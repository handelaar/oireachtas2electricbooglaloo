    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House.  I again ask the Minister if it is the policy of his Department to reduce the number of labourers employed in the forests this year with effect from 1st April?  Has the policy of laying off a number of people who have been employed for some time anything to do with the increased wages granted last year and this year?  Is an effort being made to save the money paid to these people by paying their comrades out of the money they would have got if they had been retained?  Is this the Kilkenny cat act where they are being fed with their own tails?  It appears to me that this is the reason why, when employment is dropping throughout the country, a policy decision has been taken by the Department to lay men off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a number of letters from men employed in the Forestry Division.  One letter states that two men, employed for 20 years and laid off a couple of years ago and re-employed again last year, have now been told they must go.  Have the Forestry Division gone to the trouble of doing what the local authorities did when they found themselves in a similar position at the end of last year and approached men who are near retiring age and asked them if they would be prepared to go and allow younger workers to remain on?  I am not suggesting for one moment that men would be told they would have to go but if it was explained to the men that they would qualify for a small pension, <Col N="1147" /> their retirement pension from the Department of Social Welfare and, in addition, a gratuity, I think many of the older men would be glad of the opportunity.  This would allow the younger men badly in need of an income to remain employed.</P>
    <P>Because the location of the work is in the heart of the country there is no alternative employment for the men. Most men who are laid off go on to the labour exchange and in many cases cost the State almost as much as it would cost if they were retained in full employment or emigrated.  Every effort should be made to try to prevent this. Has it been suggested that certain contractors should be employed to replace workers who were directly employed by the Forestry Division?</P>
    <P>I do not want to give the House or the Minister the impression that I am attacking the officials of the Forestry Division.  I do believe a policy decision is tied up here somewhere and I want to get to the bottom of it.  If a policy decision has been taken let us hear who took that decision and why it was taken.  A few years ago it was a question of meeting Government officials representing any of the lower grades, discussing wages and conditions with them and their decision was final. There was no appeal from a decision given by them.  There is an appeal now and I have found the officials in the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands&mdash;I do not want to include the Land Commission side&mdash;at all times courteous and prepared to discuss matters in a reasonable way.  However, I am not satisfied that we are getting the major issues discussed and I should like to know if there is a policy decision on this.  I cannot see why they should not be discussed in the same way as minor issues.</P>
    <P>I mentioned conservation last night. The Forestry Division can help considerably in this.  I travel a great deal around the country and all over the place one comes across piles of rubbish deposited on the side of the road. Could the Minister try to make available the numerous quarries and big holes which are to be found in many forests?  These could be used for dumping <Col N="1148" /> refuse.  The reason for dumping on the roadside is that a convenient dump is not available.  Careless people do not give a damn about anybody and they just pull up and dump out their rubbish on the side of the road as far away as possible from their own homes.  There are people who, if there were a dump available, would use the dump.  I hate to see the countryside despoiled because no effort is made by certain people to find a convenient place to dump their rubbish.  Indeed, some local authorities have been looking for sites for dumps.  The local authority of which I am a member are very conscious of the need for such dumps because they believe every effort should be made to preserve the countryside.  It is quite a common practice for people returning from marketing in Dublin to dump refuse 20 or 30 miles out from the city.  This has to be cleared away and people have to be paid for clearing it.  Publicans and hoteliers put piles of broken bottles on the roadside.  This does not improve the appearance of the countryside. The Minister is involved in conservation and I think he could help to put an end to this unseemly practice.</P>
    <P>With regard to the pollution of streams, this is a big problem.  I saw a programme on a British station recently.  Those who took part in it were, perhaps, a little hysterical; they talked about a doomsday watch.  Certain scientists believe we have gone beyond the point of no return and have polluted not alone the atmosphere but the soil and the waters as well and, in a short time, human beings will not be able to live on this planet.  They agreed that something must be done because we are fast reaching the point at which it will be impossible to reverse the position.  I do not think it has been brought home to people that this situation is building up.  While I do not suggest we should become hysterical about it, I think more notice should be taken of the position and a bigger effort should be made at school level to bring about some control; people do not realise the effect a properly delivered lecture can have on school-children, their parents and everybody else.  The Labour Party had evidence of that at the last general election.  The <Col N="1149" /> Minister might take an interest in this approach.  It would not be fair to pile all the responsibility on to him, but a start must be made by somebody. The tidy towns competition has helped in urban areas but in the countryside far too many beauty spots are becoming despoiled because people use them as dumping grounds.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister once again to make every effort to straighten out the employment problem because, while his Department may save a few pounds by laying off labourers this year, eventually the State will have to pay as much either directly through social welfare or indirectly through supplementary benefits from the local authorities.  This matter has not been dealt with in the way it should be.  I have raised it on a number of occasions because of what happened in the Board of Works who carry on in the same way; they lay off 150 or 200 men who inevitably go on social welfare and have to be paid almost as much for doing no work at all.  This is a ridiculous situation and I ask the Minister to give his special attention to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Tully in the tributes he has paid to the Forestry Division.  I have always found the staff very courteous and very willing to help in every way possible both here in head office and throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very considerable progress has been made in afforestation and the results are very pleasing indeed.  Successive Ministers have shown a great interest in afforestation and have done their best in their respective terms of office.  In the early years it was quite difficult to sell the idea of giving up land for afforestation.  In those days a colleague of mine, Deputy Cafferky, was very interested in afforestation.  He has now gone to his eternal reward.  If anyone reads the contributions he made in this House on the subject they will see how strong an advocate he was of afforestation.  I backed him, I am happy to say, to the best of my ability. It was not easy because some people did not appreciate what it was all about.  The idea was cattle, sheep and <Col N="1150" /> what-have-you.  It took time to bring people around to the idea of surrendering land for afforestation or, indeed, for any other purpose.  The fear was that they would give away something that had been hard won.  However, despite all the obstacles, a great deal of progress has been made and I am sure the Minister is as enthusiastic as any of his predecessors in having more land planted.  I am sure it is no pleasure to him to have to tell the House, as he did yesterday, that the new planting programme of 22,500 acres this year imposes a severe strain on our reserve of land.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>There are, however, indications of a continuing upward trend in land acquisition, and I am hopeful that over the next few years real progress will be made towards alleviating the difficulties of our land reserve position.</P>
    <P>I hope he will not be disappointed and that we will have sufficient people offering land to keep the programme going.  I am sure it is a matter of regret to him, as it is to me, that in the present year we will not be able to reach the set target.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons for this drop in the acreage planted and one of them is that the Department find, when they go to buy land, that their hands are tied because of the niggardly price they are paying.  A sum of £7 or £10 an acre is no longer an attraction to a smallholder to give up ten, 50, or 100 acres, or whatever he has.  As we all know, the price of sheep and cattle has increased and some of this land can be used for winter grazing particularly during periods when there are snowfalls because often it provides shelter and water and naturally the people feel that if they sell the land to the Forestry Division they are getting a bad deal at their present prices. If the Minister wants to get additional suitable land for planting he will have to step up the price very considerably.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that many areas in which suitable land would be available for forestry can be high amenity areas from the scenic point of view in tourist regions.  At present we have foreign speculators and, indeed, <Col N="1151" /> some of our own people returning to this country, who like to settle in places adjoining mountains, rivers and lakes and they are prepared to offer all sorts of prices for land, perhaps £200 or £500 an acre.  To some extent these people are competing against the Department.  Some of these people buy up perhaps 100 acres of this poor quality land and then start re-selling plots in order to recoup some of their outlay.  They may sell sites for five, ten or 15 houses and make it a good business transaction.  This has been particularly noticeable in the Pontoon region in recent times.  As one goes from Pontoon to Knockmore and on to Ballina one sees that a number of new bungalows have been built in the area. It started off with somebody buying a smallholding and then people proceeded to buy more and more land there which normally would have been offered to the Forestry Division.  The people who sold the land in the first instance got a substantially higher price than the Forestry Division could afford to pay.  Word gets around very quickly that land in the area is worth £100 or perhaps £300 an acre and this makes it impossible for the Forestry Division to buy land there despite the fact that they were there before anyone else.  The Minister knows that all around this area that I am talking about there are small pockets of forestry and these are the areas in which the speculators are inclined to move in.  I am sure that in earlier times the Forestry Division felt that if they moved in there everything in the garden would be rosy, that they would be able to expand, but they ran into difficulties, which I can see, even at local level.  Apart from these deals which one finds around Pontoon, Lough Conn and Lough Cullen, there is also the fact that there are people with a surplus of cash which they earned abroad and they are not worried if they have to pay an extra £10 or £15 an acre for suitable property.  The Department have to compete with such people and this does not help things.  It is not surprising, therefore, that the Minister has to come in and tell us that the area to be planted this year is only 22,500 acres.  If the Minister is to achieve what he wants to achieve, more <Col N="1152" /> employment in the Forestry Division and a greater acreage planted, he will have to be more generous with the money.</P>
    <P>A former Minister, the late Mr. Blowick, during his term of office, brought in a Canadian expert, a Mr. Cameron, to advise him about the whole approach to forestry.  My recollection is that one of his recommendations was that we should have two different approaches to the problem. Indeed, let me say here that I do not think any Minister for Lands ever followed Mr. Cameron's blueprint which seems to have been shelved. Nothing has been done about what he described as a social scheme of forestry and which he advocated.</P>
    <P>The commercial scheme is proceeding quite well but alongside that there should be a social scheme something on the lines suggested by Deputy Tully a while ago.  He said that instead of paying unemployment benefit to people who would be very anxious to work if they could get employment, forestry programmes could be initiated where the economics would not be gone into too carefully; in other words, there would not be too much worry whether the scheme paid or not.  Men would be put to work and would be receiving a good week's wages for it and denuded mountainsides would be planted.  If the scheme was not commercially viable in the initial stages that would correct itself in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Government employing experts to make recommendations in respect of forestry unless there is some benefit to be derived from their reports.  As far as I can see the recommendations made by Mr. Cameron some years ago have been ignored.  I would suggest that at least some of the recommendations of his report should be implemented.  The question of forestry has never been made a political football and it is far from my intention to do anything like that.  I realise the many difficulties which face the Minister and his staff in acquiring land but there are tracts of land even in my own neighbourhood which would be suitable for planting and would provide employment for the <Col N="1153" /> locals, as Mr. Cameron recommended in his report.  Such schemes would also have the added advantage of beautifying the countryside.</P>
    <P>As other Deputies have said, the conditions for growing timber in this country are very favourable.  There is a rapid growth of timber, one of the most rapid in the world, due to early rainfall, soil and other factors.  We should do our best to expand the acreage and I hope the Minister will not have to come into the House next year and say he regrets the target set has not been reached, as has been the case on this occasion.</P>
    <P>There does not seem to be very much progress in regard to private planting.  With goodwill one would think that the amount of private planting could be increased.  We saw examples of such co-operation during the Emergency and at many other times in the history of this country. There are particular regions where planting could be undertaken.  There are men who are skilled in this work, who have a great deal of knowledge of it as a result of having worked with the Forestry Division.  If these people could be encouraged to do private planting to the extent of three, four or five acres it would be a worthwhile contribution.  An approach should be made to primary, secondary and vocational schools in order to stimulate interest in forestry.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that whatever steps are taken, no worthwhile progress will be made unless the grant available is attractive.  Our young people are as patriotic today as they were in other generations.  They have taken pride in participating in schemes which have benefited the economy, for instance, pig raising and calf raising schemes.  I would urge the Minister to increase the grant available for forestry planting.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the amount of commonage that has been acquired under the Bill introduced in this House some years ago by the late Mr. Blowick.  The question of title in this connection has always been a difficulty. I see no reason why the Minister should not bring in amending legislation to improve the situation.  There is <Col N="1154" /> such provision in other spheres and in connection with other Departments and I would ask the Minister to have another look at the question of commonage. In some cases there may be ten, 15 or even 100 tenants interested and there may be something like 1,000 acres suitable for forestry.  It is necessary that more attractive terms be offered for such commonage.  Also required are the co-operation and the goodwill of those concerned at local level in the commonage areas.</P>
    <P>In this context perhaps churchmen, local school teachers and Muintir na Tíre could get together in an effort to encourage these people to give up their lands so that employment would be provided locally for, perhaps, one member of the family.  This is very desirable in areas such as that represented by the Minister and me.  It is a cause for regret that in recent times fewer people are finding employment. If the Minister would act on some of my suggestions, perhaps they would help in some small measure to improve the position.  I know that the Minister is anxious to do everything in his power in this matter.  Finally, I thank his officials for the courtesy that they have extended to me on any occasion on which I approached them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donovan has agreed to give way to me so that I might make one point which I intended making in relation to the acquisition of land.  I refer to the purchase of land in the Berehaven Peninsula.  There are 539 acres of land there for sale but there is too much tinkering in relation to the acquisition of the land.  This tinkering has extended over far too long a period but possibly the Minister is not aware of what is happening. Therefore, I decided to avail of this opportunity to acquaint him with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us here are interested in seeing that land is acquired for afforestation. Of course we are anxious, too, that the land be acquired at its market value. In south west Cork we have been trying for some time to have lands taken over in the Berehaven Peninsula so as to provide employment in that area&mdash; an area where there is a grave lack of <Col N="1155" /> employment.  Adjacent to the town of Castletownbere there are 539 acres of land and let me say at this stage that if I were the owner I would be tempted to dispose of some of this land for building sites because some of it is suitable for this purpose.  Building sites there could fetch as much £1,000 each. However, this land is on offer to the Forestry Division for the reasonable figure of £5,000.  I agree that only 415 acres are suitable for planting and that, in so far as the Department are concerned, about 100 acres would not be of any use to them.  The position is that the Land Commission have refused to increase their offer of £4,000 for the land.  They seem to be under the impression that the land will eventually be sold for that amount of money.  I do not like that attitude.  I have made private representations in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>It is part of my business to value land so that I can say I have a reasonably good idea of land valuation&mdash;as good as has any official in the Department of Lands but that is no reflection on them.  I am satisfied that this land could have been acquired by the Forestry Division long ago and I am asking the Minister to take a personal interest now in the matter.  It has been long enough in the hands of the employees of the Department.  I can assure the Minister that this land is well worth the £5,000 that is being asked for it by the two owners.  Why, then, must there be this-itinerant-at-the-fair attitude of long ago when itinerants would come to buy horses and slap one's hand and ask one to divide and so on?  I understand from the Forestry Division that they want land in Castletownbere and, if this is so, the land is there for them.  They should not be trying to bulldoze the owners into giving it at a price that is less than its value.</P>
    <P>I might say at this stage that the owners are anxious to sell the land to the Forestry Division in preference to letting it go to other buyers because they are well aware that the local development association are anxious that the land be acquired by the <Col N="1156" /> Forestry Division so that employment would be provided in the area.  I wonder whether I have said enough on this matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>On looking through the Minister's speech and having listened to other Deputies making certain points here regarding our forestry programme, I want to say at the outset that, while we may differ on the details with regard to the prospects of forestry development, I do not think there is any great difference of opinion in the House on the question of its general development. One could submit that forestry is a sound investment if one referred for a moment to subhead C.2, Forestry Development and Management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year I took a walk through a local forest known as Newcastle, near the town of Ballymahon.  It is an education to walk through a forest even if one has not a guide.  I must say that the forester in charge on that occasion took the opportunity to give us full information about forestry in general. I often wonder would it be possible at this stage of the development of our <Col N="1157" /> forestry amenities, and forestry as a business, to have a new programme mounted to bring home to everyone in the country the vital necessity of pressing ahead with forestry development, planting, and the husbandry that follows. I saw a number of Sitka spruce which were planted in 1935 and the trees are now 100 feet high.</P>
    <P>I was gratified and a bit surprised to note that we can grow this type of timber more successfully than the Swedes.  While, on the one hand, our climate may be said to be more humid, on the other hand it promotes faster growth of timber.  Sweden is famous for timber and in Sweden the winter is longer and harder.  The result is that the growth is not as fast but the fibre of the timber is a bit harder.  This is the only difference which we have to make up.  I wonder is it a difference.  I think we should be able to make it up in these days of scientific activity. Much of our timber is converted and used at home in the construction industry.  To my mind not half enough of our own timber is being utilised in this fashion at the moment.</P>
    <P>Here I should like to make a point. Perhaps those of us who are amateurs sometimes make the wrong points, but they are made in good faith.  There should be a more businesslike approach to the production and handling and sale of timber in general.  I would ask the Minister to consider making available to enterprising saw millers who invest heavily in machinery and plant for the development and conversion of timber as much help and advice and information as can be extended to them by the Forestry Section.  I am quite sure that is being done at the moment.  We have to have regard to the amount of money which is voted by this House for forestry development but a better public relations programme could be mounted.</P>
    <P>At this point in time forestry has all the advantages.  Having regard to our resources in land and labour, we could go so far as to suggest that a system of forestry bonds should be established for investment in forestry. The man who invested in one acre of young forest trees 35 years ago&mdash;and <Col N="1158" /> that might only be a marginal acre of land&mdash;would now have a return of £1,000.  This would not take into account the thinnings and the fall of the forest in the meantime.  It has often been said that investment in natural resources is the best investment.  We all agree with that.  I disagree slightly with Deputy O'Hara on the method of getting across to the people the necessity for planting trees even as a shelter belt.  I referred to this before and I am referring to it now in the general context of planting only.</P>
    <P>At the moment we know the various schemes we have under the local committees of agriculture and we know that they are not being taken up to advantage.  I often think that a forester or two should be made available on a regional basis, if not on a county basis, to promote this type of development. If we look at the programme in Scotland we will see that Scotsmen do this. There used to be a slogan in Scotland, &ldquo;Plant a tree, Jock; it will grow while you are sleeping.&rdquo; In the early days the Scots used to plant an acre of trees as a marriage dowry for their children.</P>
    <P>There are a number of ways in which we could help the extension of the forestry programme.  At the outset I said that (1), it was a sound investment; (2), there was labour content in the programme; (3), it helped the construction industry, which is a very important point; (4), forests serve as flood conductors; (5) they beautify the countryside, and last but not least the trees provide shelter.  A better public relations programme for the Forestry Division should be mounted so as to bring home to all our people the necessity for an extended planting programme.</P>
    <P>Last year was European Conesrvation Year and while the Minister had a very tight budget to work on he did some very good work.  He got his Department into the news very effectively and he got across to the people that last year was Conservation Year. Deputy Tully and others have mentioned dumps.  It is not the function of the Forestry Division to provide means for the disposal of rubbish; it is the responsibility of the local authorities.  I <Col N="1159" /> have spoken about this on numerous occasions at county council meetings. We should have a stricter system of inspection in this regard.  I agree with Deputy Tully that it is too bad that we should spend thousands of pounds trying to beautify certain places and at the same time allow indiscriminate dumping to go on.  I am a member of a local authority and I believe local authorities in general are not doing enough to curb this vandalism, because that is what it is.  No matter what the Minister or his Department may do to enhance the countryside, if dumping is allowed to continue then we are wasting our time and our money.</P>
    <P>I realise the Forestry Division do not have much control over the rising trend in costs and salaries and wages. It would be a pity if this upward trend resulted in a decrease in the labour force employed.  It is a stark fact that when costs go up managers look around to see in what way they can avoid those costs in order to stay in business.  Nearly always the result is increased mechanisation.  This is a good thing in one way but it would be too bad if increased wages and salaries resulted in men having to be retired. The men employed in the Forestry Division are usually employed over a long period.  During that time they gain knowledge and experience and indeed a love of their job.  It would be a pity if the Forestry Division had to lay off any of the labour employed as a result of increasing costs brought about by increases in wages and salaries.  A programme should be mounted in order to get forestry as a business into the minds of the people.  The best technical and scientific advice should be made available to those prepared to invest in machinery for the conversion of the end product.</P>

      <P>The Minister has one of the finest working groups in the country.  They are interested in their work, they do a good job and they are well paid for it.  I remember some years ago that public representatives were disappointed when local men could not be employed on the job, because the Forestry Division insisted on bringing men ten, 12 or 14 miles to do <Col N="1160" /> the work.  We now appreciate why they insisted on doing this.  All over the country there are groups of skilled men who are well paid for doing a good job.  The days of slavery are gone.  It is very encouraging to meet men dedicated to their work and to know that they are being paid £20 for a five-day week.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Hara spoke about commonage land being taken over.  I come from County Leitrim and as I farm there I know the type of land there. I can imagine the headaches the Department's officials get when the taking over of commonage is being considered. Some shareholders will be satisfied to dispose of land because it is by no means satisfactory, whereas others who are doing really well on the commonage, will not be.  This is where the problems arise and the Department finds itself in trouble.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister and his inspectors around the country come up against many problems.  One problem I meet is that very often people may not be on the best terms with their neighbours and, because they are not, they will offer their bit of land to the Forestry Division.  Those on small holdings cannot carry on unless they get a few extra acres and quite often they discover that an excellent meadow right beside their door has been taken over by the Forestry Division and that is an end of it. Ultimately the trees grow right up to their door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago we received a circular in Leitrim which advised that, if genuine reasons were advanced to show why land should not be planted, the Forestry Division would consider the case made.  In one instance the Forestry Division bought a strip of land between two portions of land held by a local farmer.  A case was made to the Forestry Division but it fell on deaf ears.  The Forestry Division did not do what we recommended.  The policy should be to keep people on the land instead of replacing them by trees. We have had cases in which land beside a local farmer who could do with a few extra acres was planted with trees.  Those few extra acres would have given him a viable holding. <Col N="1161" /> Generally speaking, the Forestry Division does not change its mind, irrespective of what case is made.</P>
    <P>The Government talk about saving the West.  The one thing that will save the West is giving farmers a few extra acres.  By doing that the farmer will be removed from the labour exchange. There are thousands of acres high up eminently suitable for afforestation and it is on that land the Forestry Division should concentrate.  There is an even greater love for the land to-day than there was perhaps ten years ago.  Every time a genuine case is made against planting land I appeal to the Minister to give heed to that case.  I can imagine the Minister arguing that my proposition would mean the Forestry Division getting only bad land.  That might happen, I agree, but I still think it is better to improve holdings rather than plant acres of good land with trees.</P>
    <P>With regard to the price of land, too much time is spent by inspectors going around again and again and making promises.  In the interval the price of land goes up but the Forestry Division sticks to its first bid.  The price is too low.  The maximum is £40 and the general average is £8, £10, £12 or £14 an acre in my area.  That must be changed.  After a careful survey of the land a fair price should be offered instead of having the kind of delays that occur at the moment.  I prefer to see land planted with people, not with trees.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of forestry work in both Leitrim and Sligo. Vermin are increasing in these forests. Funds should be made available to local committees of agriculture to enable them to exterminate these vermin.</P>
    <P>Not enough encouragement is given to farmers to embark on planting on their own land.  There was a good deal of publicity given to this some years ago but lately there has been no publicity at all.  A regional forester should be appointed to a few counties who could advise farmers and encourage them to plant trees.  Pieces of land may be of no real value to farmers because they are impossible to till or too heavy and these could be used for planting trees.  Apart from being an economic <Col N="1162" /> proposition ultimately for the farmer, they would also provide very desirable shelter.  I have no doubt that if this matter were discussed with the local farmers he would get an occasional farmer to take on the job.</P>
    <P>In regard to the provision of shelter belts the matter seems to have been left there and is taken for granted and it only comes before the committee of agriculture once a year.  Much more emphasis should be placed on the matter. Many beautiful shelter belts have been put around houses which otherwise would be wind-swept in stormy weather.  The people were strongly advised to erect these shelters and agricultural instructors called to see how the shelter belts were coming along but today the Department no longer follow up this important aspect.  The Minister should take note of this matter and have it pursued for a number of years. He should appoint a regional forester or inspector to cover several counties and this should be his sole job.  The agricultural instructors are very busy at present and they would not have the time to do this work.</P>
    <P>Forestry today is a very sound and successful undertaking and enormous quantities of wood have been taken from the plantations and used to great advantage.  Frequently we see large lorries transporting poles to various centres in which they are needed.  Only a few years ago some of those trees were of little value but today, because of the dressings they can receive, they mature well and when they are sold they are guaranteed for up to 50 years. In many mountainous areas thousands of acres have been planted under forests.  Those mountains were never meant for anything but trees.  When people lived on them they were only eking out a bare existence and they were anxious to come down to the lower lands to get holdings which they could improve for their own sakes and for the sakes of their sons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words about the reason why we have to spend so much money on forestry.  I am not going to delay the Minister, who is a very patient man.  I am grateful to him for supplying us <Col N="1163" /> with a report on the Forestry Division for 1969-70.  I am afraid I have lost my copy of the Buchanan Report and I am sorry that Deputy O'Hara is not here because I might be able to borrow his copy and have another look at it. However, it gives rise to a certain amount of folklore.  There is a Chinese saying that if you are planning for one year plant wheat, if you are planning for 100 years plant trees and if you are planning for 1,000 years plant men.  I do not know about the final one but there is no doubt that if you are planning for 100 years you should plant trees.  The Minister and I are in agreement that the most valuable work being done in his Department is in the Forestry Division.  I am not reflecting on other parts of the Department; it is just the nature of the work that is unfortunate.  It is regrettable that in the early days of the State the position financially was such that very little money, relatively speaking, was spent on afforestation.  Some members of the first Government did attempt to get something done but the technical officers in charge were Scots who, while excellent men, technically had not much interest in the country in a national sense.  Even during the first Fianna Fáil Government the area planted was only about 800 acres a year.  I am somewhat disappointed that the receipts have not been better and my reason for saying that is that we must now have a fair amount of mature forest.  I agree with Deputy Carter that an acre of mature trees is worth about £1,000.  However, I will return to that in detail later.  The Minister referred, as did the report, to the difficulties in acquiring land.  Of course it is easy to solve difficulties, as many people do to-day, by spending more money, but that is not a solution either because I am afraid there are too many people competing for the spending of more money under the aegis of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The competition between forestry and sheep is well known.  It is a question of the comparative prices for mutton and beef which really determines whether this becomes hot or not.  The Minister and the Department have been doing fairly well in recent years in regard to the quantity of land <Col N="1164" /> in reserve.  They have stepped up the purchase of land.  I am interested in a technical point about which I know nothing.  About ten years ago it seemed that Contorta Pine was taking over from Sitka Spruce and in the early years there seemed to be a lot of planting of Norway Spruce.  I do not mind admitting that I would not know the difference between Sitka Spruce and a Norway Spruce but I know from the figures that Norway Spruce seems to be out and that Sitka Spruce seems to be coming back.  I understood the important point was that pine matured much more rapidly.  For instance, the men who breed horses breed two-year olds, on the whole, and the same principle could be applied in the case of trees.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly forestry is of great value in a country like this.  A very sizeable amount of it is done in winter and it seems to me that the forestry workers are very happy men, particularly the foresters.  This is notable in Germany.  I take it the ordinary worker in forestry now, with an increase of £4 a week in the last 15 months, must be happier than he was.  Certainly in the past forestry workers were poorly paid.  They were linked with agricultural workers.  I am rather surprised that the State enterprise which was projected as far away as 15 years ago, a paper pulp factory, has not been established.  I know the present Government's love of private enterprise and their desire to make things easy for people to make profits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's point but there is a great difficulty in this.  There is a monopoly of buyers.  There are three or four main buyers.  The Waterford factory is referred to here; there is the one at Athy and the one at Scariff, County Clare. These are really the main purchasers, and there is the paper factory here in Dublin.  These are a small group, and this presents a grave difficulty.  When the second inter-Party Government was in office a committee was established to consider how this would be approached.  The Government seem to <Col N="1165" /> have dropped, as if it were a hot potato, the idea of a major paper pulp industry essentially to produce newsprint. Our imports of newsprint last year were £3 million.  Of course, the primary objective of the enterprise would be to obliterate that importation just as forestry has, I am glad to say, obliterated, unfortunately belatedly, the importation of the standards for rural electrification.  I see a reference in the report to the standards for ordinary telephone wires.  It was unfortunate that we had to import enormous quantities of spars from Finland for rural electrification in the middle fifties when rural electrification was going ahead like a house on fire and when the major part of it was done.  I still cannot understand why the Government have dropped this idea of setting up this major State enterprise.  It could have been done very cheaply some years ago.  I suppose it would be much more expensive now.  It would still give a better return to the country than some of the other enterprises that are being financed by the State.</P>
      <P>My difficulty here is that, contrary to opinion among businessmen like Deputy Belton, civil servants and semi-State work people are very good managers but they are not very good at bargaining.  When they come up against the businessmen they have no chance when it comes to buying and selling.  The businessman can put them over a barrel.  The fact is that for many long years in this country any threat from private enterprise&mdash;not employing 100 or 200 or 300 people, but employing even 30 or 40 people&mdash;to close down because they are being hardpressed by a State company has caused a flurry and a scurry among the politicians.  Then the pressure comes on the State servants: &ldquo;You really must give way on this. The State has a broad back and really can afford to carry it.&rdquo; Therefore, I am genuinely sorry that this semi-State enterprise was not established, as it should have been established in the early fifties, to produce paper pulp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Deputies who say it is unfortunate that there has not been more development of private forestry. It seems to be difficult to get people <Col N="1166" /> to engage in this.  I think the grants are fairly reasonable and relatively small areas could qualify.  The Minister and his Department are in no way to blame for the situation in relation to private planting.  I want to engage in something that does not seem to be done at all in this House and seems to be frowned on, that is, an analysis of the Estimate.  Comparing 1967-68 with 1970-71 I notice that the increase in forest development and management, which is the productive end of this work in the ordinary sense that a businessman understands it, is only up one-third, from £3.2 million in 1967-68 to £4.3 million, including the Supplementary Estimate, an increase of £1.1 million or about one-third.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the cost of administration is up from £1 million in 1967-68, which included £170,000 for travelling expenses, to £1,650,000 now, which is a 65 per cent increase.  I hope it will not be held against me if I am inclined to say that that is not as it should be.  I do grant that the salaries, wages and so on include what I regard as the key men in the service, the foresters, but I do not think they are responsible for the increase.  I notice that travelling expenses went up from £170,000 in 1967-68 to £270,000, the sum in the original Estimate this year, that is to say, an increase of 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>In this connection it is no harm to become a macro-economist for a moment since we are held to be so silent by Mr. Hugh Munro.  I noticed in the report of the Forestry Division that among the more important meetings attended were two on which I might comment.  I do not propose to criticise the bulk of these meetings. One of the two was a seminar study tour of the USA.  I do not think anyone would learn much about forestry by making a seminar tour of that country. However, what interested me even more is No. 8 on the list&mdash;British Association for the Advancement of Science at Exeter&mdash;this body is known among academics as the &ldquo;British Ass&rdquo;. I cannot imagine what value forestry people could acquire from a trip to that establishment.  That, therefore, is a macro-economic comment on the increase in travelling expenses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1167" /> I want to ask the Minister one technical question.  It is a matter that is of interest to me because I did some work on it a long time ago: what rate of interest was eventually put into the Forestry commercial accounts? Naturally, the Department, at the time, wanted to put in a rate of about 2 per cent.  The money was being borrowed at 3 per cent and the Department of Finance wanted 4 per cent put in.  I take it that commercial accounts were set up for each separate forest and I would like to know whether a standard rate of interest was introduced and if so, if it has been constantly applied during the years.  I presume it would be a rate of the order of 4 per cent or so.  I have no wish to be taken as criticising that although it does add to the present cost.  Only this morning we read in the newspapers the notification that the Department of Finance, through the Board of Works, are to charge the local authorities 9½ per cent so that the rate to borrowers will be about 10 per cent.  I am not advocating that anything like that should be applied to forestry but I would like the Minister to tell me what is the rate in the forestry commercial account.  We are told in the Minister's brief that Deputies will rejoice to learn that the magic million has been reached.  All I can say is that this is not good enough.  I appreciate the difficulties but we must remember that even 800 acres a year should result in a return of about £800,000.  In most of our forests, the second thinning must long since have been carried out.  This is the thinning which is done after 20 or 22 years and which must yield a substantial amount.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the relatively small increase in the cost of forest management is not causing a decay in the rate at which extraction is being carried on.  A relatively unsuccessful politician, Mr. Seán MacBride, was responsible for setting the target at 20,000 to 25,000 a year.  It was he who wrote the figure into the long-term programme without having any authority to do so from the then Government and although the succeeding Fianna Fáil Government tried for a while to reduce that, the <Col N="1168" /> pressures were too great and it has since been achieved.</P>
    <P>In his report the Minister regretted that the Division were not able to achieve the target of 25,000 acres last year but informed us that the amount was 22,000 acres.  That amount represents almost 80 per cent of the target and it is a good achievement.  If each of us could achieve 80 per cent of what he set out to do, he would be doing all right.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister would say if it might be possible that, again, the thinnings are not being carried out adequately. There were complaints from the public to this effect in the past and also to the effect that the timber was not being developed in the way it should be developed.  I am referring to that period in the late fifties when there were considerable complaints from the public in this connection.  Since there has been an increase of only 30 per cent in expenditure on the actual work on forestry development, I wonder if there could be some decay in standards as compared with three or four years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The constituency I represent, Dublin North-East, is one where there is little land for afforestation but, in fact, it might have the highest percentage in that about ten acres out of a total of 50 acres of arable land are devoted to afforestation. Afforestation has continued here but there has been no new thinking in regard to it.  If a person is investing money, he will find out what the percentage return is or what is the capital growth.  One might accept a small percentage because of the rate of capital growth or else he will require a reasonable percentage if there is a negligible capital growth.  In relation to Government loans, one will not get capital growth but will get a return by way of speculation on the Stock Exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one individual engaged in afforestation in County Leitrim by way of private enterprise.  When he was going into this business he was told that it was not possible to grow trees in Leitrim but, perhaps, with the aid of modern technology, he has proved that trees can be grown there.  It is <Col N="1169" /> my opinion that it is only by private enterprise that we will succeed in planting trees from Kerry to Donegal to the extent we would wish to plant them.  However, private enterprise will not become involved if there is not a fair return for the money invested.  In so far as tree planting and growing are concerned, there is no return for a long time, perhaps not during the lifetime of the investor.</P>
    <P>In planting trees in the west of Ireland or in any other area the Government would need to have a plan such as they would have in, say, the building of houses in Dublin.  They would know which areas would be for housing, which would be for factories and so on.  There should be a complete plan of the areas that could be planted. As I said, there is absolutely nothing to entice a wealthy man from anywhere in the world to go into afforestation in this country.  There should be some relief, let it be taxwise or otherwise&mdash;I think it is taxwise at the moment&mdash;for a person who invests.  I think there is such a scheme in England.</P>
    <P>This would be the job of the Minister for Finance.  If a wealthy man would invest in the West he should get relief on death duties.  I am speaking about millionaires now who take out policies for £200,000 or £300,000 to cover themselves for the five years before they die.  If this type of money could be used for planting in the West and if the Department had a proper plan whereby tourism would be allied to it&mdash;because in the future plastics may be used instead of timber; there may be some new inventions&mdash;having lakes with trees growing around them, with shooting, hunting and fishing, and monuments preserved, this could all be advertised in a proper brochure.  To do this Bord Fáilte would need to improve on what they did this year because they did not get out until February instead of last November a brochure setting out the hotel rates.</P>
    <P>I believe we must get private enterprise into afforestation.  I know that many of the State companies are service companies, and I am not criticising them because they lose money, but we must get private enterprise investment <Col N="1170" /> as well as Government investment. Some incentive should be given to private enterprise to go into afforestation. With this investment and with proper planning the country would eventually benefit from the sale of trees and from the factories which would use the timber for building or use the by-products like wood pulp or pit props or anything else.  We would also gain from tourism.  At the moment, no matter what the cost is people fly over from the Continent to avail of these amenities and the number of those people is increasing.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient for the Minister for Finance to say that he will give certain concessions in relation to death duties, or income tax, or by way of grant.  This must be advertised in a businesslike manner.  People whom the Government think might be interested should be notified and given all the details.  You must go out and sell nowadays.  You cannot sit back and say that we have passed a law in Dáil Éireann which will help people and not advertise it.</P>
    <P>If private enterprise were involved in afforestation it would cut out a lot of departmental work.  There is the trouble of buying the land and you have to go through the Civil Service to get the money.  It would be a clean-cut operation for a businessman.  It would also show whether the Department are doing the job economically. Deputy O'Donovan said that businessmen can do a better deal than civil servants.  I do not know exactly how he said it.</P>

He can spend two or three days on it with unlimited expenses and get a better deal.  It would be hard for a civil servant to make a case to his Minister that he spent so much money to buy land.  Therefore the businessman has a better set-up to do a better deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> I should like to come now to conservation. We have pollution in Dublin now.  This is not necessarily an Irish problem.  It is a worldwide problem but we have pollution in Dublin in a big way.  I presume that much Irish water is polluted from other parts of Europe.  At the moment in Dublin many rivers have been culverted and once they are culverted that is the end of it.  There is no real law to stop factories from putting their effluent into these rivers.  I know of one small river which had water running in it for eight months of the year and for four months it was dry, but an ice cream factory came in and poured stuff into it.  Nobody could trace it for quite some time but the stench from that river was dreadful.  It is now culverted and nobody knows whether the ice cream factory are still putting effluent into it.  I know it is costly for firms to arrange for the effluent to come out as clear water.  A group of inspectors should be sent out to find where factories are unloading waste matter from their premises.</P>
    <P>There is a group agitating in regard to the pollution of Dublin Bay, which the Minister knows very well since he lives in the area.  I am sure he has been asked to many functions.  This group have got a great case.  I was at a meeting as a guest and they told me that a Minister&mdash;they did not say which Minister&mdash;would definitely make sure that there would be no extra pollution in Dublin.  The same day land was given for houses that were not on the original plan.  In other words, Dublin extended.  The result is that 2,000 or 3,000 more houses will be using the same sewerage service.  Here we had one Minister saying one thing and another Minister doing another.  I know the Minister for Lands is interested in conservation and surely he can do something within the Cabinet to get the Minister for Local Government to pay attention to this.</P>
    <P>Czechoslovakia is a landlocked country with sewage disposal units which are completely covered in, with the latest equipment supplied by an English firm, I think.  I know that the English company in question does this <Col N="1172" /> work for all the South American countries. They are experts at this.  A proper sewerage treatment scheme is essential in Dublin.  At present the sewerage is pumped into the sea but with the land reclamation going on around Dublin Bay, it has been found that the sewerage is not being pumped out far enough.  In fact one is lucky if one can swim on one day in the week around the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Conservation is not a big problem in Ireland at the moment but throughout the world it has become a huge problem. Unless we start to tackle the problem now we shall never be able to do anything about it.  Jacques Cousteau has said that 6 per cent of the American budget needs to be spent on pollution if pollution is to be kept at its present level.  They have made some improvements at Lake Erie, but effluent from the North American Continent flows down to the Gulf of Mexico.</P>
    <P>If we are to prevent pollution of our rivers and of the air we must set about doing it now because if we wait even ten years the cost will be much greater. Everyone remembers the London smogs of the fifties.  People died because of the smog.  London would have smogs for at least one month of the year.  Apparently it was caused by the prevailing winds.  If the wind is coming from the Balbriggan direction Dublin will be foggy whereas if there is a south wind there will be no fog.</P>
    <P>London has been made a smokeless zone and when one gets up in the morning in London the air is as clear as it is in the West of Ireland.  The problem is nothing like as bad in Dublin as it was in London but we should try to tackle it now.  I believe one of the biggest polluters of the air is CIE whose buses and trucks run on diesel.  Distinguishing markings on lorries are now compulsory and while seat belts are not yet compulsory they are being fitted to cars.  A device fitted to the exhaust of cars and lorries would help stop pollution.</P>
    <P>There is a belief that if a chimney is high enough it will not pollute the atmosphere.  If a 40-foot chimney is erected, although it might mean that the city is not polluted, the smoke will <Col N="1173" /> drop on either Dún Laoghaire or Howth depending on which way the wind is blowing.  Lip service is of no avail.  We must do something about this problem.  It is no good saying that Dublin Bay should not be polluted and then allowing the building of 600 houses, the sewerage of which will be pumped into Dublin Bay.</P>
    <P>We must do something concrete about pollution.  The Government should take the lead. They should provide for a device fitted to the exhaust of CIE trucks and buses. They should pass a law that all new cars should be fitted with the same device.  People are inclined to think that the little bit of pollution their car makes or the few broken bottles they leave behind do no harm, but this all adds up, and unless we can get across to people what has to be done, nothing will ever be done. Americans realise that they will have to spend money cleaning up their environment and we should realise it too. It is all very well for members of the Government to make speeches at Fianna Fáil functions but nothing concrete is being done.</P>
    <P>Throughout Europe there has been a move towards the preservation of monuments.  When one visits a small country like Malta and compares what is spent on preserving monuments there with what is spent here, one is ashamed. Admittedly they were probably inhabited thousands of years before us, but we are not paying enough attention to this matter.</P>
    <P>Some incentive must be given to private enterprise to invest money in reafforestation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Forestry is a very important matter and it is something that requires plenty of initiative because it provides a great deal of useful employment. The forests have to be thinned. The thinnings go all over the country, to Athy, Clondalkin, Scariff, Waterford and elsewhere.  The factories in these places provide employment with home-grown material.  After some 50 years growth the wood is suitable for building construction work.  Different types of land are acquired for afforestation and some of this land would not be suitable for any other purpose except afforestation.  I do not regard the <Col N="1174" /> money provided here as sufficient. Expenditure has not kept step with revenue.  The amount provided in 1960-61 was £2,566,700 out of a total revenue of £138,839,495.  For the year ending 31st March, 1970, the amount provided was £4,579,000 out of a total revenue of £411,012,014.  Forestry has fallen behind; the amount provided has not kept in line.  Because it is so valuable from the point of view of employment and the production of native material it deserves special attention.</P>
      <P>As I said, the type of land varies. You have, first of all, upland, good arable land.  Then you have the high bank land.  A good portion of this would be bog suitable for turbary or for Bord na Móna.  Then you have cutaway bog.  I understand the Forestry Division would be very interested in this.  Then you have moor, bog over 30 years cutaway.  Lastly, there is mountain land.</P>
      <P>With regard to the high bank, as the Minister is aware, very little turbary is being cut on this and a good deal of it in the midlands is sold to Bord na Móna which results in considerable employment for people in Offaly, Laois, Westmeath, Longford and right up to Roscommon.  I understand the Forestry Division are very interested in acquiring cutaway bog because it is very suitable for planting.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, different layers, depending on the number of years the bog has been in existence.  There are three layers, one is a type of spagnum moss peat, the next is fen peat and further down there is a pine layer.  The fen peat is ideal for horticulture. Spagnum moss is very suitable for turf production and over the years it is cut away completely and a lot of the fen peat is also cut away.  You find here that there is a clash between three groups, Bord na Móna, the horticulturists and the foresters.  However, there is sufficient land to ensure that all three are catered for and that they will have sufficient.  The point is that once fen peat is cut away it is gone for all time and this is a problem.  If it is planted for forestry purposes then it is saved for that period because it will be left there and it will be there while the trees are growing over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> A lot of this fen peat soil is ideal for horticulture and therefore I should like to see closer liaison between the three groups I have mentioned in regard to the proper utilisation of these estates.  Different Government Departments, such as Agriculture and Lands, have held meetings in different counties to work out different ideas like this but I am afraid the meetings have come to nothing and there is not the desired liaison between those concerned.  As I have said, forestry is an excellent form of employment and a lot of people are employed in this work but I should like to give some figures in this regard. One man would be able to plant and develop ten acres of forestry over five years.  When planting and development work has been done one man would be able to look after approximately 100 acres.  However, in horticulture the employment content is much greater. If there were proper liaison between the Forestry Division and horticulturists mountain land and moorish land should be used for forestry instead of fen peat.  In Offaly, in 1964, the income from horticulture was £3,000 but in 1970 it was £158,000, a vast increase. However, as I said, I would like to see the Forestry Division and horticulturists developing a proper plan for acquiring land and in regard to estates.</P>
    <P>Up to a number of years ago the price paid by the Forestry Division for land was £10 per acre but now through agreement with the Department of Finance they can pay up to £30 or £40. From figures which I have worked out I gather that the price paid per acre of land by the Department of Lands is in the region of £14 on average.  If that figure is incorrect I should like the Minister to let us know what the figure is.  I know of one estate of approximately 650 acres of mountainy land which would be suitable for nothing else but forestry and the owner is anxious to sell the land to the Forestry Division if he gets a realistic price but he is only being offered £4 to £5 an acre.  The land is not being used to its fullest capacity and on that basis he is not likely to sell. The Forestry Division should give a realistic price because it would be a tragedy if this land were not used to its <Col N="1176" /> fullest capacity.  Even if he let it for shooting rights, which he does not want to do, he would nearly get as much money.  Even the top price of £30 to £40 which the Forestry Division pay is not sufficient in modern times because £300 to £400 is quite a common price for agricultural land and the Forestry Division should come into line with present day standards.  Years ago when they were paying £10 an acre agricultural land was going for £80 to £100 but now it has gone to £300 or £400 per statute acre.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, there are vast tracts of land which would be made available to the Forestry Division if proper title could be established for the people who own them.  Many cases are held up because the legal title to the land is not in order.  This would be not alone for ordinary mountain land and moorland but for bogland. The Department of Lands and the Forestry Division must devise a scheme to accelerate the acquisition of estates suitable for forestry development. There is a different approach in the Land Commission and in the Forestry Division.  The Land Commission can compulsorily acquire an estate from somebody, move into possession and allot the land among local smallholders; whereas the Forestry Division can agree to acquire an estate but until the legal title is fully cleared up and the Forestry Division are registered as owners they do not take possession of the estate.  The Land Commission invests the money, either in Land Bonds or on deposit, and the interest is accruing to the people who later prove their title.  I would not like to see the Forestry Division making payments in Land Bonds because the bonds would reduce in value.  However, the Minister could have consultations with the Minister for Justice so that a person who could produce an affidavit that he was in undisputed possession of land for 12 years would have the money paid over to him.  This would accelerate the availability of land for forestry.  Vast amounts of land which are lying idle and of no use to anybody would be planted immediately and this would be in the interest of everybody.</P>
    <P>I have come across many cases of <Col N="1177" /> people selling land to the Forestry Division in which the amount of money they obtain for their estate is relatively small because of the quality of land, and because the Forestry Division are not getting as fair an allocation from the Government as they should be getting.  Out of this small amount of money the vendor gets for his estate he has to pay the legal fees for transferring his property to the Forestry Division.  When the Forestry Division agree to purchase an estate they should go a considerable way towards meeting the legal expenses of the vendor.  This would not involve much extra expenditure on their part.</P>
    <P>In regard to the matter of conservation, the preservation of our national parks, the prevention of pollution and so on, I believe the Forestry Division can make an important contribution in this respect by bringing home to the community the importance of the environment in which they live.  The Forestry Division can also contribute by the proper care and management of the estates they take over, by the thinning out of trees in the estates and by the planting of trees.  They can help to bring to people's attention the importance of maintaining or restoring the beauty of the scenery for which this country was always famous.</P>
    <P>In my own area there are many thousands of acres of land which were lying idle and useless and which the Forestry Division have brought into use.  There is great benefit from the fact that the Forestry Division have a training school in Kinnitty.  Thousands of acres of land which was useless is now growing millions of trees.  Added to this is the fact that it makes a most picturesque drive around the countryside. This is a living monument to the work of the Forestry Division down through the years.  They have provided excellent employment and it is important that this work be carried on.  Much work remains to be done, commercially and otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan) Sean Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of reference of this debate were fairly narrow, but the Members, perhaps inevitably, extended the scope of the debate into forestry policy <Col N="1178" /> generally.  I will do my best to deal with the principal items that were raised, beginning with the excellent contribution from Deputy Cooney whose succinct style I would recommend not only to some members of his own party but to some members of my party also.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooney was concerned particularly, as were many other Deputies, as to the reserve of land held by the Forestry Division and he, as well as other Deputies, made the point that the Forestry Division are not paying enough for land to enable them to acquire a sufficient reserve. Obviously, the two most important factors here are land and money.  I should like to make the situation clear at the outset in regard to the policy of the Forestry Division in relation to the acquisition of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that up to some years ago the average price paid for land for afforestation purpose was quite low but Members of the House will appreciate that a duty rested on the Department to use capital moneys voted by this House to the best advantage and to obtain the marginal land mostly needed for afforestation purposes, at the best available price.  However, it became obvious some years ago that the acquisition of land was slowing down.  A new system was introduced a few years ago.  Under this system each area offered is valued on the basis of a clear assessment of its potential in the particular area for timber production and the cost of developing and planting it.  This new system has already begun to show very good results. As an example of this I would mention that in the season 1968-69, the total amount of land acquired was only a little more than 14,000 acres&mdash; obviously, an insufficient amount to maintain an annual planting programme of even 20,000 acres much less the annual programme of 25,000 acres. However, in 1969-70, we took in 25,000 acres and, so far this year, we have already acquired 30,000 acres.  I have every confidence that in regard to land acquired the trend which has manifested itself during the past couple of years will be maintained.  Therefore, I look forward with confidence to <Col N="1179" /> having no problems in the future so far as plantable reserves are concerned.</P>
    <P>I should add also that, as I mentioned in the reply to the main Estimate last year, my officials are also working on a scheme to simplify the acquisition process so far as legal technicalities are concerned.  I am sure that Members of the House will agree that this is a desirable development.  I hope that, within the next 12 months, that new scheme will be finalised and that apart from the greater flow of money that is now available for the purchase of land, there will be a more simplified procedure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright asked what is the average cost at the present time and he quoted a figure of £14 per acre. This is a reasonably accurate figure. Perhaps it may be £1 more at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>To purchase the land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is the average, taking into account that certain lands are purchased at a much higher figure while land of a poorer quality is purchased at a lower figure. It is incumbent on us to acquire land at the best price.  In that regard, we are in no different position from a person buying land for his own use either for planting or for ordinary agricultural purposes.  After all, we are dealing with capital money and virtually all of the funds at the disposal of the Forestry Division come from the capital Budget.  I do not have to remind Members of the House of the problems that any Government would face at the present time in relation to the financing of the total capital programme of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I hope that what I have said in relation to the question of acquisition will allay the fears of those Deputies who have said that at the present time we are unable to maintain our planting programme because of an insufficient reserve of land.  I am satisfied that as a result of the changes made in recent years, this is no longer the position and I believe that the upper trend in acquisition which has manifested itself will be maintained at <Col N="1180" /> least for the next few years.  Of course, we are dealing ultimately with a volatile commodity.  Perhaps that is an odd remark to make in regard to land but the optimum use to which land can be put at any given time is a matter which varies, depending on economic and social circumstances of one kind or another.  Obviously the question of maintaining a reserve is also a question of maintaining an open mind on how best to achieve the results.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney made some relevant points in regard to continuity in planting and felling trees.  He asked that there be greater continuity in this regard in all forests so as to avoid employment fluctuations.  Obviously, this would be most desirable but the gradual process of building up forest blocks and the paucity of our plantable reserves in the past have not facilitated the spreading of planting in individual areas even over a long period. However, great improvement has been made during the past ten or 15 years and at the present time there is much less fluctuation in forestry work than was the case some ten or 15 years ago.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney was concerned, too, about the recruitment of graduates.  I would like to assure the Deputy that there is liaison with the university in relation to the recruitment of graduates. Some graduates emigrate but frequently they do so with the intention of gaining experience in other countries while they are still young and then returning to work in their own country.  Of course, there is involved the risk that some of them will become so attracted by the way of life in these other countries that they may never return or that they may find themselves staying for longer than they had intended.  In the main, we consider the risk to be worth while and the fact is that most of them do return.  I can assure Deputy Cooney and the House that we will be very glad indeed to have them.  The next question I should like to turn to is the subject of forestry workers themselves and the redundancies mentioned by Deputy Tully, leading off on behalf of his party.  Of course, this subject was also mentioned by Deputy Cooney. It is perfectly true that there will be reductions in staff at various forests throughout the country, beginning next <Col N="1181" /> month.  In any event, this is a normal situation since forestry programmes of work cover financial years and the staff quotas at the various forests are subject to variations at the beginning of April.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should deal in some detail with this matter.  The first thing we have to accept is that the tendency is, and for some years has been, towards a fall in the manpower requirements in forestry.  At one time it was very highly labour-intensive.  It is still, I think, labour-intensive in comparison with many other activities, but the combination of rising costs and technological advances have both combined to reduce manpower requirements. Rising costs make it imperative to secure economies in all aspects of forestry work, if timber is to be produced at a price at which it can compete with other materials.  Forestry undertakings all over the world have been putting considerable effort into finding ways and means of off-setting this rise by new methods, new mechanical developments, greater use of herbicides and so on.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Sweden is the best example of this because for many years past the Swedes have been relatively highly mechanised in the use of forest labour because, in their country, manpower was at a premium.  Even there in the past few years new methods have led to a very great reduction in manpower utilisation in Swedish forests.  At the other end of the world, in Australia, they are also engaged in improving harvesting techniques intended to reduce costs.  I mentioned this earlier in my introductory statement.  So, overall the trend in every country is towards a reduction of manpower use for the reasons I have mentioned and our forestry service have had to keep up with these developments and to their credit have done so over the past ten years, in balancing rising costs involved in improving living standards with technological improvements and in that way keeping the industry viable.</P>
    <P>I suppose that the Government and, for that matter, the Members of the House, would have to think again about forestry expenditure if they were not satisfied that the forestry section were doing their stuff in this regard. <Col N="1182" /> While it is true, therefore, that reducing employment is the other side of the coin from increasing wages&mdash;and wages and fringe benefits have undoubtedly increased very much in recent years&mdash; it would not be true to say that men are being laid off at present because of current wage increases in particular. The fact is that, with so many demands on the Exchequer, we would still have to accommodate our forestry programme within the limits of the resources available whether or not we improved our economic viability.  Had we not made the progress that has been made towards maintaining forestry on a viable basis in the face of rising costs, this would not mean that we would now be employing more men but rather that we would be doing less forestry.</P>
    <P>In this context two other specific points were mentioned by Deputy Tully.  He feared that the introduction of a superannuation scheme for forestry workers might be causing disemployment in an effort to find the money to pay the pensions.  This I am happy to say is not true.  The scheme has already been introduced and since last January any worker laid off who has adequate service will qualify for a pension.  Deputy Tully also asked about the Civil Service staff.  The approach here is that the need to contain staff costs applies at all levels, indoor and outdoor.  It has always been a matter of policy to do with the minimum of Civil Service staff because that staff is an overhead cost on timber production.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we have to face the fact, and I have to say to the House, that as a result of the stringent capital budget and, indeed, the general budgetary situation at present, I have to accept a cut in the estimate which I furnished to the Government for our 1971-72 programme.  As a result, I have to face the fact that workers we would not otherwise have had to declare redundant will be declared redundant.  This is something which obviously, as Minister, I regret since it involves a loss of employment I hope only on a temporary basis, but one can only hope that, for forestry workers who will have to be laid off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if my suggestion that people over 65 years <Col N="1183" /> with long service who might be inclined to go out was considered?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this is being done and that it is being borne in mind in the arrangements that are being made in regard to these redundancies. Of course, it is not a pleasant thing to have to say that, apart from the factors which I mentioned earlier, and which have caused a reduction in manpower employment in forestry work, not merely in this country but all over the world, because of the cut back we also have redundancy which we would not otherwise have except for the financial&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say, also, that another by-product of that will be that in 1971-72 we will not achieve our target acreage of 25,000.  Indeed, it will put us to the pin of our collar to maintain the 1970-71 planting programme of 22,500 acres.  I feel that it is only fair that I should put Members of the House fully in the picture in this regard.  As I pointed out earlier on, this will not be because of a lack of land but because of financial considerations. At the same time, I will keep the whole situation under review. Indeed, I was interested when Deputy Enright pointed out that the percentage that the Forestry Vote had in 1960-61 of the total Vote was considerably higher than the percentage which it enjoyed in the current year, ten years later.  I do not know whether I had those figures in my mind when I was arguing with the Minister for Finance about how much we should get for forestry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all agree that forestry is one of the productive national undertakings which it would be desirable to restore as soon as the financial position is better.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooney also mentioned the timber production forecast I referred to in my opening remarks.  This forecast only became available during the last few months and we thought it proper that it should, in the first instance, be circulated to the timber trade.  This has been done.  Obviously the people in the trade are most closely concerned with this forecast.  When we hear from them I assure Deputy Cooney, and the House, that we shall be very pleased to make the forecast available to Members of the House generally.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully also mentioned&mdash;with some annoyance on this occasion&mdash;the fact that he had not heard from the Department in regard to certain submissions made by him on behalf of the Federation of Rural Workers.  I have had an opportunity of looking into this matter in the meantime.  I do not like to see Deputy Tully being cross&mdash;it is very unusual for him&mdash;so I hope that what I have to say now will act as a suitable palliative.  I understand the average working week since 1st April, 1960, has been 42½ hours.  This is operated by working 43 hours in the summer and 40 hours for the nine weeks in the winter.  I gather that on 4th February the Federation wrote to the Department saying they wished to apply again for a 40-hour week for their members.  There is no trace of any previous representation in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my information that the first intimation the Department had of this was a letter on the 4th February saying that the question of the 40-hour week was now one which, in the absence of a suitable reply from the Department, would be heard at the Labour Court.  I understand a copy of the communication was sent to the Department of Finance <Col N="1185" /> on 18th February expressing the view that the claim was in breach of the national wage agreement.  I understand that no reply has been received from the Department of Finance on this matter.</P>
      <P>I have also made certain inquiries as to developments with local authority employees.  I understand that only in Tipperary South and Kerry has agreement on a 41½-hour week been reached. Incidentally, the Labour Court recently recommended that Donegal County Council should remain on the 42½-hour week as this was the normal rate for similar employment in this county.  I am asked to point out that developments so far would not justify the Department agreeing to a reduced working week.  Obviously, if a previous application was made, as Deputy Tully has just said, and the application has been lost or mislaid, the situation might be altered.  I will give the Deputy my personal undertaking to have this question further examined in the light of what he has just said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that where a request has been made for a change in the hours or conditions of employment the least that could be expected is an opportunity to discuss the matter at official level?

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure in line with what the Deputy has said about the usual approach of the Forestry Division in regard to these matters it was probably due to the fact that they were awaiting a reply from another Department before communicating&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I can.  I hope from that point of view that what I have said will put the Deputy's situation as well as the Department's in proper perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> Deputy O'Donovan asked if Norway Spruce and Cyprus Spruce have been superseded by Contorta Pine.  The answer is that Norway Spruce is still used where suitable.  It is slower in growth than Sitka.  In general Sitka Spruce and Contorta Pine are used more extensively because they are the most suitable species for the land types. Sitka Spruce is a very fast-growing tree, producing timber very suitable for general construction purposes and, in relation to thinnings, ideal for pulp. Contorta is ideal in very exposed conditions and is a promising timber, to judge from such testings as have hitherto been possible, but it has less to offer than Sitka and there is a tendency for more land to be put under Sitka.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan also asked a number of questions on the economic side.  If he pleaded guilty to a lack of knowledge concerning trees, I can plead guilty to not having a total knowledge of the answers to the economic questions he asked.  He spoke about macro-economists and I do not think I could even describe myself as a minuscule economist.  In any event, commercial accounts as such were not set up because they would have been a form of window dressing in such a long-term business. The conjectural value of growing stock would have been too significant an element in the balance sheet.  In its planning the Forestry Division aims at an interest rate of approximately 5 per cent.  I hope Deputy O'Donovan will be satisfied with that information.</P>
    <P>In regard to subhead C.2&mdash;Forestry Development and Management&mdash;the Deputy asked why this, which he said concerned the effective working of the Department, was costing proportionately less by way of increase than the staff side over recent years.  Forestry development and management is partly wages and partly materials and equipment which have not increased in price anything like as rapidly as wages have risen.  That explains why this apparent difference in growth has taken place.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan also mentioned paper pulping by State enterprise and asked if this was dropped like a hot potato.  Perhaps not.  Perhaps it was just <Col N="1187" /> let fall like a tepid cabbage.  In any event, I am satisfied with the way in which the timber industry is carrying on its operations.  Our advice is that the existing industries should continue to expand before consideration is given to the establishment either by private enterprise or otherwise of any additional plants.  I am satisfied this is good policy.  The expansion which has taken place in the plants already in operation will be able to take care of the expanding production of our forests. They are already absorbing all available pulpwood and our thinning programmes are up-to-date.  I have no reason to think that the establishment of a State controlled factory is either necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan also raised the question of the travelling expenses of officials and he was quite amusing on the subject of the &ldquo;British Ass&rdquo;.  The seminar in the United States was an international study session of tree breeding.  This is a matter of considerable concern to us.  It was attended by one of our research staff engaged on genetics and my officials say they are very satisfied that it was a worthwhile effort.</P>
    <P>There has, of course, been a considerable exchange of views between officials here and officials in both Britain and Scotland over a long number of years and attendance at the British conference was a useful opportunity for continuing this exchange of views.  Before we took over the State very good work had been done by the British in the field of forestry in the early part of the century.  One example of that is Avondale, the home of Charles Stewart Parnell.  There has always been close co-operation between British foresters and our foresters, to the mutual advantage of both.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy was concerned about some hundreds of acres in Castletownbere.  I must confess I had not heard about this, but I will be glad to have the position examined and I shall communicate with the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carter, Deputy Belton and others mentioned private forestry. Deputy Dr. O'Donovan expressed the <Col N="1188" /> view that the grants are sufficient and said it was not the Minister's fault that private planting was at a lower level than it should be, but I think it is fair to say that these grants have not been increased since 1958.  I am concerned about this because of the obvious steep rise in the cost of maintaining the planting, screening and thinning programme in the last 13 years.  I have advised the Minister for Finance that I will be making a strong claim for an increase in the grant for private planting next year.  A good case has been made for such an increase and I can assure the House that, when an increase is given, the system under which the grant is paid in instalments at the moment will also be examined, with a view to improving it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton talked about private enterprise and that falls in with suggestions made by Deputy Carter and, outside this House, by Mr. Paul Rowan about getting people involved in forestry through a bond issue carrying certain advantages to those interested on a private enterprise basis.  This is something which is being examined very closely and I think Deputy Belton's suggestion should also be examined closely because anything which helps to remove even some of the burden of the financial problem from the State must obviously commend itself.</P>

      <P>With regard to conservation, this is a matter of deep <Col N="1189" /> concern to Members of this House.  It is one in respect of which forestry has a very special role.  I do not share Deputy Tully's fears about fire risks in forests as a result of bringing people in.  Experience has shown that the presence of a very large number of people in forests has been a dramatic success because they are a safeguard against vandalism since, with so many people about, the vandal is fearful of retaliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is a risk, but so far our experience has been very good.  The response to the opening up of the forests to the public has been nothing short of dramatic.  A number of new walks will be opened in the near future.  These are playing a significant part in the leisure activity of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think a crash programme is needed to educate people in conservation. This was successfully done, I believe, during Conservation Year, particularly where children were concerned. The success was not even throughout the country.  I could not pretend it was but, where it was a success, it was an unqualified success due to the enthusiasm and co-operation of the teachers and community leaders. I would instance Cork where 12,000 essays were produced in a competition sponsored by the North Cork Federation of Golf Clubs and the Regional Game Council by the pupils of the primary, secondary and vocational schools.  The standard achieved by these young people was quite admirable. It was unbelievably high.  In other parts of the country a similar competition was not quite so successful.  But taking one thing with another the young in particular and people generally to some extent have become conscious of the issues involved in conservation. I agree with Deputy Belton and others who mentioned particular cases of pollution in Dublin and elsewhere that action is urgently needed in certain respects.  This would be action that would be taken not by the Minister for Lands but rather by the <Col N="1190" /> Minister for Local Government or the local authority.</P>
    <P>What I am concerned about is that some overall responsibility in this regard should rest with somebody and possibly not with the executive agent but with somebody else.  This is a problem which is being examined by a departmental committee at present and I can only hope that the results of their deliberations will be forthcoming soon. Some practical progress has been made: responsibility for pollution of the sea has been taken over by the Minister for Local Government from the Minister for Transport and Power and the more centralisation of responsibility there is for the actual carrying out of anti-pollution measures the better.  Of course we also need to bring our laws up-to-date in this respect.</P>
    <P>I must say to Deputy Cooney and other Deputies who mentioned the matter that the wildlife legislation which was promised last year is ready for introduction, and has been ready for some time, but due to the backlog of work which we have here, both in regard to Estimates and legislation, we were not able to introduce it but I hope we will have it safely off the ground in the near future.  We do realise that this forms an important and integral part of any effective conservation policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that arterial drainage is having a tremendous effect on wet lands on which birds normally stay as, for instance, at the mouth of the Boyne?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This points to the need for some form of national advisory council which will weigh the balance between drainage on the one hand and wet land on the other, and so forth.  I should mention the &ldquo;Country Code&rdquo; a little booklet which is still available to anybody who wishes to have it.  We distribute the booklet to school children mainly and to organisations interested in various aspects of conservation.  It is small and handy and sets out the way in which people should behave in the countryside when enjoying its benefits as part of their leisure activities.  We still have plenty of copies available for distribution to anyone who is interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1191" /> We have to face the fact that the improvement of the situation where it happens to be less than good and the prevention of damage to our environment where it is good at present will both cost a considerable amount of money although I am inclined to agree that it will cost us less on the preventive side than on the curative side and if we can take the necessary steps now we will not find ourselves in the position in which other countries are and that have to take very expensive remedial measures, sometimes at a very late stage.  In general we are fortunate, except in one or two instances and perhaps in one or two areas, that our pollution problems are not acute and our environment is still basically good. It is up to us to take the necessary steps to preserve it where it needs to be preserved and to cure the defects where they need to be cured.  I am satisfied that so far as responsibility rests with the Forestry Division of my Department we have discharged our responsibility fairly and honourably in the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>There are many other points which were mentioned but I will deal with them either personally or through my Department by direct contact with the Deputy concerned.  In conclusion, I want to thank all Deputies who spoke for their contributions and I hope that our work will be sufficiently up-to-date the next time to be able to have a full scale debate and not a truncated one such as we had on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £348,400 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1971, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes and grants including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> The text of the Supplementary Estimate, as circulated, comprises three items, one, £250,000 for housing grants, another for £108,000 under subhead A of the Vote and the third for £11,400 on subhead 1 of the Vote.</P>
    <P>As regards the main item, the voted provision for housing grants for the current financial year was £3,400,000. Of this sum, £3,339,221 had been expended by 28th February, 1971, leaving a balance of only £60,779 to meet commitments maturing before the end of the financial year.  Having regard to the recent rate of demand for payments, this balance would not be sufficient to meet claims arising in the present month, and a supplementary sum of £250,000 is now being sought to make good the estimated deficiency.</P>
    <P>A substantial portion of the increased expenditure is due to a continuous upward trend in new house grants.  The output of private grant-aided new houses in the past two financial years achieved all-time records in each year and it is clear that output in 1970-71 will again be higher than in any previous year.  As compared with the total of 8,129 new house grants paid in 1969-70, it is expected that, despite the cement strike, the total this year will be of the order of 8,700.  New house grant allocations, which are an indication of the probable level of future activity, have also shown a consistent upward trend over the past three years. In the 11 months ended 28th February, 1971, these allocations were about 4,000 higher than in the full financial year 1969-70, which in itself was a record year as regards the allocations.</P>
    <P>The proposals outlined in the White Paper, <i>Housing in the Seventies</i>, which were implemented in the Housing Act, 1970, and which were designed to stimulate the provision of a greater number of more modest sized houses, are beginning to show results.  Already many builders are organising their activities to produce houses of this type, which qualify for a larger grant than heretofore.</P>
    <P>The excess expenditure of £250,000 for which this item in the Supplementary Estimate is sought will be met from savings on other sectors of the Department's overall capital allocation <Col N="1193" /> for 1970-71.  The provision of an extra £108,000 under subhead A of the Vote is necessary to meet the increased staff costs arising from the 12th round salary increases and the additional £11,240 Grant-in-Aid of An Foras Forbartha is intended to meet similar extra costs in respect of that body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Fianna Fáil taxation is increasing year in, year out despite the promises that have been made so often by them in the past. I remember a promise to reduce taxation by £10 million.  I also remember Mr. Lemass stating six or eight years ago that taxation had reached its limit and that in the future if there was any demand for further taxation increases the Government would have to cut their cloth according to their measure and live within their means.  The taxpayers are now reeling under one blow after another from this Government.  We in this House are inclined to ask where is it all going to end.  We are now approaching the £500 million mark of taxation imposed on the people.</P>
      <P>The Government may argue that the money is well spent&mdash;that is a debatable point&mdash;but these increases affect every sector of the economy.  They affect producers, manufacturers and it means that our goods going abroad are dear.  Every increase that the Minister for Local Government or any other Minister brings before us adds a further burden to an already over-taxed people and that includes the poorer sections of our people, the widows, small business people, many of whom are being put out of business.  It also affects industrialists on whom we are depending to make this country more viable in the competitive years ahead.</P>
      <P>I agree that when the cost of living increases officials are entitled to compensatory increases but I would remind the Government and the Minister that it is the last straw that breaks the camel's back.  These increases also affect county councils.  A few years ago the local authorities used to be arguing about the penny increases on the rates, then it became the shilling increases and now it has become pounds in the £ increases.  These are an intolerable and an unfair burden on our people.</P>

      <P>I would remind the Deputy that there will be a Supplementary Estimate for Local Government before the House at a later stage.  The Chair does not wish the discussion to go beyond the subheads in the Supplementary Estimate before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree but I am pointing out that the Government should realise that the taxpayers have not a bottomless pocket.  In regard to subhead I, which deals with the salaries of inspectors, let me say there is a very big delay at the present time in the inspection of houses.  People are complaining to us in public life and getting in touch regularly with the Department of Local Government requesting that an inspector be sent out to inspect a house in respect of which people are waiting for grants.  Builders and other such people are not inclined to wait too long for their money because others are pressing them.  It might be necessary for the Minister either to get the inspectors to expedite the work or in some areas or pockets in the country to appoint extra inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned what the Government have done for housing. According to the recent OECD Report we are building only four new houses per 1,000 population.  At one time there were three other countries below us in this respect&mdash;Spain, Portugal and Turkey.  Now we are second last on the list with only one country, Turkey, below us.  That is nothing to be proud of.  Housing grants are totally inadequate. I remember when grants were in the region of £300 plus £300 from the local authority&mdash;that was £600 altogether when those grants were first introduced.  There have been some increases recently but they are only minimal. At one time you could build a reasonably nice house for £1,200.  The cost of the site might be £100, making £1,300, and with a grant of £600 the person building his house could get almost 50 per cent by way of grant. The Minister well knows that now it costs at least £3,500 to build a similar house; the unfortunate young married man or whoever else may be trying to build a house will have to pay £1,000 for a site, bringing the cost of <Col N="1195" /> the house up to £4,500.  The grants are roughly the same with the result that he is getting only one-seventh or one-eighth of the cost of his house by way of grant.  Therefore, he must either go to a building society or get a loan from the local authority.  House purchasers are being dealt a further blow now because we are told that the interest on loans will be 9½ or 10 per cent. The Minister should increase the grants.</P>
    <P>The pattern of the provision of houses has altered from local authority housing to private enterprise housing. We know this saves the Government money but I think it is bad socially. Years ago when the inter-Party Government were in office there were as many as 14,000 houses built and 80 per cent of them were built by the local authorities.  It might be no harm to say that as far as this side of the House was concerned the housing achievements were outstanding.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is concerned that the debate should not range over Local Government as a whole but should be confined to the subject before the House. The subhead is confined to grants for private house building and takes no account of local authority housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that, Sir, but I wanted to draw the comparison. Regarding An Foras Forbartha and the work they are doing, I might point out at this stage that, as the Minister is well aware, the death rate on the roads is increasing at an alarming rate.  Because of this rate, we can assume that 500 people who are alive today will lose their lives on <Col N="1196" /> our roads during the coming 12 months.  That is something we must be ashamed of but I do not think that either An Foras Forbartha or anybody else are doing enough towards solving the problem.  Motor taxation and other types of taxation on road users bring in about £60 million but we are spending little more than £10 million on our roads.  It was claimed on a recent programme on Radio Éireann that the percentage of taxation spent on our roads is the lowest in Europe and that many countries&mdash;England, Germany and France among others&mdash;were spending on their roads between 40 and 50 per cent of what they took from the motorists.  Not enough money is being spent on our roads and it is time the Minister faced up to this responsibility.</P>
      <P>I think it was An Foras Forbartha who recommended a maximum speed limit of 60 miles per hour.  I have heard many people argue against this but my own opinion is that we should stick rigidly to this limit.  However, there is no point in any Department introducing rules and regulations if there is nobody to ensure that the law is enforced.  On my way here from Mullingar I slow down to about 30 miles per hour when travelling through the small towns and villages but cars whiz past me at up to 80 miles per hour.  Therefore, there should be a sufficient number of gardaí to enforce the regulations.  I understand that the Minister is having a survey carried out to see if there is any way in which the number of accidents can be reduced but how can he hope to get any reliable information when less than 5 per cent of drivers abide by the regulations? However, I agree that no matter what is done will be of no avail if a sense of courtesy, care and consideration cannot be installed into road users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently three young people were brutally killed in Belfast.  These people had the sympathy of the people of Northern Ireland as they had also the sympathy of each and every one of us. Yet, on the same week-end nine people died as a result of road accidents but nobody seemed to be endeavouring to enforce the rules and regulations that would prevent further accidents.  I should like to know if An Forbartha <Col N="1197" /> have made any recommendation to the Minister recently but, in any event, I would advise him not to be guided by the 60 miles per hour speed limit.</P>
    <P>I have not much more to say on this occasion because we are confined except to say that if taxation continues to increase at the present rate, I do not know where it will all end.  The Government are going to the end of the earth in their efforts to borrow money and the people of Ireland are like punch-drunk boxers because of the increased taxation such as the Minister is putting on in this Supplementary Estimate and as is being imposed in every other Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>Because of the tremendous increases that have occurred in the cost of private houses in the past few years, the matter must call for an inquiry.  I am surprised that the Minister has not called for such an inquiry.  From different tables that have been produced I have noticed that the increase in the cost of housing has surpassed any other increases that have occurred during the past three years.  It is dreadful that measures were not taken by the Minister for Local Government to take over land before it got into the hands of speculators.  If the Minister had so done, houses could have been provided at prices people could afford.  No working person at the present time can afford to buy a new house.  If a person goes to a building society he will be told that there is not a glimmer of hope for him in raising a loan if he is not earning a basic weekly wage or salary of at least £40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am annoyed about is that these building societies can avail of so many concessions. For the first time I have obtained details in relation to these concessions. There are certain building societies in this city who are using the money deposited with them by lending it to commercial concerns.  They are abusing their powers in a disgraceful manner and it is about time that an inquiry was carried out into their operations.  I have written to the Minister in connection with this matter but I have not yet received a reply from the Department.  I am talking now about public housing and not private housing.  Building societies are exempt from corporation profits tax.  This is a <Col N="1199" /> big concession.  This exemption now applies for the period beginning on 1st January, 1968, and ending on 31st December, 1970.  I want to know what has happened since January, 1971.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, under a special arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners the societies do not deduct income tax when paying interest to their investors but they pay tax direct on all the interest distributed at a composite rate.  That is at present 70 per cent only of the standard rate which means that building societies are getting away with murder.  They are getting all these concessions.  They are charging exorbitant interest rates. They are also adding on to the interest rates the extra charges.  They must be the agent for the insurance companies and the person buying the house has no say in the insurance of his own house.  They decide the rate of insurance for fire, <i>et cetera.</i> They are getting agents' commission, mortgage charges and all the other things they charge as well as the exorbitant interest rate.  They advertise and, indeed, we are bombarded with this &ldquo;5½ per cent tax free&rdquo; almost every minute on television.  They have abnormal amounts of money for advertising.  The fact that they abuse their powers warrants an investigations into the building societies.</P>
    <P>I did not think that building societies were formed for that purpose.  I thought they were formed to help people to purchase their houses.  I thought they were non-profit making societies.  It is a rude awakening to me to discover the concessions they get and the money they have.  They are all on the board of one building society in Dublin and the trickery that is going on in one building society is an out-right scandal.  Another can give money <i>ad lib</i> for commercial businesses but cannot give it for private housing.  If we cannot have an investigation into that we might as well give up as legislators.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies are mentioned in this document, <i>Housing in the Seventies</i>, after the building societies.  It is stated that insurance companies are the biggest private source of capital for housing <Col N="1200" /> after the building societies.  I am disappointed that Irish insurance companies are not very flaithiúil with their money.  When people came to me about buying a private house and I made investigations, I found that foreign insurance companies, British and Australian insurance companies, were providing the money for housing.  I would ask the Minister to consider this seriously and to look into the question of what proportion of the money for housing is provided by Irish insurance companies.  If Irish people are encouraged to put money into insurance the Irish companies should invest some of the money in houses for the Irish people.  There is an obligation on them to do so.</P>
    <P>I deplore the fashion I see nowadays of the Irish Life Assurance Company building office blocks.  If they are lending money they should lend it for private housing at realistic interest rates.  The way I have worked it out shows that a person who is buying a house from a building society cannot ever hope to own that house.  He will go through his lifetime and he will never own the house.  He will never see the deeds of the house and this means in actual fact that he is only renting it. The building societies have the right to increase the interest.  It is a one-sided contract but a contract should be between two people.  People signed a contract with a building society for a certain interest rate but this contract was broken unilaterally by the building society.  They shoved up the interest rate and there was no redress for the people.  The contracts have gone up from 30 years to 35 or 40 years which means that they will never own the house unless they increase the monthly repayments to such an extent that they cannot live.  I would ask the Minister to look at this abuse of power by the building societies and to ask the Irish insurance companies in particular to lend money for housing in this country.</P>
    <P>I think the question of traffic and Dublin Corporation would come under the Minister's Department.  I wonder would the Chair tell me if I can discuss it?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has adopted a very balanced approach to this matter and he has shown, as he has shown since he assumed office, that he is concerned about housing whether in the private or the public sector.  He has also informed us that part of the money needed will come from savings in his own Department.  This is an ideal attitude and approach for any Minister to have.  I shall support any Minister for Local Government who comes into this House and says he is going to spend more money on housing. The greatest problem in Dublin, and indeed in many other cities in the country, is a housing problem, whether it be in the private or public sector. People spend a great deal of time putting forward solutions to social ills but many of these ills stem from a housing problem.  If we solve the housing problem many of the other problems will disappear and there will be no need to amend either the criminal law or the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The possibility of young married couples getting a local authority dwelling is very slim.  They have to move into the private sector and buy themselves a house.  This means they will run into tremendous expense which in most cases is far beyond their resources. The Minister has acted wisely in ensuring that grants payable to these people are kept going and will not be delayed for even a week or a month.</P>
      <P>We must step up our housing programme if we are to reach the target of 17,000 dwellings per annum.  With people marrying younger, with the increase in the population and with emigrants returning from Britain and Canada more houses must be built to maintain the <i>status quo</i> in housing levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may or may not be proper on this Supplementary Estimate to refer to the treatment meted out to young persons <Col N="1204" /> seeking a home by owners of private property, but I believe the point is relevant because if there were enough houses people would not have to seek flats in private dwellings.  We should not let this opportunity pass without condemning people who are charging exorbitant rents to young married couples.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to enlighten the Deputy by saying I think the present traffic action by Dublin Corporation stems from a report by the German expert Dr. Schaechterle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to mention it.  The Minister states:</P>
      <P>As compared with the total of 8,129 new house grants paid in 1969-70, it is expected that, despite the cement strike, the total this year will be of the order of 8,700.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cement strike lasted five months <Col N="1205" /> and while it did not stop building completely it did affect it to a great extent. Despite this fact there is an increase in the number of private dwellings erected.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell criticised the Minister for not taking action on the land question.  This is not true.  The Minister set up a body to investigate the whole question of land.  Both the Minister and his predecessor have been generous to Dublin Corporation by giving £1 million per year for the purchase of land so that the corporation could create a land bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we are not getting on to public housing again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>No, this is mostly private enterprise building.  The land acquired by Dublin Corporation with the money given it by the Minister is 50 per cent for public building and 50 per cent for private building.  Dublin Corporation allocate land to small builders so that they can build SDA type houses.  The cost of this land has risen astronomically but the Minister's action has pegged land at reasonable prices and this has enabled local authorities to provide houses in the private sector for those who need housing.</P>
      <P>I am sure every Member of this House realises how serious the housing problem is.  When one makes such a statement like that one is often accused of being an alarmist but anyone examining the implications of the housing problem must realise we are making progress.  We must increase the tempo of that progress if we are to meet the tremendous challenge of our time.  The Minister has tried to meet it in his publications <i>Housing in the Seventies</i> and <i>A House of Your Own.</i> There is no limit to the Minister's activity in regard to housing.  I wonder if all sectors of the industry are facing up to the challenges before them.  Are we going ahead at a rapid enough rate to give hope and promise to young married couples in Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier the housing problem is our most serious problem. One hundred and one problems arise out of bad housing.  It has been said by economists that housing is a good social investment but a bad financial <Col N="1206" /> one.  Neither this Government nor its predecessors have ever measured the cost of housing in financial terms alone. At times money has become scarce and the Government have been blamed for bad husbandry in not making the economy sufficiently buoyant to provide the money necessary for housing. If we measure housing in terms of money solely or in terms of bricks and mortar we will never succeed in solving this problem.  If we are to succeed in our housing drive we will have to accept more and more taxation.</P>
    <P>It is a truism to state that no living city has ever solved its housing problems. It is only dead cities that have no problems.  In this city and elsewhere throughout the State we have a real problem.  The Government were criticised by Deputy L'Estrange for borrowing too much and for spending too much.  It is a poor look-out to find the Government criticised, on the one hand, for not providing enough housing and, on the other hand, for spending too much.  The time when the housing problem was good politics has gone.  No Government could be judged on its success or failure in the realm of housing alone.  I and the other members of my party are behind the Minister in any extra expenditure he seeks here for housing.  Nobody can measure in pounds and new pennies the amount of human misery suffered by those who have no proper housing.</P>
    <P>We look forward to the Minister's main Estimate and we hope that he will ensure that in that Estimate sufficient money will be forthcoming to sustain the housing drive.  We will always have a backlog.  The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to ensure that anyone who wants to buy a house, and who qualifies under the various schemes, will not be held up for lack of finance.  I endorse the Minister's application.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the amount paid out in building grants.  The grant in 1948 was £275, or £285 if one went to a building co-operative. Prices at that time were in the region of £1,900 gross or £1,400 or £1,500 net.  Since then local authorities have been giving grants to help out those with lower incomes.  I should <Col N="1207" /> mention here that a person entitled to a corporation grant is debarred from getting that grant if he works overtime. The idea then is not to work in order to qualify for the corporation grant. This is something that should be corrected.</P>
      <P>The percentage of grants in relation to the selling price is in the region of 10 per cent&mdash;£500 on £5,000.  The Minister said that the reduction in the floor space had brought about an improvement in the number of houses being built.  Houses which cost £1,200, £1,400 or £1,500 in 1948 now cost in the region of £5,000 even though the floor space has been reduced.  One gets 10 per cent by way of grant if one qualifies; in 1948 it was 20 per cent.  The grants have never increased <i>pro rata</i> with increase in cost.  This is mainly due to the Government in the early sixties not spending any money on housing and failing to service land.</P>
      <P>Prior to the introduction of the reduced floor space the grant was £275 plus a corporation grant, if one were eligible.  One now gets a lower rate of grant for building a reasonably sized house.  An 800 square foot house is a box and nothing else.  Those who buy houses above the 1,250 mark are very often people with five or six children who would be entitled to a corporation grant.  These people now have to pay stamp duty.  Unless they intend to put all the boys sleeping in bunks in one room and all the girls sleeping in bunks in another room they must pay nearly £1,000 extra for a house.  I admit there has to be a limit, but the limit should be higher than 1,250.  Consideration should be given to the number of children in the family.  It is a bad investment to buy an 800 square foot house when one has four, five or six children. These people should be enabled to buy a decent sized house at the very beginning. As things are they are prevented from doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some experience and I know that a smaller sized house does not necessarily mean a cheaper house.  All one does is save on materials.  Take the case of a bricklayer.  If he has to lay bricks at a corner it is going to take more time than if he were laying <Col N="1208" /> a straight line of bricks and there will be extra costs involved.  If one takes a bedroom or a diningroom the same number of floor boards, practically, have to be laid and the cost is negligible but the cost of materials is something, I agree.  A plasterer will charge a certain amount per square yard for a straight wall but when it comes to corners or cornices the rate doubles. You have more corners per acre than you have in a bigger building and, therefore, again the labour cost is negligible.</P>
    <P>I am not against office blocks or churches being built&mdash;in some cases too much money is spent on them&mdash; but what I am getting at is the cost of houses.  When you are building schools, churches, hospitals and office blocks out of the one labour pool then labour is in short supply and there will be greater offers.  I do not blame any man for getting as much as he can but his fellow-worker is going to pay in the cost of these houses.  We should be more rational and get our priorities right and endeavour to keep down the cost of these houses.  If this was done the grant might be better.  The price of a house could drop by £400 or £500. I know, of course, that land is very expensive because the Government did not provide serviced land around Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult now to differentiate between what starts out as a corporation house and what starts out as a private house under grant.  Shortly after I was elected I came in here and I heard the amount a contractor would charge the corporation for a house after roads were laid and private builders could actually sell the houses cheaper.  Now we have a practice which follows that, and I agree with it, that a builder can build 500 houses, do all the work himself and he can sell you the house cheaper.  Why not buy the finished article straight away then?  The house starts off as a grant house, I do not say the builder gets a grant, but then the corporation come in and buy the scheme.  There have been several cases of that in Dublin.</P>
    <P>No matter what strike has taken place the Minister comes along and says that they built more houses in spite of the strike.  Why is he not <Col N="1209" /> honest?  The amount of cement used in a house is negligible.  During the cement strike many people were short of cement but they got it one way or another, even on the black market, and they used it to build the frame of the house.  Work on the houses was able to continue and while no roads were laid they built the houses along where the road would be and when the strike ended all that was necessary was to lay the roads.  The Minister gets no credit for that.  The reason why there are so many grant houses is that fewer corporation houses have been built.  I presume that the figures which the Minister mentioned include the houses which were purchased in Ballybrack and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out, the 1,200 square foot house or the 1,500 square foot house is now £1,000 dearer.  All these privately built houses are costing people £2 to £3 a week extra if they get the money from building societies. This means that in turn these people look for extra wages and this creates inflation and a round of wages comes back to the Minister who must pay the extra money to the people working in his Department.</P>
    <P>If a person is building a house, let it be 800 or 1,000 square feet, the only cost is material.  You have to have a bathroom and toilet no matter what size the house is and you have to have a kitchen.  You have the same sewerage and water services coming into it and the plumber has to make the same number of bends in the pipes.  His time costs the same for a small house as for a big one.  I would say that at the start of the scheme there would be no extra saving at all.  I know people who are paying £5 for one room and who are looking for a house and any small house would do them.  The Minister, however, has panicked and has rushed at the smaller type houses, presumably on the advice of his Department.  His predecessor also did this.  Another 150 square feet would not mean any greater cost, or certainly very little extra cost.</P>
    <P>The Government serviced no land in Dublin from 1960 onwards.  A sewerage scheme was laid down in Griffith Avenue and after two or three years it was overloaded.  The cost of the land is putting up the price of the houses, <Col N="1210" /> which, again, shows how small the grant is against the cost of the houses. If we are going to have this smaller type house we are going to put it into a smaller area.  Are we going to have 20 houses to the acre and will that bring down the price?  It should bring down the price by about £1,000 but it has not done so.  The Government maintain that by forcing small houses on the people the building industry will be able to provide an extra 1,000 houses per year.  This is only propaganda. It takes the same amount of labour and you will not always save something on material because the lengths of timber, for instance, are conventional and very often they come in already cut.</P>

If this is placed within the hospital grounds there will be a further area available within the hospital grounds possibly for some other development.  We are discussing it as rapidly as we can.</P>

Although the local office of the Department of Labour received the relevant stamped insurance card, receipt of the card in the Department of Social Welfare has not been traced.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not the Minister agree that the regulation which prevents a man who has been carrying out a job satisfactorily for 12 months from being appointed permanently to that job, is rather foolish?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree and I could not undertake to look into the regulations with a view to making this kind of alteration.  I think it is clear enough that the tests which are conducted in relation to Irish are simple. Indeed, in the last examination which was held in September there were 40 candidates who qualified and of these only six failed in the Irish test.  The competitions are held at fairly regular intervals and it is possible for the candidates who intend taking part to prepare themselves for the competition. The results show that they can do so.</P>

If a person has been carrying out his duties satisfactorily for more than 12 months, I do not see why somebody else who is successful in an Irish test that is not relative to the work, should be appointed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any dissatisfaction among genuine working small farmers in the area.</P>
      <P>These two estates, aggregating 335 acres, were included in a comprehensive plan of land settlement in the area which was put into effect earlier this month and involved, in all, some 788 acres.</P>
      <P>The main portion of the estate referred to in the question was allocated to two migrants, but it must be put on the record that, by way of exchange, they surrendered, respectively, 85 acres three miles away and 150 acres one mile away.</P>
      <P>In addition, five local cottiers received accommodation plots of four acres each and a total of 37 acres was allotted to four local smallholders as enlargements.</P>

      <P>The position regarding lands in the possession of the Land Commission for distribution is subject to constant fluctuation, depending on progress in allotment and intake. This is particularly so at this time of any year as Land Commission activities in the allotment of land reach their peak.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it would meet the Deputy's requirements if I refer him to the list of estates in the possession of the Land Commission in County Kerry as at 16th February, 1971, which I supplied in reply to Question No. 15 on that day&mdash;Volume 251 (9), columns 1313 to 1318.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state in respect of Land Bonds issued each year for the past ten years (a) the amount, (b) the date of issue, (c) interest paid at date of issue, (d) their value one year from date of issue, and (e) their value at the present time or at the latest date for which figures are available.</P>

      <P>The reply to the major portion of this question is in the <Col N="1228" /> form of a tabular statement which, with your permission a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Land Bonds are issued and placed to credit of each estate as from the date of its vesting in the Land Commission. To give the value of bonds one year from the date of issue in every case would require examination of the records of some thousand or more estates, which would not be warranted.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>Land Bonds issued (i.e. put to credit of estate accounts in the Bank of Ireland) in respect of purchase moneys of estates in the ten financial years 1960-61 to 1969-70.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may take it that forest areas in County Cork, as elsewhere throughout the country, are generally open to the public for walking.  Motor vehicles are discouraged as a rule.  The exceptions would be immature plantations where there might be particular fire hazards.</P>
      <P>Amenity development has already been undertaken in 14 forests throughout the county.  The facilities provided range from simple layby parking and picnic facilities to quite extensive programmes for forest park development as at Gougane Barra.  This amenity development programme is an ongoing activity and will be extended to other forests in the county.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whether his attention has been drawn to the substantial subsidies, interest free loans and other financial assistance given by the Dutch Government to the tomato industry in that country; whether the artificial competitive advantage thus enjoyed by the Dutch glasshouse industry is regarded as being in conflict with the obligations of membership of the EEC; if the granting of similar aids to the Irish glasshouse industry will be compatible with this country's application for membership of the EEC; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Dutch Government have been operating certain temporary measures in the form of favourable interest terms and grants with a view to encouraging the Dutch glasshouse industry to switch from fuel oil to natural gas heating.</P>
      <P>Substantial grant aid for the establishment of glasshouse nurseries has of course been available in this country also.  Irish tomatoes on the home market are fully protected from competition from imported supplies since imports are not permitted during the annual season when home grown supplies are available.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that the Irish tomato industry has been able to export increasing quantities successfully on a competitive market and quality basis during the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the EEC, individual State aids come under the surveillance of the European Commission who, subject to the overriding authority of the Council of Ministers, are empowered to adjudicate thereon and to require abolition or adjustment of any aid found to be <Col N="1235" /> incompatible with the common market. The Council of Ministers have not so far laid down specific criteria as to the types of aid that may or may not be permitted under the common agricultural policy.</P>

      <P>University College, Cork, were informed in March, 1967, that State expenditure of £505,565 based on their estimate of the cost of the expansion of the Dairy Science Faculty had been approved.  Drawings were received, and approved, in August, 1967.  Demolition work commenced in July, 1968.  Foundation and piling work commenced early in 1969, and I understand that this work has been virtually completed, though at a cost greatly in excess of the original estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lowest tender for the main construction work was received from UCC for approval in September, 1969.  This showed that the total would now be nearly double the amount originally approved, and a detailed re-assessment was, therefore, necessary.  This gave rise to questions which involved correspondence with the college up to August, 1970.  In October, 1970, it was necessary to ask for additional detailed information, which was furnished by the college in December, 1970.  Certain aspects of the proposals have been under examination in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Education in the light of the additional information furnished, and I am informed that there will be no avoidable delay.  The Deputy will appreciate that, where expenditure of this kind is going to exceed very substantially the amount originally approved, regard must be had to the principle of the importance of careful <Col N="1237" /> planning and realistic estimates in relation to projects financed directly from public funds, where bodies such as the universities rely to a very large extent on public finance for capital projects.</P>

      <P>The closing date for new applications under the scheme this year was 1st March.  Very full advance publicity was given to this.  All arrangements for this year's inspection have been made and I regret that it would not now be possible to accept late applications for this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the large number of late applicants will the Parliamentary Secretary reconsider his decision?  Last year the closing date was extended and the initial date was far later than the closing date this year, and people were misled by this.  There is a strong case to be made for the extension of the closing date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons why the date was extended last year was that increased grants were announced at Budget time and it was felt only fair to extend the closing date in order to permit people who would be encouraged <Col N="1239" /> by these grants to avail of the scheme.  There has to be a closing date and no matter what date is set applications will come in late.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that other offices under the control of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have been releasing application forms?  On the application form last year the closing date was 31st March.  In some cases farmers collected last year's application forms and all they thought they need do was to alter the year from 1970 to 1971. Some farmers are still under the impression they are still in order in applying.  In view of the fact that this is not due to any fault on the part of the farmer will the Department give sympathetic consideration to applications received on such application forms?  Could we have a reply to that question?</P>

I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is well aware that farmers do not read newspapers to any great extent and would he not consider making the date this year the same as it was last year, 8th May?  Because it was 8th May last year we all assumed it would be the same date this year.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary give that aspect sympathetic consideration?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries what concessions for Irish fisheries are being sought in the current negotiations for membership of the EEC; and if he will make a comprehensive statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are concerned about one feature in particular of the EEC common fisheries policy, namely, the provision for equality of access to the fishery waters of each member State by the fishing vessels of the other member States.  This freedom of access could create economic and social problems for our inshore fishermen who depend almost entirely on landings from our exclusive fishery waters and it could also have adverse effects on conservation of our fish resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These problems have been repeatedly stressed at the negotiating meetings in Brussels and the Minister for Foreign Affairs has raised the matter at every ministerial meeting with the Communities. In this connection it was agreed towards the end of last year that there should be talks between representatives of Ireland and of the EEC Commission for the purpose of clarifying the content and scope of the fishery regulations and that any problems which would arise for us from implementation of the present regulations could then be discussed.  The <Col N="1242" /> clarification talks were held in January and February and, at a ministerial meeting on 2nd March, the Minister for Foreign Affairs again raised with the ministers of the Six the problems which would arise for us from free access to our fishery waters and he stressed the need for arriving at a satisfactory solution.</P>
    <P>The matter will continue to be pursued actively in the negotiations and I can assure the Deputy that the interests of our fishing industry will be protected to the maximum possible extent.</P>
    <P>Two other applicant countries also, Britain and Norway, are concerned about this problem of free access to fishery waters and representatives of those countries have been having clarification talks on the regulations with the EEC Commission.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, necessary to bear in mind that, while we are concerned about the problems which would result from free access to our fishery grounds, accession to the Communities would bring many benefits to our fishing industry.  The existing customs duties and, in some cases, quantitative restrictions on imports of Irish fish into the present member States would disappear and our fishermen would benefit from the price support arrangements of the common fisheries policy.  In addition, the establishment and operation of fishermen's producer organisations would be assisted and assistance would also be available for such matters as the improvement of fishing fleets and research.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the assistance will be for the purpose of modernising our fleet and having a more sophisticated fleet comparable to that of the other countries which are technically so far ahead of us, as the Parliamentary Secretary is aware.  This could have disastrous effects as far as we are concerned unless we get the guarantees the Minister is seeking. Would the Parliamentary Secretary be able to tell us when we can expect a reply to the Minister's representations at these meetings?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>If, in the event of the reply being favourable, which is most unlikely, is it clear from the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that our fishermen are doomed?  I use the word &ldquo;doomed&rdquo; deliberately.  We will be taken over.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the foreign vessels will take the fish from our seas and our fishermen will fall on lean times?  In view of that, is it not quite clear that membership of the EEC will be a grave disadvantage as far as our fishermen are concerned.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the grave concern felt throughout the country because of the number of factories closing and of reports that many more may close; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Recent factory closures have been due to various reasons.  Certain sectors of industry have been affected adversely by such factors as international market depressions, cost inflation and competition from alternative products and have been forced to cut back production or, in extreme cases, to close down.  The Industrial Development Authority are making every effort to offset the effects of these closures by assisting the expansion of existing factories and the opening of new ones.</P>
      <P>As I said in reply to a question on 3rd March, 1971, I am fully conscious of the need to keep to a minimum any disruption of employment and in a number of cases, where there has been difficulty, I arranged for my Department to make direct contact with the firms concerned with a view to giving them every possible assistance.</P>

      <P>Over 4,000 people have lost jobs recently and 70,000 are unemployed and it is rumoured that 40 or 50 more industries may go bankrupt within the next few months and surely the Minister is aware that the Free Trade Area Agreement is having a bad effect on many of our factories?  That agreement is to be reviewed this year and is it the intention of the Minister and the Government further to reduce our tariffs because if that is done they will close dozens more of factories?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has dealt adequately with that type of repetitious supplementary.  As a matter of fact he had the opportunity of dealing with it twice yesterday because the Deputy asked the same type of question twice yesterday.  In relation to factories closing down, the textile industry is the industry which has been most seriously affected.  Factories which have closed within the last six months were all factories set up with a view to exporting only and therefore the agreement would have no effect on the outcome.</P>

Our information nationally and locally is that a number of factories are cutting back and may eventually close down.  Could he say, first of all, what the number is and, secondly, what help is given before the shutters are put up, because once the shutters are put up it is very hard to take them down? <Col N="1249" /> Everybody appreciates the problem it would be for the people working in those factories, for shopkeepers and others who gain from industrial development in the district.

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Local Government.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was stating earlier that the area of grant houses has been reduced.  I presume this comes about because of the OECD figures showing Ireland at the bottom of the international table for individual finished house units per thousand of the population. The Minister thinks the way to deal with this is to cut down on the area of houses.  I do not agree with this because there are other factors involved.  I would like the Minister to compel particularly big operators in the building line to indicate, when a house is for sale, the square foot area of the house along with the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grants have not increased proportionately to the cost of the house.  It is now approximately 10 per cent against 20 or 22½ per cent in 1948.  There are many reasons for this.  The cost of land has gone up.  In the early sixties the Government did not service enough land in the city.  As one moves out from <Col N="1251" /> the centre of the city land becomes that little bit cheaper and housing becomes more competitive.  There are various costs a builder has to face.  One of the greatest is due to the delays by Dublin local authorities in passing the plans.  I do not blame the officials for this.  They are under-staffed and badly paid in comparison with private industry.  A delay of a couple of months puts up the cost to the builder.  He is buying land at the rate of £8 to £10 per acre and he has to pay interest to the bank for that money.</P>
    <P>The Minister says in his opening speech that a greater amount of money is being provided this year as compared with last year and previous years. How much money did he get back in turnover tax and, in certain cases, in wholesale tax?  He is getting back a good portion of the money he is paying out.  It is a matter of one Department taking it in and another Department paying it out.  Taking turnover tax into account that alone reduces the value of the grant by 6 or 7 per cent compared to 1948.</P>
    <P>People got used to an area of 1,200 square feet for a house.  Then it was reduced to 1,000 feet, and then to 800 square feet.  It is only when the person is living in the house that he finds it is not the area he thought it was.  When a house is put up for sale it should be compulsory for the builder to indicate the square foot area of that house.</P>
    <P>Another factor that has entered into the cost of housing since the 1963 Act is that when a person gets permission to build, another person near him who has a vested interest and does not want other people competing against him, will object to his plans.  This objection will delay the plans anything up to 15 months or two years.  That appeal has to go to the Department of Local Government.  In the Department of Local Government most appeals take something in the region of 12 months and if there is an oral appeal it could be two years.  I can give an instance to the Minister where it took two and a half years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I remember a case taking over two years.  Anyone in the building business will tell you that can happen.  The builder has to pay interest on the money for that period. This puts up the cost of houses.  I am sorry for the officials in the corporation and county councils where there is understaffing.  This understaffing is due to the fact that the wages do not compare with those being paid by private enterprise.</P>
      <P>The corporation are now inclined to buy blocks of completed houses.  They agree with the builder on the building of 500 or 600 houses and when they are completed, the corporation take them over and pay a portion of the money towards the building costs.  I know that Dublin Corporation have bought up a lot of land.  They should give building contracts to the smaller builders who would build, say, six or 12 houses.  Most of these small builders work manually on the job themselves and they would be in a position to build the houses at a lower rate than others by virtue of the fact that a lot of the outside labour is cut out.</P>
      <P>Unless the Minister does something like this and prevents the big builders of Dublin who, I might add, are also engaged in building in many other counties as well, this grant will be insignificant.  There are ten or 12 of those big builders who have bought land banks that will keep them going for ten years.  The Minister will be back in a couple of years to double this amount and it will be still insufficient because these people have the whole market tied up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people buying houses in this category under small dwellings (acquisition) loans will now find themselves in a situation whereby if they qualify for a local government loan, they will have to have either a bridging loan from the bank or else obtain an additional loan from some other source.  The situation in this category of house building has reached the stage where houses have almost <Col N="1253" /> doubled in price during the past four years.  The smallest type grant house which attracts the largest grant is now costing between £3,500 and £4,000. With the news of yesterday that interest rates have been increased, people now buying houses in this category are faced with weekly repayments of between £8 and £10.  Such people would be confined to a certain income which would vary between £20 and £35 a week so that a weekly outlay of up to £10 on housing alone is a high percentage of their income.  In particular it is the married couples who are faced with these problems.  The local authorities for one reason or another have failed to build the necessary number of houses in almost every case and this is putting more and more people in the position of having to buy houses from the speculative builder. The local authority have failed, in particular in my own constituency, during the past few years to build houses. Inflation is rampant within the building industry and this has been reflected in the increasing costs of houses.  In 1966, I bought my own house at an approximate cost of £3,000 but the same type of house today would cost about £7,000.  This means that people like myself who were able to acquire a house in 1966 would have no hope of doing so today.</P>
      <P>When the Minister introduced <i>Housing in the Seventies</i> and when he made changes in the housing grants, he was accepting that no longer can either the Government or the building agencies provide the type of house that could be built three or six years ago.  The previous speaker mentioned the tendency to provide smaller houses and to give the larger grants for the 800 square feet house.  That is a worth-while change but the Minister has accepted that housing costs have increased to such an extent that, if housing is to go to the most deserving people, pressure must be brought to bear on builders to build smaller houses and in that way to build them a little cheaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If large numbers of new houses are being built, it is because the law of supply and demand is in operation and the Government by their <i>laissez faire</i><Col N="1254" /> attitude are allowing speculators to go into the market and to build houses because, obviously, the demand for houses of this type is unlimited at the moment.  Failure of local authorities to supply houses is pushing more people into this category and if there is an expansion in house building it is because of the law of supply and demand.</P>
    <P>The very high interest rate of almost 10 per cent has had little deterring effect on the expansion of the demand for housing.  This reflects the dire state in which people now find themselves in relation to housing.  In my own constituency I have estimated that between 1,000 and 1,200 families are in need of immediate housing.  Since the houses are not being provided, more people are having to avail of the type of buildings for which this grant is intended.  In this way the ordinary speculative builder can build these grant type houses.  It is being done in Wicklow.  Surely it is a reflection in some way on the house planning of the Department that private builders can do the work much quicker than can the local authority people.  For this reason I would appeal to the Minister to require these speculative builders to allocate a number of their houses to people on the housing lists of the local authorities.  The delays in providing public housing are such that after a scheme starts four or five years may elapse before the houses are provided.</P>
    <P>Another problem which is becoming an increasingly heavy burden on young people is the rateable valuation on the grant-type house.  Some years ago the rateable valuation for a three-bed-roomed house&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to couple it with the problems of people buying grant-type houses.  It was in that context only that I mentioned rateable valuation.  I accept what the Chair says. Perhaps it is outside the scope of this debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The £250,000 which the Minister requires to pay the additional grants over and above those for which he originally estimated is, naturally, welcome because it means that people are being housed.  In the end, this is the most important thing.  This also reflects the fact that local authorities are not building houses.  If these grants continue to expand that will reflect the lack of houses provided by the local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of this Supplementary Estimate I should like to say that the details spelled out in it are that it is to defray the cost of the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including grants to local authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes and grants, including a Grant-in-Aid. These are the things we stand for.  If there have to be increase in taxation for this reason we stand over them.  The Minister referred to the housing programme and said that a substantial portion of the increased expenditure is due to a continuous upward trend in new house grants.  I am quite sure that nobody in this House objects to an upward trend in housing grants, although some people object to the fact that there have been increases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with Deputy L'Estrange, the Fine Gael spokesman, in a moment.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>The output of private grant-aided new houses in the past two financial years achieved all-time records in each year and it is clear that output in 1970-71 will again be higher than in any previous year.  As compared with the total of 8,129 new house grants paid in 1969-70, it is expected that, despite the cement strike, the total this year will be of the order of 8,700.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to comment upon it.  I want to ensure that the Deputy has read it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
      <P>New house grant allocations, which are an indication of the probable level of future activity, have also shown a consistent upward trend over the past three years.</P>
      <P>The important point is:</P>
      <P>In the 11 months ended 28th February, 1971, these allocations were about 4,000 higher than in the full financial year 1969-70, which in itself was a record year as regard the allocations.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to the Minister looking for more money to ensure that the housing drive is continued.  I would support any measures brought into this House to ensure that the housing drive is continued, to ensure that the personnel in the various Departments get the increased salaries they are justly entitled to, and to ensure that the section of the community requiring grants will get grants.  I heard some groaning and moaning today from Deputy L'Estrange.  He talked about taxation and about Fine Gael policy, but he had no suggestion to offset the cost or to provide the money in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said that Fianna Fáil taxation increases year by year.  If it increases for this purpose or for other social service purposes I am behind it.  When Deputy L'Estrange says that increases in taxation should not occur that suggests to me that he is not in favour of paying the increased grants and the increased salaries.  It is rather sad to think that this is Fine Gael policy. Deputy L'Estrange spoke about a variety of matters relating to housing. He quoted the OECD Report on the conditions in Turkey and the conditions here.  He did not spell out the fact that the units of accommodation we provide are far higher than those provided on the Continent.  He did not spell out the fact that the family size <Col N="1257" /> here is far larger than it is in Britain or on the Continent, and that our family structure demands a bigger type house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Government were making arrangements to change that too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>We provide as much accommodation as they do, taking into consideration the structures and the size of the accommodation and measuring them against theirs.  Deputy L'Estrange said that the figure for Turkey was the lowest and ours was the second lowest.  We are second lowest because of the fact that we produce a larger type of accommodation than is produced elsewhere.  If the accommodation we produce were on a par with theirs, we might be very high up on that list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the point. Deputy L'Estrange presented no idea that would stimulate the house-building programme.  He did not present any new evidence that would enable the Department, or the builders in general, to produce houses at a lower cost.</P>
      <P>We had some suggestions from Deputy Belton also.  He said that the price of houses could be reduced by as much as £1,000 per house.  There is no doubt whatever that if Deputy Belton were able to put into operation a scheme which would reduce the cost of building houses by £1,000 he would, within six months, be the richest man in the country because everyone would be going to him for cheap houses. Nobody knows better than Deputy Belton the cost of producing houses, the profit on houses and all the other factors related to house-building.  I would ask Deputy Belton to produce proof to the Minister for Local Government and to house-builders so that all the houses built in future can be built £1,000 cheaper.  I am quite sure that young couples looking for houses would support Deputy Belton forever for his suggestion.  We all know that Deputy Belton made these remarks without any foundation and I am quite certain he cannot produce the evidence required.  He spoke about houses costing £1,900, £1,250 and £1,300 back in the forties but he did not indicate what wages were at that time or what materials cost.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask Deputy Belton some questions in relation to the comments he made.  Does the builder put the price of houses up for profit?  Does the builder increase the price of houses to offset wages?  Does the builder increase the price of houses to offset the increasing costs of materials?  Does the builder increase the price of houses to offset the price of land?  Does the builder increase the price of houses to offset the other services provided?  If house prices are put up purely for profit that is wrong.  A builder is entitled to put up the price of houses so that he will get a fair return for the services he renders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" /> Some of the houses built are way out of the reach of the ordinary working man but they were never intended to be within his reach.  Certain houses will always be built which are out of the reach of the ordinary worker.  The first real effort made on behalf of such people was that made by the Minister for Local Government when he increased the grants and made it easier for them to purchase their own homes. It is easy for a person living in a 19 or 20 room house to say that a house of 1,000 square feet is too small.  It is too small for him but it is not too small for working people if they can afford to buy it.</P>
    <P>Modest type houses are in demand and to say that no effort has been made to provide them is erroneous.  The Department of Local Government have made £3 million available to Dublin Corporation to enable them to accumulate a land bank.  This land has been handed over to small builders to develop.  In Tallaght at the present time 300 sites are being developed.  This land bank will provide much needed competition in the building trade and give us a variety of houses at different prices so that people will be able to buy the houses of their choice.  This was a good idea and in time to come I am sure we shall hear Deputies from the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party claiming that this was their idea. When this matter was first mentioned the Opposition thought it was a good idea because it would bring the purchase of a house within the scope of the ordinary worker.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell spoke about the taking over of land.  I disagree with that; I think the building up of land banks is much better.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to be associated with this Supplementary Estimate which will ensure that grants are made available for young people.</P>
      <P>I was concerned to read a statement by the Royal Liver Insurance Company indicating that they were no longer making loans available for house purchase.  There is a responsibility on all insurance companies and more especially on foreign insurance companies to pump money back for house building.  These foreign insurance companies get large sums of money every week and yet they do not now intend to make any contribution to house building.  The people who make weekly payments want to see some return either to themselves or their fellow countrymen.  Insurance companies should be compelled to make some percentage of the money they collect available for house purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned with producing more homes for our people and, whenever we are called upon to meet additional taxation to produce these homes, whether they be local authority homes or purchase type homes, we will gladly support the Minister.  Our main concern is to ensure that we have homes for our people and any suggestion that this Supplementary Estimate is coming at an inopportune time cannot be sustained. Neither can these references to taxing people up to the hilt.  This is for something of which we should all approve and I am quite sure Deputies opposite will not vote against this.  Let us see how consistent they will be when the debate ends.  No one will vote against this.  Let us have an end to hypocrisy.  I trust that, before the debate ends, they will see sense and make some of their ideas available so that <Col N="1262" /> we can have these cheap houses about which they have spoken at such length but when they were building houses, they were not by any means cheap.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual, Deputy Dowling has a great line of patter, but he is, of course, as usual quite confused. He is trying to give the impression that the Minister is asking an extra £250,000 when, in fact, the money is coming from another section of his Department which failed to spend this £250,000.  That is just part of his confusion. He does not even know the name of the Minister who was responsible for confining grants to the more modest type of house; he cannot remember his name or, perhaps, it is a bit of an embarrassment to him to remember it.  He is giving credit to the present Minister.  One wonders whether in fact credit should be given to any Minister for what is allegedly an improvement in housing grants.  I have serious doubts as to whether there is any improvement.  When one considers the way other expenses have been piled on to the cost of house building one appreciates that the grant has been cancelled out completely.</P>
      <P>To exclude a house that exceeds 1,250 square feet from grant is unjust because a very large family might require such a house even though that family is not in the upper income bracket.  There is no provision whereby such people can get a grant because of their particular family circumstances and they will be compelled to live in a totally inadequate house simply because they are debarred by legislation from getting the consideration to which their exceptional circumstances would entitle them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there has been any improvement.  There has been a switch of emphasis, but no improvement.  An enormous improvement is called for.  I have been listening for years to talk about the Government's efforts to produce a low cost house and to reduce the price of houses for those who find it impossible to get a deposit in order to provide themselves with a home. Actually nothing has happened.  We had a great sing-song about the land bank.  I thought it was an excellent idea, but I am having doubts about it now, <Col N="1263" /> except for local authority requirements. First of all, an immense amount of money is required to buy a big land bank and, unless that land can be developed fairly rapidly and converted into houses, the cost of servicing the bank will be enormous.  In fact, what might look like cheap site land today may turn out to be very expensive land in a few years time if services are not provided for ten or 15 years, which is quite a possibility.  We know what site lands are costing us.  Some of us have been shocked at the price Dublin Corporation have had to charge small builders.  We hear a great deal of talk about this land being freely available. The fact is it is not.</P>
    <P>Only the other day a builder told me he had to leave County Dublin in order to keep his small staff working; he is building in the adjoining counties because he could not get site land in Dublin.  He applied for land in Tallaght last November and he still has not got it.  We have just heard Deputy Dowling telling us small builders now have no trouble.  The fact is all the land has been grabbed from under their feet.  It is not available to them.  This is something the Minister should examine into as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The backlog in County Dublin is enormous.  The same situation obtains in the city.  The city is expanding out into the county.  That is how the city is solving its problem.  No building is being done in the city.  That does not matter so long as the problem is solved.  It is, however, a shocking thing to drive small builders out of the county because they cannot get site lands within the county.  To my knowledge that is definitely happening.</P>
    <P>There is another thing happening which the Minister should look into.  It is something I condemn.  We hear about speculators and developers going wrong.  There is no doubt they are not in business for the fun of it and probably some of them make excess profits; nevertheless they are doing one thing and that is producing houses quickly.  It is deplorable that a local authority should come along and put a compulsory purchase order on site land a builder has bought when that land is not required for the council's <Col N="1264" /> own purposes there and then; if it were left to the private developer there would be houses on it in half the time it takes local authorities to provide them.  That is not the fault of the local authority. There are various reasons why local authorities cannot work as rapidly as the private builder, but the main one is the fact that the necessary finance will not be made available by the Department of Local Government.  The private developer can get his hands on the necessary money and go ahead. One may deplore the fact that the private developer may make what looks like too much profit, but he is at least producing houses and these houses are being bought, even if it is not with local loans fund money.</P>
    <P>I have drawn the Minister's attention to the fact that the number of applicants for local loans fund money has dropped significantly mainly because the maximum loan is so far short of what is required.  They are just not able to find the deposit.  No serious effort has been made by the Minister to look into the situation and see what can be done.</P>
    <P>It is misleading for the Minister to say that a substantial portion of the increased expenditure is due to a continuous upward trend in new house grants.  That sort of language is used to give the impression that there has been an enormous improvement in the State subvention for the building of private houses.  The net position is far worse today than five or ten years ago and the Minister must accept this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling asks, if the price of houses has increased, who is responsible? He exonerates the Government from any responsibility for the increase. Their policy did not matter.  It had no effect; their taxation policy had no effect.  He blinds himself to the fact that the Government have an immense responsibility for allowing house prices to increase as they have, due to increases in the cost of living and the consequent demands for increases in incomes from people in the industry, and due to direct taxation, wholesale tax and so on, on various materials used in the industry.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House would welcome increased demands by the <Col N="1265" /> Minister for more money for houses if this would lead to an improvement and if the backlog were wiped out but there is little sign of that happening certainly in this part of the country into which people are pouring and the demand and the frustration are increasing. Deputy Dowling said that there was an enormous demand for this smaller type house.  Of course there is because it is the only type of house they can afford. Anything is better than a shed or 20 people living in a cottage, or living in deplorable caravans which have no sanitation and let in the rain.  Recently the Minister went to England to look at the &ldquo;No Fines&rdquo; country type house and I also went across with members of the county council to see if houses could be produced cheaper in this way. I should like to tell the Minister if he has not seen it that there was a &ldquo;No Fines&rdquo; concrete house of 930 square feet, and a 30 square feet garage, the rent of which was £4.05 including rates. The Minister should look into this and see how this is possible.  It was a first-class house and I got the impression that there is considerable scope for rapid building and for reducing the price of houses.  Having seen the way these houses are built I feel that there must be an enormous profit in them for the builder.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister has decided to go ahead with some schemes of this sort and that the NBA have been in on this, and that certain contractors have been selected.  Is there any competitive tendering in these cases or how are these people picked for this work? It is important that this should be known because there is a rumour a broad that they are selected for reasons which are not very desirable.  This may be wronging the people concerned but at least people must be seen to get a fair chance to tender for this type of work.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend the Minister for going to the trouble of investigating this way of producing lower cost houses while at the same time keeping quality reasonably high.  I would exhort him not to reduce his standards too low in regard to the house area itself. There is nothing more deplorable than to see families overcrowded to the point where it is injurious to their health.  I would prefer to see a more spacious <Col N="1266" /> house with a finish which was less good than a well finished, small house.  There is a good deal to be said in that regard. I believe that we are making many of our houses much too small.</P>
    <P>Portion of this Supplementary Estimate which is not being secured as a result of savings in other Departments is the money for An Foras Forbartha. An Foras Forbartha cover a fairly wide field and recently we got a summary of the work they do.  I saw a reference recently to the fact that they were so starved for necessary capital that they are unable to meet their responsibilities or attend to work which they could properly do.  I do not know sufficient about the position to be constructively critical about them.  One thing which they do is to reclassify roads and I am very critical of this aspect of their work.  Roads are not classified on the basis of the volume of traffic which they carry.  If one is to judge by the grants being made available for road improvements then if you have a black top road that is the end of the matter because that is the yardstick and you will get no grant. They saw fit in County Dublin to classify 51 miles of road.  In County Dublin we are carrying the traffic of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Physical planning will be aided by the work of An Foras Forbartha (The National Institute for Physical Planning and Construction Research) which has been established by the Minister for Local Government, with United Nations assistance, to provide research and advisory services in environmental studies, including local and regional planning, amenity conservation and development, road construction, road safety and traffic, and water resources conservation.</P>

      <P>The provision of an extra £108,000 under subhead A of the Vote is necessary to meet the increased staff costs arising from the twelfth round increases and the additional £11,400 Grant-in-Aid of An Foras Forbartha is intended to meet similar extra costs in respect of that body.</P>

    <P>The Chair is entitled to make a ruling that we cannot mention An Foras Forbartha but it is mentioned in the Minister's brief.  There is a substantial amount of money allocated to it and if the Minister is not objecting to having it discussed he was making rather strange noises when Deputy Clinton was attempting to discuss it.  One <Col N="1269" /> further point in relation to this extra money.  It is supposed to defray extra expenses, but there is a question of a reduction of staff when they had to sack their secretary because they had not the money to keep him on.  Where does that come in?  Surely the Minister should have referred to that when he was looking for extra money for staff for An Foras Forbartha.  The Minister can shake his head.</P>

      <P>I am not.  The Minister, of course, was very anxious this would not be discussed at all and I would like if he would make a comment when he is replying.  We discussed here the question of the reduced size of houses which would qualify for grant and what Deputy Clinton says is quite true. Despite Deputy Dowling's comments here, this was introduced by the former Deputy Boland when he was Minister, not by the present Minister, and at the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know they like to forget a lot of things here.  In fact, the figure was 1,249 square feet and no grant or rates remission would be allowed over that.  Deputy Dowling seemed to suggest that a house of that size was something enormous.  He talked about 11-roomed houses.  I do not know whether he was talking about former Ministers.  They are the only people I know who happen to have houses of that size and who are connected with this House.  The position is that people with a large family would not find anything extraordinary in building a house which is over 1,249 square feet; in fact, anything under that would mean that they would have to be adding on to it as so many of them have done. The Department have been sitting tight for years on the question of the amount of housing grant to be given.  The Minister ignores the fact that it now costs as much to buy a site as it did to build a house some years ago.  I am one of those people who have a family growing up, getting married and building their own houses, and I know exactly to the last nail what the costings are on those houses.  Anybody who goes to the trouble will soon find out that when site costs are taken into consideration and when the extra taxes which were put on deliberately by the Government are added to the material and also the increases in wages which were brought about because of the huge increases in the cost of living, they will understand why the price of houses has gone up so much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the money which is available to people who want to build houses is the main thing that is dealt with here.  I do not know whether the Minister knows this or not, but there is the extraordinary situation in regard to people who want to build a house that, as soon as they reach the stage at which they feel they would have money to repay the loan&mdash;and we were told on the radio this morning that local authority loans will be going up from 8½ per cent to 9 per cent on 1st April&mdash;they are told they are ineligible for a loan. They are then thrown back on building <Col N="1271" /> societies and various other organisations who will make their own terms before they agree to lend money.</P>
    <P>In addition to that we have the situation where people who are borrowing money in order to build houses are, in many cases, people who would normally qualify for local authority houses.  After these people have made all the necessary arrangements many are frightened by the cost.  Would it be unreasonable to suggest to the Minister that people who would normally qualify for local authority houses but who build their own houses should be added to the categories who are qualifying for the higher grant for such houses?  Would it be unreasonable to suggest that somebody who becomes tired of waiting for the local authority to build a house for him and who makes the effort to build his own house might be given an extra grant or a subsidy on the loan charges? This would encourage people to build their own houses.  As the Minister must be aware, most of the people in this category would be living either in condemned accommodation or in overcrowded conditions.  I know of many people in the lower income groups who are attempting to build their own houses.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Clinton say that when he went to England recently on an inspection, he found that a certain type of house could be built for which the repayments would be only £4 or £5 per week.  A repayment of £4 per week out of an income of, say, £20 would be quite substantial and after income tax and other outgoings had been paid, there would be very little left for a family to live on.  It is people like these whom the Minister must help because rents, as well as interest on loans, are most unreasonable.</P>
    <P>In the case of local authority houses, the position is the same and the people who get those houses must pay rates from the day they enter the houses and when we take into consideration the further increase in the rates&mdash; again, because of muddling on the part of the Government&mdash;these people will be put to the pin of their collar.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> Finally, I ask the Minister if any effort has been made by his Department to find some way of getting low cost houses on the market.  When the last Housing Bill was going through, the then Minister, Mr. Boland, included a suggestion that an additional grant would be paid to anybody who could devise a unique type of house. We are not looking for houses of a unique type.  We are looking for low cost houses, for houses that the people can afford.  Somebody said recently that the houses being built now will not last as long as did those that were built 100 years ago but it will satisfy most of us if they last for less than half that time.  No matter what Deputy Dowling or any other Deputy may say, the fact remains that the number of people seeking housing in this city and in this country as a whole, is a national scandal.  Despite all this nobody seems to be very worried about trying to break new ground in relation to house planning.  Surely it should be possible for somebody to devise a low cost house?</P>
    <P>I know that, a few years ago, the Department went on a rampage in relation to local authority housing. They inspected these houses and sent back plans to the effect that ceilings should be lowered by six inches, windows narrowed by two inches and other such nonsense so as to cut down costs.  The Minister, as a young man, should make every effort to ensure that houses will be built of such a type that people will be able to pay for them.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of sites. The only way in which sites can be had at a reasonable cost is if the State would decide that building land should be purchased, where necessary, only by local authorities or by the State.  I object strongly to the term &ldquo;confiscation&rdquo; used by Deputy Dowling.  It was all right during the last general election campaign when he went around the country talking about the confiscation of farmers' property. What I am talking about is not confiscation.  It is something to which the people of this country are entitled. It is a national scandal, too, that where local authorities spend a lot of money <Col N="1273" /> in the development of a site, some speculator, be he a landowner or a builder, is allowed to buy that land at a low price and eventually charge exorbitant prices for the houses he builds thereon.  If the Minister is not prepared to tackle the problems now, I do not know of anybody else in the Department who would be interested in tackling them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have no wish to take up the time of the House for more than a few minutes but I would not like to let this Supplementary Estimate go through without paying tribute to a section of the community that I believe are doing a very good job and who deserve the greatest credit.  I refer to those people of modest means who, during the years, have been building their own houses.  Of course, a lot of these people are forced into building their own houses because sufficient housing is not being provided by the local authority.</P>
      <P>Bad as the situation is here in relation to housing, if these people had not made the effort to provide their own houses, we would be a disgrace before the world.  I might say also that in many towns there are small builders who are constructing houses to order and who are doing a reasonably good job.  If it were not for them and those people who build their own houses, we would be much worse off.</P>
      <P>In this respect, I would like to say that it is becoming increasingly difficult for people of modest means to build their own houses because the gap between the State grant and the cost of housing is widening and I do not believe that the normal State grant is in line in any way with the increase in the cost of housing.  As Deputy Tully has said, the rate of interest has now been increased.  This means that the cost of servicing a county council loan will be in the region of £250 a year.  It means that to service a county council loan will cost about £250 a year on a £2,500 loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rates have gone up very considerably. The size of the house has been reduced, as Deputy Tully also said, from 1,500 square feet to 1,249 square feet.  It is very doubtful whether <Col N="1274" /> that was a wise move.  A house of 1,500 square feet is not palatial and anybody with a reasonably large family would certainly want a house of that size.  The interest rate has put up the price of housing.  The turnover tax has increased the price of housing very considerably.  The wholesale tax which applies to certain items has also increased considerably the price of housing.</P>
    <P>I believe that the section of the community about which I spoke, that is the people who just qualify for the grants, should get further assistance. I believe it is a wise investment of public money to invest it in private housing.  This relieves the local authority of the necessity to provide houses and in that way money is saved. Furthermore, if they are privately owned, the houses will be kept in a proper state of repair.  Over the years it has not been possible for local authorities to keep their houses in a proper state of repair because, when they are striking the rate, repairs are the one item they are inclined to save on, the one area where they have discretion.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country local authority houses, by and large, are in a poor state of repair for the simple reason that when the rate is being struck this is where economies are made.  Therefore, the Minister should continue to keep housing grants in line with the increased costs of house construction. I do not know whether &ldquo;private housing grants&rdquo; includes reconstruction grants.  This has not been dealt with in the Supplementary Estimate.  I am sure that the finance provided for reconstruction falls under this heading.</P>
    <P>I believe that in this field reconstruction grants have not been touched for many years.  They have fallen behind and they are still one-third of the cost that has to be met by the applicant. The maximum is £140.  It has remained at that figure for many years.  In this way houses which would be repaired if the grants were more adequate and could be saved, are allowed to fall into disrepair and are scrapped.  Therefore, I would strongly recommend to the Minister that he should increase the reconstruction grants.</P>
    <P>I rose mainly to pay a tribute which <Col N="1275" /> is not paid often enough to the people who are providing their own houses and the small builders who carry out these schemes.  They should get more encouragement and any encouragement which the Minister can give them I am sure will have the support of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Before a person can qualify for a housing grant or loan he must raise the necessary money.  As we are all aware, building societies have closed down as regards granting money for additional building.  Unless you had an application in prior to a fortnight ago, and it was sanctioned, you cannot get any money.  Everybody in the country knows this.  Banks are not granting bridging loans to people who had a building society loan before the closure, or even to people who get a county council loan.  The Minister will have to look into this matter.  Otherwise the loans will be only a matter of form.  It is almost impossible for people to provide their own houses.  Families must have homes.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister can exert any influence over the building societies but I would hope he would ask them to relax their restrictions on credit.  I believe they would listen to him and endeavour to facilitate him. When the Minister is replying I should like him to say if he agrees with what I am saying.  I should like him to say if he believes this to be true.  I should like him to say if he believes that the building societies are not granting loans and that if a person makes an application it will be refused.  I believe it is true that the building societies have dried up their money and are not giving any further loans.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the banks.  In cases where the local managers were prepared to grant bridging loans I believe they have been turned down by head office in Dublin.  All this is imposing grave hardship on the people who were expecting a bridging loan.  They also have to wait for possession for a further period until the title documents and other matters are cleared up.  The Minister should investigate this matter and try to rectify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with the position in <Col N="1276" /> regard to private housing grants.  Let us take a private housing grant for a farmer with a valuation of over £60. Such a farmer does not qualify for a loan from a county council.  Unless a farmer with a £60 valuation is able to obtain a loan from the county council he will find it impossible to build a house because building societies are not prepared to facilitate farmers.  The only recourse a farmer has for a loan is to the county council.  He will be able to obtain a loan of approximately £500 from the Land Commission, but that is a very small sum compared with the cost of building a new house.  I would urge the Minister to raise the poor law valuation limit from £60 to at least £75 and if possible £80.  Due allowance should also be taken of the number of children attending school.  I have come across a few cases where people with a valuation of over £60 were not granted a loan by the county council.  Banks are not prepared to grant loans over a 25 year period and the Land Commission cannot grant sums of that size.</P>
    <P>The income limit for ordinary people who qualify for a loan from the county council is in the region of £1,500.  This limit should be increased to £2,000. Such an increase would be justified with the fall in the value of money and more people could be helped to purchase their own homes.  The maximum grant for a valuation under £20 would be £900, £450 from Local Government and £450 from the county council.</P>

      <P>I should like to know when the present rate for these grants was set.  It would be in the best interests of people to raise the grants and it would stimulate more building and encourage people to provide their own homes.</P>
      <P>House loans are to go up by 1 per cent according to this evening's <i>Evening Press</i>, which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thousands of would-be home buyers face the prospect of much higher repayments on their local authority house loans because of a decision by the Government to raise the interest rate by 1 per cent to an <Col N="1277" /> all-time high of 10 per cent, it was learned today.</P>
    <P>Officials of Dublin Corporation have calculated that the higher interest will cost a man with the new maximum loan of £3,300 an extra £2 10s a month in repayments.</P>
    <P>That amounts to approximately £30 a year.  An interest rate of 10 per cent on a loan is very high and many people faced with increases in the rates &mdash;at the present time the rate is 93s in the £ in Offaly&mdash;will find this increased interest rate a grave imposition.  It is all very well to say it is only £2 10s a month but people having to meet the rising costs of living will find this a heavy burden.  It is unfair, to say the least of it, that people should be asked to pay this extra money at this particular time when costs are spiralling.</P>
    <P>With regard to the White Paper on Local Government, there is one item at the moment which is causing grave concern.  I refer to the rating system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a fairly wide ranging discussion on this somewhat small Supplementary Estimate and I suppose it is difficult for Deputies, even, perhaps, for the Chair at times, to know where to draw the line.  The money required is for two purposes, the first being additional finance to pay the increased number of private house grants and, secondly, more finance for the 12th round salary increases. It would, of course, be quite impossible for the Minister and his advisers to estimate around the end of March, 1970, what wage increases would come in course of payment during <Col N="1278" /> the year and we could not, therefore, provide accurately for these.</P>
      <P>With regard to the sum required for private house grants, this is a very interesting development.  It shows a most encouraging trend.  One must record one's admiration for these young people who are purchasing their own homes.  In most cases purchasing a house is the biggest investment they will ever make and I am heartened at the number of young people who are entering into this commitment now. If the booklet we produced&mdash;<i>A House of Your Own</i>&mdash;were more widely read I believe there would be an even greater increase in the numbers of people seeking to purchase their own homes.  The demand for the booklet has been fairly substantial, but it could be much greater.  I recommend the booklet and I suggest Deputies should advise their constituents to procure it.  It is available through the Government Sales Office.</P>
      <P>Steps have been taken to encourage the building of houses for private purchase. We have been encouraging local authorities to purchase as much land as they can, to service it and sell it to small builders, or to sell off serviced sites.  There is a special subsidy for this. A number of Deputies referred to land acquisition.  The three housing authorities in the Dublin area have acquired or are in process of acquiring sufficient land for about 24,700 houses.  At the end of 1965 Dublin local authorities had acquired or were acquiring 9,000 sites; at the end of 1970 the figure is 24,700.  For all local authorities, at the end of 1965 there were 25,000 sites acquired or in process of acquisition; at the end of 1970 that figure had increased to 62,000.  That is a substantial figure and those who try to ridicule the Government are quite wrong in their attitude because the facts abundantly prove the point that the policy of encouraging local authorities to buy land was a wise one and was willingly accepted by local authorities and implemented by them.  Vast tracts of land have actually been acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton made a rather extraordinary statement.  He said the Government had not serviced any land since 1960 onwards.  He was, I think, <Col N="1279" /> referring to the Dublin area.  It is no harm to refer to the part the Government have played in the sanitary services programme.  About £15¼ million worth of water and sewerage schemes have been released in the past three years, never mind going back to 1960, and a great deal of the work has already been completed.  Practically all the work is in progress.  Deputy Belton's statement was most uninformed. The Dodder Valley sewer necessitated the laying of four main sections; two of these have already been completed, the third is in progress and tenders for the final section will probably be invited later this year.  The cost of that scheme is £2.5 million. It will open up 6,300 acres of new land for housing in the Dublin region.  It will also help from the point of view of industrial development.</P>
    <P>Another great scheme is the Grand Canal scheme.  This is being designed as a matter of great urgency.  It is expected the scheme will be completed by the end of 1976.  The cost will be £6.5 million.  When it is completed it will open up about 11,000 acres for housing and industrial development.</P>
    <P>The treatment works for Dublin sewers will cost about £3.5 million. If one lumps them all together the total figure comes to roughly £12.5 million.  In Cork, major drainage schemes are being prepared, as well as water supply schemes.  Major works are going ahead in Galway.  I have personal knowledge of the work being done there.  The investment will be substantial, roughly £1.5 million, and more than half the work has been completed.</P>
    <P>There are big schemes in Limerick and Drogheda.  In practically every county water supply and sewerage schemes, financed by the Exchequer, are under way.  This is a policy decision on the part of the Government and Deputy Belton should never have made the sweeping statement he did.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the part building co-operatives can play in the provision of more houses in the private sector and I have set up a special section in the Department to give expert advice and assistance to any group which forms a <Col N="1280" /> building co-operative anywhere in the country.  I have circularised every local authority instructing them to give them every possible assistance, to give them whatever advice they need and where possible provide them with serviced sites.  I have given a clear indication that where serviced sites are being allocated by local authorities a minimum of 20 per cent should be made available to building co-operatives.  I would like to see much more of course because I am making a very strong commitment now to the co-operative movement and want to encourage it as much as possible.  There will be no delay in regard to applications or requests for information and I have instructed that where grants are due for payment they be paid quickly to enable these groups to go ahead without any unnecessary delay.</P>
    <P>We also encourage local authorities to pay supplementary grants in addition to the local government housing grant. It is a matter of regret to me that there are still some local authorities who are not paying supplementary grants in full.  I would urge them to play their full part in the housing programme by initiating a full 100 per cent supplementary grant scheme in each area.  I regret that Galway Corporation, of which I was a member up to a short time ago, have not yet initiated such a scheme.  They have only a very limited scheme of supplementary grants available in that city in which there is great growth and a great demand for houses.</P>
    <P>We have also encouraged local authorities to participate in the guaranteeing of loans to building societies.  One of the first efforts was made in this field during 1969 and early 1970 when the Dublin city and county manager negotiated a scheme, which applied under section 42 (1) of the Housing Act, 1966, with building societies and with certain life assurance companies.  The scheme was to enable the corporation to guarantee advances made by the commercial agencies in respect of package deal houses in Dublin city and county.  Deputy O'Connell expressed some criticism of building societies and assurance companies and it is only fair that I should refer to part of the work in which they have been participating in relation to <Col N="1281" /> enabling people to have sufficient funds to build houses, and the way in which we have encouraged local authorities to participate in this as well.  A similar scheme in respect of package deal houses was started by Dublin County Council and a similar scheme has been approved for houses in the Dún Laoghaire borough.  All in all, about £1½ million was made available in 1970-71 under this particular scheme which is additional finance made available for houses for people who need them.</P>
    <P>As the scheme is drawn up it indemnifies societies against almost any imaginable loss on their part arising from the making of a loan for house purchase.  The guarantees are confined to new houses and may be given in relation to loans not exceeding £3,300, or the maximum of a loan which may be made by the housing authority from time to time.  The limit on loans should ensure that there will be no question of recoupment of any losses incurred because the local authority are confident that they will always be able to realise at least the full amount of the outstanding loan by the sale of any house for which a guarantee is given. Alternatively they will use their statutory powers to appropriate the house in question for their own purposes.</P>
    <P>The approved scheme enables many applicants whose incomes would normally be too low to obtain building society or assurance company mortgages. It also helped the Dublin Corporation and the county council to find capital for package deal houses which could not be made available from the normal capital allocation for local authority house purchase loans.</P>
    <P>The building societies will normally advance twice the borrower's income to about 80 per cent of the valuation which they put on the house but under the above scheme, irrespective of income, they will lend up to 90 per cent of the valuation of the house, or the £3,300 limit, whichever is the lower. This is another valuable form of assistance to enable people to provide their own houses.  It should also be borne in mind that when the Department increased their grants the local authorities <Col N="1282" /> who were paying the supplementary 100 per cent grant also increased theirs in line with the Department's grant, which does give an increase in the overall grant to persons who qualify.  As the House knows, I increased the income limits for supplementary grants last year.</P>
    <P>We also encourage local authorities to sell their houses and to draw up purchase schemes and this has been working very successfully.  Many thousands of houses have now been bought by the tenants and the money thus made available goes back into the house building programme to provide further capital for house building.  The question of the price of building land was raised. The part that this is playing in increasing the price of houses has been of great concern to anybody connected with house purchase or house building. The Government established the Kenny Committee a short time ago to go into this whole question.  There are highly qualified people on this committee and I await with interest the outcome of their deliberations.  It would be wrong for Deputies to ignore the difficulties which the Government are faced with in dealing with this matter of land prices.  There are very serious constitutional obstacles and it is not honest for any Deputy to speak here and not to admit that these difficulties exist.</P>

We have also invited comments from others in the community on how to overcome the difficulties.  We are completely open to suggestions and I invite them from any quarter.  As <Col N="1283" /> Deputies know we have also provided a large sum of money to local authorities especially in Dublin, of £1 million a year for three years, to purchase land.  Until some other solution presents itself or until I get the findings of this committee I intend continuing with the land acquisition policy.  If the committee make positive, constructive proposals which are practicable, which can be implemented and if they are acceptable to the Government, this further action will be taken.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Land Commission Policy : Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of a policy to be carried out by the Land Commission which will ensure that in the allocation of land, the claims of local deserving applicants should be satisfied, before persons from outside areas are considered.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Tully.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is worthy of very serious and careful consideration. In his introductory statement Deputy Tully made a very strong case for a better deal for the small farmers and landless men in the so-called non-congested areas who are anxious to expand their activities in farming.  I fully support the case he has made.  Consideration in relation to any estate should not be restricted solely to those who happen to be within a mile or half a mile of the estate.  If we preserve the present policy without fundamental change many people will never be in the fortunate position that an estate will be divided within a mile of them and, therefore, they will never be considered.  This to my mind is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many landless men, men who may be extensively engaged in farming by taking land on conacre but who do not own any land themselves. These men are to all intents and purposes <Col N="1284" /> farmers and the fact that they are not fortunate enough to own land should not be held against them.  I also agree that the present policy whereby the annuity paid by the local allottees for land in the eastern part of the country is twice as much as the annuity paid by people who have come up from the so-called congested areas is entirely wrong and unfair.  The 45-adjusted acres which is the standard acreage to which the Land Commission adheres at the moment needs to be revised upwards. Everyone knows that in modern conditions it is not sufficient to ensure an adequate standard of living, particularly in the light of the proposals which are receiving tacit approval from the Government which indicate that a farm should support a man and a helper.  I do not think a man and his helper would be supported in very great comfort on 45 acres.  However, I have grave doubts as to whether the object which Deputy Tully and others in this House espouse can be achieved by means of only a slight change of policy in the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Merely to increase the limit for consideration for land to within a radius of five miles of the estate in question or, indeed, to include landless men for consideration within that limit, while leaving the overall policy of the Land Commission intact, would create more problems than it solved.  It would be an end to all migration not only from the west but within the eastern counties themselves.  I also believe it could work out administratively to be very expensive if everybody within five miles of an estate had to be interviewed.  It would also create a demand for land which possibly could not be satisfied.</P>
    <P>I should like to expand on this a little.  Over the past few years the amount of land acquired by the Land Commission in both Meath and Kildare has been falling rapidly.  In 1967-68 the Land Commission acquired 2,569 acres in Meath; in 1969-70 they acquired only 1,234 acres.  Every indication is that in 1970-71 it will be substantially lower again.  At a time when land values are soaring the Land Commission is getting an increasingly smaller portion of Government resources. In 1960-61 the share of Government  <Col N="1285" /> resources allocated to the Land Commission was roughly 1.9 per cent; this is down to 1.2 per cent of the total Government Budget in 1970-71. This is at a time when land prices have increased even faster than Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>The question is where would the Land Commission get the money to buy enough land to satisfy everybody within five miles of an estate?  This is a question which none of us in this House can dodge even if we happen to be on the Opposition benches.  Another fact that has to be faced&mdash;this is something I have to bear in mind in advocating the case I have made earlier in my speech&mdash;is that if we change the limit from one mile for uneconomic holders and half a mile for landless men to five miles for all this would mean, assuming that the density of population is the same, mathematically the number of small holders to be considered would be 25 times the present number and the number of uneconomic holders would be 100 times the present number.  I agree that this is substantially qualified by the fact that there would be an overlap between the five-mile radius of various estates and this would bring this figure down significantly because the interview for one estate would hold for another and so forth.  However, it is fair to say it would create a very large administrative problem for the Land Commission.  The figures given by the Minister&mdash;I have no reason to doubt them&mdash;indicate that 60 per cent of the lands which have already been distributed by the Land Commission have been given to local people who happen to be within the mile.  If that were extended to five miles it would appear that a substantially greater amount of land would be needed to satisfy all the people within that radius, if 60 per cent of it is exhausted satisfying the people within one mile.</P>
    <P>This would bring a further difficulty if another reality had to be faced, that is, of raising the target acreage of the Land Commission from 45 acres to 60 acres as I believe it should be, and if that included not only existing holders but also landless men.  To do that again a lot more land would be <Col N="1286" /> needed than the Land Commission have at the present time.  There are a number of ways in which we can get that extra land, and we would want to look very carefully at them.  The first possibility would be to increase very greatly the expenditure budget of the Land Commission but that brings you only part of the way because if the land does not come up for sale how are they to acquire land?  The position at the moment is that they can only acquire land that is offered for sale.  I hope that in due course the effect which these proposals have on the Land Commission budget will be spelled out. I would like to make it clear that the difficulties to which I have referred apply only while the present Land Commission structure is adhered to.</P>
    <P>It is essential that something be done about the many small farmers and landless men who are at present being deprived of an opportunity of acquiring enough land to enable them to develop their talents.  However, nothing can be done within the existing structure of the Land Commission.  A proposal such as that which is on today's Order Paper is within the existing structure of the Land Commission. This proposal is a good one for the time being but in order to achieve the long-term objectives which both Deputy Tully and I advocate, we must undertake a complete overhaul of the Land Commission.  This proposal or the other one which Deputy Tully has on the Order Paper are more of a temporary nature.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that in order to achieve the objectives set out here, the Land Commission should be converted into a land purchase corporation, retaining the powers to acquire land but devoting most of the £4 million that they now receive to extending credit at low interest rates, say 3 or 4 per cent, to all farmers with holdings of less than 60 acres and to landless men so that they might have enough land to enable them to participate in full-time competitive farming.</P>
    <P>The amount currently being devoted towards this purpose by the Agricultural Credit Corporation is only about £150,000 a year.  As a result only those farmers with holdings of less than <Col N="1287" /> 45 acres can participate.  In many cases, the prohibitive interest rate of 8½ per cent is being charged.  The substantial amount of £4 million which is paid to the Land Commission should be given by way of credit to small farmers to enable them to buy more land.  There are one or two difficulties in regard to this.  One is that land coming on the market might comprise a very big estate which no individual small farmer could contemplate bidding for.  That situation could be met by the Land Commission using their existing powers of acquisition and subsequently dividing the land into lots and reselling these lots to smallholders who could avail of the land purchase corporation to which I have referred. To my mind this would be a better system than the present time-consuming and expensive process of interviewing everybody within a radius of one mile and drawing up a scheme of allocation.  Also, the process of reselling would involve much less administrative expense on the part of the Land Commission thereby leaving available more money for the provision of facilities to farmers.</P>
    <P>This, too, would be beneficial in that it would involve the extension of credit, and it would sort out those who were genuinely interested in becoming competitive farmers from those who might be merely seeking land as a form of security for their old age.  This proposal should be considered.  I am not putting it forward as one that is perfect but any method that we can devise of enabling small farmers to extend their holdings or of enabling landless men to acquire land, is worth considering.  It is these people who should be put at the top of our priority list.  This proposal would enable them to acquire reasonably sized holdings and not merely five-acre plots.  If there are objections to this proposal, as I am sure there will be, I shall be glad to hear them.  I know that it is not a watertight proposal but it is one that merits some consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider this motion to be a good one and one that should be supported fully.  In order to deal properly with this motion, it may be <Col N="1288" /> necessary to go slightly outside the scope of it.  The Land Commission are a body who are criticised on all sides.  I believe that even if Solomon were at their head, he, in his wisdom, would fail to satisfy the demands of everybody in regard to land division. It has not been possible to fulfil the demands of any generation in so far as land is concerned and I believe that the position will be worse in the future. However, the Land Commission are well able to cope with whatever criticism is levelled at them but there are two main bones of contention that arise in relation to the Land Commission. One is their present policy &mdash;I do not know whether it is actual policy but it is happening&mdash;and that is that when they acquire an estate they hold it for far too long.  There are many delays in dividing estates.  I know this from my own constituency.  Lands there have been held by the Land Commission for four, five and six years.</P>
      <P>When land goes on the market, local smallholders pay a high rent for it on the 11 months system in the hope that the Land Commission will recognise their claim to it.  The Land Commission are paying fairly high prices for land and for that reason they may let it for a number of years in order to recoup their investment.  They get high rents to offset their costs.  The long delays in allocating the land lead to criticism of their policy.</P>
      <P>The second bone of contention is the method of payment for land, that is, payment in land bonds.  I would go so far as to say that it is decidedly dishonest for the Land Commission to pay for land with land bonds.  They may find that they are so tied to this policy that they cannot change it. When the land bonds are sold, after a period the farmer finds that he gets only £70 or £60 for his £100.  If an ordinary person acquires land from a neighbour and if there is a delay of six months or a year or two years before he pays for it, and if he then pays £60 instead of £100, or £600 instead of £1,000, or £6,000 instead of £10,000, he finds himself in the High Court for breach of contract.  I do not see why this should not apply to the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> I read that a Wicklow county councillor said that land bonds are comparable to soap papers.  I would be willing to exchange a lot of soap papers for land bonds at any time with whoever made that suggestion.  I hope that the policy of the Land Commission will be changed and that people will be paid in cash for their land.  I have not an acre of land of my own, but if I had I certainly would not sell it to the Land Commission if they were to pay me in land bonds, because I would feel I would not be paid in full. Many people would be more than willing to facilitate the Land Commission by selling them land but they are reluctant to do so if they are to be paid in land bonds.  This policy will have to be changed if the Land Commission are to function properly.  I realise that the Minister is investigating this matter and I would ask him to come up with some solution with regard to paying for land in cash.  This would speed up the acquisition of land.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission come in for much criticism but from what I have seen of their work I believe much of that criticism is unjustifiable.  They are doing quite a good job.  Indeed, I would go so far as to say they are doing an excellent job on limited resources. The men, the labourers, the lorry-drivers, the men in the offices, the men in Dublin, are doing a very good job.  The houses provided by the Land Commission are good houses.</P>

      <P>I am speaking for Laois and Offaly and the houses there are excellent.  The outbuildings provided are also good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion we are discussing proposes that the claims of local smallholders and local deserving applicants should be satisfied before persons from outside areas are considered.  It is desirable that the demands of local deserving applicants should be satisfied. When people grow up in an area and get to know the land, they have a love for it.  They are anxious to live in that area, and that their families should live there too.  When a suitable and <Col N="1290" /> attractive farm comes on the market and the Land Commission take it and bring in somebody from an area 40 or 50 miles away this leads to dissatisfaction and unrest.  Sometimes it leads to many of the problems associated with land division.  For this reason the claims of the local people should be satisfied first.</P>
    <P>When people have been farming in an area they know the land.  They know the crops that are suitable, the types of manures that are necessary, the type of sheep which thrive there, and the breeds of cattle that are suitable. It is a matter of getting to know the heart, and the feel, and the tilth of the land.  Therefore a local person is in a better position to make the best use of the land in his own area.  When people come in from outside it takes them a number of years to realise the potential and the quality of the land. Therefore the most beneficial use is not made of the land for a number of years.  The claims of the local smallholders and deserving applicants should be satisfied before outsiders are brought in.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware, the mile limit is still Land Commission policy.  Unless a person is living within one mile of the land he does not qualify for an allotment.  The mile limit should be waived.  I would extend it to approximately five miles.  This would give the Land Commission much greater scope.  I would go no further than that. They would know that an estate was suitable for allotment and they could allot it.  Sometimes there may be other estates around the area and if the Land Commission could go outside the one mile limit they might be able to divide land in a more equitable way.  The one mile limit should be abolished.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to people such as agricultural contractors and cottage dwellers with only cottage gardens who are engaged full-time in agriculture. I believe it is Land Commission policy that unless a person has five acres of land in his own name he will not be considered for an allotment of land.  I believe there have been exceptions to this.  About an hour ago I wrote to the Secretary of the Land Commission about a particular case. <Col N="1291" /> The person about whom I wrote has no land in his own name.  He is 33 to 35 years of age and he is engaged full-time in agriculture.  He lives in a council house and has a cottage garden. He takes land on the 11 months system and competes on the open market with farmers for this land.  He has a wife and three children and they are living very well.  He has nothing except the acre of land attached to his cottage.  I believe that where a person has no means of livelihood except farming, even though he has no farm of his own, he should certainly be considered by the Land Commission for a farm.</P>
    <P>I am reasonably in agreement with the Minister when he says that in the west of Ireland it is desirable that there should be part-time farmers, that industries should be provided so that a farmer with a small portion of land could have a job in a factory as well.  I must say that people who are full-time in agriculture and have no land have a prior claim to land and should certainly he considered.  They would certainly come in under this motion as being &ldquo;local deserving applicants&rdquo;. The Land Commission have their officials around the country and they are in close communication with the farmers. They are, I hope, working closely with the committees of agriculture and they should have a good knowledge of all the people in an area who are engaged full-time in agriculture.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Land Commission some months ago about the person I mentioned a while ago and I was told that as he had no land he could hardly be considered but I think a person engaged full-time in agriculture should certainly come under the heading &ldquo;local deserving applicants&rdquo; even though he has no land in his own name. This rule should be fully considered and only people who are engaged full-time in agriculture should be allowed in under this heading.  In regard to the Minister's point about small farmers being engaged part-time in jobs and part-time as farmers, I can see merit in that for the west of Ireland where it would not be as practicable to live on a 40 acre farm as on a 40 acre <Col N="1292" /> farm, say, in March, Offaly, Laois or Tipperary.  It would not be of the same value and, therefore, a farmer with 40 acres in the west would require some further income.  He would require a job as well and the Land Commission would have to facilitate him.</P>
    <P>I believe that farms should be approximately 60 to 70 acres because nowadays it is almost impossible to make a living on anything under 60 acres.  I am in full agreement with the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan) Sean Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is obviously a great deal of common ground between myself and the Members who put down the motion and who have spoken in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>I should like to say clearly at the beginning that it is, and has been, the firm policy of the Land Commission all down the years to give preference to local, deserving smallholders and also to dispossessed tenants of landlords and in the implementation of this policy particulars of all smallholders living in the vicinity of the land are invariably obtained before-hand by the local inspectors and it is only when provision has been made for all deserving local applicants and displaced employees that consideration is given to the introduction of any others.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to emphasise that fact clearly at the outset and, perhaps, to reiterate what Deputy Bruton said&mdash; that 60 per cent of the land divided in Meath over the past five years has been given to local applicants.  Of an aggregate of 10,678 acres divided in that county since 1965, 6,206 acres, or 60 per cent roughly, went to local applicants.  Deputy Tully also represents Meath and he is the mover of this motion.  Deputy Kavanagh, who represents Wicklow, will be interested to know that during the same period the percentage was 65 for his county. It is clear that what is at issue here is what is &ldquo;local&rdquo; and what is &ldquo;deserving&rdquo; and it is on the definition of the word &ldquo;local&rdquo; that the debate has so far taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of the 1923 Land Act the Land Commission are <Col N="1293" /> obliged to satisfy themselves that prospective allottees are capable of working land and intend to do so and it is for the purpose of meeting these requirements that all local people are visited and particulars taken in regard to the property which they own, their family circumstances probed and evaluated <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to say that this is a duty that is conscientiously discharged by the lay commissioners and I am glad that Deputy Enright and others have paid tribute to the fairmindedness of the commissioners on whom the ultimate responsibility rests for making decisions. I am personally satisfied, as Minister, and as Deputy before that, that the commissioners do their very best to be fair, having studied the different circumstances of the various applicants for land.</P>
    <P>Obviously there are all sorts of considerations, including in particular marital status, because the fundamental aim of the commission all along has been to preserve the family farm.  One can envisage circumstances in the future and, perhaps, the proximate future, when events in this country will tend to push aside the family farm for the business.  I think that was in Deputy L'Estrange's mind when he spoke of the speculator, the entrepreneur, the person who has never been associated with farming.  Indeed, this is already happening in Ireland.  There are signs of such a trend rather than something which one can instance as having happened in one or two places.  This brings one back to the wider fact that land is a volatile entity and, while it is static, its importance in a community is constantly changing.  Its relevance and importance in localities is also changing with changing national and local circumstances.</P>
    <P>Dealing on a narrower basis with the functions of the Land Commission, I have mentioned first deserving local applicants.  Anybody who has served even a few months in this House knows that, as Deputy Enright said, even Solomon would not be able to satisfy everybody in deciding who is and who is not deserving.  Many a day he or Deputy Bruton or anybody else who is in this House for the first time has <Col N="1294" /> already been cooped up in a corner being convinced by A that he should get land as the only person properly qualified for it and five minutes later another neighbour, B, comes in with, according to him, a better case for not giving it to A but for giving it to B &mdash;&ldquo;it was a half-holding with his in the grandmother's time and they divided&rdquo;&mdash;you can ring the changes on this, that and the other.  Accepting the fact that there is not enough land to satisfy all the people who want it&mdash; and it is from that premise that every Deputy must argue and discuss everything concerning the activities of the Land Commission&mdash;you will realise that, no matter what any commission does, not all deserving applicants can always be accommodated. It is also important to remember that property has its rights as well as its duties, if I may invert the famous phrase.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is an appropriate stage to mention the migrants and the rights of people who are given land as migrants or as people qualifying for additions.  This has agitated Deputy Tully's mind at Question Time and in this debate&mdash;the fact that somebody is given land, that it is vested in him almost immediately and that thereafter he is free to do as he likes with it. Experience in regard to migrants has been extremely favourable judging by statistics over the past 35 or 40 years or so.  A survey of the Gaeltacht colonies in County Meath carried out a few years ago showed that out of the original total of 122 holdings allotted, 106 were still in the ownership of the people who were originally given them, or their immediate family successors. Two were resumed by the Land Commission and reallotted, one of them to a migrant's son so that only 14 of the holdings involved had changed hands by sale and of these six were bought by other colonists.  I think this represents a very satisfactory effort on the part of the migrants and a very small turnover in land so allocated over 25 or 30 years.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that land should be given to those people by way of addition or on migration other than on a permanent basis.  I am not attracted by the idea of giving land temporarily <Col N="1295" /> on lease or on a conditional basis.  I do not think this would be acceptable to the people themselves.  Once the decision is made the land ought to be vested in the allottees and the obligations as well as the rights of ownership immediately conferred on them.  In the cases mentioned by Deputy Tully at Question Time today and yesterday when he spoke of migrants who were vested and occupied holdings only for a few years and then cleared off, this is a hazard the Land Commission must face and if you accept that it is not a good idea to allocate land other than in fee simple you must take the risk that ultimately a small proportion of those concerned will abandon the holdings.  The Land Commission would have their reserved rights to go after these holdings again as they have done in the cases I have cited in regard to the Gaeltacht colony in County Meath.</P>
    <P>It is also important to realise that these owners may have had unfortunate family circumstances and may not have been able, through bad luck or some other reason, to make a success of the holding.  They may have gone to England to try to accumulate sufficient capital to restock.  One must have compassion for these people when this happens.  They also have rights as owners and it is only fair that the Commissioners, in such circumstances, should give them a year or two or three or perhaps five years, depending on individual circumstances, to rehabilitate themselves so as to return and make a success of the holding which the commission were satisfied they were entitled to receive in the first place.</P>
    <P>This also applies in congested areas where land hunger involves people almost in land-grabbing attempts. Owners as well as those who are looking over the wall have rights and if a family have survived for generations in a particular smallholding and if they wish to get a chance to go away for a number of years to build up funds to capitalise their work.  I should be the last to suggest that they should not have it.</P>
    <P>We then come to the question of what is local.  That is perhaps the <Col N="1296" /> larger of the two issues here because most speakers who contributed have suggested that this one-mile limit is (a) sacrosanct and (b) improper.  First, it is not sacrosanct; it is not a rigid limit and policy is sufficiently elastic to cater for some who may be marginally over the limit.  In addition, where a pocket of congestion is found outside a mile from an estate it can be dealt with from time to time by migration of one or more smallholders in the estate and dividing their surrendered land among the remaining deserving holders.</P>
    <P>It will be agreed that some limit must be placed on the distance a farmer should have to travel between his existing farm and any addition and the ideal distance cannot be calculated by slide rule.  It is a matter for argument.  It has been placed by Deputy Bruton at five miles and by somebody else at three miles.  It could be one, two, three or five miles depending on the point of view of the person making the case.  Some, indeed, argue that the mile limit is too generous.  It is a frequent experience of the Land Commission that the number of deserving smallholders within the mile limit is too large to be accommodated with the amount of land available and in those instances very hard decisions have often to be made as to whom to select and whom to omit.</P>
    <P>I hold the old-fashioned idea that the mile is long enough.  I hold to the old idea that to keep the parent holding and the additional parcel as close together as possible is the optimum aim.  All my experience in my own county and locality suggests that this is so.  I know of many additions of land that have been given to people in my locality at home, in other parts of the county and in other counties which have simply not been adequately worked that were considerably under five miles away and some of them under one mile away.  It is important to remember that one of the reasons for this is that whatever about the increase in the speed of mechanical transport, the walking pace of a cow has not changed within the past 50 years and it is unlikely to change in the next 50 years either.  In fact, the growth of <Col N="1297" /> motor traffic and the necessity to eliminate possible road hazards has indeed added a further reason why there should be the minimum distance if the animals have to travel on the highway.</P>
    <P>Deputies should be aware of the concern of the Department of Local Government and all planning authorities who are actively discouraging the creation of farm openings leading directly on to main roads.  The farmer has his own interests to consider in this matter and Deputies will be aware possibly of the recent legal decision when a farmer was held accountable for the skidding conditions created by his stock on a road adjacent to his farm buildings.  Deputy Enright and others will be particularly interested in that.</P>
    <P>It has been found, looking at this whole matter from an economic point of view, that there has been a significant increase in costs as well when the distance between the holding and the parcel lengthens.  There was a survey carried out in Europe recently which revealed that while the covering of the distance was quicker the costs of the transport, investment, amortisation, management, repairs and maintenance are very high and the financial expenditure significant.  It was found by the researchers that what they called this unproductive waste reduced efficiency and could only be cured by improving structure, in other words, by making the farm more compact. Indeed my attention was recently drawn to a letter from an applicant seeking an exchange for a holding in County Clare.  This holding was in four lots, two being some three miles away from his farmhouse.  His own words were &ldquo;With help so hard to get it was a great waste of time getting to and from the land.&rdquo; I do not have to tell rural Deputies how difficult it is to get any kind of help for agricultural purposes at the present time.</P>
    <P>These considerations apart, isolated parcels of land create minor problems, including the difficulty of protecting it against trespass and other damage.  The further away the parcel is the more those problems increase both in number and in scale.  It is because of all these considerations that the Land Commission <Col N="1298" /> opted for the mile as the limit&mdash; not sacrosanct limit but general limit&mdash; for the allocation of land to local smallholders. In that way they have also adopted some reasonable balance between all the various factors involved, the desires of local people and of others who may consider themselves equally entitled.</P>
    <P>The motion obviously is directed largely at the allotment of holdings to migrants from my part of the country and other western areas to Meath and other eastern areas.  Again, I must state that it is only when all the local deserving claimants are accommodated, based on the criteria that I have mentioned, that migrants are introduced at all.  The Land Commission, after all, are the national land settlement agency operating on a countrywide basis and their concern about the improvement of land structure must be directed particularly to the areas in the west where conditions are bad in the extreme.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I could illustrate this situation. Out of a total of 62,700 farms in Connaught some 37,000 odd or 60 per cent are less than 30 acres in extent. This position is grievously affected by the fact that the land is poor and on top of that there is the additional problem of widespread fragmentation. Look then at the statistics for, say, County Meath.  Out of almost 6,000 farms in that county, 2,000, or 34 per cent, are less than 30 acres. Here the land is uniformly good and fragmentation virtually non-existent. The corresponding figures for County Wicklow are 2,700 holdings and some 550 or 20 per cent of the total under 30 acres.  Deputies will appreciate the conditions in the western areas are extreme and warrant exceptional measures for land structural improvement. Western Deputies know how difficult it is for the Land Commission to acquire for purchase anything like the quantity of land required for land settlement purposes in the west in general.  The migration process over the years has added significantly to the pool of available land and very frequently the migration of some of the existing landowners is the only possible way to effect any improvement <Col N="1299" /> in the congestion and fragmentation conditions in the west.</P>
    <P>This is and has been the justification of the migration policy but I am conscious of the very strong hardening of opinion in the east against migrants at this stage.  I have been told this not merely in the House but outside the House, not merely by Members of the House but also by people who are not Members but who are interested.</P>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange referred to the fact that I am not particularly in favour of the continuance of migration from the west if a better solution to the problem of the western areas can be found.  Deputy L'Estrange very fairly accepts that it is an obligation to provide a form of livelihood alternative to additional land for the people in the west if migration is to be discontinued. I suppose it is reasonable to say that whatever land is on hands in the Land Commission at the present time, and acquired originally for the purpose of accommodating migrants, should be used for that purpose.  In that connection the Land Commission I hope will not have to put up with bullying tactics from rapacious locals who band themselves together, some and only some, prepared to work within the law.</P>
    <P>I am aware of and I sympathise with the situation people in Meath and Wicklow find themselves in, but they must remember there are other parts of the country besides Meath and Wicklow and other people have rights besides the people of Meath and Wicklow. Having regard to the relations which have developed over the years between migrants and the people who receive them so kindly it would be a great shame if that record were endangered by any extremist activity either in the east or elsewhere.  The aim is that migration should be phased out and I cannot offer any better assurance to the House than that.  I consider it unlikely that any land acquired by the Land Commission in future will be put to use for migrant purposes. On the other hand, I think it most likely, once existing holdings marked <Col N="1300" /> out for migrants have been allocated to them either as co-operative or group migrants, that then any additional land that becomes available will be allocated to them.  I hope that that will satisfy those Deputies who have put down this motion.  I think I am running out of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>One other matter I want to deal with is the question of landless men.  As the price of land has increased so greatly in a short time and appears likely to continue to increase, the pressure for additional land from people already farming in some capacity is going to increase.  Landless men have always had a very low place in the priority list and if these are to be elevated to an equal status with existing holders the position will be chaotic.  I cannot hold out any real hope that such a fundamental and radical change in Land Commission policy will take place.  It would multiply the Land Commission's difficulties and make their situation impossible. It is already being made very difficult by some of the factors I have mentioned and it would be impossible if landless men, merely because they were interested in farming, were to be made one of the prime objects of the Land Commission's attention.  Landless men must be accommodated in some other capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not say the same thing about the conacre farmers mentioned here.  The conacre farmer is a rare bird in our part of the country, but I am well aware of the situation in Westmeath. Meath and to some extent Kildare. Conacre farmers are a different matter and I think it is fair to say it would be in accordance with European thinking if these men were to get special consideration.  I would certainly not include them in the same category as landless men, even though they are technically landless within the definition of &ldquo;landless&rdquo; in our present policy.  As they have made their livelihood <Col N="1301" /> exclusively out of agriculture for a period of years I feel special consideration must be given to them in the circumstances.  It is quite true that I recently interviewed some people directly involved or affected in this regard.  I can assure the House I have every possible sympathy with them.  I accept they have made their livelihood out of farming and they support their wives and children from farming but as things stand at the moment they do not qualify but this is certainly something which should be examined.</P>
    <P>While I can accept the motion as it stands, subject to what I have said in the course of my remarks, if we were to expand &ldquo;local&rdquo; to include landless people and expand the area to five miles the work of the Land Commission would become impossible. Having regard to the fact that the pool of land available in counties like Meath is steadily declining anyway and the possibility of getting it at a price which would be economic to pass on with a full or half annuity is also becoming more difficult; indeed, from the point of view of discrimination between those entitled to half annuity and the full annuity is possibly not justified.  It is another matter on which I would be prepared to have a second look.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A colleague of mine now departed from this world used to say, &ldquo;I can look after my enemies, the Lord save me from my friends&rdquo;, and listening to Deputy Bruton this evening I am afraid I cannot go the whole way with a number of the points he put up. While supporting the idea he created Aunt Sallies which we have knocked down and I must spend some of the time.  I have knocking down the remainder of them.  He made the mistake of considering that I was thinking of the continuation of migration from the west or elsewhere at the same time as I was talking about giving land to people who live further than half a mile or a mile from an estate.  Nothing could be further from my mind.  The first thing which must be done is that the Land Commission must start beside the estate&mdash;by that I mean the nearest point to it whether it is along the road or across the fields&mdash;the Land Commission <Col N="1302" /> have, from time to time, proved that roads are easily made&mdash;and allocate land to deserving people.</P>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Minister for the statement he has made here this evening which goes a long way towards what Deputy Bruton.  Deputy L'Estrange, Deputy Kavanagh and myself would like to see happening.  He was, I think, again misunderstanding something.  He was under the impression that we were saying people who had no land at all should be placed on an equal footing with people looking for enlargement of their holdings. That is not so.  Landless men, leaving aside the conacre farmer and the dairy farmer who has built up a dairy by taking grass, would be satisfied if they got a small portion of land.  The Minister will remember a deputation which Deputy Hilliard, Deputy Bruton and I took to him.  One of the men on that deputation lived slightly over half a mile from the estate but he had no land.  He worked at a job and out of whatever money he was able to spare he bought several cows and calves and he was taking a letting of land on the estate.  The official of the Land Commission told me they considered he was a very deserving young man but he was more than half a mile from the estate, he was something like 100 yards beyond it, and he was ruled out by some of the other people on the deputation who, because they were farmers living within a mile of the estate, were considered.</P>
      <P>If the Land Commission feel that five miles is too far they should start beside the estate and go around in a circle and decide when they have enough deserving applicants to allocate the land to.  I am not attempting to lay down a regulation that they must interview everyone within five miles.  What I am saying is that the way land should be allocated is to start from the estate itself and go outwards until they get the necessary number of people. Landless men will be satisfied with a smaller portion of land.  Farmers who want an addition should get that addition to bring them up to a reasonable standard.  The conacre farmers and those who have built up dairy herds should also get land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had an experience with the Minister's <Col N="1303" /> predecessor in the case of a man who had built up from scratch a substantial dairy herd.  He had been working in a factory and the doctor advised him that he should get an outdoor job. He started off with two cows and, as I say, he eventually built up a herd of 30 cows.  Farms were divided all around him but he would not be considered because the Minister's predecessor said a dairy farmer was not a farmer.  I do not know how he worked that one out.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about cows not being able to walk any faster than they did 30 years ago.  With modern methods they do not need to be brought home in the evening time because they are accommodated on the land.  The dairy farmer should get some portion of any land that is going.  Certainly he should not be ignored.</P>
    <P>We are talking about some temporary arrangement.  The Minister must bring in legislation to straighten out a number of things.  He must in equity bring in a regulation which will straighten out this question of half the annuity.  The present position is ludicrous.  It should never have been introduced.  It has caused ill-feeling because migrants pay half the annuity while the local people have to pay the full annuity.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise here that there is no animosity against migrants in my county and I am sure that is true of other counties as well.  Initially the fact that they were brought in was resented but there has been no animosity. They have been integrated with the local people.  We are all Irishmen. The extraordinary thing is that the migrants are the very people who are now strongest in agitating against the bringing in of any more migrants.  In this they are as one with the local people.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the half-mile or the mile is not sacrosanct.  I am sorry to disagree with him, but up to the present it has been sacrosanct. Someone lays on a tape measure and you are either inside or outside.  If the Minister now says to the Land Commission that this should not be so we are more than half way there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> The question as to whether or not there is enough land or where it will come from has been discussed here on numerous occasions, including the last two evenings.  We all know there is not enough land to go around but the land that is there should be divided fairly.  There are hundreds of thousands who will never get a piece of land or a full-sized farm because there are no large farms to be acquired and divided.  The people accept that. In the same way people must accept that there is not enough land to give everybody a full-sized farm.  When people here talk about 60 acres or 70 acres as the correct size of a viable farm they are talking so much hot air.  It would be very nice if everybody could have a farm of 60 or 70 acres, but I have known people to make a good living on a great deal less land than that simply because they used it properly.  With modern methods of husbandry I do not see any reason why many more could not make a good living on quite small holdings.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to five miles. I can tell him that there are people taking grazing land and conacre much farther than five miles away, travelling happily to it and glad to have it.  I grant you the annuity, particularly in Meath, is very, very high.  I believe the people taking conacre are paying a good deal more and, while they say they can give up the land if they are not making anything out of it, at the same time, if the annuities were reduced to what was agreed at the end of the Economic War, in other words, if the annuities were halved, that would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, there is no stronger force than the kind of land hunger which grips people in certain areas.  At the present moment it is causing some difficulty in my constituency and in a neighbouring constituency. It is creating something I have not seen since I was a small boy; it is breeding discontent, the kind of discontent which can often end in violence. I should hate to see that happen and I believe it can be prevented by the exercise of a little common sense on both sides.</P>

      <P>I have proved to the Minister that these people do not have two heads or wear horns.  If someone talks reasonably to them and agrees that certain of their claims are just, instead of just brushing them aside, saying we make the law and they must obey, this whole thing could be dealt with very easily.  It is not a political matter.  There are no votes in it for me, for Deputy Bruton or for Deputy Hilliard.  The late Deputy Paddy Giles used to say to anyone who took an interest in land division that they were fools because, if ten people got land and 90 people were disappointed, the 90 were one's enemies for life.  I personally believe the Land Commission have nothing to gain by giving concessions to Fianna Fáil, to Fine Gael or Labour.  I personally believe they do not set out to divide land on a political basis.  It is just too bad that sometimes it may appear that that is the case simply because a certain Deputy will go along and claim that he got the land for the people when, in fact, he did not.  Unfortunately we have in this House people who are not prepared to tell the truth, if the truth will deprive them of a few votes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will never for that reason and the Minister is aware of this, say that any man is a man who must get land.  I recommend him if he is worth recommending and I will give him whatever character I can.  It is then a matter for the officials to decide. There is no use in carrying out an investigation in an area and passing one person over for one reason or another. I was told some years ago&mdash;I am not sure if it happens now&mdash;that some officials tended to listen to the neighbour who might feel he was strengthening his own case by blackening the person who lived beside him.  I trust that is not continuing.  If it is then it is one of the reasons why there is a certain amount of irritation between people who live around an estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency, in both Kildare and Meath, there is still a good deal of land which could be acquired.  One of the reasons why migrants are so costly <Col N="1306" /> is that houses and outoffices have to be built for them and the land properly fenced.  If land were allocated to locals I am quite sure the whole process would cost a great deal less.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised that no other Fianna Fáil speaker intervened in this debate in view of what Deputy Davern said at Question Time.  This is not a political matter.  It affects everybody and I should like to hear rural Deputies expressing their views because that is the only way in which the Minister can get a grasp of what the real situation is throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to this question of 60 per cent of the land in Meath being given to Meath people. However, he has covered that by saying that he hopes that the present allocation will be the last.  Incidentally, I often wonder why any Minister for Lands would send his best supporters out of his constituency.  I know I would not if I were Minister.  I suggest that he should not proceed with the building of houses.  I know from discussions that I have had with some of these people that they do not want to come. Some years ago the mere suggestion that they would be entitled to get a farm in County Meath would send them rushing around preparing to move the next day.  That no longer is the case and very many of them come and look at the farms and then move off.  Indeed, it is very irritating for a man who lives beside a farm and is hoping to get a bit of it to see car load after car load of people looking at it and to hear them saying that they thought the land was better and that they are going to hold out for a better offer somewhere else when he would give his right eye to get it, such as it is.</P>
    <P>There is this question of whether these people are the best people to work the land and it should be looked at this way.  People reared in a district have either been working their own farms, or have been on their father's farm, or on neighbouring farms, and they know more about farming, particularly farming in that area, than anybody else and is there any reason why they should not be entitled to a bit of land to give them some security and a stake in the country?  In my <Col N="1307" /> job as a trade union official I meet quite a lot of people for whom the five day week was negotiated and after 12 months practically all of them were prepared to say that one of the best things they got for years was the free day on Saturday because if they had some land, or if they could get some land locally, they could make as much money from it as they would working for a week for somebody else.  It is a great thing to see this happening and every encouragement should be given to them.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to be very slow about saying that landless men have not got much of a chance.  Landless men, with the exception of people who are engaged directly in farming and own property, or stock, or rent a farm, are not expecting to get 30 or 40 acres but they do except that they should get a portion of the farm on which many of them work.  They should be entitled to portion of that farm and I appeal to the Minister to try to ensure that this will happen when farms are being divided.  Normally they are very reasonable people.  Some people have been ruled out on the grounds that they were working away from the area.  Working away from the area in my constituency means that a man gets up at about 6 o'clock in the morning and with four or five of his pals drives to Dublin to work on a building job and then returns home in the evening.  You would be amazed to find those people, their wives and children out working on land which they have taken because they have none of their own, in an effort to boost the family income.  There is no reason why people like that should be ruled out.  Up to now the idea has been that people working away from the area are not entitled to land, or if they are tradesmen they are not entitled to land.</P>
    <P>There is another thing which would help in this matter of having enough land available for the area.  As the Minister is aware, farms have been acquired and kept for many years and I suggest that the Land Commission make a resolution for the coming financial year that any land acquired before the start of the last financial year should be allocated immediately.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> I cannot see any reason for holding this land particularly as the Land Commission say they are losing money on it.  If I had something on which I was losing money I would get rid of it as quickly as possible.  There is no reason why the Land Commission should not save the State's money and save themselves annoyance by allocating the land much more quickly.  Another thing is that it would do no harm if the people who are to be allocated land were brought together by the commissioner and told what it is proposed to do, because very often I have met neighbouring farmers who were allocated land and one will say: &ldquo;I got this field and my friend got another one over there and if we could switch we would be much better off.&rdquo; If this has to be done through the Land Commission after the allocation it is a much bigger job.  I have referred to the man who was left without water because the person who was doing the allocation did not know the full facts.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to evicted tenants.  I do not think there are any left, certainly in my constituency, who would be claiming the right to get land.  The Minister said that they hoped to allocate land to married people. Recently it was brought to my attention that an estate was divided and one man complained that while he and his family&mdash;he is rather old&mdash;were not given any land three sons of his brother, who lived down the road, got land and the fourth was being offered a farm which had been refused by somebody else.  So much for the single man not getting land.  This is the sort of thing which causes annoyance in the area.  If somebody is being treated in a certain way then let us treat everybody else in the same way and there will be no quarrel.  When the Minister says that he will do something he has the courage to do it and he has been breaking away from what was considered standard Land Commission talk over the years and he has made a certain number of statements which have given encouragement to people like myself who have been attempting to do something about land division. He has said that the Land Commission propose to change the system and I will be glad to see that done but I <Col N="1309" /> would appeal to him to forget about this limit of half a mile or a mile or whatever it is and to have his inspectors start on the inside and allocate out as far as the land goes.  If they do that nobody will quarrel with it.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to thank the Minister for the way in which he has met this motion.  Some years ago, during the period of office of a different Government, I had a similar motion down on which there was a free vote and there was a rather strange selection of people in both Lobbies when the vote was over.  Anyway we lost and the situation did not change.  If the Minister makes the alteration as he proposes to do he will have the co-operation not alone of Deputies on these benches, and I am sure on the Fine Gael benches, but also of the people who he and his officials may feel are starting a kind of uprising against them.  As soon as the people realise they are going to be met fairly with regard to land division there will be no further trouble.  As I have stated publicly before, I will support their claims as far as I can as long as they stay within the law.  Most of them do stay within the law but certain people have attached themselves to these organisations and have given the impression that they are spokesmen for them when they had no right to do so.  Also certain people have taken advantage of the fact that the organisation is in the area to break the law and try to get the blame put on the organisation, or they have tried to get what they could out of the organisation.  In the main, however, these are decent hard-working people who are entitled to a fair share of what is going and I am glad that the Minister appears to be prepared now to give it to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956, which was enacted for a period of three years and <Col N="1310" /> has been renewed at the end of each three-year period, will expire on 31st March, 1971.  The purpose of this Bill is to continue the 1956 Act in force until 31st March, 1974.</P>
    <P>The Act empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce to prohibit by order the export of industrial goods save under a licence issued by him. Such orders have a life of 12 months only and may be annulled by Resolution of either House of the Oireachtas at any time during this period.  Control is at present in force on a range of goods under the Control of Exports Order, 1971, and the Control of Exports (Southern Rhodesia) Order, 1970.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to continue these powers for a further period and to enact the appropriate legislation. Control continues to be necessary for the following purposes:</P>
    <P>(a)  to conserve supplies of scarce raw materials (e.g. scrap metals), for the benefit of home industry;</P>
    <P>(b)  to ensure that strategic materials are not exported from this country to undesirable destinations or that this country is not used as a base for such trade from elsewhere;</P>
    <P>(c)  to implement the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement which requires, <i>inter alia,</i> control on exports to the United Kingdom of textile goods containing cotton;</P>
    <P>(d)  to comply with the mandatory resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council requiring member States to prevent the exportation of goods to Southern Rhodesia;</P>
    <P>(e)  to have immediately available a means of dealing with any emergency which might denude the country of essential materials before corrective legislation could be enacted.</P>
    <P>For the reasons mentioned I commend this Bill to the favourable consideration of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a continuance Bill, of course, and the original Bill was introduced by the late William Norton.  The then Opposition raised <Col N="1311" /> no objection to the Bill and whether there will be any opposition here will rest on whether or not the Minister is prepared to give full information on the Committee Stage on everything he might desire to do apart from what he has given us on the Second Reading.</P>
      <P>The Minister has the power to prohibit the export of any industrial goods and the reasons given are quite valid, that we must conserve certain supplies of raw materials.  I would like to deal with the example given by the Minister at subparagraph (a) of the Minister's circulated speech, namely, scrap metals.  This has been discussed in the House in relation to the price of scrap metals to Irish Steel Holdings. It was my duty as spokesman for my party on Industry and Commerce to examine that situation and to consider the representations made to me and to others in relation to the suggestion that the price of such scrap metals was inadequate and that there was a closed shop in respect of one supplier.</P>
      <P>I came to the conclusion at that time that the assembly and the separation of scrap metals into their various items was a highly expensive operation and that Members of this House would have great difficulty in deciding whether or not the prices given were in fact unjust to small suppliers.  However, these provisions are to be used for a different reason, that is, to stop the people sending scrap metals out of the country to provide a better price for themselves rather than send them to the only place to which they could send them here, namely, Irish Steel Holdings.</P>
      <P>The question then arises&mdash;and I make this point not in any spirit of criticism but in a spirit of mature examination&mdash;as to whether or not the assembly of scrap metals perhaps in England and shipping them to Irish Steel Holding might be an operation which would be so costly that it would not be practicable and that we must conserve our supplies of scrap metal, notably scrap motor cars, which is a great source of supply for use by Irish Steel Holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That immediately raises the question, <Col N="1312" /> if it is prohibitive to buy scrap metals at the going price around the city of Liverpool and ship them by coaster to Irish Steel Holding in Cork, why is it not prohibitive to assemble them here and ship them to a company in Britain operating on the same basis as Irish Steel Holdings?  This is a question that I cannot answer, because I am not qualified to do so.  It is a question that somebody with a technical knowledge of the trade would have to answer.  If you ask me about drying wheat, handling grain or about various other aspects of industry I would be able to give an opinion here which, whether right or wrong, would be based on a certain amount of experience and knowledge of a particular business.  In this matter all I have to go on as spokesman for the Opposition is the Act of 1956, the debates in the bound volumes on that particular Act and a momentary examination of the intentions of the Minister as outlined in his opening remarks.</P>
    <P>This matter must be examined clinically and both the Government and the Opposition must consider the representations made to them and make their judgment upon them.  They must then come in here on the Committee Stage and state honestly their opinion on this question.  Of course this Bill is tied up with the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and must go in 1974.  We must decide whether or not it is wise to take the Minister's example and use it as a headline in relation to his activities under the Control of Exports Act which we are continuing.</P>
    <P>I note from subparagraph (b) the Minister wants to ensure that strategic materials are not exported from this country to undesirable destinations and that this country is not used as a base for such trade from elsewhere.  This is entirely acceptable to anyone.  What might or might not be acceptable would be the definition of an undesirable commodity.  The State might be at variance with the Government in this respect.  My view is that the Government, with all their shortcomings, have been elected by the people. Therefore, if we are operating as a democracy in relation to subparagraph (b), the Government must make that decision.  It is for the people to decide <Col N="1313" /> whether or not it is a fair decision and at the next election they can cast their vote against the Government if they are not satisfied with their decision and if they consider the matter is serious enough to merit changing their vote, namely, whether they, in respect of any commodity, stopped the export order from here on the basis that it was going to an undesirable location or was a commodity that was undesirable to go to any location, then let the people decide.  It is for the Opposition to uncover any action that might attract criticism.</P>
    <P>Point (c) is something that must be considered in a more serious manner. At the moment, there is redundancy in our textile trade.  There is also rationalisation but as we approach the end of the term of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, we must accept that rationalisation is necessary. It may not be pleasant but it is necessary. Because of redundancy in the textile trade, I would ask the Minister whether he has considered items in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, notably the item whereby we can impose tariffs, if we so wish, on 3 per cent of our industrial imports. This is something that might help. Also, a further section where, bilaterally, there could be a change.  I would ask the Minister, too, whether it is correct that every section of this agreement, which was signed some years ago by people who were so brilliant, which gave power for adjustment has not been invoked on even one occasion?  I speak in no sense of criticism of the various people who signed that agreement.  The former Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, and the present Minister for Foreign Affairs were involved, as was the Taoiseach.  However, while I am not criticising these men in any way, they are not infallible.  They did what they considered was best at the time, but if it is true that there are sections of that agreement which give opportunity for bilateral or unilateral adjustment and if it is proved that the estimates made were incorrect, should these not have been used by the Government, particularly in our situation as a small trading nation as far as industrial goods are concerned while Britain is <Col N="1314" /> such a large trading nation, and when we are in the position of being one of Britain's best customers?  Therefore, I wonder about the automatic application of a section of that agreement through the continuance of this particular piece of legislation, without considering whether the provisions signed on the first occasion should not have been varied by the other sections of the agreement that permit of unilateral or bilateral adjustment.</P>
    <P>We subscribe to the United Nations and, therefore, I presume we must take our policy from them and decide not to export goods to Southern Rhodesia. I have no fault to find with that.  There may be people in the House who have but it is my opinion that, as the world becomes smaller, we must involve ourselves and commit ourselves.  Indeed, we have already done this by our various trading, economic, social and other associations with the UN as well as the EEC, by the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, the European Free Trade Association and other international agreements.  Therefore, I suggest that point 5 (d) is one that we must accept because since we have subscribed to the mandatory resolution of the United Nations Security Council, we must act accordingly.  I should not like to see this country shirking its international obligations.</P>
    <P>Point 5 (e) is an interesting one. This is that we are:</P>
    <P>to have immediately available a means of dealing with any emergency which might denude the country of essential materials before corrective legislation could be enacted.</P>
    <P>That was a wise provision.  I suppose it is not really a provision but merely indicates what powers are in the Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1956 which it is proposed here not to amend but merely to continue until 1974.  We might have had the Sheiks of Araby denying us oil during the last few weeks and, in such a situation, it would be imperative that the Government would retain all the oil that is in the country, also, that our stock of oil would be directed towards essential services.</P>
    <P>This Act does not deal with the direction of essential commodities, such <Col N="1315" /> as oil, towards essential services but, of course, there is such legislation on the Statute Book.  However, the position is that the Government of 1956&mdash;I note that the Bill was acually introduced in 1955&mdash;did not find an Opposition at that time that was critical of the Bill. Rather, they found an Opposition that let the Bill through without amendment. However, we are living in different times; we are living in the time of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and surely there should have been changes in certain of the Articles of that Agreement?  However, I mention this merely in passing.</P>
    <P>As spokesman for Industry and Commerce for the main Opposition Party I want to say that we have examined the argument in relation to scrap metals and have found that there is no great dishonesty or great advantage resulting to anybody in this regard and that the assembly of scrap metal and the taking of one type of scrap metal from, say, a wrecked car is a highly expensive operation.  However, it seems to me that if we are to regulate the supply of scrap metal to our one and only large steel foundry and if we are then to place the supply of that metal in the hands of one agent and if we are to follow that up by invoking the powers of the Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956, and if the Minister indicates that scrap metal is one of the commodities that will not be allowed to be exported surely then the question arises as to whether scrap metals are becoming available to one of our nationalised industries or semi-State industries at a price less than world price.  I am not quibbling with that.  I am not even saying it is wrong.</P>
    <P>Recently in a debate here relating to Irish Steel Holdings I said that the Fine Gael Party were 100 per cent behind the full employment of every worker in Irish Steel Holdings and would take legislative action if the Government wished or would, in fact, instigate legislative action if we felt it necessary to defend the last job there.  The example given by the Minister poses that question and I should like to have it answered on Committee Stage, if not tonight.  If it can be answered in a <Col N="1316" /> satisfactory manner tonight, I see no reason why this cannot have the same passage through the House as it had in 1956.</P>
    <P>I agree completely that we cannot have this country used as a point of transfer of undesirable goods or goods to undesirable sources.  That would fall within the ambit of our international obligations anyway.  I knew when I read this Continuance Bill that the phasing out of this legislation in 1974 is a result of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  I want to know now if any other legislation within the ambit of that agreement is contemplated by the Government in order to provide whatever protection is humanly possible within that agreement for existing jobs.  I am not asking too much and I am not being too difficult, I am not being querulous when I ask for these undertakings, because we are in an era of redundancies.</P>
    <P>I met a businessman today who said to me that we are at the top of the league again, that we have lost 1,000,000 work days through strikes. I said: &ldquo;Yes.  It is dreadful.  I hope it will not be the same this year.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;What I fear is that this year, 1971, will not be the year of strikes but the year of redundancies.&rdquo; If one were to take the period from 1st January until almost the end of March of this year as a headline in this regard, one could say that it has been the quarter of redundancies as opposed to any other quarter of any other year, perhaps, since the period when the Government got us out in 1957 when the international difficulties of the Suez crisis and the Korean War were used for a nefarious purpose, not beneath the Government opposite, who, like a certain lady in a play, are always prepared to stoop to conquer.</P>
    <P>I agree with paragraphs (d) and (e). I want undertakings, and I want assurances, and I want explanations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be interesting to know which other goods are covered by paragraph (a).  I know that scrap metal is referred to.  I have not to hand the Control of Exports Order, 1971, which gives other examples of products or materials specified <Col N="1317" /> under paragraph (a).  With regard to scrap metal I suppose there is a case if the only works in the country which utilise it can be assisted in any way by it.  As Deputy Donegan said, it may be true that a higher price could be got abroad for this material but if any advantage can accrue to our own home industry in this area, paragraph (a) is necessary and this prohibition on the export of this material is necessary.</P>
      <P>I am a bit curious about exactly which strategic materials are mentioned under paragraph (b) : to ensure that strategic materials are not exported from this country to undesirable destinations or that this country is not used as a base for such trade from elsewhere. What exactly do we mean by &ldquo;strategic materials&rdquo;?  I am curious about what strategic materials are in the country at the present time.  Is this simply the terminology of the original Act, or are any goods mentioned, or is it just a bit of necessary legalistic filling-in in the Act?  I should like the Minister to tell me what strategic materials may be in the official mind under this heading.</P>
      <P>Under paragraph (c) we behave ourselves and say that we will implement the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement which requires, <i>inter alia,</i> control on exports to the United Kingdom of textile goods containing cotton.  We are probably the best-behaved nation in the matter of living up to our obligations under international trading charters and so on.  We must be a byname by now in the current EEC negotiations as the most moral state in Europe in the matter of standing by the letter of the law in various agreements.</P>

      <P>To some extent I think some of our people confuse the clauses of the Treaty of Rome with the clauses of the Nicene Creed.  Here again we continue the same possibly admirable&mdash;I do not know&mdash;conduct in paragraph (c) and we carry out the terms of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know this is the review year for the agreement.  On all sides the effects of that agreement are now considered <Col N="1318" /> to be disastrous for certain large sections of Irish industry.  While carrying out this admirable record of being the good boys of Europe in relation to the way we keep international agreements, we might decide to look after our own interests also whilst preserving this image abroad.  Our own interests call for a review of the agreement at the earliest opportunity.  We need a review of the manner in which it is affecting the textile industry and the footwear industry.</P>
    <P>This point gives me the opportunity to remind the Minister of the necessity to consider which sections of Irish industry have been hardest hit by some parts of the agreement, and to consider the possibility of our not carrying out part of the agreement in reducing the tariffs by the necessary cuts.  The urgent situation facing a great deal of Irish industry calls for this.  It is no doctrinaire claim from our party when I make this suggestion because the Confederation of Irish Industries, in a recent pamphlet on the matter, expressed alarm at the extent to which the home market has been taken over by industrial competition from Britain.  At this moment the effect of the agreement is weakening our competitive position <i>vis-à-vis</i> whatever eventuates in the EEC.  So, it is sound common sense not to be so committed to the free trade concept that we go ahead under all the automatic provisions of the agreement.  We should be selfish at this stage and look after our own interests.</P>
    <P>This Government and this State have an obligation to look after our own interests.  The British or any other group abroad will not do it for us.  If we wish to preserve this Simon Pure approach to international agreements as they affect our trade let us do that but, at the same time, let us adopt Bernard Shaw's suggestion and trust in God but keep our powder dry.  We should attach this type of attitude towards all agreements that affect our vital interests.  At this moment our interests are being mauled by virtue of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  It was a disastrous agreement and it is now time to review it. We should not be in the least bit apologetic about reviewing the provisions <Col N="1319" /> which are harming us at present.</P>
    <P>In paragraph (d) we agree to comply with the mandatory resolutions adopted by the United Nations Security Council requiring member States to prevent the exportation of goods to Southern Rhodesia.  Of course we support this. I regret that there is no section here that asks us to comply with a similar United Nations resolution on trade with South Africa&mdash;an even bigger sinner in the matter of racist crime than Southern Rhodesia.</P>
    <P>I realise that this is a country that must search for trade wherever it can find it but the regime which exists in South Africa is one that is unique in the comity of nations, one which has elevated to a morality within that State the despicable doctrine of race hatred and race inferiority.  As we know, Europe took part in a second world war to defeat the ideology of racial superiority and yet this State in Africa supports this concept in 1971. It is a pity that this State here, which has been so loud in its profession of the necessity for law and order between nations, has not cut off what little trade we have with South Africa, boycotted trade with that country.</P>
    <P>Here, of course, we are merely following what the British are doing because of their struggle with the government of Rhodesia.  We are merely carrying out what the British are doing in relation to Southern Rhodesia and presumably if tomorrow morning the British changed their approach we would follow suit.  It is time that in this area, at least, we acted independently of others if, in fact, we are serious about our dislike of these racist policies.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5 (e) reads:</P>
    <P>to have immediately available a means of dealing with any emergency which might denude the country of essential materials before corrective legislation could be enacted.</P>
    <P>I get the impression that in this Bill there is a great deal of terminology which does not refer to any real things. <Col N="1320" /> I may be wrong in this but I would be interested if the Minister could tell me whether 5 (e) refers to any known material and whether, in fact, we have these &ldquo;stategic materials&rdquo; and what exactly, in the Minister's view, is an undesirable destination in the minds of the Government of this country at this time.  I would imagine there are certain countries in Europe at present who consider this country an undesirable destination for some strategic materials which have been imported into this country over the past year or two.  Perhaps the Minister would give us some information under those headings?</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome the manner in which the Bill has been received by the House.  It appears to be fully accepted that it is desirable to continue in force the Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act initially introduced in 1956.  Before I go any further I should like to clear up a misconception which Deputy Donegan appeared to have in relation to the fact that the Bill expires on 31st March, 1974.  This has nothing to do with the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and it has nothing to do with our entry into the EEC.  This Bill, originally introduced in 1956, is a three-year piece of legislation which has, every three years, been reintroduced and re-enacted.</P>

      <P>Deputy Donegan made a point, and Deputy O'Leary followed it up, regarding the danger that the prevention of the export of scrap creates a difficult situation where Irish Steel Holdings may be taking advantage to buy scrap at a limited price. Deputy Donegan suggested that the cost of assembling and collecting scrap is quite an expensive business and while <Col N="1322" /> it seems prohibitive to collect and assemble scrap in Liverpool and send it to Cork that, on the other hand, with the Minister for Industry and Commerce having to have legislation to prevent its export it followed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that there would be an outside market for it and therefore a better price could be got abroad and the price being paid by Irish Steel Holdings was not sufficient.  I do not know but I do not think this case has been made.  In fact, there has been a degree of criticism in recent years in connection with the various agencies for collection and the prices payable for various volumes or tonnages.  It may be helpful for me to say that this has been raised fairly regularly in the House over the last three or four years.  The last time it was raised by way of parliamentary question I made a reply similar to that made by my predecessor to the question suggesting that if the allegations were proper that the case should be referred to the Fair Trade Commission for examination. This has now happened.  The people making the complaint have submitted the case to the Fair Trade Commission which is pretty deeply involved in an inquiry at present which will take some time but I understand that the Fair Trade Commission will give its attention to this problem within a reasonable time and I would hope that it will clear up this issue.  I have no record of having positive complaints from collectors of scrap about the actual price paid except the complaint referred to, the differential in the prices paid for various volumes, but it was claimed that with the volume which only one man could supply the price was unsatisfactory.  I expect the Fair Trade Commission will be investigating and should resolve this knotty problem which has been worrying a number of people for a considerable time.  I do not think it has ever been contended that Irish Steel Holdings were not paying, across the board, sufficient money for scrap.  Scrap springs to mind most quickly and that is why it is specifically mentioned as the top example; it is the one of which we are most aware.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1323" /> Deputy O'Leary was anxious to know what strategic goods were.  There is a pretty wide range of strategic goods including arms and ammunition, fissionable material&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement were mentioned from the point of view of control of exports.

I want specifically to say that I was not talking about imports in relation to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  I was talking about the section of that agreement referred to by the Minister himself in relation to cotton.  I think of the textile workers in Loughrea and I wonder now when the Minister says that the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement has been under continuous review why it is that in this period of five years since we signed this Agreement, if there have been redundancies because of certain provisions of this Agreement which have been agreed by the Federation of Irish Industries and the Congress of Trade Unions, no action was taken.</P>

      <P>The reason for there being written into the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement at the time, the control that I mentioned here on the export of cotton-content goods which covers years, fabrics, household textiles and garments, containing 50 per cent or more of cotton, is that it affects goods going to Britain and the Six Counties.  It was introduced away back in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It was 1959, when the British at that stage expressed concern at the alleged extent of imports from this country of such goods containing cheap cotton from Asian sources, the content of the cheap cotton yarn going into items like textiles, garments, yarns and fabrics.  In fact, since that time, under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, these textile controls, which had operated in 1959 against our goods, were revised.  They now involve a quota allocation based on a datum year.  I have not the figures for the quota but the position is that the manufacturing firms here making up a certain amount of this material with the finished article containing less than 50 per cent of a low cost imported element, can get a certain quota in.  It is working to the advantage of a number of those firms having this quota that they can get into Britain at this stage.  In actual fact the overall prevention of exports here, with the exclusion which we have to allow a certain quota into Britain, is working to the advantage of a number of firms here at the present time. I know of one firm which ran into difficulties, in so far as they exceeded the 50 per cent amount, with the <Col N="1329" /> British Board of Trade in relation to a duty on them.</P>

If I find it is not it is one of the factors that I would like to have included in my discussions with the British in view of the fact that it is written in as a restriction which appears to me on the face of it to be of advantage to the UK.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned I was referring briefly to the Kenny Committee which has recently been set up to inquire into building land prices.  I wish to refer to it in passing as an indication of the Government's concern about the increasing price being paid for building land and what we are trying to do about it.  Pending any recommendations the committee might make, we are continuing to encourage local authorities to acquire as much land as possible and build up a land bank.  This land could either be let out to builders or let out in private developed sites by the local authority. Acquiring land for the community in this way ensures that the increasing value will be passed on to the community instead of into the hands of speculators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listed the various activities of the Department in the private housing field because this is what we are confined to discussing.  We are continuing to implement that policy until some other avenue is opened up to us which will give us greater control over the prices of building land.  Where local authorities acquire land and sell it off as private sites a special subsidy is <Col N="1331" /> paid by the Department.  This State subsidy is equivalent to £150 for every developed site sold by a local authority for private housing to accommodate either local authority tenants or persons of limited resources.  This has a double advantage for the purchaser as he has the benefit of low cost acquisition as well as the benefit of a site developed by the local authority plus the subsidy.</P>
    <P>During the past few months we have increased the income limits for supplementary grants and this has extended the scope of persons who would qualify for supplementary grants from local authorities.  The increase was from £1,050 to £1,250.  This is a substantial increase and it has made this additional grant available to more persons.  The local loans income limits were recently increased from £1,200 to £1,500.  The limits of the loans themselves have also been increased: where £3,000 applied the figure has been increased to £3,300 and where £2,700 applied the figure has been increased to £3,000.</P>
    <P>For some months we have been working on the low cost housing programme. Some Deputies have referred to this and I was surprised to hear Deputy Tully's remarks because I began to wonder whether he was aware of the work the Department are doing. I thought it had received a good deal of publicity.  I have referred to it in the House and it has been adverted to in newspaper articles and trade magazines. I do not think any Deputy should, at this stage, be unaware of the vast amount of work which is being done in the Department in relation to low cost housing.  I hope to be able to make an announcement on the outcome of our investigations in this field in a short time.  We have made some progress on it and the community in general will welcome the results of the many hours of labour that have gone into this task.  Benefits will accrue to the community in the provision of a good standard of house at much lower cost than they would otherwise have had to pay.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton raised the question of how firms, which he had some indication were going to be successful in this project, would obtain the contracts. <Col N="1332" /> We placed an advertisement in the Press last August inviting builders, architects and any interested company or group of persons to submit proposals to the Department which would enable houses to be erected at a lower cost, but which would comply with certain specifications, which are made available to those interested.  It was on a competitive basis, price being the main factor, that decisions were made and these will be announced in detail shortly, although some local authorities are already aware of some of the results.</P>
    <P>The Housing Bill, which was passed last year, increased housing grants. From some of the comments made by Deputies one would think housing grants had not been increased for many years.  The 1970 Act, which came into force in August, increased the standard grant from £275 to £325 and this was retrospective to houses which were commenced on or after 1st October, 1969.  Apart from that increase one of the principal effects of the Bill is that the level of grants now relates to the total floor area of a house rather than the number of rooms in a house. There are different categories of floor areas and the maximum grant of £325 is payable for a house in the category of 800 to 1,050 square feet.  The average local authority house is between 800 and 850 square feet, if any Deputy is trying to picture in his own mind what size of house that is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that be a two- or three-bedroom local authority house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>A three-bedroomed local authority house.  This is considered to be a medium-sized house. It is part of the policy of the 1970 Act to encourage the building of houses of a more modest size.  It is already evident that builders are reorganising their building programmes to provide houses in this category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maximum floor area for grant type houses is now 1,249 square feet and, within that limit, a house containing four bedrooms and ample living-room space can, in fact, be provided. When the Bill was before the House, I gave the House, as an illustration, <Col N="1333" /> the fact that &ldquo;the house of the year&rdquo; the previous year was a house of 1,150 square feet and that was considered a good, comfortatble, medium-sized house which would meet the main demand from those who were building or purchasing their own houses. There is every justification for withdrawing grants to houses over 1,249 square feet.  We should not continue a policy of paying grants irrespective of need and irrespective of the means of the applicant.  Houses above 1,249 square feet can be regarded as being in semi-luxury class and a grant at that level does not have any great influence on the person who is building that house.  In my opinion it was a great waste of State funds to give grants to these houses.  This money can be put to better use in encouraging others of modest means to build houses for themselves.  They will not be looking for a luxury-type house.</P>
    <P>The change from the number of rooms to the total floor area in the determination of the level of the grant makes for much greater flexibility in the layout of the house itself.  This is something which must be welcomed.  I know it meets the wishes of architects and house designers generally.  For many years they have sought greater freedom in designing houses.  Floor areas in the case of houses commenced from 1st January, 1971, are expressed in metric terms.  This is to keep in line with Government policy in supporting the introduction of metrication in the building industry which, I may say, is now at a very advanced stage.</P>
    <P>Great play was made about these new grants and relating them to the size of the house.  The old argument, so easy to trot out and so hard to prove, that the new grants were encouraging small box-type houses was made again here today.  Under the old grant system a three-bedroomed house qualified for a grant of £175, a four-bedroomed house qualified for a grant of £225 and the five-bedroomed house qualified for a grant of £275; these have now gone and the new measurements are a grant of £175 for 350 to 500 square feet, £250 for 500 to 800 square feet, and a maximum grant of £325 for 1,050 square feet. <Col N="1334" /> For the 1,050 to the 1,250 square feet the grant is £275.  A person can now build a house tailored to meet his real needs.  In that way it is possible to ensure that the resources available to the State are put to the best use.  Young couples and retired persons do not now have to purchase houses larger than their requirements, with all the greater costs of maintenance, furnishing and so forth that these houses entail.</P>
    <P>If Deputies who make comparisons with OECD countries believe they are honest with themselves and with this House in making these comparisons they must also admit, with equal honesty, that there is a vast difference in the size of houses built in these countries.  Traditionally we have always built larger houses here.  In the countries with which comparisons are made the rooms are generally smaller than our rooms are.</P>

      <P>I do not think people appreciate the quality of our local authority houses and the quality of private houses.  I have visited housing schemes in other countries and I have been amazed at the differences in standards. One obvious difference is the saving in the height of rooms.  Density is another factor.  Density in other countries is much higher than it is here and that results in a tremendous economy for them because the price of land is an important factor and, the greater the density, the cheaper the <Col N="1335" /> site acquisition costs per house.  Again, a great deal of building in these countries consists of flats and apartments. They are described as dwelling units. There is no question of a front garden and a back garden, which is the general pattern in building here.  Generally, our standards are much higher and a fair comparison cannot in fact be made.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should study the figures and look at the matter again.  In view of some of Deputy L'Estrange's remarks it might be appropriate to review briefly the Government's achievements in housing. At the start of the 1960s, we were building about 6,000 houses a year. This figure started to rise in 1962 as the demand began to recover from the recession of the late 1950s.  In 1964, the Government published the White Paper, &ldquo;Housing&mdash;Progress and Prospects&rdquo; which set out proposals for modernising the administration of housing and set a target for housing output of 12,000 to 14,000 dwellings by 1970.  Following the publication of this White Paper, output rose every year&mdash;apart from one year in which there was a small reduction.  In fact, the number of houses which we built in the calendar year 1969 was just 17 short of our upper target of 14,000 dwellings set for 1970.  So the targets set in the White Paper in 1964 were achieved by the Government.  They tried to hit between 12,000 and 14,000 and achieved in fact the upper limit. These achievements do merit mention.</P>
      <P>During the ten years to the 31st March, 1970 we built 98,000 houses with the aid of grants and loans, and reconstructed a further 93,000 with the aid of grants at a total cost of £377 million, together with an additional £92 million in subsidies which were met from taxation.  The 191,000 houses which were built or reconstructed represent more than a quarter of all the houses in the country now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, in 1969-70, we were building <Col N="1337" /> at the rate of five houses for every two built in the opening years of the decade.  We were spending approximately £64 million on providing and reconstructing houses and a further £13½ million approximately in subsidies from taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well the numbers inflated, they did increase.  In 1970-71, just fewer than 14,000 will probably be completed if weather and other circumstances permit and remember we did have a cement strike.  If this figure is reached it will mean surpassing the target set in 1969 and the completion of about 41,000 houses in the last three years, or a greater number in such a period than ever before in our history as a State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <P>Completed.  New houses. My Department carried out a general review of housing needs and prospects in 1969.  The results were published in the White Paper <i>Housing in the Seventies.</i> This was the second White Paper on Housing.  The paper estimated that the number of houses likely to be built in the mid-seventies would be about 15,000 to 17,000, so we were lifting our targets substantially, and it also detailed the steps to be taken to help ensure that these houses would be built. It indicated that these projections would not be regarded as limiting the level of building and that in so far as the economy could afford it any higher level of output found necessary would be aimed at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pattern of increasing output is reflected in increasing expenditure.  Of the £377 million from all sources spent on house building and reconstruction during the sixties £184 million was provided from private sources and £193 million through the public capital programme. At the end of the decade the total expenditure on providing and reconstructing houses was running at an annual rate almost four times that at the beginning of the decade.  Expenditure on subsidies from taxation was <Col N="1338" /> more than twice the corresponding level for the early sixties.</P>
    <P>I would not like Deputies to think that in quoting these figures I am complacent about the housing situation. All I am simply trying to show is that we have had growth in housing output and capital expenditure and that this growth has been faster than that achieved in most other sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>I am disturbed, and I know that many Deputies are also, about the continuing increase in the price of houses. Although the price of land has been mentioned frequently it must be remembered that this is only one factor contributing to increased prices for the finished house.  I have already referred to the Kenny Committee.  I am anxious to try to bring about the situation in which builders and persons seeking building land will go to the local authority for sites.  I am very anxious to call a halt to land speculation which has been going on in recent years.  I feel that builders do not want to be involved at this level in the buying of land if they could be assured of sufficient land for which they could plan a good programme of house construction for a number of years ahead. This would also enable them to keep their construction team together.</P>
    <P>It has been a feature of the past few years that larger builders with greater capital resources have been buying large quantities of land and smaller builders without the same resources have been trying to compete with them and some panicked and paid exorbitant prices where this need not have happened. I should like to see a situation in which land would be freely available from the local authority and builders would not need to be entering into the market and putting up the prices on each other and adding in that way to the price of the finished product.</P>
    <P>There are other factors besides land. The cost of materials and of labour has been increasing and this is a reflection of the rate of inflation which has been so evident in recent years in our economy.  It is a factor for which we must pay in increased costs to the finished product including the house.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1339" /> There are other aspects which do not often get publicity and to which I should like to draw attention.  I am not giving these factors in any order of priority and I just want to mention them for consideration.  Building societies have been mentioned and I may come back to say a few words about them later on.  We had a debate on building societies during Private Members' time not so long ago and I tried then to put all the available facts on record so that they would be available to Deputies and to the public.</P>
    <P>However, there is one aspect of the operations of building societies to which I should like again to draw attention and that is in regard to a person who goes to a society to seek a loan.  In my experience the most important requirement as far as building societies are concerned seems to be the level of income of the potential borrower.  If a man comes into a building society and says: &ldquo;I want to borrow £10,000 to buy a house,&rdquo; in my view the first question he should be asked by the building society is: &ldquo;What is the value of the house?  Who valued it?,&rdquo; and they should send out their own valuer to ensure that they get a realistic valuation.  But no&mdash;and I can be proved wrong by the building societies if they so wish&mdash;what they are saying to the man is: &ldquo;What is your income?&rdquo; If the income is good and he is a good prospect to repay a loan of £10,000 he gets it without any great bother.  Because that man has the money made freely available to him he pays the £10,000 for a house on the market.  If the building societies were more rigid in the valuations which they put on houses for which they are lending money, there would be a very strong brake applied to rising house prices. They have a very important part to play in this and they have not been playing it to the full.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter on which I hope I will get another &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; from Deputy O'Connell. It is the question of lumpers.  In this field the trade unions can play a very <Col N="1340" /> important part.  I know that in principle the trade unions do not support lumping but in practice they do not seem to be doing a great deal about it.  We all know the type of money the lumpers are demanding for their services.  I have every admiration for a man who will do a decent day's work, especially a man who will work for five-and-a-half or six days a week, because I never believed we should have had the five-day week in this country until our economy was stronger and until we had reached a much more advanced stage in our development.  I think we have gone a bit soft in this regard.  Any TD has to work seven days a week, so we can stand up and say this.</P>
      <P>The union will have to do something about lumping.  It is adding to the price of houses.  If a person wants to buy a house, and it is going to be erected by way of direct labour or if a large or small building contractor wishes to build a housing scheme the lumper plays a very important part and is making a substantial contribution towards increasing the cost of the finished product.  If sums of £70, £80 and up to £90 per week have been known to be paid to such persons building houses, one does not have to wonder why the cost of houses has been going up at such a fast rate.  I am just throwing out this point.  I would strongly urge the trade union movement and the unions catering for men in the construction industry to take a much firmer stand.  I know their own members will support them in it but they have been very tardy in this field.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has put his finger on another aspect of it.  This is certainly one of the biggest complaints of all, the fact that this money is just passed in cash from one to the other, that there are no records and consequently no tax paid on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope these efforts will be successful.  An attempt is being made but the unions could play a much bigger part in it.  There is also the question of the shortage of skilled workers.  This applies only to certain areas around the country and usually in the areas where there is the biggest demand for housing.  I have some experience of the type of closed shop technique which some of the building unions operate and I would like to ask them whether they honestly think they can justify operating such very stringent entry conditions for membership of unions.  If you are not a member of the union you cannot be taken on because your potential employer cannot employ workers who are not members of the majority union on his site.  I believe that in this way we are being denied many skilled workers in the building field and it certainly deserves a close look and a rethink on the part of the unions involved.  There is more involved than the individuals who are members of the union.  They, as well as I and the other Members of this House, have a responsibility to the community in which we live and any action of theirs which would in any way restrict the opportunities for young persons looking for homes would be a very serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another practice, a malpractice, in my view, which in some instances is contributing to the increased cost of houses.  The normal practice with large builders who build &ldquo;spec&rdquo; houses is that they will advertise, say, 100 houses for sale and there are often queues of people outside their offices to sign up for one of these houses.  These are houses for which planning permission has just been received; the site is developed and building will be proceeded with in a very short period of time.  However, because of the demand which exists today these builders can advertise before even the foundations are put down.  They can be very selective because the demand for these houses is greater than the supply.  I have reason to believe that there are certain members of the community going in and buying more than one house, buying, say, half a dozen houses, persons who themselves are not in need of a house but who are going <Col N="1342" /> in because they feel this is a good field for speculation, a good field in which to make a fast buck.</P>
    <P>What happens is that these people put down deposits on the six houses. The builder is quite pleased; he has got rid of six of his houses and he is assured that he will be paid for them.  He begins to construct the whole scheme and when the houses are completed the man who has bought the six houses will advertise them for sale in the public press and get a price which is often from £1,000 to £1,500 higher than the actual cost of the houses to him, and remember that house was never occupied.  This is a most despicable practice which should never be tolerated.  I am having a look at it to see if there is anything I can do. This is one of the worst features of the housing market at present.  It is contributing towards inflation in house prices because it is creating an artificial demand when persons who are not in need of houses at all can come into possession of them because of their own financial ability to do so and then take advantage of those persons who are without homes and charge them a price far in excess of the builder's prices.  Those houses have never been occupied and already a second price is being paid for them.  This is a very serious matter.  The practice is not very extensive but it certainly merits some mention by me and I am having a look at it to see what I can do.</P>
    <P>There were certain points raised by a number of Deputies and I shall not have time to reply to all of these.  However, I shall refer briefly to some of them.  When this debate opened I was amazed that Deputy L'Estrange launched immediately into an attack on the Government and on me for bringing the Supplementary Estimate before the House.  He said additional taxation was something that could not be tolerated by the Opposition.  In other words, he could not see any need for this Supplementary Estimate.  I do not know what it is that Deputy L'Estrange expects the Government to do.  I explained to him that the £¼ million that I am seeking in this Supplementary Estimate is in fact being provided by way of savings which I have effected within <Col N="1343" /> my own capital allocation.  That took some doing.  There is no additional taxation involved in that one way or another. On the other hand, the Deputy appears to be saying that we should not raise the additional money to pay the 12th round wage increase to the members of my staff and to the staff of An Foras Forbartha.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to a point that was raised by Deputy Clinton when he was referring to land that had been purchased by Dublin Corporation.  The Deputy said that this land was not being made available to small builders, one of the categories for whom it was intended it should be made available.  I can inform the Deputy that, in all, almost 1,200 sites have been given so far by Dublin Corporation to small builders and the corporation hope to allocate a further 1,400 sites before the end of this year. Most of these sites have been given out in small blocks of from four to 20. Therefore, it should be obvious that a large number of small builders are being facilitated.  It will be seen, then, that the point raised by Deputy Clinton was not valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corporation are helping builders who have been building traditionally in the Dublin area and this I think is only fair.  They have no wish to try to attract contractors to the Dublin area from other places.  Some such builders who have applied unsuccessfully were, naturally, somewhat disgruntled and I can only assume that the builders to whom Deputy Clinton <Col N="1346" /> referred are in that category, that is, that they have not been operating traditionally in the Dublin area.  I shall conclude on that note and I thank the House generally for accepting the Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £6,575,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1971, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an ArdChláraitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including grants to Local Authorities, miscellaneous grants and certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>

    <P>The supplementary provisions which I seek for my Department for the present financial year are, to a major extent, occasioned by adjustments in levels of remuneration in the central, local and voluntary services operating within the health sphere.

These increases are, as <Col N="1347" /> the House will appreciate, unavoidable and reflect increases in remuneration throughout the economy generally. Incidentally, of the increases in remuneration costs, over £1,000,000 represents, independent altogether of 12th round, a well merited status increase payable in the present year but retrospective to 1st October, 1969, to some 5,500 general trained nurses and also the cost of reducing their working hours from 85 per fortnight to 80 per fortnight.</P>
    <P>Increased costs of commodities used within the area of the health services necessitated an increased provision of over £600,000.  While these increases are, to a very considerable extent, outside my control, I think I should make it absolutely clear that I do not view with any sense of detachment the ever upwards spiral of costs within the health services and I mean to ensure that even if costs have to rise we will give the community full value for every penny which is spent.  Management consultants are, as Deputies will know, assisting my Department in the preparation of an efficient and streamlined system of administration for the new health boards.  I intend also to provide in my Department a small staff unit the function of which will be to promote and co-ordinate the activities of management services units in the on-going work of health boards and hospitals.  In this way the overlapping of activities will be avoided and the beneficial results of each survey will be available to all the functional bodies.</P>
    <P>The supplementary provision includes and additional sum of £100,000 to meet the costs of establishing the health boards, the travelling expenses of members, the training of chief executive officers and other senior personnel and also to meet the cost of the management consultants' survey and other work to which I have referred. The supplementary provision also includes a sum of over £400,000 to meet the cost of providing increases in the allowances payable to disabled persons and under the provisions of the infectious diseases maintenance regulations which were announced at the time of the Budget and were operative from the 1st of August last.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1348" /> The supplementary estimate also includes the sum of over £250,000 to meet increases in maintenance costs of patients in residential homes for the mentally handicapped and in the cost of providing additional day care services. These increases arise in respect of existing homes and also in respect of approximately 100 new places provided during the past year.  An additional sum of £25,000 is needed to cover the cost of the intensified health education activities of my Department and particularly those aimed at persuading young people not to smoke cigarettes or to give them up if they have started to smoke them.  This campaign, using all of the communication resources available to us, is being increased in intensity and will, I feel confident, have a still more marked effect in the coming year when the advertising of cigarettes disappears altogether from our television screens which will happen from the 1st April next.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that there was much disappointment and frustration throughout the country and among health authorities and managements. I cannot speak for them all but I can give the House some idea of how the Cork Health Authority felt about the Minister's announcement last week.  We all know that all the health authorities expected&mdash;and the Minister had practically prepared them for&mdash;much better news than he gave them when he made the announcement.</P>
      <P>In reply to several Parliamentary Questions he was prodded and goaded into telling us what the amount of the grants would be.  He put it off from day to day and from week to week.  In the case of the Cork Health Authority this is what happened.  I think the House should note it because if this is what has happened in Cork, all the health authorities have good reason to be frustrated and disappointed.  The Minister made a grant of £5,285,000 available to the Cork Health Authority for 1971-72.  The additional grant given because of the increase in rates &mdash;this was the announcement that got such great publicity from all the media last week; it was described by many of them as a shot in the arm but when I am finished I am sure they will be more inclined to agree that it was a kick in the pants&mdash;was a sum of £270,000.  That made in all a figure of £5,555,000.  In February at an estimates meeting of the Cork Health Authority at which I was present the manager estimated the grant at £5,607,000.  There was a shortfall, then, between the manager's estimate and what we are getting in full of £52,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As members of the House will know, the Cork Health Authority comprises the city and county of Cork.  The manager estimated that the increase in the rates in the county would be of the order of 12s 6d in the £.  In the case of Cork city he estimated it would be increased by 17s 6d in the £.  The Minister suggested that the demand in the rate should be held to the produce of 44p in the £.  Cork Health Authority agreed to do this on Tuesday.  This means, in effect, that there is £386,220 of a deficit to be carried over from <Col N="1352" /> this year to next year in the Cork Health Authority account.  That is one way of putting off the evil day.</P>
    <P>Cork Health Authority will become the Southern Regional Health Board when it is amalgamated with Kerry next week.  I want to tell them, if they do not know now, that what they are incurring from the Cork Health Authority alone, because of the Minister's management of the figures, is a debt of £386,220.</P>
    <P>We should take serious note here of where we are going in regard to the Health Act and its impact on the rates.  I remember a time, as a member of Cork County Council 20 years ago, when we spent days arguing to get some pence off the rates.  Later we spent days arguing to try to get shillings off the rates.  Now, no matter how it is debated, rates will increase not by pence or shillings but by pounds.  This House, the Minister and the Government should take serious note of this.  It cannot go on indefinitely. The Minister and the Government should again look at the Fine Gael suggestion for the implementation, running and financing of health services and look at how an insurance system could be worked.  We all know that the ratepayers, whose valuations are increasing, some of them doubling and trebling this year, just cannot keep on paying pounds in the £ increases year after year.  We should sound from the Opposition benches a note of warning and caution now and I am doing that on behalf of the Fine Gael Party. The financing of the health services should be looked into as a matter of urgency by the Minister for Health.  I know that any Minister for Health will have difficulty in getting extra money from any Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that most of the £6 million is needed for increases under the 12th Round&mdash;£50,000 to Department of Health staff, £3,725,000 to staffs in the local health authority service and £1,350,000 to staffs employed in voluntary hospitals.  That suggests to me that the Minister for Finance must be getting a great amount in income tax from the extra money paid to all those people.  I suggest to the Minister for Health that the Minister <Col N="1353" /> for Finance could be far more liberal with him.</P>
    <P>Most local authorities are at their wits' end trying to keep the rates within manageable proportions and within the capacity of the people to pay.  I was a Member of this House when the late Dr. Jim Ryan, then Minister for Health, ar dheis láimh Dé go raibh a h-anam, mentioned that the increases in the rates consequent on the introduction of the Health Act would not be more than 2s in the £.  I know that the value of money is declining every day unfortunately but the impact of the financing of the Health Act on rates is something we must in a serious way debate here and for which we must find some solution.</P>
    <P>With regard to the extra money for the payment of nurses we on this side of the House have advocated over a number of years that that dedicated body of people, who work so assiduously in the interests of others, should be recognised and I am glad that their pay and conditions have been improved. This was long overdue.</P>
    <P>In deference to the Minister I have no intention of ranging over the Health Estimate generally.  I shall confine myself to saying that the Minister, by his action in causing a debit of £386,220 to go into next year in the case of the Cork Health Authority, is inviting health authorities to go into debt.</P>
    <P>There is a provision of £100,000 for expenses in connection with the implementation of the Health Act.  The regional health boards will be taking over the running of the health services from next week and I want to say that what has gone on in the preparation for those new regional bodies is not conducive to the good administration of the health services.  We already have in Cork and Kerry arguments going on as to where the headquarters should be and who should staff the various offices.  From what I have read in newspapers the same is happening in the midlands and in the eastern and western health boards areas.  They are starting off by vying with each other as to where the headquarters will be, vying with each other as to who the chairman and vice-chairman will be of the different authorities.  I noticed <Col N="1354" /> that the banks even came into this.  If I read it correctly the way some of the banks were looking for the accounts of the different boards would seem to be almost on the point of graft and corruption.  This is a serious state of affairs.  What we have heard of the regional health boards, in their preparation, does not give us hope for the way they will administer the health services.  I hope what I am saying is wrong but they got off to a very poor start.</P>
    <P>In regard to the staffing of these boards I have read advertisements showing that some of the officials of the boards will be paid something like £4,000 a year.  Some development officers will be getting around £3,600 a year.  I wonder if all those extra staff will not make the financial position even more unmanageable.  I urge the Minister to watch their activities and to be very, very cautious in giving money to them.  This is one area in which an argument could be made for making the health services a national charge.  If that were the case the Minister for Finance would have a direct interest and direct control in the way the money was provided and indeed the way the money was spent.</P>
    <P>We must take serious note of where we are going in regard to health administration. I am glad the Minister has provided a sum for the dissemination of information on smoking in the hope of preventing the incidence of lung cancer.  I notice that most of this money will be spent on the education of youth and on trying to convince them of the danger to their health of smoking.  There may be something to be said for that but adults should also be educated because when young people see adults doing something they are inclined to imitate.  Therefore, some of this money should be spent educating adults as well as young people in that regard.</P>
    <P>I believe I speak for all health authorities when I express disappointment at the way they have been treated by the Minister and the Government in regard to grants.  They feel they cannot keep going unless something is done to help them to manage their affairs by giving them some money from the <Col N="1355" /> Exchequer to enable them to remove the unbearable burden from the backs of the ratepayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this Supplementary Estimate covering last year's affairs in the Department of Health I should first like to refer to my disappointment at the fact that the Minister has not been successful in bringing into effect the free choice of doctor scheme.  I know there were prolonged negotiations with the medical profession extending over years and I have seen dilly-dallying by the Government, by the Ministers, since the late Deputy O'Malley introduced the White Paper on health services.  To give the present Minister due credit he has tried in every possible way to meet the doctors and discuss the matter.  He has not been anxious for a breakdown or an impasse and I commend him on his decision to reopen negotiations as a result of the questionnaire prepared by the Medical Union.  I am not certain a solution will be found as a result of these negotiations but the great pity is that the scheme was not introduced before now.</P>
      <P>We know that the dispensary system is obsolete.  It has carried with it humiliation and degradation for patients who had to avail of it.  It was a startling revelation in this House to find that patients attending dispensaries had no record cards of their ailments or illnesses or dispensary visits for the information of the dispensary doctors. This is a disgraceful state of affairs.  There was no record of patients attending dispensaries and no means of ascertaining the numbers of patients attending any one session at a dispensary. The fact that this has gone on for years is deplorable.  It is no wonder information is not available to the Department or to the House on visits by patients to dispensary doctors. Neither do we know the prescribing habits of the dispensary doctors.  In the near future when the Minister reaches agreement with the doctors I hope he will ensure that a proper clinical record card is produced for use by doctors so that we can have up-to-date information on patients' illnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> The deficit on the voluntary hospitals is considerable.  I am not surprised. I have long been an advocate of the short stay for patients in hospitals since I first wrote from my practice to Deputy MacEntee, former Minister for Health.  I saw patients being detained unnecessarily in hospitals because no effort was made at streamlining the system or the consultant was unavailable when cases should have been discharged.  When it is realised that the cost of maintaining a patient in hospital is £30 to £32 per week it is disgraceful to have patients detained unnecessarily.  Many factors play a part in this.  It is dreadful that X-ray departments should close at 4 p.m. or 4.30 p.m. when, with no great effort, we could have them operating on a 24-hours basis so that patients could be admitted, say, on Friday and not left until the following Monday before investigation begins. This is the cause of the tremendous rise in the deficit for voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>I have asked time and again that a committee be set up to investigate the length of stay of patients in hospital. I have seen patients admitted on Friday afternoon and hospitals commenced tests on the following Monday. With the demands made on X-ray and other ancillary services, it is quite wrong to find that these laboratory and X-ray services close at 5 p.m. or 5.30 p.m.  It is sad to think that expensive and useful equipment is not fully utilised.  This is what is wrong with the system and it is now the cause of the high deficit for voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>Now is the time to talk about this. I should like to see X-ray departments asked to change their whole system of working so that they can work on a shift basis.  The same applies to laboratories.  This matter is too important and too expensive and the change should be made if we are to cut down the cost of hospitalisating patients.  We must tackle this immediately.  It is constructive work towards lowering hospitalisation charges.  What I am complaining of represents the major part of the £32 per week cost of maintaining a patient in hospital.  This is the built-in factor.  It results in patients <Col N="1357" /> being detained unnecessarily, especially when they are in for investigation.</P>
    <P>Also because of the short hours which X-ray and other hospital departments are working patients are being admitted, who should not be admitted to hospital for investigation.  Doctors who would be glad to have patients investigated in the out-patients' departments find that the delay is too long and that it is quicker and simpler to have the patients admitted to hospital. This is unnecessary admission of patients to hospital and is the cause of the high cost of hospitalisation. It is a very important factor and I would ask the Minister to look seriously into this.  Recently I made a survey among doctors in regard to this problems and I found that doctors were dissatisfied with the hospital appointments system because patients had to wait so long.  They found it easier to admit the patients to hospital. This confession by doctors shows something radically wrong with the system.  It should be possible to streamline out-patient departments so that patients could have the fullest intensive investigation on an out-patient basis and need not be admitted to take up beds which cost so much.</P>
    <P>We have another big problem on our hands, the problem of the terminal patient, say, with cancer who is in the last stages of his life and needs nursing care and, perhaps, narcotics or pain relievers in the final stages of his life.  It is an unchristian attitude we adopt in not accepting these patients. We look upon them as if they must be forgotten about and allowed to die without any care or attention.  Families are left with this terrible burden because no hospital is prepared to give facilities for them.  We can have sophisticated, elaborate hospitals like St. Luke's to treat cancer patients.  Personally, I do not agree with calling any hospital a cancer hospital and the sooner we get rid of that idea the better.  These cancer hospitals should be units attached to general hospitals. Let us get rid of these cancer hospitals immediately because there is a terrible fear in everybody's mind when cancer is mentioned.</P>
    <P>It seems ridiculous that we should <Col N="1358" /> be talking about this when these units could very readily be provided as part of a general hospital.  I seriously ask the Minister to consider this aspect. This cancer hospital and the other hospitals which provide treatment for cancer provide acute treatment but when they say further treatment is of no avail the patient is sent home.  There should be provision for some unit to be attached to general hospitals for terminal cases.  Many doctors have had to lie over and over again to bend the regulations to get those patients into hospital for treatment.  This affects every one of us in our families one way or another.  None of us is completely immune from this.  It can affect our fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters or ourselves.  It is nice to think there are facilities for those patients to get this care and attention in their final stages.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see that nurses at long last are being treated as ordinary human beings.  We have too often heard the saying: &ldquo;It is a vocation; it is a dedicated life and they must be prepared for it&rdquo;.  I have seen nurses in hospitals doing the worst possible tasks although they were doing them very gladly.  When I was working in hospital on a 12-hour shift the nurses were expected to be on their feet all day at the ridiculously low salary they were getting.  They were living in the Victorian era up to quite recently, until the time the late Donogh O'Malley saw fit to recognise the fact that they must be treated normally.  Nursing is a vocation. I would not like to see the stage being reached where nurses were far removed from the nursing care of their patients.  I would like to see a proper national college of nursing.  I would like to see them receiving university training and I would like to see them brought completely up to date on every aspect of medical care and medical treatment.  I would not like to see them, as I have seen them in America, so far removed from the patients that the patients represent numbers on a chart.</P>
    <P>We will have to face the problem that we will have a more severe shortage of nurses in this country.  There are too many opportunities for girls in other professions and they will not be attracted to the dull, menial tasks which some of our nurses <Col N="1359" /> are asked to perform, which are not necessarily associated with the care of the patients.  A few years ago I was in the Mater Hospital in Dublin and I saw a nurse on a tall stool washing the wall.  I asked the sister if this was part of the nursing care of the patient, and she said that this was proper training for nurses.  It is intolerable that nurses should be asked to do such things.  They should be asked to perform nursing duties alone.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the establishment of the assistant nurse who could help with basic nursing chores which would help the trained nurse in every way. The Minister should not completely discard the idea of assistant nurses. When we get fewer and fewer nurses we will have to think seriously of assistant nurses, who would be trained in basic nursing care but who would not have the skill nor the knowledge that the generally well-trained nurse would have.  We should talk about this now instead of waiting until we face the acute shortage of nurses, which is likely to arise in the near future.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed recently to find that some hospitals still charge fees for nurses during their training.  This is not right.  There are many girls with a special flair for nursing, with the ability and with the talent, who are deprived of the opportunity of taking up nursing in this country because they have not got the requisite fee. The sooner we get rid of this fee the better because a girl more than pays her way in her training as a nurse.  In a teaching hospital in Dublin the wards are staffed by student nurses. They are performing daily nursing jobs and it is disgraceful that they have to pay a fee.</P>
    <P>I saw recently that a doctor was involved in a case of not attending at the scene of a road accident.  This raises the question as to whether or not the Department of Health should seriously look into this problem because this regularly happens.  Admittedly doctors have no legal obligation to attend those cases.  Many of them feel that they cannot do much at that time and this is quite true. <Col N="1360" /> They may find themselves depriving their own patients of the care and attention which they need by attending road accidents.  Their absence may involve many hours, especially in rural areas.  Doctors realise when they attend the scene of an accident and render whatever medical care they can, they have to attend in Dublin at a later stage for insurance purposes.  This is something doctors are loth to do.</P>
    <P>I can readily understand a doctor's point of view but the public have a point of view as well.  They say that it is unchristian for a doctor not to attend a road accident.  I feel strongly that we must have a proper road accident emergency service with properly equipped ambulances somewhat on the lines of the cardiac ambulances that provide full care for patients from the time they are brought into the ambulance. Attached to those ambulances must be properly trained casualty officers so that from the time the patient is put into the ambulance immediate anti-shock therapy can be applied.</P>
    <P>There were over 532 deaths last year and I maintain many of these deaths could have been avoided had emergency care been provided by properly trained men at the time the patient was put in the ambulance, such as therapy by way of infusions against the shock which kills the patient on the way to hospital.  How often have we read: &ldquo;He was dead on admission to hospital&rdquo;? In many cases this need not have happened.  We are going to face the problem of more and more road accidents and we have got to have a properly equipped road accident service to deal with this problem.  I am making these suggestions because I do not think it is good enough for a Deputy to criticise without making constructive suggestions as to what can be done.  Something must be done if we are ever going to reduce the holocaust on the roads.  If a properly equipped ambulance with trained casualty officers can be available on 24 hour call this would help.  What does the cost matter if we can reduce the number of deaths?</P>
    <P>The financing of the health service gives every Deputy food for thought as it must the general public who have to pay for it.  While I have made some <Col N="1361" /> suggestions as to how costs could be reduced we must seriously consider how to reduce the tremendous burden on the rates, which is the cause of so much concern.  We all realise that health charges are increasing.  The health service must be financed from the Central Exchequer.  The Minister must realise this and if he is going to realise it next year or the year after why does he not face up to it now?  Health insurance must be paid by the general public including farmers, civil servants and all those who do not pay insurance at the moment, so that we can have a proper health service.  The only way we can properly finance the health service is by graded insurance so that the man on the small income would pay less than the man earning £30, £40 or £50 a week.  Besides extending contributions to a larger section of the community we can spread the load more evenly by graded insurance.</P>
    <P>The burden of the health service is becoming worse every year and we must try to solve the problem.  Dublin ratepayers were shocked to hear the latest increase.  They have no way of protesting against these increases.  No one seems to think about what it will be next year or the year after.  In two or three years time we might be paying £7, £8 or £9 in the £.  It is already over £5 in the £.  It is terrible to think that no one is doing anything to stop this; no one is suggesting that we can finance it from the Central Exchequer and thereby spread the load more evenly.</P>
    <P>With the aid of the Civil Service it should be possible to devise a scheme that will spread the net over a larger section of the population so that the burden will be less on those who are needy.  The rate increase is a worry beyond words to people living alone. They do not know how they will face this extra burden.  I know people with small houses and the rates on them are crippling them.  I know of people who would be glad to dispose of their houses but they cannot do so because they know they will never get a flat from Dublin Corporation.  It is terrible that we are faced with this problem again this year.</P>

      <P>No, I am talking about the appalling burden health charges are on the rates.  If we could devise a system of financing the service from the Central Exchequer we would not have this problem on our hands.  Last year the Minister did admit that this was being considered but I wonder how long it is going to take.</P>
      <P>The choice of doctor scheme is to be introduced shortly and the dispensing pharmacies are to disappear.  I hope they will.  I brought to the Minister's attention some months ago the danger of buying drugs in bulk packages for dispensary patients.  Despite the fact that I showed the Minister how lives could be lost because of the wrong packaging and the wrong labelling of drugs, despite the fact that I showed him examples of how this could be done with pill boxes, and despite the fact that I raised the matter on the Adjournment, the Minister did not grasp what was wrong or the danger inherent in this system.  I was shocked to find out recently that despite the promises made by the Minister this method is still in operation.  These pill boxes, the lids of which can be easily transposed, are still in use.  This method should have been abolished when I brought it to the Minister's attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of one particular case where a patient had two sets of tablets in two identical pill boxes, one contained sleeping tablets, one of which was to be taken at night; the other contained tablets one of which was to be taken three times a day.  The patient switched lids and she ended up taking sleeping tablets three times a day and one of the other tablets at night.  The patient was semi-conscious, yet nothing was done to change this method. If we have to record a death as a result of such a mistake then, no doubt, something will be done immediately. I do not think I should have to bring this up again when I have already explained it at great length to the Minister and in the Oireachtas Library I showed him exactly how it <Col N="1363" /> could happen.  If there were extra stocks of these pill boxes they should have been thrown out.</P>
    <P>I have no opportunity to check on this at the moment but I am looking forward to 1st April when the Eastern Health Board, of which I am a member, will come into operation.  There are many questions I shall want to ask and many things I want sorted out.  I have talked to dispensary doctors about this problem and they have said that the labels on the big tins of tablets can become detached and this causes waste because, when the label is missing, tablets have to be discarded. We are not dealing here with sweets or anything like that.  We are dealing with lives and when we are dealing with lives we must be extra careful.</P>
    <P>I recently heard about this infamous company, Intercontinental Pharmaceuticals, which I exposed in this House because of its nefarious activities. Even if these tablets are not coming from this country, the invoices are and &ldquo;Made in the Republic of Ireland&rdquo; is still on them when they are sold abroad.  This company is still in operation.  I think the particular gentleman is in Cyprus now.  When Britain got wise to him and decided to get rid of him he went to Cyprus.  I exposed this in 1965.  This is something which concerns the Department of Health and it could have a very damaging effect on a £7 million export of drugs.</P>

This individual got away with this for three years here.  I exposed him in 1965 but it took until 1968 to get rid of him. Britain banned his drugs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Time and time again complaint is made that drugs are a very big factor in health charges.  They are an important aspect of these charges.  We have today miracle drugs which can literally make a patient well overnight.  Even a patient <i>in extremis</i> can be put back on the road to recovery with the help of these drugs. They are costly.  If I put a patient on a drug which works out at 3s per dose and he has to take the drug for four days that works out at 48s.  On the other hand, this expenditure will obviate the necessity to send the patient to hospital and, therefore, a saving is effected from the point of view of hospitalisation.  This is important. Patients can be kept out of hospitals by putting them on broad spectrum antibiotics.  Before the advent of these drugs, if one had any doubt at all, the patient was hospitalised immediately. If one had to go back four times a day to give an injection it was much simpler and easier to send the patient to hospital.  Now, with modern therapeutic medicine, we can treat the patient at home.  I only hope more drugs will be discovered to cut down hospitalisation still further, thereby effecting a considerable saving on our health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, when we discover the way to curb infections, nature has another trick up her sleeve.  Today psychiatric illness is increasing and this is proving another problem.  However, again by the use of modern drugs, <Col N="1365" /> it is now possible to keep these patients out of hospital.  I should not like anyone now to get the idea that psychiatric illnesses can be cured by pills.  That is not so.  Psychotherapy is most essential and it is absolutely vital that we should have a sufficient number of qualified psychiatrists in our hospitals.  We have not got anything like enough at the moment.  The need is urgent.  We do not appear to have looked at the problem properly.  We have a situation in which the psychiatrist is asked to see as many as 60 or 70 patients per session.  Psychiatric illness is demanding of time.  It is not a matter of a stethoscope and a quick diagnosis.  One has to listen to discover the factors that led to the illness.  This is time consuming. I understand a memorandum has been sent to the Minister and I trust that the number of psychiatrists will be increased considerably; no psychiatrist should be asked to see more than ten or 15 patients at a session.  If the number is more than that he just cannot do his job properly and the patients suffer.</P>
    <P>There should also always be a senior psychiatrist on duty at the hospital. Only fully qualified psychiatrists should see patients in the out-patients department.  The Minister knows the problem.  He has adverted to it time and time again.  He has admitted that this particular form of illness is increasing. These illnesses do not necessarily warrant prolonged hospitalisation. What is needed is a psychiatric diagnostic service and adequate specialist treatment.  We need properly qualified and properly paid psychiatrists.  It is no good training psychiatrists here so that they can emigrate to Britain or the USA.  The attractions are many.  These people can earn much more abroad under infinitely better conditions, especially in the United States.  The salaries there are enormous.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has at last reached some form of agreement with the junior hospital doctors, though I am not too sure what will happen the members of the medical union. Junior hospital doctors play an important part in the running of hospitals. When I was a junior doctor we worked 18 hours a day for the princely sum <Col N="1366" /> of £2 17s 6d a week.  We are living in an age in which we must recognise that these doctors cannot be expected to work these hours and must have time off if they are to pursue the studies necessary if they are to proceed. It is a tough grind in a hospital.  The question of overtime seemed ridiculous initially to the Department but they had to face up to it if doctors were to provide a proper service for their patients.  Doctors are more concerned with time-off and it was dreadful to think of them working a 100-hour week. The great concession we have now given them is a 70-hour week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is great to know that the Minister has conceded a 140-hour fortnight for junior hospital doctors. He should rejoice at that.  I asked questions about thalidomide children. This is an important matter which should have been pursued by the Department on behalf of the parents of these children.  We had some 56 thalidomide babies and these children will require care, special equipment and appliances for the rest of their lives.  I do not know if any Deputies have seen a thalidomide child.  Some have half an arm.  I know one child who has three quarters of an arm and on the hand on the other arm there is no thumb.  He will require appliances for the rest of his life and will be a burden on the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What irked me more than anything else was that in Britain the Government were quick to act on behalf of parents of such children and the company in Britain paid compensation without fuss or ado, but here the parents were far removed from Germany where the original trial took place and they had nobody to act for them.  The Department should have acted on their behalf.  When we find <Col N="1367" /> out who is responsible the Department must make a claim on behalf of these people for compensation, compensation that will serve them for the rest of their lives.  We must think in terms of these children growing up to live the full span of 60, 70 or 80 years.</P>
    <P>There is little enough that we can do for these children.  I could not get from the Minister concerned an assurance that these children will be provided with all the necessary appliances free of charge, without any equivocation. We should have decided this and not said that they will be considered and we should not be given incomplete figures in regard to them.  I should like to know why the report on these children, prepared by Dr. Victoria Coffey in St. Kevin's Hospital, was suppressed.  It was not so private that we could not have been supplied with it.  The excuse that patients might be identified was poppycock.  It is very wrong that a medical report such as this was not published.  This report was commissioned and should have been published.  I fail to see why it was suppressed by the Department or on instructions from the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister on occasion has boasted about the facilities he has provided for the mentally handicapped.  I always think you can say we have done wonders by comparison.  Yes, we have. We have, perhaps, the worst facilities of any western country for mentally handicapped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We are the third best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that we had the worst facilities of any country in western Europe.  I remember one pathetic case of a mother of a mentally handicapped child who said: &ldquo;I do not know what I will do with him. When he was four I got a letter from the hospital telling me to have him immunised and that they would arrange a place for him in the hospital.&rdquo; She added that he was now 18 and she had never heard from them since. She did not mind as long as she was alive as she would provide for him but she wondered what would happen him afterwards.  He had the IQ of a boy of five.  She had been waiting 14 <Col N="1368" /> years for word from a hospital for a place for him.  I know that the Minister looked at the problem and saw that there was a diabolical situation and he faced up to it.  I congratulate him for what he has done and what he is trying to do.  It is terrible that previous Ministers were prepared to overlook the problem and do nothing. We are inclined to think of numbers and to say that so many more will be accommodated in so many years: but what about these cases in the meantime?  I am going to see a parent tomorrow who cannot get her child in anywhere.  The fact that these children are put into mental hospitals, where nothing can be done for them, is deplorable.  The Minister has done the work of three Ministers in trying to tackle the problem but I would urge him not to slacken and to continue to do everything possible.  I would include autistic children in this regard.  What happens these children when they reach 16, 17 or 18?  Beds in hospitals are not good enough for them.  What they require is accommodation in a hostel attached to a mental hospital and this is what we should think about.</P>
      <P>I should like to talk about the information provided by the Department. The Minister has faced up to his responsibility in regard to cigarette advertising on television.  This was allowed to continue for too long, although we on these benches badgered the Minister about it.  Unfortunately, nearly a generation of children have been bombarded with this advertising and they are now cigarette addicts and we have to wait for the new generation. I am not impressed by the Department's advertising.  I thought we might set up a health education council that would take on the task, free from the Department, and would use a little more imagination and initiative and that might seek advice from people who are in a position to advise on it. There is need for a health education council and not for the Department of Health to take on this task and, indeed, other very important tasks about which I shall be talking tomorrow.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flor Crowley gave notice that he wished to raise the following matter: the recent acquisition by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of mining rights at Nevinstown, County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I had to raise this matter on the Adjournment and cause some people to work overtime, but I considered it of such importance that it was worth putting some people to a little inconvenience.  This is a case of a mining company that came to this country in good faith, brought its expertise with it, carried out quite extensive prospecting and eventually came up with a very extensive strike at Navan.  This company is composed of four principals, four Irishmen who went to Canada and came back and, as a result of the incentives that we were giving to mining companies, started prospecting in Ireland. From 1955 onwards these four principals involved in the company in Navan were supervising major activities of mineral exploration and mine development in Ireland.  Despite talk to the contrary these people have been living in Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is very important that we urge the Minister to make a quick decision because the fate of the savings of many small people is involved in the decision the Minister will have to make.  Over two million of the shares of this company are held by Irish people. Substantial employment is given to Irish people.  Unless swift action is taken by the Minister the whole credibility of the Government in relation to its incentives in mining could be eroded.  There is a great deal of illinformed comment in the daily press, and universities and at various other levels from people who think they know all the facts about mining.  However, it should be recorded here this evening that over £700,000 has been spent by this company prospecting in Ireland, and it would be disastrous for the mining industry, indeed for all industries in this country, if any opportunistic business deal deprived these people of their rightful licence to mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> Before I came in here this evening I went to the trouble of looking up some of the Acts of the Oireachtas in relation to mining and prospecting and I would like to quote from Part II, section 8 (3) of the Minerals Development Act, 1940:</P>
    <P>Every prospecting licence shall be expressed and shall operate to authorise the licensee, during the currency of such period as is specified in such licence and subject to the provisions of this Part of this Act, to enter on such land as may be similarly specified and there do all things as the licensee considers necessary or desirable for the purpose of ascertaining the character, extent, or value of the minerals lying on or under such land, and in particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, for the purposes aforesaid to make borings, sink pits, remove water from old workings, and take and remove reasonable quantities of any such minerals for the purpose of analysis, test, trial or experiment.</P>
    <P>The prospecting having been carried out, the natural sequence to this would be to apply to the Minister for a licence for mining.  Let me quote from Part I section 13 (1) of the same Act:</P>
    <P>On the granting or at any time during the currency of a prospecting licence, the Minister may enter into an undertaking with the licensee under such licence to the effect that if, at any time during the currency or on the expiration of such licence, the Minister is satisfied that the prospecting carried on by such licensee has been successful and that the terms and conditions of such licence have been observed and performed, the Minister will grant to such licensee a State mining lease under Part IV of this Act to take effect from such date, either before or after the expiration of such licence, as may be specified in the State mining lease.</P>
    <P>It is pretty clear that the company that tried to oust the existing company from their rights in Navan, if I read the Act properly, have not got a leg to stand on and this should be made very clear to the public.  As we all know with any company that is quoted on the Stock <Col N="1371" /> Exchange, one of the most important ingredients of the success of that company is the confidence of the people, the confidence of the investor in that company.  Surely nothing could be more shattering or damaging to any company or to any quoted share than to have this type of carry-on we have had at Navan.  That is why I think it was essential that it should be stated here clearly that this company called Bula have no right, if we are to interpret the Mineral Development Act of 1940 properly, and that the people generally need have no fear of their investment in Tara.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, most of the investors are small investors.  Most of the investors invested in it because it was an Irish enterprise and it was local.  It was something of a miniPoseidon as far as the people of Ireland were concerned.  Each year we spend a substantial amount of money in various countries in endeavouring to make industrialists aware of the advantages that this country can offer to them if they are interested in setting up here.  Are we to negative completely the work of the Industrial Development Authority by allowing the type of shoddy practice that has been attempted in this particular case?  Or are we to state immediately and categorically that Bula have no rights in this particular instance? We know that the Minister had to act quickly because this land happens to be fee simple but, again, this is provided for in section 14 of the Minerals Development Act, 1940, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Whenever it appears to the Minister that there are minerals on or under any land and that such minerals are not being worked or are not being worked efficiently and the Minister is of the opinion that it is desirable in the public interest, with a view to the exploitation of such minerals, that the working of such minerals should be controlled by the State, the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may by order (in this Act referred to as a minerals acquisition order) either, as he shall, with the consent <Col N="1372" /> aforesaid, think proper, compulsorily acquire such minerals or compulsorily acquire an exclusive mining right in respect of such minerals.</P>
    <P>The Minister is proceeding to do that now and he should not hesitate to alleviate the fears of the shareholders of Tara Exploration because, when we come to negotiate and endeavour to attract industry into this country the most important asset we have to offer is our credibility in ensuring that there will be no sharp practice so far as the incoming company are concerned and that we will stand over the type of concession that we say we are prepared to offer.  I do not wish that anybody would be left with the impression that this is an argument to the effect that Tara should pay more royalties or that mining companies in general should pay taxes or that they should be subject to more stringent measures than at present.  That is not the issue.  The issue tonight is that we wish to ensure that the investments of a substantial number of the Irish people are protected.  We want to ensure that, so far as the future of mining in Ireland is concerned, it will be unimpaired.  Even more so, we want to ensure that confidence in the setting up in Ireland of industry is not fraught with the type of dangers and pitfalls that Bula are attempting to perpetrate.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me if I did not pay tribute on an occasion such as this to a company that have treated the Irish people more than fairly&mdash;a company that have always been straightforward and above board in their analysis of the situation and in their presentation of the facts of the borings.  We have seen what happened in Australia in relation to the fly-by-night mining companies.  We are very fortunate in having in this country a company of the calibre of Tara who have been straight and sincere with the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by urging the Minister to alleviate the fears of Tara shareholders as quickly as possible. Deputy Tully represents the constituency concerned and he has asked me if I would mind giving up some of my time to him.  I am delighted to do so.</P>
    <Col N="1373" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Crowley for accommodating me and I shall be very brief.  So far as I can see, this is the most blatant case of claim jumping that has been known in the mining world for more than one hundred years. According to old stories people who went to register mines after discovering them were often killed so that somebody else might take over the claim. However, nobody has been killed so far in relation to this operation, but it appears that there is an attempt at the snatching of the claim.  I know that Deputy Crowley had very good intentions when raising this matter but possibly we are putting the Minister in an awkward situation because, as I see it, the Minister and the Government have no option but to give the mining rights to the company that discovered the ore deposits in Nevinstown.  Perhaps we are pushing an open door because, being the honourable man he is, the Minister has no option, and neither would he wish to have any option, but to hand over the rights of mining to the people who have spent their own money and their shareholders' money on the project.</P>
      <P>I should like to echo what Deputy Crowley has said in that it is not the big shareholders in foreign countries who are involved in this: anybody in the Meath area who had a few pounds to spare invested in Tara.  The feeling around Navan town, in particular, is one of shock in that anybody would have the nerve to do what these people have done.  Possibly at the back of their mind there is the feeling that they might be able to blackmail the Tara company into a position that they would get something out of it eventually.</P>
      <P>I am sorry for the owner of the land, Mr. Wright, who is a decent man and who comes from a decent family.  He has been conned by people who have deliberately put themselves in the position that, although Mr. Wright owns a farm of land under which minerals have been found, he will have a one-third share while the few gentlemen who have appeared as his saviours will get two-thirds.  I should hate to see that happen to anybody, much less to a constituent of mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> With Deputy Crowley I appeal to the Minister to ensure that this matter will be settled immediately, It is true that Tara shares have fallen to some extent, but the shares have been going up again.  Those people who have money invested in a big way realise that this sort of thing would not be allowed happen in any civilised country.  I agree also with Deputy Crowley in that, if a situation has arisen where an Irish Government would allow industrialists to take away the fruit of the labours of a firm that have worked here and have expended money for the purpose of having an industry established, it would almost certainly result in a situation where nobody else outside this country would ever be inclined to invest money here again.</P>

      <P>I understood that I was on the Adjournment to-night in relation to the recent acquisition by me as Minister for Industry and Commerce of the mining rights at Nevinstown, County Meath.  I suppose that normally one could assume that the discussion would develop on the lines taken by Deputy Crowley and Deputy Tully. I found the discussion quite interesting from the point of view of learning something about the Irish investment in Tara Ltd., as such.  I am conscious of the fact that ever since the information broke about a discovery at Nevinstown away back before Christmas, there was quite a share of individual Irish financial interest in it.  Deputy Crowley mentioned a figure.  He said that the fate of many Irish people was involved and he mentioned that 2,000,000 of the shares were held by Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I must accept Deputy Tully's summary of the situation.  He said that the Minister is an honourable man and a member of an honourable Government.  I am hoping that when this problem is completely resolved&mdash; and I hope that it can be resolved reasonably and within a reasonable time&mdash;this fact will be further established.</P>
      <P>The developments in this regard over the past week have been quite alarming. I suppose that is the only way to describe it.  Deputy Crowley said he was glad the Minister had acted pretty swiftly with regard to the acquisition of the mineral rights.  To be quite honest let me say that coming up from the country last Monday morning when I read in the papers about this development I was a little annoyed with myself for not having acted as swiftly as I would have wished in the light of the development.  In fact, I took a decision &mdash;and I was checking on this this evening&mdash;away back on 19th February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not very &ldquo;away back&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but on the 19th February, as I saw it, there was no problem.  On the question of mineral rights my predecessors had taken steps previously to acquire rights in areas under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The strike was published before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the point is that it comes under section 14 of the Act.  The House will appreciate that in a great number of cases the mineral rights are held by the State in any event.  There are only isolated pockets <Col N="1376" /> where the mineral rights are held privately rather than by the State. Having had the matter gone into fully &mdash;and this involves a good deal of research in conjunction with the Land Commission&mdash;I arrived at the conclusion at that stage that it was necessary for me to take steps under section 14 of the Act to acquire those rights.  I instructed the officials of my Department to prepare the papers for this and the order was made on the 15th March.</P>
      <P>Then there was the development whereby this other company, apparently some time in or about 18th or 19th March, entered into an arrangement with the landowner who was, it appears&mdash;I do not know if this is a positive fact&mdash;also the owner of the mineral rights.  From their point of view the mineral rights were acquired by that company but by the order made on the 15th March the mineral rights had become the property of the State.  That is the situation at the moment.  I have seen press reports which indicate that this order is being challenged for one reason or another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  Does the Minister intend to allow the licensed prospector to proceed with the mining under licence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have ten minutes to reply and I am trying to cover this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the licensed prospector, Tara, very recently applied to me for an undertaking that I would give a mining lease.  That is the application under Article 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the normal procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unfair to say that this was only a very recent application because there is an outstanding application of some few months for a lease as such for a much wider area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>From them.  Deputy Tully is quite right in saying that in equity the person who already holds the prospecting licence and who operates it efficiently and effectively and properly under the conditions under which it is issued&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Should&mdash;I do not want to imply anything, but there is nothing written into the Act which says that the prospector, the man who has the licence, must or should get the subsequent lease.  Unless there are good reasons&mdash;and I do not see any at the moment&mdash;for not giving the lease the original prospector is the person who, in equity, should get the lease.  So many things have happened in the past week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Only one thing happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to make this situation rather unusual.  Accepting the fact that on behalf of the State I hold the mineral rights, it is now my decision to issue a lease if I find that all the qualifications are met.  The normal procedure is that the people who have made the strike, the people who have the prospecting licence, if I am satisfied that they have the capacity to go ahead and develop the mine, would normally be expected to get the lease. I will not say positively here tonight that it will be issued&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The application I have before me at the moment is an application for a lease under section 13.  In relation to a lease I want to make the situation quite positive.  I am satisfied that the royalties we negotiated in relation to previous leases are not sufficient for me in relation to the present development.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If they have bought the land I take it they are entitled to go on the land.  They may not prospect on the land because the minerals are State-owned but so far we have no evidence that they are prospecting or mining.  They are carrying out some work there and I propose to ask the Geological Survey Office to have a look at what they are doing with a view to taking action if there is an apparent breach of the Act.</P>
