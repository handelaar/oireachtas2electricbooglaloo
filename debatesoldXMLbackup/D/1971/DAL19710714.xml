      <P>In page 2, line 21, after &ldquo;whatsoever&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(including caravans and mobile homes)&rdquo;.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> This matter was raised by me on Committee Stage following a speech by Deputy Lenehan from Mayo who seemed to think that the virtue in the Bill was the fact that it would protect caravans and that sort of thing.  I pointed out that caravans seemed to be excluded specifically from the definition in the Bill.  The Minister has now decided to include caravans and this amendment is acceptable to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 27, to delete &ldquo;any person having an estate or interest in land&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out on Committee Stage, any virtue that there is in this Bill lies <Col N="1249" /> in the fact that it seeks to protect occupiers of buildings and premises; it seeks to protect people entitled to immediate occupation of premises and it seeks to protect these against all and sundry.  It strikes me that the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; in section 1 seems to be out of line with the spirit of the Bill because, as the definition now stands, it will not be illegal for one type of person, not entitled to occupy premises, to go in and, in fact, take forcible possession of them against the will of the person rightfully entitled to occupation. &ldquo;Owner&rdquo; is defined in section 1 as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;owner&rdquo;, in relation to land, includes the lawful occupier, every person lawfully entitled to the immediate use and enjoyment of unoccupied land,</P>
    <P>I think the definition should stop there. But it does not; it goes on to say:</P>
    <P>any persons having an estate or interest in land...</P>
    <P>That is the part of the definition to which I take exception.  In order to explain my objection it is necessary to point out the various types of interest a person could have in land.  There is an interest in land known as a fee farm grant.  Fee farm grants were first granted away back in the old days when a landlord gave grants forever to tenants at a small rent.  Under a fee farm grant the conditions are usually very limited.  Unlike a lease the conditions attached to a fee farm grant are usually merely that a small rent will be paid and, if the rent is not paid, the grant can be terminated.  The conditions are minimal.  They are grants forever and so long as the fee farm grantee discharges the obligation to pay the rent the fee farm grantor has no right at all to occupation of the land.  In my professional experience I have never known a fee farm grantor recovering possession of land or property held under a fee farm grant. Subject to the rent being paid, the fee farm grantor has no right, good, bad or indifferent, to occupation of the land or premises and, if he wants to get possession of the land or property, he must invoke the law.  If he thinks he has a right he must invoke the <Col N="1250" /> law.  Under this measure, however, he is to be treated as within the law if he bullies his way in on top of his tenant or fee farm grantee.  When I raised this matter on Committee Stage I was hopeful that the Minister would do something about it.  I concede he did not promise that he would but he definitely stated he would have a look at it; he said that on numerous occasions because this runs all through this Bill.  The Minister did say that the tenant could resort to his legal rights and put out the offending landlord or grantor.  I say the position should be reversed: the fee farm grantor, if he wants to get possession, should rely on his rights.  It is not right that a man of substantial means and substantial power should be specifically excluded by the Minister from the criminal element in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to point out now the absurdity that can arise from this definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; when really &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; is meant.  In subsection (3) of section 1 it is provided that:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Act shall apply to an entry or an occupation of land or a vehicle in the exercise of lawful authority or with the permission of the owner.</P>
    <P>This owner, who has no right, good bad or indifferent, to occupy the land can, under the provisions of this Bill, take possession of the land.  As I pointed out on Committee Stage this is a situation that could very easily arise. One of the arguments put forward by the Minister in justification of this measure was the occupation of certain houses in Hume Street.  These houses were occupied in furtherance of a protest against the proposal of the Government to allow their demolition and the replacing of them by office blocks, thereby destroying buildings of architectural value.  We know that many people of the fee farm grantor class were interested in the preservation of these buildings.  In fact, the Minister in this House subtly referred to them as belted earls.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not we know from experience that many of these fee farm grantors are titled people many of whom are interested in the preservation <Col N="1251" /> of this type of architecture.  In this city all that a fee farm grantor of a Georgian building that is about to be destroyed to make place for office blocks, would have to do, if he wished, if this Bill were law&mdash;I emphasise that he is a fee farm grantor, he is not entitled to possession or occupation&mdash; would be to stencil hundreds of thousands of leaflets or forms saying, &ldquo;I authorise the bearer to take possession of No. 1 Hume Street&rdquo; and distribute these wholesale over the city. If the Bill goes through as it is anybody going into occupation armed with authority from the fee farm grantor&mdash; admittedly he must be the fee farm grantor of this particular building&mdash; will be going in lawfully under the provisions of this Bill.  I pointed that out to the Minister on Committee Stage and I do not think it can be contradicted.  I am not really interested in that particular case; I am only pointing it out to show the absurdity of the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister wants to protect the tenants.  Surely the Minister does not want to change the law, and if he quibbles with me about changing it, surely he does not want to create laws under which it will be illegal for one person to take possession forcibly of land or property and it will not be illegal for another person to take possession, the other person here being the absentee landlord or his agent.  This absentee landlord, who may be in Hong Kong or anywhere else, can under this Bill send an authority to some bullyboy in Dublin city authorising that bullyboy to take possession of a house forcibly and knock it down over the ears of the tenant.  If that is done the tenant has his right of course, if he has any money, to sue the landlord overseas. This is a disgraceful definition.  It is a disgraceful bit of legislation which discriminates against the tenant <i>vis-à-vis</i> the remote landlord.  It is no answer at all for the Minister to say to me, &ldquo;Let the tenant resort to the civil law&rdquo;.  Why not let the landlord resort to the civil law?</P>
    <P>I state my case here in support of this amendment principally on the basis that the tenant should be protected <Col N="1252" /> from the offending landlord just as much as he should be protected from anybody else.  I have picked out here to demonstrate my argument the fee farm grantor; with a bit of research it would be possible to think out people by the score who would have an interest in land or property but who would not be entitled to possession of it.  Some elderly person might have a life estate which in the ordinary course of nature could not be expected to last for more than a very short time, yet that person can take forcible possession of his land or authorise somebody else to do it, and will not be guilty of any offence.</P>
    <P>As I say, any lawyer who wanted to research could find out dozens of ways where a person could be legally stated as having an estate or interest in land without being entitled to possession thereof.  On the Second Stage I stated that we were in agreement with the general principles of sections 2 and 3 if the Bill was stripped of the extremely offensive sections like section 4 and this definition of &ldquo;ownership&rdquo;.  I did that on the basis that protection was being given to the occupier.  I certainly never agreed to it on the basis that the law was going to be changed in a way that the battering rams were again to be placed in the hands of the landlord.  That is what this section is doing.  It clearly differentiates between the landlord on the one hand and the general public on the other.  It is going to be an offence under this Bill for some unfortunate down-and-out man with a wife and family who have no shelter over their heads to take possession of an unoccupied house but it is not going to be an offence under this section for a wealthy landlord with a 40-room mansion, hundreds of acres of land, yachts and all the rest, to act the bully and land himself in on top of an unfortunate tenant in lowly circumstances. He is going to get the blessing of the Minister for Justice and the gardaí will not be allowed to go near the place.  They will be told that is a matter for the civil law in so far as this gentleman is concerned.  They are going to be foretold by the Minister and the Government that they are to go in and arrest the unfortunate homeless man and lodge him in Mountjoy <Col N="1253" /> and bring him before the courts&mdash;arrest him without warrant.</P>
    <P>I am terribly disappointed that the Minister did not look into this matter between Committee Stage and Report Stage as he led me to believe he would. The definition of ownership does not stand up to any sort of examination.  I have pointed out the absurdity about the belted earl being able to authorise all and sundry to take possession of the place and, if he does it, it is OK.  All he is entitled to may be a fee farm rent of 16s 8d in perpetuity; he is going to be immune; but the people who feel strongly about the protection of Georgian architecture or any ancient form of architecture are to be guilty of an offence even when they are making a protest which is reasonable and which the Government subsequently hold to be reasonable and to which they yield.</P>
    <P>Then you have the case of the homeless man being guilty of an offence if he dares to go in and being subject to the most rigorous provisions of this Bill.  Indeed, the newspaper editor will be guilty of an offence if he says that the homeless man was right to take the house.  If the same newspaper says that the fee farm grantor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We are not.  I am back right on it.  I am dealing with the definition.  If the Chair will have patience with me for a minute, I am pointing out that if the newspaper editor supports the taking of a house by a man who has not a house he will be guilty of an offence but if the newspaper editor supports the taking of possession of a house by a fee farm grantor he is not going to be guilty of any offence.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I know, but this would be relevant. If the Chair will have patience with me, I am clearly relevant.  I am pointing out the absurdities arising under this Bill from the definition of owner and when I get to amendment No. 9 <Col N="1254" /> the definition of owner will be over and finished with and there will be no use in my pointing out then the absurdity of this, as I am pointing it out now.</P>
      <P>This definition of owner really riddles this Bill with absurdities.  It runs contrary to the whole letter of the Bill which seeks to protect tenants in occupation, which seeks to protect people lawfully as at the time of the event entitled to occupation of land. It is simply an attempt to arm the absentee landlords with the battering ram which we all thought had been done away with and taken out of the landlord and tenant code in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Just briefly, I should like to support Deputy Fitzpatrick in his arguments on the deficiencies of the definition of owner. The kernel of the objection is that it permits a person who is an absentee landlord to interfere with the occupants of a premises without incurring the criminal sanctions which this Bill introduces, and that raises two points.  First of all, it raises the point that the obvious answer is that if he does, the occupier has his civil remedy but this again gets back to the essential contradiction in this piece of legislation in that it is trying to effect a compromise between the civil and criminal law in relation to a matter which is essentially a matter of civil law.  This is the essential objection to this Bill and that objection is highlighted by the deficiencies in the definition of owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further serious deficiency in regard to the definition and which would be cured by Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment is that as well as the persons defined in the definition part of section 1, an owner is also any person acting on behalf of the owner and this is unduly and dangerously wide in relation to the type of owner mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick, the absentee owner, the person who has only what you might call the colour of a right because a fee farm grantor in <Col N="1255" /> this day and age has no more than the colour of a right.  It is a legal right but it is only the colour of a right in reality.  Nevertheless, that person can act through somebody else.  He can act through the private army, as we all fear.  He can even act through the very subversive organisations the Minister says the Bill is aimed against.  Then you end up having a ridiculous situation. The more we consider this Bill, particularly the more we consider how it will develop, how it can and how it might develop having regard to the definitions and particularly having regard to this definition of owner, the more ridiculous and inept the Bill becomes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  The deletion of the words as proposed by Fine Gael spokesmen is quite fair and reasonable because there is in the Minister's mind such a sweeping extension of the concept and definition of ownership as to illustrate the negative and discriminatory thinking, overloaded in favour of property owners and developers, on the part of the Minister.  The imbalance in the Bill is shown up in that section.  In respect of the rights of any occupier I am quite sure that in no circumstances would the Minister give parallel support within legislation to such persons. This is a public authorisation, a public licence, by the Minister to any landlord in this country to designate anybody whom he wishes and whom he may deem for the time being to have a vested interest in the land, to proceed to crucify the tenants or occupiers of land or of a structure.  This is grossly unbalanced and grossly unfair.  It does one thing more than anything else.  It highlights the negative concept of the Minister in introducing this Bill.  In that context the amendment proposed by the Fine Gael Party is worthy of support and will certainly enjoy ours.</P>

      <P>In the interval since this matter was discussed on Committee Stage, I have given very careful consideration to the views expressed by Deputy Fitzpatrick and to his suggestion that the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; should be amended in the manner which he has proposed again.  Because I believe that Deputy Fitzpatrick is sincere in his approach to this particular matter I have gone out of my way to see whether it would be possible to accommodate his views without giving rise to the objections that I voiced on Committee Stage and which I regard as still being valid.  Unfortunately, I find that there is no way of reconciling the Deputy's wishes and my own objections and, therefore, I must oppose the amendment again on this Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> The sole purpose of this Bill is to deal with the specific problem with which the community has been confronted in recent times and which manifests itself in the forcible occupation of other persons' property and in forcible interference with the legitimate rights of owners by persons who have no semblance or colour of right to the property affected.  I have been criticised at great length by some Opposition Deputies for introducing a Bill which they say goes too far.  They allege that it introduces the sanction of the criminal law to an area where existing civil remedies are adequate or would be adequate if the procedure for enforcing them were streamlined suitably. I have answered that criticism by pointing out that in the case of the particular activities to which the Bill applies civil remedies are completely inadequate, not because of any procedural defect in the law but because of the violent and crude methods of intimidation that are adopted by the organised groups responsible as a result of which individual property owners are afraid to invoke the process of the civil law and are otherwise powerless to defend themselves.</P>
    <P>It is in these circumstances that the State must step in and protect the individual in the interests of the community as a whole and to protect public order and public peace.  In effect, Deputy Fitzpatrick is now saying that the Bill does not go far enough and that it should introduce the sanction of the criminal law not only in cases where property is entered forcibly or occupied by people who have no legal interest in or claim to the property but also in cases where entry or occupation is effected by persons who have a legal interest in the property. In other words, Deputy Fitzpatrick wants to introduce a sanction of the criminal law into an area which at present is governed adequately by the law of property and in particular the law of landlord and tenant.</P>
    <P>Today Deputy Fitzpatrick described the definition of owner in this Bill as being absurd, but to illustrate how, as he alleged, it was absurd, it was necessary for him to give an example and I think that even he, if he is honest, <Col N="1258" /> must agree that the example he gave was absurd in the extreme.  He spoke this morning at fair length about fee farm grantors and what they could and could not do and what offences they would commit or would not commit.  I wonder how many people in this country, apart from solicitors and barristers, have even the remotest idea of what is a fee farm grantor.  I wonder how many fee farm grantors there are in this country or how many people who are fee farm grantors know that they are fee farm grantors. I wonder how many people who are fee farm grantors would have the slightest interest in the property concerned or would seek or would have ever sought to interfere in any way in the running of it.  I am sure a great many fee farm grantors are not even aware of the property in respect of which they hold that fee farm grant because all they are entitled to is their rent charge.  Their entitlement is to the rent charge and not to the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an amazing argument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>For Deputy Fitzpatrick to say that the definition in this section is absurd because fee farm grantors can do what he must admit are rather absurd things which no fee farm grantor has ever done or is ever likely to do, only highlights the absurdity of Deputy Fitzpatrick's argument. If he has to rely on such obscure matters as the rights or lack of rights of fee farm grantors, I am confident that there cannot be very much wrong with this definition.  The Deputy goes on to make sweeping generalised statements about licences being given to landlords to do this, that or the other but he fails totally to advert to subsection (5) of section 1 of this Bill which says that:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this Act shall be regarded as conferring on any person any right to entry or occupation of land which did not exist immediately before the commencement of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put that in at Committee Stage to make the position crystal clear but in spite of this Deputies as well as others outside have misrepresented the position <Col N="1259" /> continuously and I can only conclude that they misrepresented it deliberately.  I do not think that anything could be clearer than that subsection. In three lines it sets out that nobody is given a right under this Bill to do anything that he did not have the right to do before.  However, the fact is that no matter how often it is repeated to the contrary, no landlord whether he is a fee farm grantor, a lessor, a mortgagee or anyone else with any interest in land, remote or not entitled to immediate occupation, is given even a tiny fraction of right to do anything that he does not already have.  He is not given any extra rights nor are any rights taken from him. There is no change at all in the position of a landlord <i>vis-à-vis</i> his tenant or a fee farm grantor <i>vis-à-vis</i> the fee farm grantees or the other occupiers or a mortgagee <i>vis-à-vis</i> a mortgagor.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney in supporting Deputy Fitzpatrick is in effect quite inconsistent because if these words &ldquo;estate or interest in land&rdquo; are taken out of the definition it will then become an offence for certain people, with whom Deputy Cooney was concerned on earlier stages, to remain forcibly in possession.  The obvious example of that is a mortgagor against whom a mortgagee has obtained an order for possession.  I argued at considerable length with Deputy Cooney on this point, not in any acrimonious way, on Committee Stage.  I thought we had sorted that out.  I accepted Deputy Cooney's point that a mortgagor against whom an order had been made should not be open to some sort of arbitrary ejectment.  I made the point that the mortgagor in that instance had an interest in land because he retained an equity of redemption. I have since checked on that and I am informed that what I said at the time was right.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will accept my effort to demonstrate the inconsistency of what Deputy Fitzpatrick says on the one hand and Deputy Cooney says on the other.  In a sense I am not blaming them for this.  This is highly technical, it is extremely difficult, it is very hard to understand it.  I have <Col N="1260" /> spent hours studying it.  Here was an instance this morning of two Deputies who are purporting to make the same point&mdash;they are moving and seconding the same amendment&mdash;but in fact the reasons they ascribe to it are mutually exclusive because if Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendments were accepted for the reasons which he proposed the very things which Deputy Cooney wants to prevent would thereby happen. This matter is so technical and so difficult that it is regrettable that people who do not understand it from Adam and who do not know what fee farm grantors, mortgagors, mortgagees, equities of redemption or anything else are, will get up and make the most profound and sweeping statements about what is in this Bill, what is not in it, what it is purporting to do and what it is proposing not to do. The public are being continuously misled&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made a statement that this Bill would bring the battering ram back into Irish life or give a battering ram to landlords. Nothing could be further from the truth.  The fact is that subsection (5) of section I puts it beyond the slightest shadow of doubt that no landlord has the right to do under this Bill anything that he did not have the right to do before it.  That statement of Deputy Fitzpatrick's, with all due respect to him, is totally false and he must know that it is false because if <Col N="1261" /> he reads and if he understands, as he must, subsection (5) of section 1 it must be clear beyond a shadow of doubt that a landlord is not allowed to do anything under this Bill that he was not in a position to do before.</P>

      <P>That is a very different matter.  That is the very point that Deputy Cooney was making, that nobody concerned in a landlord and tenant relationship should ever be guilty of a criminal offence and that the whole thing should be allowed to go to civil remedies.  The very point that I have been trying to make throughout this is that I want to keep the criminal law in it to the very minimum.  I do not want the criminal law involved as a sanction in disputes between landlords and tenants, between mortgagors and mortgagees, between fee farm grantors and fee farm grantees, between lessors and lessees. I want to keep it out.</P>

      <P>If I were to accept Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment it would mean that as between landlord and tenant, as between fee farm grantor and fee farm grantee, the present position would not continue as it does under the Bill but in fact the criminal law could be invoked by either party against the other.  In other words the Garda, the Attorney General are dragged into things which are not alone essentially but entirely matters of private dispute between two parties in a civil action.  I want, as Deputy Cooney does, to resist bringing the Garda into that sort of situation.  I want mortgagors and mortgagees who have a dispute, landlords and tenants who have a dispute, fee farm grantors and fee farm grantees who have a dispute, to fight that out as they do at the moment in the civil courts.  I do not want it to be open to either side to bring in the Garda, to bring in the criminal law, in aid of them and I do not want this sort of dispute fought out in the criminal courts.  These types <Col N="1262" /> of disputes at the moment are fought out quite adequately to everyone's satisfaction in the civil courts.  I want that situation to continue.  For that reason I must reject these amendments because I do not want the Garda in it, I do not want the criminal law in it. I do not think I can say that often enough to try to get it across.</P>
      <P>Where you have a situation that two parties to a dispute have certain rights in property of different kinds&mdash;there is a wide variety of interests or estates in land&mdash;those people should confine any dispute between themselves to the civil law.  It would be a very retrograde step if the whole concept of criminal law were broadened to include that kind of situation.  This Bill is designed only to deal with the type of situation where persons who have no colour of right, who have no estate or interest in land come in and forcibly enter it or forcibly occupy it.</P>
      <P>When I talk about forcibly entering or forcibly occupying I want to make it very clear that these proposed offences are defined in this Bill.  In particular they are set out in sections 2 and 3 which have to be read in conjunction with the definitions in section 1.  These offences are forcible entry and forcible occupation.  They are not squatting <i>simpliciter</i>.  It must be something more.  It must be either forcible entry or forcible occupation and that is a good deal more than squatting. Therefore, it is totally misleading for Deputy Fitzpatrick to say that if a homeless man and his family decide to go into an unoccupied or empty house for shelter they are automatically lodged at the gate of Mountjoy Jail. That is emotionalism of an extreme kind.  It is worse than that.  It is a gross misrepresentation of the position.  Before there can be any question of a man being summoned in respect of any offence under this Bill he must have committed the offences set out in sections 2 and 3, forcible entry and forcible occupation.  They are very different to simple squatting.</P>

      <P>I made it clear at the very beginning of the Second Stage of this Bill several months ago, in the first speech I made on it, that the sort of situation where a man or family go into a place that is unoccupied for the purpose of seeking temporary shelter and while they do not seek to bar themselves in in such a way that they can remain permanently or semi-permanently there, those people will not commit any offence under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I repeat that any person or family in those circumstances going in for temporary shelter are not necessarily&mdash;unless they go further and do the acts set out in the Bill&mdash;committing any offence.  Therefore, to make this sweeping statement about homeless people looking for shelter being locked in Mountjoy jail is totally wrong and misleading.  I do not know how often I must repeat that in order to get it across.  I begin to despair.  No matter how often I say these things if certain people get certain ideas about a Bill like this they will simply continue to propagate them regardless of the facts.  The Bill could well become associated in the public mind with things that are not in it at all.  I see in that a grave danger to the whole legislative process.  You could have a situation, particularly when you put it the other way around, where it is alleged that things are not in the Bill which, in fact, are in it and the Bill is passed without public outcry for that reason. If what is in the Bill were known there would be a public outcry which might prevent the Bill being passed.  That is the converse of the case here.  Here we have the situation where it is alleged that things are being done in the Bill which are not being done and people who would otherwise be very much in favour of the Bill tend to feel they must oppose it for that reason.</P>

      <P>I have dealt fully with the points made and as clearly as <Col N="1264" /> I could.  I have tried to explain them as best I could.  Putting it mildly, the essential effects of these two proposed alternative amendments are highly technical and difficult to understand and even when one grasps them one must apply them in practice to a whole series of particular instances in the law of property.  I think I have shown already the traps a person could quite unwittingly fall into in making generalised or sweeping statements on this matter.  Quite unwittingly Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Cooney are proposing the same amendment in order to achieve, as it were, opposite effects.  That, in itself, is an eloquent commentary on the difficulties involved and had I not dealt fully with the other objections it would be a very good argument against the acceptance of these amendments because, whatever they are designed to cure, they would inevitably create far greater problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister has emphasised repeatedly in the discussion on this amendment and the mis-definition of ownership that he does not want to involve the criminal law in spheres where the civil law is adequate.  In my respectful opinion if there is any field of operations in which the civil law is more than adequate to deal with the situation it is in the field of landlord and tenant.  The Minister may say that is an argument in his favour: it is no such thing.  What the Minister is doing here is encouraging the introduction of criminal activities into the relationship of landlord and tenant and then he is writing into the Bill in black and white that it shall not be a criminal offence.  That is precisely what he is doing here.  Activities of a landlord which, under the law as it now stands, might be regarded as illegal and might fall within the criminal code will, when this Bill becomes law, be specifically excluded because the measure when it becomes an Act will be regarded as the standard authority on the law of illegal occupation or forcible entry or forcible occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has been introduced, according to the Minister, to tidy up the law and clearly state the law.  In section 1 (3) it says that &ldquo;nothing in this Act <Col N="1265" /> shall apply to an entry or an occupation of land or a vehicle in the exercise of lawful authority or with the permission of the owner&rdquo;.  It does not matter what the owner does; he can shake this Bill in the face of any member of the Garda or any Minister and say: &ldquo;Oireachtas Éireann decided that I could do what I liked because I am a fee farm grantor and even if I am not entitled to possession I am put in a privileged position.&rdquo;  It is no argument for the Minister to say that section 5 ensures that nothing in the Act can be regarded as conferring on any person any right to enter or occupy land which did not exist immediately before the commencement of the Act.  It will say that while A, B and C will be guilty of a criminal offence, the remote landlord will not be guilty. I am convinced that the Minister is in fact introducing into the landlord and tenant code criminal activities and then proceeding to declare that they are not criminal.</P>
    <P>Just now the Minister made some play about squatting.  I did not mention the word &ldquo;squatting&rdquo; this morning. I know if there is a house with no doors or windows and somebody goes in and sits on the floor he is not committing an offence under this legislation unless he does so by threatening somebody outside that if he does not let him in he will beat him up or break his face.  &ldquo;Forcible&rdquo; is described here as meaning &ldquo;using or threatening to use force&rdquo;&mdash;for the time being we will leave out &ldquo;threatening to use force&rdquo;. This means that if the door of a vacant house is closed, if a homeless man who has a wife and family comes along and puts his shoulder to the door, it could be said that he used force and that he has committed a crime.  When this Bill becomes law that man may be arrested without warrant.  I defy the Minister to contradict that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> He has committed an offence under section 2.  We should remember that we are talking about a homeless man who has a wife and children.  Of course, if he leaves when requested to <Col N="1266" /> do so that is all right.  However, the absentee landlord who acts through his bullyboy and who uses ten times as much force has a charter in this Bill which will declare that he is not guilty of an offence.  I am surprised that the Minister has tried to confuse the issue here by saying that a fee farm grantor is a rare bird and that fee farm grantees are few and far between. I would say that a large percentage of the homes in this city are held under fee farm grants or are carved out of fee farm grants.  I know that in many towns most of the property is held under fee farm grants from local landlords.  In many cases fee farm grants of two or three acres were given 50 or 100 years ago; they are now split up into building sites and houses are built on them.  I am not a statistician but I should be interested to know what percentage of the houses in built-up areas are held under fee farm grants.  I am sure the Minister would find a big percentage are so held.</P>
      <P>I repeat that so far as section 5 is concerned it merely writes in some kind of pious expression, that it does not confer a right on the landlord to bully his way in, in that he is answerable to the civil law.  However, it places him in a privileged position; it says he can act the bully as much as he likes and that he has subsection (3) of section 1 to protect him.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not deal with the position of the mischievous or artistic landlord who wants to protect himself against the demolition of houses in Dublin.  He can do this under this Bill because he can issue authorities <i>ad lib</i> to all the people who are interested in co-operating with him and they will not be guilty of an offence. I am pointing that out to demonstrate the absurdity&mdash;and so far as this Bill is concerned, the futility&mdash;of this definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same protection should be afforded to law-abiding tenants against the criminal landlord as against any other person indulging in criminal activities.  From the Minister's opening remarks I know that he sees the force of the objections I have put up against this definition but he has been advised <Col N="1267" /> in the old and best departmental tradition that it is never likely that such things will happen in his time.  He has probably been told that if he changes the definition he will run into other kinds of criticism.  This is the kind of advice he has received and has accepted. We have heard this argument used in this House from time to time: that it is unreasonable to think somebody would be guilty of this kind of thing but that if the Minister yields he will let himself in for trouble in other directions. I am going to press this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 29, after &ldquo;tenancy&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or permissive occupation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is again an amendment of the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo;.  On Committee Stage the definition was extended by the Minister to incluude a person who remains in occupation of land after the termination of his tenancy. The reason behind this extension was, I think, to ensure that a person overholding on notice to quit or a decree for possession would not be guilty of a criminal offence and criminal sanctions would not be invoked against him.  This is perfectly acceptable to me, but it does not go far enough.  It does not deal with the person who stays on following the termination of a permissive occupation.</P>
      <P>The amendment is necessary in that a permissive occupation is not a tenancy. There is no element of contract and, on the termination of such a permissive occupation, the protection the Minister sought to include would not be available.  It is a very common situation to have tenants at will.  I am thinking now of persons in occupation of gate lodges or houses in connection with their employment.  Such occupation may have continued for a long number of years.  There was a case in Tullamore lately where a family occupying a gate lodge, tenants at will or permissive occupiers, were evicted. They were not able to go as quickly as the landlord wished and they were actually evicted.  I think they barred themselves into the gate lodge and there is no doubt that would have been forcible occupation within the meaning of section 3.  I do not think the Minister would intend that such persons, who had been in possession, and their predecessors before them, of such premises should be guilty of a criminal offence under this Bill.  That would be contrary to the spirit of the Minister's reasons for introducing his Bill; he said it was designed to get at people who resort to violent and crude methods.</P>
      <P>My amendment would cover persons in the category I have described.  A farm worker might have a house in connection with his employment. His people before him might have worked for generations on the same farm and been in occupation of the same house as permissive tenants.  If there should be a change of ownership and the Land Commission or some German decided the cottage was needed and sought to remove the permissive tenant, having terminated his employment, and that tenant refused to go, he could be guilty of an offence under this Bill.  That tenant should not be subject to the sanctions of this Bill. That is another example of persons who would come within the scope of my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important thing is to ensure that any person with a right could not be guilty of an offence under this Bill. The Minister accepted that general principle, the idea being to keep the criminal law and the civil law entirely separate.  As the Minister pointed out when he was alleging inconsistency as between Deputy Fitzpatrick and myself, it is just not possible to keep the two branches of the law separate.  That is a defect in this Bill.  That is the whole difficulty.  The borderline between the two branches criss-crosses to the detriment of the law generally.  The Minister, in trying to keep the criminal law out of what is a matter of personal <Col N="1271" /> contention between two parties, must in some of the definitions and sections unavoidably allow the criminal law to enter and the persons in dispute would then, according to this Bill, have the option of taking their civil remedy or calling in the gardaí.  The gardaí would possibly have no option but to act on the complaint made.  At the moment they can refuse to interfere on the ground that these matters are essentially matters of civil law.  The Minister says he does not want the gardaí brought into what are essentially title disputes, but it is inevitable this will happen.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to accept this amendment because it softens what could be a very harsh situation for innocent people very far removed from the type of person against whom the Minister aims this Bill.  They would be far removed from the type of person who resorts to violent and crude methods for remaining in forcible occupation or taking forcible possession. The person covered by this amendment would be the exact opposite. He would be a person in possession for very many years but he might not have a legal right under the law as it stands; he would, however, have an unassailable moral case not to be evicted and to prevent eviction and that person should not be touched in any way by the criminal sanctions of this Bill.  It should be a matter purely and simply for the civil law.  If the owner uses the battering ram in those circumstances he is using it without the sanction of the criminal law; he is invoking the civil law as it stands. It would be sad to see an owner doing such a thing.  Regrettably it happened in Tullamore, but that particular episode ended happily; the people who were ejected were housed by the local authority because the local authority had compassion for their plight.  I should not like to see persons in that situation being arrested for committing a serious criminal offence.  Persons in that category should be included in the exemptions: any person with a colour of right should be exempted from the penalties of this Bill.  That person would not, I submit, be covered by the exemptions contained in subsection (5) of section 1 which says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> Nothing in this Act shall be regarded as conferring on any person any right to entry or occupation of land which did not exist immediately before the commencement of this Act.</P>
    <P>That would have nothing to do with the cases I have in mind where the permissive occupation of the tenancy at will would be determined.  To determine it all at once is a simple demand of possession; there is not even the necessity to serve a notice to quit. The simple demand of possession followed by a summons can in most of these cottier tenancies permit the owner of the property to sue for possession. I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party support this amendment.  There are many people who do not have a legal right to their continued occupation of the premises.  The result of this particular section would be that the new powers given for their removal would mean that such people would be put in a most unfortunate and invidious position.  Though they might claim, in Deputy Cooney's words an unassailable moral right to continue possession all power would be given to the caregories of owners mentioned in the Bill to remove them with the full sanction of criminal law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever the Minister may say about his overall intent in this Bill I do not think he can defend such a resulting situation.  I do not know if the Minister expressed any willingness to accept this amendment but I cannot think of any argument that he could put forward for rejecting it.  It seems to me an eminently reasonable amendment and one that possibly covers a great many other cases than those mentioned by Deputy Cooney and it protects them.  There are possibly many agreements to stay on in tenancies which have nothing to do with a standardised position under the law, only the benevolence of the owner or the existing arrangement between the owner and the tenant protects these people.  With a change of ownership a person who was not guilty either of coming on to the premises by force originally, or not coming on illegally, <Col N="1273" /> could be in a very peculiar position if this amendment is not accepted.  Such people living with full approval on a particular premises may after the death of the person who gave the approval find themselves in a very difficult legal position with the new owner who may claim rights under this Bill for immediate vacant possession.  A case in Tullamore was mentioned and I am sure there are other cases around the country.  I would join with Deputy Cooney in asking the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every sympathy with the purpose behind Deputy Cooney's amendment.  I have expressed myself already as being in sympathy with people involved in the particular type of cases which he mentioned but I am afraid, for reasons which I shall explain, I cannot accept the amendment. I am satisfied that if it was adopted it would curtail drastically the efficacy of section 3 which covers the offence of forcible occupation.  In the type of case with which that section is designed to deal it very often happens that persons enter lawfully into a building with the licence or permission of the owner and, having gained entry, then proceed to remain in forcible occupation.  If the word &ldquo;owner&rdquo; as defined in section 1 were to include a person who remains on land after the termination of the licence which entitled him to go in there in the first place the effect would be to exempt from the scope of the offence provided for in section 3 the very persons whose activity gives rise to the need to create the offence in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully appreciate that Deputy Cooney's amendment refers to permissive occupation and not to mere physical presence on land by someone who has permission to be there. Nevertheless, this is a criminal statute and it is to be expected that the courts would lean over backwards to give defendants the benefit of the most liberal interpretation of what might constitute occupation.  Indeed, the Parliamentary draftsman has advised that if we were to seek to open the door at all by accepting this amendment we might well find we had opened the floodgates and that the <Col N="1274" /> effect of section 3 could thereby be largely nullified.  I am afraid I cannot undertake to accept that risk.</P>
    <P>A further consideration is that acceptance of the amendment would mean that the scope of the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; would be very greatly enlarged and we would have the anomalous situation in which a person merely being on land with the owner's consent and who remained on after the consent had expired would have an equal status, so far as the Bill is concerned, with the person having a proper legal interest in the land.  I know that Deputy Cooney's concern is primarily with the type of case in which a person has been in occupation of a house for a long time under, for example, a caretaker's agreement, and then finds the owner's permission is withdrawn.  In that connection I would invite his attention to the fact that if a person remains on in forcible occupation of the house in the honest belief that he has a claim of right to be there he will not be committing an offence under section 3 by virtue of the words at the end of subsection (1) &ldquo;remains thereon in pursuance of a <i>bona fide</i> claim of right&rdquo;.  Deputy Cooney has mentioned the type of case that he would like to see covered and I agree with him that type of case is one in which a person or family have been in occupation of a gate lodge or a similar building for a very long time, often 50 years or more, and even though they have only been there as caretakers or licensees they, in a sort of vague non-legal way, regard it as their house.  They do feel they have a claim to it.  They have a very high and very strong moral claim to it and that claim is sufficient to bring them within the wording at the end of subsection (1) of section 3.</P>
    <P>In any event, where there was such a situation, in practice the gardaí would not bring a prosecution because it would be clear to them that this was a case in which the occupier felt that he had a <i>bona fide</i> claim of right. There would be few who would dispute that feeling or that claim with him, in a non-legal sense at any rate.  The nub of the difficulty is that if I were to accept the amendment, much as I <Col N="1275" /> am in sympathy with it and attempted to do it, because this is a criminal statute and because the definitions must be made or construed by the court for the benefit of the defendant as widely as possible, mere invitees and licensees would be covered by it too because they are permissive occupants of a different type but they would come under that phrase.  Somebody who goes into a shop or an office is an invitee or a licensee as the case may be and the situation would be that all those people would be exempted from the provisions of the Bill.  Those people who go in as invitees or licensees to a business premises or a similar property and proceed forcibly to remain in occupation are the type of people we are endeavouring to deal with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I did think that, perhaps, if we added the words &ldquo;excluding licensees and invitees&rdquo; to the words suggested in Deputy Cooney's amendment I might be able to meet the point but I am afraid, on reflection, that will not work because the actual people in possession under a caretaker's agreement or something similar are themselves either invitees or licensees.  They are more normally licensees.  Because it is a criminal statute it must be construed in a way that where there is any doubt the defendant gets the benefit of it. I do not think that Deputy Cooney, in fact, need worry on the point that he has made because I think the words at the end of subsection (1) of section 3 will cover that situation in practice.</P>

      <P>The Minister has just told us that he has every sympathy with the motives behind the amendment, the purpose envisaged by it, but at the same time that he is not going to accept it.  The main reason, as I understand it, for his non-acceptance was that this being a criminal statute the courts would, as he said, lean over backwards in favour of defendants under it and that, therefore, apparently, this tendency had to be compensated for or counteracted in the wording of the statute itself.  It seems to me that this is an odd general principle to invoke the general principles of law and the general practice of the <Col N="1276" /> courts.  These are, in fact, designed to protect against the possibility of unjust conviction.  If this humane tendency which is part of the legal heritage&mdash; only part of it&mdash;which does exist, is deliberately to be offset in the wording of our legislation so that the judges are as far as possible to be constrained in the other direction, it seems to me that we are introducing a very odd principle at this stage.</P>

      <P>I know.  Only the Minister understands anything. This principle has been made very clear in a series of extremely arrogant interventions here.  It is generally, I think, taken that one of the purposes of discussion by Members is to enable people to have a say who have no professional grasp of the technicalities involved.  We are not supposed to be an association or group of technical people and if the technicalities are unclear it is the Minister's duty to explain them to the House and to do so in a reasonable tone without brushing aside all who differ from him as ignorant and incapable of discourse.</P>
      <P>I do think that the principle invoked here by the Minister is a dangerous one and one which has a tendency in favour of draconian legislation and I think also it exemplifies the general state of mind behind this Bill which is one indifferent to or contemptuous of the whole structure of conventions which we know as civil rights and I think that in every detailed intervention in the discussion of every amendment here this pattern becomes more and more clear that the tendency of this Government is to introduce legislation and enagage in practices which may erode and eventually destroy civil rights in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this humanitarian tendency, the case for which was made so forcibly, so convincingly, by Deputy Cooney, in fact, the Minister has simply no answer to it, to me as a layman.  I support Deputy Cruise-O'Brien's plea to the Minister <Col N="1277" /> to try to remember that he is talking to laymen and that is our function as legislators.  We are laymen attempting to legislate and it is the function of the Minister to explain in the clearest possible terms to us as laymen so that we can take a decision one way or another, for or against his proposals, as representatives of the vast majority of laymen in the community. If he does not make his case clearly to us it is no good to dismiss us as not being technocrats in law and for that reason incapable of understanding what he has in mind.</P>
      <P>It is of no use whatever to the unfortunate person to whom Deputy Cooney referred to know that the Minister is in sympathy with the general proposal that the person who has been in occupation over a long period of time should be protected but that he finds that, clever and all as he is, skilled and all as he is in the intricacies of the law and skilled as his advisers are in the law and as his Parliamentary draftsmen are, in regard to this case which he supports, the case for this type of person with whom he sympathises and in respect of whom he says there is a very valid argument for an attempt to be made to protect him in the way suggested by Deputy Cooney, he must say: &ldquo;Technically we cannot protect them; technically it is outside the capacity of the Parliamentary draftsman or of myself who have given hours to the whole consideration of this question to protect these people and, therefore, these people shall not be protected.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a very extraordinary attitude for a Minister or a Government or a Dáil to adopt.  A case has already been cited and the case is simply one of a number of such cases, not only in rural Ireland but in urban areas as well, of a speculator who comes in, takes over a vast estate or a property and somebody happens to be in this property, in the lodge or in a cottage on the estate, in possession as caretaker, whatever it may be.  This additional support is now being given against the person who has a traditional or, as the Minister himself admitted, a very strong moral case&mdash;&ldquo;high moral claim,&rdquo; is what he said&mdash;to continued possession of this property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1278" /> Of course, this suggestion that the courts may lean over backwards keeps occurring in the governmental <i>pronunciamientos</i> on these different issues from time to time.  Deputy Faulkner used it recently.  It has absolutely no meaning whatever in law.  I am surprised that a lawyer should advance it as if it had any meaning.  I should like the Minister to say has it any meaning and if it has any meaning would the Minister try to explain to us why is it that the person mentioned by Deputy Cooney was, effectively, forcibly ejected from a cottage and if it was not for the humanitarian attitude of the local authority the person concerned, whoever he was, would have pursued the law against the leaning-over-backwards judge on the bench, if he was leaning over backwards&mdash;I do not know whether he was or was not.  He was not very successful, apparently, because the person was in fact forced to leave the property and the local authority was forced, out of compassion for this unfortunate person, to provide him with a house and by so doing denied somebody else the right to that house.  It all started with this person who took over the property and insisted on his rights in spite of this provision which the Minister says is in our laws and in spite of what he says about it being within the power of the judiciary to lean over backwards and interpret the law in their own way.  It seems to me that if the law is drafted with such precision as the Minister insists there is, then there shall be precision in relation to it and there can be no way in which one can get around the precise words and phrases put in in this House by the Minister acting on the advice of his advisers.  The Minister sweeps away the whole element of precision in saying that a judge has a right to lean over backwards and break the law.  Has he the right to break it? Surely his job is to administer the law as we write it here in this House.  If he has the right to break the law, what is the purpose of taking up all the time of the House by deciding whether it shall be an &ldquo;if&rdquo;, or &ldquo;but&rdquo; or whether it shall be &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or &ldquo;will&rdquo; lest the unfortunate judge be not clear as to precisely what we had in <Col N="1279" /> mind when we framed the laws?</P>
    <P>The Minister was contradicted before he sat down by the point made by Deputy Cooney in relation to the case in Tullamore.  There are many precedents up to this and no doubt there will be many other cases subsequent to that particular one that will not be covered by this extraordinary new O'Malley principle of the judge in his bench leaning over backwards and breaking the law, bending the law, twisting the law, perverting, misusing or misapplying the law in order to try to honour the humanitarian principles for which, in my view, the Minister hypocritically expressed concern. It is no good coming here and supporting the sympathetic case made by the Deputy who proposed this amendment and then, with all the authority of the Minister for Justice and with all the legal expertise at his disposal, saying: &ldquo;There is nothing I can do about it. I agree with the case being made.  I appreciate that we should try to protect these people but the law cannot protect.&rdquo;</P>

I cannot exempt them in so many words.  Unfortunately we cannot devise a section which would protect them in the way we would like them to be protected but, take it from me, a nod is as good as a wink to the gardaí and the judiciary.

He can now take up occupation in that house because, in retrospect, we have, with the authority of the Minister for Justice, said that he should never have been put out of the house; in fact, the gardaí should never have taken the case; in fact the <Col N="1283" /> judge, if it were brought to the courts, would never have put the man out; in fact the local authority panicked because the man did not need a local authority house, he had a good house and nobody would have dispossessed him of the house and nobody ever will dispossess him of the house.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am not replying.  I have not intervened. It is sometimes said that Parliamentary debate is a waste of time.  We hear criticism of long Committee Stages and long Report Stages of Bills but as we get through a Bill of this sort I think the power of Parliament becomes apparent.  While it might be going too far to say it is powerful when you have a Government with a majority who will not listen to the Opposition, it is certainly valid to say that it is a powerful forum for ventilating the rights of the citizen and for pointing out proposals in Bills which invade the rights of the citizen no matter how lowly he is.</P>
      <P>I spent a considerable time here this morning trying to get the Minister to accept an amendment which sought to amend the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; by deleting part of the definition which defined &ldquo;owner&rdquo; as a person having any interest in land.  I did that because I thought that it was unfair that an absentee landlord, under a fee farm grant, who would never be entitled to ownership of land, could be entitled to come in and forcibly take possession of the land and eject his tenant and still would be immune from the provisions of this Bill when it becomes an Act.  The Minister told me then that the civil law was adequate to deal with the relationship of landlord and tenant and that the tenant should use the civil law to get rid of the offending landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have gone, in this proposal of the Minister's, to the other extreme when it comes to the most humble type of tenant.  I agree with some of <Col N="1284" /> the Labour Deputies that they should not be criticised by the Minister for not being all legal experts.  It has been a criticism of some people in this House that they have legal qualifications. By and large, this is a House of lay people speaking lay people's language, trying to understand it, and trying to bring common sense to bear on the deliberations of the House.  We come to the other end of the scale and we are dealing with the most lowly type of tenant, the permissive occupant, perhaps not in strict legal parlance described as a tenant but somebody who has been in legal occupation of a building, the gate lodge which is the most humble type of abode that anybody can occupy, until perhaps he is no longer any use.  He has occupied it for 50 or 60 years.  He has become feeble and is not able to perform the services demanded of him. Is the landlord here to be left to his civil rights to get this man out?  He is not because this permissive occupant, as the Bill stands, is to be brought within the criminal law, is to be treated as a criminal if he refuses to get out when the landlord tells him to do so.  He becomes a criminal under this Bill.  Such a contrast! The absentee landlord is to be above the law.  The lowly permissive occupant is to be a criminal.  It is to be perfectly legal for the owner of this house to take the permissive occupant&mdash;the herd, the caretaker&mdash;by the back of the neck and throw him out.  He will not have to rely on the civil law and take proceedings in the district court under which he does not even have to serve a notice to quit because there is the most simple, inexpensive summary provision made for dealing with permissive occupants.  You simply demand possession, serve a summons, go to the district court and get an order. That would be too much trouble to impose on the landlord in this case. Whether he is a foreign speculator, a native speculator or the Land Commission he is to be saved that trouble.  He is to be able to go in forcibly and throw this man out by the back of the neck.  If he is not fit to do it he can hire a couple of bullyboys to assist him and they will not be guilty of an offence under this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1285" /> I would not speak so strongly on this were it not for the fact that at the other end of the scale the Minister could not discommode the absentee landlord who wants to effect forcible possession and take physical occupation of a premises that he is not entitled to and the Minister must concede he is not entitled to it.  He is to be left to the civil law but this humble caretaker, the permissive occupant is to be at the mercy of violence and force and the big speculator, although there is already the simplest and most summary machinery built into the law, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows. The argument that was put forward by the Minister in support of bringing the criminal code into forcible entry was&mdash;and to some extent I agree&mdash; that to get out a person who took illegal possession of property action must be taken on the title in the circuit court and that could go on indefinitely, but here we have the most summary provisions for getting out a permissive occupant, no notice to quit, no action on the title, simply a summons provided in the old days to protect the landlord and ensure that he would not have much trouble in getting out permissive occupants of this type.</P>
    <P>The Minister was not here when I was speaking.  I know he cannot sit here all the time but I shall conclude by saying that I was doing my best to point out that while the Minister is quite prepared to tolerate the absentee landlord using force against his tenant in respect of a building to which he is not entitled and is prepared to leave the tenant to resort to the civil courts to get him out, he is prepared to allow the owner or landlord to take a permissive occupant who has been in occupation of a building for 50 years by the back of the neck and throw him out.  If the landlord is not able to do that physically he can get the Garda to prosecute.  I say that is completely wrong and utterly inconsistent.  At the highest level of the landlord and tenant code the Minister says the head landlord need not resort to the civil court or, in case the Minister says I am misrepresenting him, he is saying that if he does not resort to the civil court and takes the law into his own hands, <Col N="1286" /> the Minister will not blame him and the Garda will not be entitled to prosecute him and the tenant can take civil proceedings.  But when we go to the lower rung of the ladder we find that the owner of a gate lodge or a bit of land occupied by a man and his family for generations is treated very differently.  If that man, after getting a simple demand to get out, does not get out, he can be bundled out and if he stays on, the criminal law will operate to throw him out as a person violating the criminal law.</P>
    <P>I wonder does the Minister appreciate the contrast?  Do the members of his party realise the distinction we are making here between the head landlord, on the one hand, and the lowest form of tenant life on the other? I will not accept from the Minister that a permissive occupant is not a tenant.  He may not be a tenant in the hard definition of the law but he is a man who got into possession by rightful means and, perhaps, had possession for years by law and is only being thrown out now because the big ranch can no longer pay the rates and is being sold to some foreign speculator who does not appreciate the relationship that existed here and who cannot have his driveway obstructed or suffer the inconvenience of having somebody living on his property and gets the criminal law to throw them out.  If the Minister thought hard enough about this he would accept Deputy Cooney's amendment as one in keeping with the spirit of his definition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The failure of the Minister to accept this reasonable amendment, put down by Deputies <Col N="1287" /> Cooney and Fitzpatrick, will, in practice, provide encouragement to landlords or their agents and owners, as defined in the Bill, to institute proceedings against, one might say, any occupancy on which they want to get their hands.  Every occupancy will, in time, one might say, be brought into question.  As Members of the House well know many thousands of occupancies are of a casual, traditional nature, a caretaker or general takeover nature. The structure of land inheritance, because of the history of land development and agitation by the people, is such that not many Members of the House cannot trace back more than a few generations without calling into question in many cases the means by which they or their forefathers came to live on a particular piece of property. There are many occupancies for which people would find it extremely difficult to produce watertight titles. The failure of the Minister to accept the concept of permissive occupation will give rise to considerable difficulty and agitation in the future.</P>
      <P>Land values and property values generally have increased very considerably in recent years.  We in this country have a great propensity for agitation and litigation in relation to land and its ownership and no law should be so devised as to form what one might call a lawyers' paradise out of a situation in which people can suffer severely.  The definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; in section 1 is so wide that it is an open invitation to persons to indulge in such litigation.  I am surprised that the Minister has kept on reassuring Deputies that in certain circumstances a prosecution will not evolve; these references bear no relation to what is in the Bill.  I am surprised that a man who professes such legal expertise would fall into that kind of trap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he has every sympathy with those who have moral claims by virtue of traditional casual occupancy over a long period.  He considered that if any such person found himself in court his moral claims would be respected; no garda would bring a prosecution or no judge would <Col N="1288" /> feel constrained to lay the heavy hand of the law on such a person.  The fact is that there is provision in the Bill that such could happen.  I do not think any spiritual comfort the Minister might give to the person concerned will alleviate the worry we have in regard to this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that the Garda would not necessarily bring a prosecution and he was very irate when this was fired back at him by Deputy Browne.  I heard the Minister say that a person who had a moral claim or was in traditional occupancy need not worry because the Garda would not be constrained to bring prosecution.  However, that does not stop land agents. In these days when the mineral re-cources of the country are being subjected to close scrutiny it does not stop owners suddenly coming into possession of new title; it does not stop them from going to the Garda Síochána and from launching into prosecutions. Irrespective of the goodwill that may be displayed by the Garda Síochána towards the people concerned, they may not have the benefit of such goodwill if litigation is indulged in.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is entirely proper that a law should be adopted on the basis of what a Garda superintendent might like to do.  We do not legislate on the basis of the goodwill interpretation of members of the Garda Síochána.  The Garda themselves would agree that this is not good law or justice.  In conscience, the Minister should accept the amendment.  It is reasonable and just and it will get rid of much of the complaints made in relation to the section, particularly by Deputy Cooney.  We are in a difficulty on Report Stage because, once again, the Minister himself becomes the interpretative authority.  He has taken interpretative responsibility to himself; he is not entitled to do this because what the law will say in the future is what matters, not what the Minister now thinks the law might interpret in future.</P>
    <P>I have noticed in relation to the division already called on this section that such is the bemused contempt of the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Haughey, for this Bill he sits in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery.  He <Col N="1289" /> has such contempt for this Bill he did not even vote for the Government this morning in relation to this Bill.</P>

Whether we are legal experts or not I do not think the petulant query by the Minister will get him very far in this debate.  I do not know any property lawyer or any person of eminence in this field who has come out in favour of this section. I do not know of any authoritative source in that regard who is prepared to defend the Minister.  The Minister should read the article by Senator Robinson in today's <i>Irish Times</i> and he would appreciate the public's repugnance of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Since I became a member of the Oireachtas, there are certain principles of legislation which I have understood to apply.  First, that one should seek clarity in legislation and, secondly, that one should legislate in such a way that the law is enforceable and enforced.  In relation to any Bill the Minister brings into the Dáil, because of inability to draft it correctly, he should not say that the law will not be enforced.  I understood another principle of legislation to be that there is no problem of the kind we are discussing which cannot be resolved by some form of drafting.  I understand the Minister this morning has been breaching these principles of legislation and has been knocking them down like skittles in relation to this matter.  I was not here during part of his speech, but if I am not correct I am sure the Minister will put me right.  I understand that the Minister has indicated that while he is in sympathy with the purpose of the amendment <Col N="1290" /> he does not want to include more than certain types of cases within the amendment; he is not prepared to accept it in its present form and cannot devise an alternative.  The Minister's solution is that the Garda Síochána will not prosecute.</P>
      <P>This is intolerable, not only on a political basis between the Government and Opposition but as a principle of legislation.  Our job in this House is to try to legislate to ensure that the law is clear and precise.  The law should do what it states&mdash;no more or less.  It should be drafted with clarity; the law should be enforceable and should be enforced.  Any other approach leads to the law falling into disrepute.</P>
      <P>It ill becomes the Minister for Justice to adopt the attitude he has adopted this morning, to suggest that while he is in sympathy with the idea, he cannot see how it can be done.  He thinks the amendment goes too far and he is incapable of devising an amendment that would meet the point.  His answer is to let the law fall into disrepute and not be enforced.  We must protest against this attitude and ask the Minister to reconsider the position.  Neither he nor any other Minister is entitled to adopt this position, above all a Minister for Justice who, one would have thought, would have available to him sufficient legal advice to enable him to re-draft an amendment if the form of the draft by the Opposition unintentionally goes beyond what the Opposition are seeking and does something which he is not prepared to agree to and when there is a clear principle with which he is in sympathy.</P>

      <P>That is a different point altogether.  Of course, if there is a <i>bona fide</i> claim of right in those circumstances that is covered in the Bill, but we are talking about cases which may not come within that.  It may be that some of the cases we mentioned <Col N="1292" /> may be covered by that, but some of them may not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He may or he may not.  It depends on the circumstances in which he is there and the nature of the permission given to him over that period.  I have not got the legal knowledge the Minister has to know in what precise circumstances that constitutes a <i>bona fide</i> claim of right. There is a good legal authority here, and the Minister does not appear to have controverted it, that there are circumstances in which permissive occupation does not constitute a <i>bona fide</i> claim of right.  If there can be such circumstances, then the Bill cannot be enacted in its present form without offending against the principle to which the Minister has subscribed, and which he has sought to implement by his acceptance of the concept of the <i>bona fide</i> claim of right.</P>
      <P>It would appear from what has been said, and from what the Minister said himself, that the <i>bona fide</i> claim of right principle, which he has accepted, may not extend to some of these cases.  It is the duty of both sides of this House to implement what is the clear wish of both sides of the House to cover these cases.  We cannot allow ourselves to be put into the position of being told that we are incapable of drafting a Bill to achieve the purpose we want to achieve.  That is something which Parliaments do not accept.  The job of Parliament is to draft the Bill in the form they want it.  It is well within the power of the Government and the Opposition, especially with the legal advice available to the Government, to do just that.  It has been suggested, and it is apparently the position, that if a person in permissive occupation has not got what would be judged in a court of law to be a <i>bona fide</i> claim of right, the landlord can act against him with impunity under this Bill.  I should like to ask the Minister whether this is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One curious feature of this legislation is that in introducing section 2 the <Col N="1293" /> Minister purported to be replacing earlier legislation.  He said section 2 was necessary because although everything in it, as he claimed at that time, was in earlier legislation&mdash;the Forcible Entry Acts of the 14th and 15th centuries in particular&mdash;these Acts were so ancient that courts were reluctant to enforce them and, therefore, it was necessary to enact the same principles in a modern Act so that these Acts would be brought up to date.  I was never quite sure that the Minister was correct in saying, as I understood him to say, that all section 2 did was to implement existing Acts and to codify or re-enact them.</P>
    <P>My understanding of those Acts is that they were, in fact, enacted to prevent the displacement of a lawful occupier by his landlord by force and that problems arose in that century of a kind not dissimilar to those that have arisen in the past year or two of landlords or owners of property seeking to by-pass the civil law and take the law into their own hands by forcibly ejecting occupiers who were lawful occupiers and who were entitled to remain there until civil proceedings had been taken to eject them.  That is what those Acts were for.  As I pointed out in this House, the Irish Act of 1402 was distinguished from the earlier British Act by the special provision that, not alone was it an offence for a landlord or any other person so to eject a lawful occupier, but the occupier concerned was entitled under the Irish law to re-occupy at the end of that period, whereas in English law, although it was an offence to put him out, once he was out he had to stay out, as was shown by the Stoke Poges case in 1921.  That was the Irish law on the matter.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not repeal these laws. Am I, therefore, correct in thinking that they remain in force and that the situation now is that, if somebody in permissive occupation is, in fact, put out by a landlord in accordance with this Bill, both the landlord and the tenant or the occupier will be in contravention of different statutes and amenable to the criminal law?  Is that the situation if these earlier Acts remain in force?  This seems a rather curious kind of situation to create.  If not, how <Col N="1294" /> are the earlier laws not in force when the Minister is not repealing them? What is the purpose of section 2 of the Bill?  The Minister said it was to replace the earlier laws but he has not repealed them.  I am in a state of confusion as to what the law is or will be when this Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not purport to repeal existing laws designed to protect the occupier.  Yet this Bill is designed to give to the owner of property rights against an occupier.  It appears to me that under this Bill we are setting up an extraordinary conflict of laws in which everybody will be in the wrong. The Minister may find great satisfaction in seeing the whole lot going to jail but I do not think it should be our purpose to set up such conflicts of laws that, in circumstances of the kind contemplated here, everybody concerned on both sides is wrong and goes to jail.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in a state of great confusion over this Bill.  The House is in a state of confusion over it.  We should have this point clarified before we go any further.  Is it the case that the existing laws remain and that the Minister could have answered Deputy Cooney's criticisms in these terms?  I want to know if the fact that he did not do so has any significance.  Would somebody taking the action suggested here be in contravention of these earlier statutes?  Are they still law?  Is that the case or is the Minister claiming that they have fallen into desuetude and that they are not the law at the moment?  What is the position?  Who will offend against what law in the cases mentioned here?</P>
    <P>The confusion between bringing in this Bill to replace earlier laws and not, in fact, replacing them and leaving a contradictory situation, and the Minister's ineptitude in refusing even to contemplate trying to enact the will of both sides of the House in this matter by saying he is incapable of finding a form of words to achieve this, have left us in an impossible position.  The only thing we can do in these circumstances is to minimise the damage done by the confusion created by the Minister by pressing this amendment.</P>

      <P>I cannot see why the Minister cannot agree to this amendment. I know there are quite a number of occupiers of property in the circumstances with which this amendment deals.  There is a certain amount of inconsistency between Government Departments because the guidelines laid down for local authorities in allocating houses to tenants do not give preferential treatment to people in houses such as these.  According to the rules of allocation local authorities regard people living in houses such as these as being in good circumstances. I could quote from personal experience several examples to prove my point.  The problem is aggravated by the fact that there is a very serious shortage of alternative housing for these people and, if this amendment is not accepted, we will be weakening the position of these occupiers and strengthening the position of their landlords. If this Bill is passed in its present form landlords will be able legally to eject, or engage a private army lawfully to eject, these tenants.  The Minister has, I think, admitted that these people have a good case.  We should ensure in any legislation we pass that these people are adequately and fully protected and that their position is not worsened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should, perhaps, start by begging the Minister to receive my efforts at expressing my ideas on matters legal charitably because, like many other Deputies, I am very far from being an expert in this field. It is possible to see a definite evolution in the law regarding property and the rights of owners of property.  That evolution has been going on for 100 years now.  We are long past the time when the law expressed the then current social opinion that the rights of the owner were in all cases paramount. Under that law the owner had a great deal of room to dispose of his property as he wished.  We have seen in all sorts of matters a continuous circumscribing of these rights of ownership.  We have seen it in the matter of death duties and the rights to pass on property. We have seen it in the right to export money from a country being severely limited.  We have seen it in <Col N="1296" /> continuing efforts of long duration to strengthen the rights of tenants as against the owners of property.  We have seen all sorts of strengthening of the position of the person in an economically subservient situation.  It is interesting, if one goes back, to find 700 years ago parallels in the law at a time when, prior to the rise of capitalism, the feudal ideas were strongly expressed in the law and the rights of the subservient and the lower classes were perfected.</P>
      <P>As I understand the complex wording of this section, it seems to me that this is flying contrary to the direction of evolution in regard to property.  It is a strengthening in a sort of 19th century capitalist sense of the right of the owner of property and a weakening of the right of the tenant.  I am not clear what exactly the legal definition of tenancy is; let me widen it and say, therefore, a weakening of the position of the occupier and a strengthening of the position of the owner.  This seems to me to be contrary to the spirit of this century in regard to the relationship between owners and tenants and owners and occupiers.  This is retrograde because in our society we clearly need legislation which all the time discriminates in a way that strengthens the position of the weaker, the poorer, the non-property-owning sections of our society.  Surely the need for equalisation and the need for social justice is recognised on both sides of this House.</P>

    <P>It may be that I am failing to understand this rather difficult section, but it does seem to me to strengthen the right of the property-owner to occupy, dispense with and do as he will with that which he owns, contrary to the general evolution.  This is an objection to the principle of this section which is, I think, the validation for the amendment we are now discussing.  I think, too, that we have entered a very strange area; I say this again in ignorance and not as a lawyer; I am simply trying to proceed on the basis of common sense and, I hope, of goodwill in this area.  It is no use saying: &ldquo;Let us write it down that way and agree to it as a sovereign Parliament and let us promulgate it as the law of the <Col N="1297" /> land because we all understand it will not quite work out that way.&rdquo;  It may be that I am misunderstanding the Minister, but this suggestion that the gardaí would not bring a case is not tenable because, even if we grant that the Minister is right in the vast majority of cases, one might get a cantankerous garda or one who in, perhaps, an unfashionable sense, felt it was his duty to carry out the law as enacted by us.</P>
    <P>At times there are signs of too much discretion and it is often very unfair to vest that sort of discretion in the Garda.  Their job is not to exercise discretion either to favour people by excusing them from prosecution, if there is a violation, nor yet to punish them by pushing a prosecution beyond that which is normally necessary: their job is simply to carry out the law as enacted, to use the old cliché, without fear or favour.  I believe that is something the gardaí would wish themselves. I think they hate being put in the position in which, so to speak, a nod is as good as a wink: the law is on the Statute Book but it does not quite mean what it says.</P>
    <P>The other side, the judges, then: it is, I admit, impossible to draw up a body of legislation which, just by reading it, can be applied to any situation. If that were the case we could computerise all the rules, ask the computer a question and the computer would give an answer.  Judges, juries and all the rest of it would be totally redundant.  There is no way in which one can remove the human element. Again, I do not think the judiciary like being put in the position in which they are showing benevolence because, if you show it on one occasion, what is the opposite of it on another occasion? Malice.  If you are benevolent to one you balance it up by being malicious to someone else.  You balance it and you do not get justice in every particular case.  From the point of view of the judges and from the point of view of the garda this sort of sanction is undesirable.</P>
    <P>I understand, and this is not an exact quotation, that the Minister said a person would have a high moral claim after 50 years.  The sad experience that one has of the world is that a very <Col N="1298" /> high moral claim is not worth a damn if there is not a legal claim which can be upheld.  This world is full of people who have very high moral claims not to have been fired out of their jobs but who are nonetheless unemployed; it is full of people who have very high moral claims to have employment in their own country but are working somewhere else; it is full of people who have very high moral claims to occupy a particular house or piece of land but they do not occupy it.  They do not have any claim in any sort of legally upholdable form. The world is full of people who have very high moral claims to things which they cannot enjoy.  Were it otherwise there would be no injustice in the world and there is patently a great deal.  The suggestion of a very high moral claim as far as I am concerned is utterly irrelevant to the process of reasonable law-making and should not be brought forward in connection with a piece of legislation at all.</P>
    <P>The final thing which makes us wish to keep reiterating our support of Deputy Cooney's amendment is the extraordinary suggestion that it is not possible to find a form of words which would explain exactly what is intended. Surely this is to deny the possibility to legislate?  If one cannot find a form of words to say what one means then one cannot make rules at all.  If, on the other hand, the Minister is admitting, and I do not want to put words into his mouth, that the distinction, which he seeks to make for reasons which seem to me to be bad reasons, is, in fact, a distinction which could not be drafted in legal terms which would stand up in all circumstances, then this is a valuable admission because then the Minister is saying: &ldquo;Yes, we want this legislation because we want to do something but it is not possible to draft it.&rdquo;  We can only say to the Minister: &ldquo;If you are looking for a right which cannot be drafted into that legislation this is a right which this Parliament will resist giving to you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a reproach not just to Parliament inexpert and amateur as it is in the matter of laws to be given an explanation like this.  It is also a reproach to the highly qualified public servants <Col N="1299" /> with legal qualifications in the employment of the Minister.  He is not the actual draftsman: he does not draft the law and if he does it is very irregular.  There are people with a great deal of expertise and professional training to do this.  I would be surprised if people with this background and this professional skill would come to the Minister and say: &ldquo;We cannot find a form of words.&rdquo;  I very much doubt if any legal draftsman would admit such a thing.  He would be knocking away the basis for the validity of the whole activity of his life as a draftsman.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's decision that a form of words cannot be found because, in fact, he is unwilling to expose the basic contradiction which exists in the heart of this section.  That contradiction is that he wants to have a law which can be applied at his discretion or at the discretion of certain other persons in a selective way against people whom the Minister does not like.  Were we to admit that sort of principle into law-making, were we to admit a partisan or a punitive principle, were we to admit that laws could be made to act against bodies or political activists with whom we happen to disagree we would be violating the principles on which this Parliament is built; we would be violating the many decent strands in the history of the evolution of legislation in the legal profession and we would, I think, be violating all the responsibilities which we have as elected representatives to the people who sent us here. This is, perhaps, an unduly lengthy intervention on what seems a trivial thing but, in fact, it is far from a trivial thing; it is essential.</P>
    <P>We are still at the beginning of the Bill and no amount of amending, it seems to me, is going to get over it. There is a basic contradiction in the Minister's approach.  One simply cannot draft legislation which will punish black people but not white people, left wing people but not right wing people, women but not men or some other such category which exists in one's mind.  The law has to be the same for everybody and this is not intended in that way by the draftsmen.  We cannot <Col N="1300" /> leave it to the discretion of the Minister or to the discretion of the Garda.  If we now enact it we cannot leave it to their discretion to apply it in that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to exempt from the criminal sanctions of this Bill persons who might remain on in the possession of cottages, gate lodges or other premises following the termination of a permissive occupancy therein.  They might have been there as caretakers or in connection with their employment; they were not there as contractual tenants.  The Minister concedes that the spirit of the amendment is acceptable to him but he rejects the amendment for a number of reasons.</P>
      <P>The first and most startling reason to my mind is that he says it would, in effect, nullify the effect of section 3. Section 3 is the section which makes it an offence to remain in forcible occupation.  I presume the Minister in saying that this amendment would nullify section 3 has in mind a situation where a person of the category sought to be protected by this amendment remains in forcible occupation but if the amendment were allowed that person would not commit an offence, whereas if the amendment is disallowed, as the Minister wants, that person will then commit an offence.</P>
      <P>This, to my mind, is completely contrary to what the Minister has said all along as being the spirit and the intention behind this Bill.  The Bill is aimed at subversives and people who deliberately occupy forcibly, with malice, property, whereas the person we are concerned with in this section is the very opposite type of person, the person who the Minister admits has a moral claim to be where he is.  Consequently, it seems to be an extraordinary argument to reject the amendment and to say that the amendment would take that person out of the criminal sanction of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 3 is intended to deal with persons who have gone into occupation and who remain in occupation in such circumstances that remaining there becomes forcible occupation.  I think it was always the Minister's intention that the type of person who would come within section 3 would be a person who would originally have gone in illegally.  I do not think it was ever the Minister's intention that section 3 would apply to persons who went in legally in the first instance, whether as contractual tenants or as permissive occupants.</P>

The Minister goes on to make a further point in reply to my amendment that the amendment, <Col N="1302" /> by dealing with permissive occupants, would also cover mere invitees or licensees.  That was the type of person to whom Deputy Crowley refers.  I would suggest to the Minister that there must be a clear distinction between the two categories of persons in the sense that in the case of the person I seek to deal with, the essence of his position is occupation, occupation in the sense of being exclusive occupation, whereas the persons the Minister refers to, invitees or licensees, are mere visitors to a premises, are only temporary, and are not in any sense occupants.  They are merely using portion of the premises for their particular piece of business and they could not by any stretch of the imagination, I would submit to the Minister, be considered to be permissive occupants within the amendment I propose.</P>

      <P>They are, unfortunately. That is the whole root of the trouble.  There would be no problem with the amendment otherwise.  They are, and I have been advised of that several times by highly competent people. They are permissive occupants and the section must be construed in their favour.  If people who go into an office and then kick everyone out and barricade it and all the rest of it, go into court afterwards and make the claim that they went in as invitees or licensees and if that is established, that is an absolute defence to them under the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point that there is a very clear distinction to be made between people who are invitees or licensees and people who are permissive occupants.  I make the point that the distinction lies in the fact that an invitee or licensee could not by any stretch of the imagination be considered to be an occupant.  An invitee or a licensee is on a premises for a specific purpose.  Generally, I have never heard the word used in relation to the law of property.  I have only heard it used in relation to the law of tort.  I cannot and will not accept the Minister's contention that the words &ldquo;permissive occupant&rdquo; could let in persons who are invitees or licensees, that it could include the visitor to an office and that visitor who has locked himself in would be exempt from the Act if my amendment were accepted.  I must say I just cannot accept that.  If the Minister can produce authority or case stated to support that, then I would accept it but it would surprise me greatly.</P>

      <P>The next reason put forward by the Minister for rejecting my amendment was that, while appreciating the spirit of the amendment, it is unnecessary because the last words of subsection (1) of section 3 refer to a person remaining in occupation in pursuance of a <i>bona fide</i> claim of right.  Again we are getting back to a rather nebulous but entirely praiseworthy sentiment.  I proposed originally the insertion of the words &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i> claim of right&rdquo; but I did not propose them out of any sympathy with the Bill or for the Minister. My reason for proposing them was to try to soften the Bill so as to make its effect woolly when the time would come for it to be applied in the court, in an effort to try to nullify it because in my opinion the words &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i> claim of right&rdquo; can only lead to the court metaphorically scratching its head and saying &ldquo;What the hell does this mean?&rdquo; If a court seriously has to consider the words &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i> claim of right&rdquo;, it will not consider them in reference to any moral issue and neither will it consider them in any layman's language.  It will consider them in the light of the word &ldquo;right&rdquo; meaning a property right and the property right can arise only under some contractual tenancy right or under documentary evidence of title or some evidence of ownership.  I do not think that a court faced with the problem of interpreting a praiseworthy sentiment&mdash;and that is all the words &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i> claim of right&rdquo; are&mdash;will give any moral interpretation.  In the situation envisaged by the amendment, a court faced with those words would say to itself that a <i>bona fide</i> claim of right arises only if the person is there as a result of a contractual tenancy or under a legally documented title.</P>
      <P>I do not think that a court could allow itself to say that a <i>bona fide</i> claim of right is referable to this case where all that is involved is a moral right.  The court will say to itself that it is not a court of morals but a court of law.  Consequently, the Minister's argument that those words would give protection to those whom I seek to protect does not stand up in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point raised in rejecting <Col N="1306" /> the amendment is that it is unnecessary in the sense that the gardaí would not prosecute or would not dispute this claim.  This is moving on to dangerous ground and I submit to the Minister that this is no argument for his rejection of what is acceptable in principle.  The gardaí should have no discretion as to whether to prosecute because they have the utmost sympathy with the type of person whom this amendment is intended to protect. Everybody would have this sympathy but that would not relieve the person from the rigour of the law.  Therefore, I submit to the Minister that this is not an answer to my argument.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the principle implicit in this amendment is acceptable entirely to the Minister and the kernel of the Minister's argument against accepting the amendment is that there are drafting difficulties in the way.  Drafting difficulties should never prevent legislation that has merit even if it means rephrasing completely the section and altering the structure of other sections.</P>

      <P>The Minister has yet to go to the Upper House.  These things should be done if by doing them the end is desirable and is one that would prevent injustice to a person who, as the Minister admits, should not suffer any injustice.  The Minister says that while such a person should not suffer any injustice he did not think he would suffer any injustice because (a) the courts could hold that he is on the property under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of right, (b) the gardaí might not prosecute or (c) the courts would lean backwards to be lenient with this type of person.  These are not valid arguments because they are not capable of being enforced rigidly and consistently. A person in the predicament of having to depend on such non-legal protection is not being protected by the Minister and is being subjected to bad legislation. I urge the Minister strongly to reconsider the problem.  If it is merely one of drafting or restructuring the layout of the Bill, I would ask him to accept the amendment.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete all words after &ldquo;tenement&rdquo; in line 31 down to and including &ldquo;accordingly&rdquo; in line 33.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to amend the provision whereby a person acting on behalf of the owner can be construed as the owner.  This is most objectionable. We had experience of what people acting on behalf of owners can do and already on Committee Stage we <Col N="1309" /> cited the Hume Street case.  If this section is passed without amendment it will give rise to wholesale development of such practices.  It will encourage owners to engage private armies to do bullyboy work for them.  I can even visualise advertisements in our papers, perhaps, in the &ldquo;Positions Wanted&rdquo; columns in which private armies will offer their services to landlords and big property owners with all kinds of inducements, guaranteeing prompt service and success.</P>
    <P>We have already discussed the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; as distinct from a person or persons acting on behalf of the owner and we have seen how unsatisfactory the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; is.  Extending the definition to a person or persons acting on behalf of the owner makes the definition far too loose and can make it cover practically anyone.  It will give rise to all sorts of problems.  It will make the work of the Garda far more difficult because it is much easier if one wants to get occupiers out of a house to get them out with one person and much less troublesome than with a group of ten people who will be legally entitled to use an amount of force and will be legally entitled to do an amount of damage in the ejectment process.</P>
    <P>As we will see later, the damage these private armies can do will have to be paid for by the unfortunate occupier.  These people acting on behalf of the owner will be really responsible to nobody when their defence is that they are acting on behalf of the owner.  They can even justify the use of physical assault on people.  This amendment should be accepted.  It will help to restore the balance so that the unfortunate occupier will have some protection not only from being ejected but also from physical assault and damage to property.  I do not think it is the intention of the Minister to encourage the formation of this kind of private armies or gangs of bullyboys but that is what the definition will achieve.  Also, it will give such groups the protection of the law.  If these groups go to eject somebody they will have the protection of the peace keeping force, whereas the occupier will not.  We want to correct this by our amendment which I hope the Minister <Col N="1310" /> will accept.  I do not see why &ldquo;owner&rdquo; would not be as effective as a person or persons acting on behalf of the owner.  We have experience of what this type of activity can lead to.  We shall only be creating a situation in which many breaches of the peace, to put it mildly, will occur and creating the environment which leads to breaches of the peace.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the amendment, if accepted, will detract from the Minister's intentions in this Bill but that it will lead to a more peaceful process if the Bill goes through and will restore the balance that is now heavily weighted in favour of the big landowner or landlord.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> In normal circumstances one might accept as reasonable a definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; which included any person acting on behalf of the owner.  However, that would presuppose that the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; was reasonable. The definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; in this interpretation section is so unreasonable that to extend it to include someone acting on behalf of the owner would be unacceptable to me.  I have done my best to convince the Minister that he should limit the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; to include only a person entitled to occupation.  The essence of this Bill deals with occupation: its title is &ldquo;Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill, 1970&rdquo;.  Here we are defining &ldquo;owner&rdquo; as anyone having an interest in land or building or a vehicle, irrespective of whether he is entitled to occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dislike harping on this all the time but it is the foundation of my consideration of this Bill.  We will create a situation whereby an absentee landlord, who has leased his property for 10,000 years, can delegate someone in this country to act on his behalf; he can take possession of the property but he is excluded from this Bill.  That is my main reason for supporting this amendment.  It could be used by an absentee landlord holding only a very slight interest in the land.  He could <Col N="1311" /> authorise teddyboys to harass the tenant; they could go in night after night, they could force their way into the house and then say they were acting under the authority of the landlord and they would not be guilty of an offence.  This is another of the absurdities that can arise because of this definition.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that when the Government introduce a measure in this deliberative assembly they do not listen to reasonable suggestions that are put forward.  Had they done so in this case, so far as I am concerned it would have curtailed the debate to a considerable extent.  However, the Minister has refused to budge on this and, as I have said, I think it is because of the built-in attitude of the establishment.  They want to make sure that all the gaps are closed, that there is no escape, even if it means enacting dangerous legislation.  They use the argument that it will not be availed of, that we can always rely on the forces of law and order to act in a reasonable manner.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that argument.  It is unsound in regard to any criminal legislation but it is particularly so in regard to this Bill.  Not only does this Bill confer powers and rights on the Garda Síochána, in spite of what the Minister has said, it confers rights in a roundabout way on lay people&mdash; people who are not subject to discipline, not subject to Parliament, to the Minister, or to the commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  This is one reason we should be slow to extend powers, particularly when we are extending them in favour of the absentee or native landlord against the tenant.</P>
    <P>If I accepted the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; as reasonable, I should find it difficult to support this amendment as fully as I do.  However, I do not accept the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo;.  It is unsound and out of line with the principle enshrined in this Bill, namely, the protection of the occupier.  This Bill does the opposite.  I made my position abundantly clear on this issue on the Second Reading of the Bill and right through Committee Stage. I know that the Minister was coming <Col N="1312" /> with me to some extent&mdash;perhaps, only to the extent that he said he would consider it.  When I insisted on raising my objection to the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; on various sections of the Bill subsequent to section 1, the Minister reminded me that he had already told me that he proposed to consider the matter.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that he would not be let.  We are drifting fairly quickly towards accepting what we are told by certain advisers of the Government.  The result is that we were told here the other day that ten Acts of Parliament have been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court or the High Court since 1937.  It would be interesting to know how many more will be declared unconstitutional, or are unconstitutional, as a result of the recent Supreme Court decision.  It would be more interesting still to ascertain how many would be unconstitutional&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am arguing on the basis that it is impossible to get the Minister to accept any amendment.  It would be more interesting still to know how many of these Acts would be found unconstitutional if they were challenged or if people had the courage and the finance to challenge them in the superior courts.  This all follows from the refusal of responsible Ministers to yield an inch on measures once they bring them in here.  They are afraid they will not have the big stick and they steamroll them through the House.</P>
      <P>I think I have made my position abundantly clear.  I pointed out this morning the inconsistency in the definition of ownership.  I certainly could not be a party to accepting an extension of ownership to include the agent of an owner and I do not think that should be accepted for the purpose of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I accept your ruling but I think this matter is of importance in relation to the Bill and to this amendment.  The amendment put down by Deputy Pattison arises from an acute consciousness here of the abuses which can be perpetrated by persons acting on behalf of an owner especially when, as Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, the term &ldquo;owner&rdquo; is defined as widely as it is here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen in the Hume Street case the use of brutal and unnecessary violence by persons commercially employed to act on behalf of an owner and applying unnecessary force and violence in so doing.  We think this is a dangerous trend.  We think that the enforcement of the law should be left <Col N="1314" /> to the Garda.  In other countries, and in the United States under the Pinkerton system, in particular, we have seen the growth of private law enforcement bodies acting on behalf of private commercial interests.  We have been concerned to see this same trend creeping into this country, apparently with some measure of Government approval and connivance.  During the last election members of the Government appeared with a sort of Praetorian Guard furnished by these commercial enforcers and appliers of force.</P>
    <P>This is socially undesirable in the highest sense in that the people used for this purpose have not the kind of training or the kind of discipline which the Garda have.  They are not carefully trained over a considerable period in the limitation of their authority.  In general, perhaps, they are not of the same standard of education as the Garda are.  They do not look forward to an established secure career.  I do not want to malign them collectively as a class, or any class collectively, but included among them are, perhaps, some adventurous toughs who take up this work and go on to something else.</P>
    <P>We think it very undesirable, particularly when these extended powers of coercion are being introduced in this rather extraordinary Bill, that there should be any language in it which may tend to give licence to this kind of operation.  We hope the Minister may be able to see and understand the nature of the concern behind this amendment and accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is particularly important because, if it is not accepted, then, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, ownership is extended to include any individual or agency nominated by the legal owner of the property.  I make the plea of the layman enmeshed in a lot of legal jargon which he does not fully understand, for understandable reasons, that this kind of sweeping power included in one line of the section could change the whole implications of the words &ldquo;ownership of property&rdquo;, &ldquo;ownership of a house&rdquo;, &ldquo;ownership of an estate&rdquo;.  This is an extraordinarily <Col N="1315" /> emotive phrase in the language of a capitalist society and it is wrong that we should, by the use of half a dozen words, vest this power in the individual owner of property.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>At first the layman tends to be very impressed by the tortuosities of the lawyers, the legalisms and complicated phraseology but, when one is presented with three or four words like this, words which can so change the law and vest so much power and authority in an individual, power and authority, we are led to believe, which can only be vested in any individual as a result of the most complex and intricate laws going back into the roots of history, the other thing one hears about the law, that the law is an ass, seems to be very much closer to the truth.  If it is as simple as this to transfer ownership with all the power that ownership implies in a capitalist society, then we should not be as frightened as we tend to be by this factor of ownership in a society such as ours.  I am reminded here of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> when, on asking what a word meant, she was told that it meant whatever meaning the user of the word wanted it to mean.  It seems to me the Minister is here taking on this magic power to use words to transfer authority from one individual to another and, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, there are circumstances in which one must be permitted to transfer ownership; but, in this set of circumstances, the authority to transfer ownership is for a very specific purpose and the purpose is, if necessary, to evict, eject, or look for ownership, or occupation, of a property occupied by another individual whether as a squatter or in any other capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister plays two tunes here. He has done so consistently throughout the debate on this Bill.  Most Deputies on this side of the House throughout the discussion have shown humanitarian and liberal attitudes in their attempts to try to keep off the Statute Book the very worst and, in <Col N="1316" /> our particular historical context, the most harrowing and evil powers of landlordism, going back to the terrible evictions, the famine, the expropriation and consolidation of estates, all these lovely euphemisms to cover the appalling brutality and inhumanity of landlords over the centuries here in Ireland.  This side of the House has consistently pleaded with the Minister not to vest in individuals these extraordinary powers for dealing with unfortunate individuals who squat in houses or take possession of houses because of the failure primarily of the community, of the State, of the Government, to discharge their responsibilities and give these people houses. These people are not doing this for fun.  No man is going to take his wife and children down the road and into a derelict or an occupied building, risking the terrible emotional assault and possible physical assault on his wife and children, without great thought to the consequences.</P>
    <P>We have consistently advocated that the Minister should provide legislation, if I may coin a phrase, with a human face and have some compassion for these people and not expose them to the great dangers which must eventuate if care is not taken in this particular section to amend it in the way suggested here by Deputy Pattison.</P>
    <P>In my life as a protester I have seen the forces of law in action and felt them in action on a number of occasions as well.  I suppose the last time was in the Hume Street incident in which I participated, along with other Deputies.  That was the first time I saw the emergence in this country of the private army, the private bullyboy, the private strong arm man in action.  As it turned out on that occasion it was a girl who was assaulted by this particular bullyboy and fortunately, if I remember aright, the girl was able to take action in the courts and was able to show that this private bullyboy had overstepped the law.</P>
    <P>As events have turned out, because of the benevolence of the Minister for Justice and his concern for the rights of the landlord as opposed to the rights of the ordinary citizen, that private bullyboy will not overstep the <Col N="1317" /> law the next time; he will not hit an unfortunate girl on the back of the head, or wherever it may be, and throw her to the ground.  She was not a member of any subversive organisation, she was a youngster who had a very ordinary, reasonable sense of the aesthetic value of a beautiful street in her own city of Dublin and she was attempting to assert her right to protest against the attempt to vandalise that very nice street and in the process of doing that she was physically assaulted by this particular bullyboy.</P>
    <P>I was very impressed at the time because the gardaí were there too. The interesting thing about the gardaí was that they refused to intervene, correctly, while I was there anyway. Now whether they should or should not have the right to intervene the important thing is, and will be, the way in which an intervention is carried out.  This brings us to the nub of Deputy Pattison's amendment, the sense of responsibility used by individuals in implementing the law.  Earlier we heard the Minister, on the humanitarian side of the Jekyll and Hyde performance he is giving here, telling us that in fact the gardaí need not prosecute and even if they have not read his speeches telling them that they need not prosecute the judge need not convict if in fact the guard does happen to prosecute.  That is the humanitarian side of the Minister showing, but we then have the other side of the Minister who says, when a reasonable amendment of this kind is suggested, that it must be ruled out because in fact there is no form of words which would give the protection required without in some other way weakening the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier on, we have this loose string of half a dozen words here whereby he tells us that we can authorise an individual, who goes along with a cheque book and buys an estate, to give power and authority to another individual, group of individuals, or agency to do more or less what they like.  The Minister is giving authority to a German, Frenchman, Dutchman, or anybody else, who may not even know enough English to be able to tell the Irishman to &ldquo;get out&rdquo; and may <Col N="1318" /> have to get somebody else to tell him, to put somebody out of a cottage in which he and generations of his family before him have lived.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>They say in Hume Street the position was that the man apparently acted <i>ultra vires</i> and that will not happen again.  We will get further repetitions of this kind of scandalous action of members of a private army.  We believe this is a very loose provision.  It is such a loose provision that as Deputy Fitzpatrick has said it is more than likely to be questioned in the courts and found as so many Acts passed by this House have been found, to be contrary to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Our problem is that the Minister is allowing an individual to delegate his power to a completely untrained individual hired simply because of his ability to act in a strong-arm capacity when he is told to and without any serious background of training or experience of discipline or tradition which we feel are the absolute prerequisites for any individual or group of individuals in whom is vested the great powers of compelling somebody to leave a particular building.</P>

      <P>I do not know in what way Deputy Desmond can suggest that what I said last Sunday represented a departure from the policy that we as a Government have pursued. As I have said already, reconciliation permeated that speech.  The British Government through their present Leader and the former British Government through their then Leader, stated publicly that, as far as they were concerned, if it was possible to achieve unity in Ireland and if Irish people could agree amongst themselves, they would not stand in the way.  I felt that they could usefully go further since this experiment of Partition has obviously failed to achieve peace in Ireland, especially in the north-eastern part of our country, that they might go that step further by encouraging Irish unity.  I do not see in what way what I said last Sunday was a departure.</P>

      <P>This is a matter which is proper to be discussed on the Health Estimate.  It would take me too long to analyse the Health Act and to distinguish between the powers of the health boards and the powers of county councils.  Incidentally, the health boards can determine the number of officers and servants appointed by them but they have no part in the control, supervision or remuneration and so forth of the officers.  There is no change in that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Department of Health have notified the health authority that they can, in fact, pay the <i>per capita</i> increases only if provision is made for them in the estimates of the local authorities?  In view of the fact that the notification of the increases in any case did not come until after the estimate was struck, how does the Minister consider that the increases can be paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that these increases relate to a small number of institutions and that the health boards have, in general, a small contingency fund out of which they can pay increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been misinformed.  I am sorry to delay the House, but this is the last opportunity we will get before the Recess to have this matter raised.  It will cause considerable embarrassment to health boards unless something is done about it.  Would the Minister now take the necessary steps to notify the health boards that they are entitled to pay the increases as requested, full stop, because if he does not do that there will be many people who will not be paid for in hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In a circular addressed by the Department on 31st May to every health board there was a paragraph which dealt with expenditure in <Col N="1334" /> excess of what was shown at column 2 when we put down the amount of expenditure to be incurred.  This included additional costs due to general increases in prices and approved increases in capitation rates and rates of allowances.  That permission was given in a letter dated 31st May.  It would be far better if the Deputy would let me have what he has immediately in mind because most of the increases in capitation grants apply to certain institutions, old people's homes, to polio and after-care associations where arrangements are being made for increases in payments for operational causes.  They did not include any very large increases given over the whole area of the health board's operations. The Deputy should let me have some particulars and I shall find out if something has gone wrong between my Department and the North Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <P>Is it possible to get information, such as that requested by Deputy Begley, in this House?  Deputy Begley is not a member of the Southern Health Board and neither am I.  They have little or no function but why not have this type of information here when 50 per cent of the cost is borne from central funds of which we are supposed to be in charge?

      <P>Surely the Minister is creating a most unwelcome precedent? Would I be right in saying that local authorities which were in fact the health authorities were always subject to Parliamentary question and that information sought from local authorities, from Departments and Ministers was always provided on the basis that there was a large Exchequer contribution, often 100 per cent in the cost of roads and 50 per cent or more in the case of health?  Is this not a complete break with precedent?  The Minister is, in fact, removing from Deputy Begley who is responsible by his vote here and from other Deputies, the opportunity to get the information upon which they can exert pressure and express views within their own political parties and get them to decide how to vote?  Is the Minister not directly responsible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Deputy wishes to raise a question of principle he can do it but he should remember that within the next six months county advisory <Col N="1336" /> health committees will be appointed which can fight if they wish and determine if the policy in relation to a particular area of the health board is being exercised wisely.  They can ask this sort of question of the county advisory board.  They can have an examination of whether disability allowances are being properly paid or whether there is a difference in the method of payment between one county and another.  If a question of a national principle arises, of course I shall reply to the Deputy here but there is no national principle involved here.  I would wish that members of the House would become acquainted with the operation of the health boards and make the health boards answer questions of a purely local character.</P>

      <P>Surely this does arise.  Surely the Minister will agree that one of the problems created by the currency situation is that it has been interfering with the operation of the common agricultural policy and in view of our interest in that have we not an interest in ensuring that this problem is settled in such a way that the resulting exchange rates which are at present inhibiting the operation of the farm policy would be removed and we would return to a fixed exchange rate position that would help the farm policy to operate to our benefit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte and CIE that forecasts of coach tour traffic made earlier this year were based on information then available and were clearly tentative. Results to-date have not been up to expectation due to external factors, including economic conditions abroad, which are outside our control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any explanation to offer for the serious <Col N="1342" /> situation that has been revealed not merely by the CIE report but also from the information received from the airlines and other carriers regarding the decline in North American tourist traffic?  How can the Minister explain this situation in the light of the optimistic forecast he made following his two visits to the United States in the last six months?  Last April the Minister assured the House that the North American traffic would be up by 4 per cent; now it is down by 15 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

This meeting will be attended by all the carriers, both public and private, and the tourist interests &mdash;hotels and other interests.  We will have a rational discussion about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that reports from hoteliers in almost every tourist centre show a serious decline and that the bed occupancy is at an unprecedentedly low rate?  Further, may I say that whatever reports were produced by Bord Fáilte this week&mdash; whether in regard to market research or otherwise&mdash;I will not accept them as true and nobody in the tourist industry will accept them either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister what he means by &ldquo;outside our control&rdquo;?  Surely the Minister is aware that the decline in the number of tourists coming to this country is due to direct and deliberate Govvernment policy for the importation of arms, which has given Ireland a bad name?  Tourists are afraid to come here because of direct Government policy which was within the Minister's control if the Taoiseach had not stood idly by when Ministers were attempting to import arms.  Ireland <Col N="1343" /> has a bad name throughout the world and tourists will not come.  The Minister knows this.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Óstlanna Iompair Éireann that their business has been adversely affected by external factors outside their control which are also affecting other sectors of the tourist industry. The fall in the occupancy rate in the company's hotels in June, 1971 as compared with June, 1968 can be ascribed to these factors.  When the possibility of a fall-off in traffic became evident, CIE took special measures, including additional promotional work and the introduction of package deals, in order to improve business.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 39 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We oppose this section. It is typical of what I regard as the overall characteristic of this Finance Bill and fiscal legislation this year.  It is obsessional.  It is obsessed with the fact that there are small holes in the net and, in trying to close every possible loophole and ensure that nobody escapes, injustice is unwittingly, perhaps, being done to certain people. One cannot complain of any effort to close loopholes and thereby diminish tax avoidance.  Everybody must agree with that policy but when the method used to close such loopholes inflicts injustice on small people it is time to cry halt.  We must balance the two positions.</P>
      <P>Section 39 can do an injustice, At the moment, if an estate consists partly of agricultural land and partly of other personal property, the agricultural land is valued on an artificial basis at 25 times the poor law valuation and from that figure is deducted the redemption value of the Land Commission annuity. If the resultant figure when added to the net personal property does not exceed £2,000 the estate may be valued on that artificial basis.  My experience is that that artificial basis invariably lies only in the case of small farms.  Here, we have a provision that if, within the following six years, that farm is sold the actual market value as realised will then be the value and presumably the assessment will have to be re-opened.  If the exemptions allowed by section 7 (5) of the 1894 Act and section 61 (1) of the 1910 Act were being abused, or were capable of abuse, I could see some justification for the section, but I cannot see how they can be abused.  Invariably they deal only with small estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made the point that the net personalty, because of a very large debt, might be a nil figure or there might even be a deficit.  When that would be taken from the artificial value that should clearly come within <Col N="1355" /> the £2,000 limit but, as I say, in practice this is just not possible.  Take a farm of £50 valuation, which is a common enough type of valuation. There are bigger farms and there are smaller farms but, in my experience it is the maximum valuation to which these provisions could apply.  I cannot see that such a farm would not have livestock on it and, if it has livestock on it, the personalty can only then be taken down if there is a bank overdraft.  The reality of the situation is that a bank overdraft would not be permitted of such a size that it would equate to or exceed the personalty of the estate.  This is the reality of life in rural Ireland.  I cannot visualise a situation in which this could be used as a means of avoidance.  All this section will do is impose hardship on people who, for some domestic and <i>bona fide</i> reason, have to sell their farm within six years of the assessment being made. It will not close any loophole because I do not think there is anybody escaping through that loophole at the moment.  The original intention presumably in the 1894 Act and in the 1910 Act and all the other Acts which increased the original figure from £500 to £2,000 was to benefit agricultural land and not to prejudice people on small farms with heavy estate duty burdens and to encourage presumably the rectification of title and the passing on of property within the family.  This was highly commendable.  It is still commendable and it is altogether unjust to say that, if these people can have the benefit of this value today, and if they sell the farm within six years, the full value comes into play; six years is altogether an unrealistic period of time.</P>
    <P>I am against any change in the law but if there has to be some provision and if the Minister feels strongly enough about it and can make a case to justify the change I cannot see how he is going to be able to justify a period of six years.  So much can happen on a family farm within six years.  The circumstances could be completely different from those pertaining at the time of death.  This could lead to a very serious injustice in a small or medium size farm.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> The proviso of subsection (2) seeks to give relief to what I suppose the Minister will tell me would be a <i>bona fide</i> transaction where presumably on intestacy, there has to be a sale in order to distribute the assets among the next-of-kin and one of the family retains the property, and the section shall not apply.  Again this is unrealistic; it is not conversant with the realities of life in rural Ireland and this is my chief objection to this section. It does not take into account what happens on the average farm when there is an intestacy or even a death testate.  To suggest that this section has been used for tax avoidance or estate duty avoidance is quite ridiculous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The reference in the Minister's speech to evasion here is misleading.  When I hear of evasion or avoidance being mentioned in relation to income tax or death duties I take it that it means the improper use of a section or the extension of a section in a way that never was meant.  There is no such thing here; this is a long standing section which allows the artificial value of so many times the poor law valuation to be applied to agricultural land.  All that is being done here is that this machinery, which the legislature provided in its wisdom many years ago, is being used in the way that it was intended to be used.  If there was any misuse or abuse of it I could understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section simply takes away, in certain circumstances, the provision which was enacted in the Finance Act, 1910.  It is a method of imposing death duties at a higher rate on agricultural land.  It is introducing a new method of valuing agricultural land for death duty purposes.  It is taking away the method which has been in use for the past 60 years and it provides that if the land is sold within six years from the date on which it was valued, which I take to be six years from the date of death, that the artificial value is to cease to apply and death duties will <Col N="1357" /> have to be paid on the actual market value as at the date of death and not, I hope, on the sale price maybe five years later.</P>
    <P>Family circumstances could change in the intervening six years and there might be reasons to sell the land on the open market to a stranger.  It is provided here that if it remains within the family the section shall not apply, but there might be a complete change in family circumstances which might necessitate the outright sale of the land. I do not think this section should be departed from.  I had hoped we were thinking of moving away from this system of collecting revenue from death duties but apparently we are going to consolidate it and establish it and collect the very last penny that can be collected.  I am opposed to this section for those reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This form of relief was originally introduced in relief of landlords of farms where a number of farms were occupied by tenant farmers. It was by a decision in an Irish court in 1901 that it was applied to the interests of tenants of farms.  We may take it from the effect of that decision and from the manner in which it has operated since, that the whole purpose of this was not for the benefit of agricultural land as such but for the benefit of families living on farms particularly on small farms.  This principle is being preserved, in what we are doing here, in two senses.  First, in the sense that if a farm is sold it cannot be said that we are preserving or helping the family in the farm to hold on to it because if the farm is sold the whole object is defeated.  Secondly, as Deputy Cooney has pointed out, in subsection (2) we make special exemption for situations which can of necessity arise on a family settlement in the event of an intestacy where what might be called an artificial sale takes place and we are preventing the operation of this section in such cases.  Quite clearly the operation of the section is designed to continue the principle on which it has been operating for so many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was then asked how can any evasion arise on the basis of <Col N="1358" /> artificial valuation?  Indeed, Deputy Cooney's argument was that it could not arise and that he would consider that perhaps some action of this kind was justifiable if such evasion did arise.  I want to tell the House that such evasion does arise and I should like to give briefly particulars of four cases which actually occurred in which evasion arose as a result of the use of the artificial valuation of land.  In the first one the artificial value of the lands was £2,231 and there was a deficit of £1,269 in the personal estate. The value of the estate for duty purposes was £962.  The lands were sold for £18,800 so that the real value of the estate was £17,531, but no duty was payable.  In the second case the artificial value of the lands was £2,957; there was a deficiency of £2,859 in the personal estate due to an overdraft of £4,875, the estate was valued for duty at £98 and the real value of the lands turned out to be £22,000.  In the third case an artificial value of £948 applied and no duty is paid.  Two years after the death, and fairly recently, the lands were sold for £17,050, but no duty was payable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Minister, the last example he gave of an artificial value of £948 would imply a poor law valuation of about £38 and it is beyond my imagination how a farm with a valuation of £38 could fetch £17,000 as agricultural land. There must have been some other factor.</P>

      <P>No. There was no increase in value afterwards in any of these cases.  They were sold as agricultural land.  I am not finished yet.  There is another case that I want to give details of, a relatively recent case also. Artificial value was applied to lands consisting of 267 acres approximately. The rateable valuation of the land was just over £200 and of the buildings was £36 5s.  The lands were sold about two years after death for £110,000 and no duty was payable.  In each of these cases that I have taken I do not think that, in fact, there was any conscious attempt at evasion.</P>

His personalty is thus deficient by £10,000.  This deficiency lets in the artificial value of the lands and in that case duty would be payable on £20,000 only, that is, at 12 per cent, instead of on £90,000 at 37 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The key to this is that by reason of the overdraft he got himself into the artificial valuation category. If he could not do that, of course, the real value of the land would come into play.  The point I am making in this regard is that first, in the four earlier cases I have mentioned, I cannot say positively but I do not believe there was a deliberate attempt to evade duty but one can see from the figures involved that there was, in fact, a very considerable nonpayment of duty which would be payable by anybody else in circumstances where the artificial valuation did not come into play but, in addition to that, I am trying to indicate that it is possible, and has been done, so to contrive one's affairs as to bring in the artificial valuation and deliberately avoid a substantial amount of duty.</P>
      <P>This, I hope, will answer the argument by Deputy Cooney as to why we should do anything about this.  I hope I have demonstrated that there is reason to take action to prevent evasion by the use of this artificial valuation.  I want to stress that although we are taking this action we are also ensuring that the original purpose of artificial valuation is being maintained and if a man whose holding would be in the normal way and under the law artificially valued if he leaves it to his son and his son carries on as his father before him, as a farmer, we are preserving that situation under the section but I want to suggest to the House that in circumstances, whatever they may be in which a genuine sale takes place as distinct from the one that is saved in subsection (2), in which people get the value of the property into their hands, there is not any reason that I can see why such people should not pay duty the same as anybody else who receives a similar amount of money.  I think the case for this section, quite frankly, is overwhelming.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this is one of the many sections in this Finance Bill which are greatly extending the scope of death duty.  The idea was that this was a tax on property passing on death.  Other sections of this Bill are making it more difficult for the giving of gifts during life which are, perhaps, made without any contemplation of death at all.  So, we are extending it in that direction and we are extending its scope.  It is no longer, in that sense, a tax on property passing on death.  In the other direction, after the death, we are extending the scope. We are extending the scope of estate duty to sales which take place in relation to an estate which within the past six years was the subject of a bequest.  So, we are extending estate duty on both sides of the grave.  It is now no longer merely a tax on property passing on death but a very selective tax on the alienation of property either by gift or by sale.  It is selective in the sense that it picks on those years, five years prior to death and the six years afterwards and says that sales or gifts which take place within that period are to be singled out for harsh treatment, whereas gifts which take place prior to the five-year period are exempt.  The same applies to the other side.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but we can see the trend of the Finance legislation that is going through.  What we really have is a highly selective tax on the disposition of property&mdash;selective in the sense that it picks on those dispositions that take place within the ten-year period covering the date of death.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a few remarks in relation to this.  In relation to one of the examples to which the Minister drew attention, Deputy Cooney said he calculated that the rateable valuation of the farm would be £38. This farm was sold for about £17,000. I remember vaguely talking to the Land Commission about this question of valuation and they calculated that good agricultural land would be in the region of £1 valuation per acre. On that basis it would seem to me as if this property was sold at £500 per acre.  I am not an expert on agricultural land values but I think that £500 an acre is somewhat higher than what one would normally expect to receive for land that is used solely for agricultural purposes.  Certainly, £500 an acre would be a lot more than anyone buying such land could hope to recoup from it in earnings from agriculture. Therefore, we are dealing with cases that are highly exceptional and which could probably, as the Minister said, be dealt with from the point of view of saying that the land, strictly speaking, was not agricultural land and had potential in other directions.  It is possible that the section, if enforced, could meet the problem to which the Minister referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question that was referred to by Deputy Fitzpatrick and on which we need some more information is in relation to the sale of land.  If the sale takes place five years after the date of death, will it be the sale on the artificial market value which is supposed to be the market value of the property at the date of death of the owner or would it be the actual sale price that would be taken for duty purposes?  I should like to know also how it is proposed to enforce this <Col N="1363" /> section.  Will it mean that the Estate Duty Office will have to keep in touch with the owners for the remaining two years so as to make sure that it has not been sold?  Will there have to be some sort of police force operating to ensure that people will not sell property that has been the subject of a bequest?</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that in the six years that are governed by this section, the circumstances of a family could change radically and by no means would it be evidence of evasionary tactics that within six years the property had to be sold.  It could possibly be that for the first two or three years after death, the successors had every intention of retaining the property and working it as it had been worked by the deceased but their circumstances could change to such an extent during the remaining three years that they would be forced to sell it before the six-year period had expired. Anybody who knows anything about the ups and downs of agriculture would agree this could easily happen particularly in the present situation in agriculture where heavy investment in machinery must take place frequently and when such investment does not pay off, the person concerned might find himself in debt to such an extent that he would have to sell the farm.  This would have nothing to do with the evasion of estate duty.  For anybody getting on in life to say that he would avoid death duties on the estate by using this tactic would require very great sacrifice on his part.  In the first place he would have to purchase an amount of agricultural land of the correct proportion, not too much and not too little.  Then he would have to put that land in heavy debt.  That would be taking far too great a risk for the person concerned to make it a worthwhile evasionary tactic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Minister's case in the sense that if a sale shall subsequently take place, the person is, in effect, getting into his pocket the actual value of the property which passed at death and to that extent is in no worse position than a person holding a dwellinghouse in a town.  I can see <Col N="1364" /> that but I suggest to the Minister that having put that person in an exceptional position at the date of death, it is unfair to leave him with this sword of Damocles, so to speak, hanging over him for six years.  I presume, too, that the figure that will be relevant will be the price realised six years afterwards and which figure could be vastly different from the market value as at the date of death.  If it is to be the value as at the date of death and not the actual sale price realised, there is then a vast area of contention because the estimation is being made in 1976 on what was the market value of that property in 1970.  This is something that can give rise to considerable practical difficulties.</P>
      <P>A further point that was raised by Deputy Bruton was how the incidence for this will come to the notice of the Estate Duty Office.  A sale takes place six years afterwards and, so far as I know, a purchaser would be protected and would not be liable for any duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>You could have the situation where a person who decided to buy it from the rest of his family subsequently found that he unwittingly <Col N="1366" /> or for some economic reasons over which he had no control made a bad bargain.  He had paid the full market value and presumably had paid stamp duty on the transaction between himself and his family.  He would subsequently be penalised when he found he had to sell the farm by having to pay death duties.  I think that is unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is he really being penalised in those circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If he has paid stamp duty he is.  He is paying twice to the Revenue.  Having been put in the privileged position as a user of agricultural land, the time within which full market value would come into play should be reduced from six years to, at most, three years.  It is far too long to leave it hanging for six years. If it were for three years it would increase the certainly that a certificate of discharge from death duty would be sought and that would be all to the Minister's advantage.</P>
      <P>May I comment on the examples the Minister gave?  In the first case he said there was an artificial value of £2,231 on land, that there was a deficit on the personalty and that the farm was subsequently sold for £18,000.  An artificial value of £2,231 would put the poor law valuation at £110 to £115.  That would be a farm of at least 100 acres taking £1 per acre valuation.  In some parts of the country it would be more, in some parts less.  I find it hard to see how the owner of that farm, even if he wanted to avoid duty, would be able to commit himself by way of borrowing.  He would not be allowed to borrow in the way the Minister indicated.  It takes into account that there was this farm of over 100 acres and there must not have been a tail on it.  I do not think that in practice these things can happen.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave another example of a farm of £38 valuation being sold for £17,000.  That was not ordinary agricultural land.  There must have been some other factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concede the principle that the person in the event of a sale should not be any better off but I would suggest that the period for the sale should be <Col N="1367" /> reduced from six years to three years and that in subsection (2) the settlement should be extended from widow and children to all next-of-kin.  The person seeking to come to a settlement can be in a much more difficult and tricky position with next-of-kin who are not his mother or his brothers or sisters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister not make the one six-year period both for subsection (2) and subsection (1), that where there was a family settlement made it would be all right as long as the six-year period from the date of the death occurred was met rather than extending it a possible further six years?  I do not know what objection the Minister sees to this because he is prepared to concede that there is a situation here that should be met where a family arrangement is necessary. I am sure it was never the intention in the section that this restriction should be imposed for a further six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, I would not grumble very much about section 39 because it meets a case I was making yesterday where there is an artificial value put on land that will not be realised.  This has happened on many occasions.  The value that has been put on land was the potential value should it be sold.  This section covers that sort of situation and very few people could legitimately object to it except in a case that I have in mind.  This is particularly relevant to areas where rapid development is taking place such as the area I represent.  At the date of death a holding could be agricultural land and even giving it its highest value it could be worth £500 an acre because of location but it would not be known to have any development potential at that point of time.  Then we reach the end of one of these five-year periods when the county plan would be reviewed.  This area then would be brought into the development area and services extended.  This would rocket the value of the holding from, perhaps, £500 an acre up to £4,500 of £5,000 an acre.  If it were valued at the time of death it would be £500.  If it were valued subsequently <Col N="1368" /> within the six-year period it could be as much as £5,000, as much as £7,000 if it was zoned for industrial development. There is something here that should be met in some way.  There should be an attempt to value at the time of death if all people are to be treated alike.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I would appeal to the Minister to accept Deputy Cooney's suggestion that the time specified in subsection (1) should be limited to three years because if the section is to be used to evade payment of death duty, then I think the sale would take place within three years.  It is dragging it out too far to have a limit of six years because there could be genuine changes in family circumstances within those six years that would alter the whole circumstances and bring about a sale.  If the people intended as of the date of death to sell it is most unlikely that they would wait for six years just to avoid the duty.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> If the Minister imposes a three-year period I think his net will be wide enough.  The proviso at the end of subsection (2) which says that if there is this inter-family sale then the net will extend again if there is a sale within six years from the date of that arrangement is unreasonable.  Why not have the period run from the date of death whatever it is?  The Minister is satisfied in subsection (1) with a period of six years.  I say that is too long but he is satisfied with it.  When he comes to subsection (2) he extends that to a possible 12 less one day.  He should be satisfied with the same period running from the date of death in subsection (2) as in subsection (1).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A question I think we should consider is the impact this is likely to have on land use.  The Minister has made much of the value of this artificial valuation procedure to people engaged in farming.  I may be wrong but I think he did say that only 4 per cent of agricultural cases coming before the Estate Duty Office turned out to be liable to duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have some concern about the impact this will have on land use in the case of the 96 per cent.  Many estates which escape under this artificial valuation procedure may well be inherited by people who do not intend to operate the land properly as farmers.  At present they can sell the land immediately and it is presumably bought by somebody who will manage it properly and get maximum use out of this national resource.  In this case people who may not have the skill or capital resources to manage the farm properly will find themselves with this definite financial tax incentive to hold on to the land for six years in order to avoid paying death duties. This may not cost them very much except in rates but it will mean that the land, which could be used if put on the market and bought by a farmer, will be lying practically derelict and not properly managed.  The Minister probably has a case and I think a compromise would be the best way of meeting this difficulty.  A three-year period with the land lying there not properly used, while it would mean the loss of a national resource for that period would be only half as bad as if it were lying there for six years. I ask the Minister to consider this possibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not.  I do not want to go over all the ground again but in this section we are endeavouring to retain the existing exemption for people engaged in farming whose families are going to continue in farming but we are applying the normal method of assessment and liability for duty that applies to everybody else to people who sell the land within six years.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a few questions which were raised.  First, as I mentioned in an interjection, the practice in respect of all property, land or otherwise, is to give a provisional assessment which unless for some special reason the value is specially determined is only provisional and is so regarded for a period of six years. The method by which the Revenue Commissioners keep in touch with this situation is the certificate of discharge of death duties because eventually when the property is being sold the purchaser seeks this; it must be applied for and this brings the Revenue Commissioners into the picture and they can assess what happens to the property in the way of sale.  There are other methods by which the commissioners of valuation keep an eye on the market generally for the purpose of assessing movements in the value of property but primarily the method by which the Revenue Commissioners keep in touch is through the certificate of discharge of death duties.  I see no reason why this should not operate just as effectively in the limited type of cases we are discussing here as it operates in the case of all other property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the valuation of the property, assuming it is sold five years after the death and that in the meantime the value of property in that particular area has gone up substantially, what the law requires is that an <Col N="1371" /> assessment be made of the value of the property at the date of death and any development which takes place after the date of death which increases the value of the property must be ignored. In practice, I understand what happens is this: take a case where the sale takes place five years after the death and that it results in the property being sold for 100 per cent more than it was assessed for estate duty purposes.  An examination is then made of the general movement in that five-year period in the sale of similar land.  If that reveals that in the five-year period the land is increased, by, say, 50 per cent, the sale price is reduced by 50 per cent for the purpose of arriving at the true value as at the date of death.  This may sound complex.  I think it was Deputy Cooney who said it could lead to a good deal of argument. This may be true but it is the basis of valuation of all types of property for estate duty purposes and, by and large, it works reasonably well. I repeat that the commissioners are obliged to ignore any development which takes place subsequent to the death.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, the Minister said that only 4 per cent of all agricultural cases had to pay death duties. Is the Minister sure of this?  Are all farms included in this because if they are we must get the whole 4 per cent in County Dublin?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

That figure emerged from a study which the Revenue Commissioners carried out over a two-year period in 1967 and 1968.  An examination of all the cases coming in in those two years revealed that of all the agricultural holdings coming before the Revenue Commissioners only 4 per cent became liable to duty.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 32 is in the name of Deputy O'Higgins and others.  Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 are related.  Amendments Nos. 32, 33, and 34 may be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 22, subsection (1), to delete all words after the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 33 down to and including the word &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; in line 36.</P>
      <P>This is the infamous section in the estate duty section in so far as it seeks to bring in gifts in consideration of marriage and put them in the category of ordinary gifts.  This is a very serious departure for the following reasons.</P>
      <P>Under our legal system marriage has always been equated with money or valuable considerations and, for the first time, that principle has been altered drastically.  A gift in consideration of marriage, with the exception of the first £5,000 or £1,000, is being treated as a simple voluntary gift.  This is a serious breach of a long standing legal principle and it should not be contained in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave as his reason for this change in the law the fact that marriage settlements were being used to evade estate duty and he quoted one example that had come to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners. I submit that to bring in such a drastic alteration in our legal system&mdash;it is more than merely a change in estate duty law; it is destroying the idea of marriage as being a valuable consideration&mdash;the Minister should require a stronger reason than one known case of evasion of death duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unrealistic for the Minister to be apprehensive that evasion could occur by way of using marriage settlements. It is not possible to have a marriage settlement unless there is a marriage, and a marriage cannot be arranged to suit the necessity to evade death duty. One can visualise a ludicrous situation where a father gets a heart attack and all his daughters come home. Somebody asks for a volunteer who <Col N="1376" /> will marry so that the father can settle the property on the volunteer and on the death of the father the volunteer distributes the property among her brothers and sisters.  This is what the Minister is asking us to believe takes place.  Marriage settlements cannot be a vehicle for evading death duties.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned one case in which apparently a father was <i>in extremis</i>; he had a child who was ready for marriage and he was able to transfer his property to the child.  Presumably there was a secret trust on the child to honour the parent's wishes in regard to the redistribution of the estate among the family.  This is an exceptional case.  There are very few cases in which a parent <i>in extremis</i> would have a daughter or a son who would be getting married and on whom a settlement could be made.  Secondly, if the amount of property is substantial, there are not that many families with such a strong sense of unity that the person <i>in extremis</i> would take on the complication of making a settlement in those conditions.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the fact that there must be a marriage consideration means that the gift can only vest if the marriage actually takes place.  The fact that that condition must be complied with means that it has to be <i>bona fide</i>, that there cannot be a promise to marry so as to transfer the property.  The actual marriage must take place.  There can be no fiddle, so to speak, on a promise to marry which is not fulfilled afterwards because, if it is not fulfilled, there will be no marriage, the consideration fails and the property does not pass.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the section which these amendments seek to cure will do a lot of damage in our society.  The proposals have been described as anti-social and that is what they are.  The tenor of our laws so far and of our social practice has been to try to encourage earlier marriages and to encourage the disposition by elderly parents of their property to young married couples.  It has long been a source of complaint in rural Ireland that the owners of land have been holding on to the land for far too long, and inhibiting their <Col N="1377" /> children from marrying because they have not got the security of being the owners of the land themselves.</P>
    <P>If there was the attraction that property transfer on marriage was equivalent to sale, the attraction that because of the valuable consideration element on marriage to transfer the property on the part of the holder or the parent, that is now being removed.  As I said on the Financial Resolution, you could have the ridiculous situation in which a person in receipt of a non-contributory old age pension could leave an estate liable to death duty because his gift in consideration of marriage would be a deprivation of property and he would be qualified on a means test for a non-contributory old age pension. Technically he would have no property but yet, if that person died, under this section his estate in excess of £5,000 would become liable for duty.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Department of Social Welfare would not recognise a transfer if they felt it was made purely for the purpose of qualifying the transferor to receive an old age pension.  Of course, they always recognsed a transfer made in consideration of marriage on the very old legal principle that it was not a voluntary transfer but was tantamount to a sale.  It was a transfer for valuable considerations.  This was recognised and the Department of Social Welfare were anxious to encourage these transfers.</P>
    <P>In addition to recognising marriage settlements they abolished the rule whereby they had to be satisfied that the voluntary transfer was by way of a family arrangement and not purely to qualify the donor for pension.  The Department of Social Welfare now recognise all transfers, even purely voluntary transfers.  They always recognised marriage settlements.  The law in all its aspects always recognised that a marriage settlement was tantamount to a transfer for value.  This section is now trying to close an unlikely loophole. It will inhibit parents transferring to their children in a case where there is a <i>bona fide</i> marriage.  I presume all marriages are <i>bona fide</i> intended. Where a marriage is intended, not for the purpose of evading this section, the <Col N="1378" /> section will inhibit the transfer by an aged parent to children on marriage.</P>
    <P>There is an exemption for the first £5,000.  That is not a very large exemption. The second subsection gives an exemption of £1,000 in a case where the marriage gift is by a person other than a parent.  This is equally a hardship because there are many, many cases in rural Ireland where a bachelor uncle transfers to a nephew or a niece in consideration of marriage.  That is the type of case which it is socially desirable to encourage.  If it can be put to the bachelor owner that he should get rid of his property and that there will be an avoidance of duty, this is an encouragement for him to make the transfer.  It is socially most desirable that he should make the transfer but this Bill will inhibit that.  It seeks to close what to my mind is a most unlikely loophole because, before you can have a marriage settlement, you must have a marriage, and marriages cannot be arranged just at the drop of a hat for the purpose of avoiding death duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Deputy Cooney has said because I think this is in an entirely different category from any other device adopted to minimise or defeat the effects of estate and death duties. As has been rightly said, it is a well-established practice that marriage has been recognised for so long as anyone can remember as for valuable considerations.</P>
      <P>It is true that in Britain some six or seven years ago they made a change in the law in this respect.  It was admitted here last night that a number of the provisions of our revenue legislation, and certain provisions in the Finance Acts, have followed at suitable intervals on what happened in Britain. There is one very clear distinction between conditions here and conditions in Britain.  Here divorce is not permitted. While I suppose we have all heard of cases of marriages of one sort or another the vast majority of marriages are <i>bona fide</i> and do not happen at the drop of a hat.  While it may be anticipated to some extent it is not possible to arrange a marriage in anticipation of the death of a parent, or uncle, or aunt, or owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Constitution there are phrases <Col N="1379" /> suggesting that the family is a special unit and has a special place in society. I know that on more than one occasion the Articles dealing with social principles in the Constitution have been the subject of comment by the Supreme Court as being imprecise and, in some cases, unenforceable. Accepting, for the moment, that the social principles are given at least verbal support, and that a verbal concession is made to the institution of marriage and the family, and coupling that with what has been stated here as the long-established and recognised policy of the Land Commission and the Department of Social Welfare&mdash;in particular, of the Land Commission not to fragment holdings or have unnecessary splitting up of farms&mdash;this proposal is advocated on the basis of a single case which moved the Revenue authorities to recommend to the Minister the introduction of this section.  The only statistics produced in the Minister's Second Reading speech in justification for this section were in respect of a single case.</P>
    <P>There is a complete contrast between conditions here and conditions in Britian and this is one case in which we should not follow the British precedent. Their social and family legislation is entirely different.  Divorce and the dissolution of marriage is an accepted thing in Britain.  There is a whole corpus of legislation and special judges are assigned to the probate and divorce division to deal with the multiplicity of cases that arise.  Indeed, so serious is the position there that extra judges have had to be provided. That is not the situation here.  There is no divorce.  It is regarded as anti-social. This particular proposal is, therefore, contrary to accepted social policy here.  The number of cases involved must be very limited and it is a bad approach in fiscal legislation like this to introduce a proposal which conflicts with Land Commission policy or, as Deputy Cooney said, with the policy operated by the Department of Social Welfare in pension cases.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons why people who occupy farms or who run family businesses cannot part with them or assign them over to their children at <Col N="1380" /> an earlier point of time and the objection we have to this is that it runs contrary to recognised and accepted national and social policy. Since this applies in the main to farmers transferring their farms to their children, it is to that extent a mistake to adopt an urban attitude of mind to what is mainly a rural problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Such transfers are recognised as socially desirable.  One of the matters causing concern in regard to membership of the EEC is the possibility of land here, farms in particular, being acquired by outsiders. This type of legislation will be an impetus to a development involving the disposal of property.  At the moment property passes down through the generations.  Most parents are anxious to retain property, to put into it effort and skill and enterprise and pride, and ultimately to hand it on to the next generation.  This proposal will vitiate that.</P>
      <P>I believe the amendment is one which has general acceptance.  As I said earlier, there was no mention of this proposal in the Budget Statement. It was slipped in as an afterthought in a document circulated subsequently.  It is contrary to established practice to introduce a major change of this type in that way.  It is a weak argument to base the case for a proposal of this kind on one particular case.  Undoubtedly there will always be exceptional cases.  The particular case may have been a case of unusual significance but since there are so few cases, the problem cannot be a grave one.  Social and national policy is supposed to be designed to settle as many families as possible on the land.  This is in direct conflict with that policy.  As Deputy Cooney rightly said, Social Welfare have always accepted a voluntary settlement.  Sometimes these are made for valuable consideration.  Gifts in anticipation of marriage are exceptional and have always been so regarded. It is a bad precedent to move away from that in the direction in which the Minister proposes to move in this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether or not this section has been introduced <Col N="1381" /> for the purpose of scraping the bottom of the barrel.  Like a number of other sections it appears to be an effort to get the very last penny out of certain types of taxpayers.  I am surprised to find the section in the Bill.  It would appear to me that, the Budget having been introduced, the Minister then gave somebody the task of looking through legislation dealing with finance in an effort to find out if there was any way in which a few extra shillings could be got here and there.  I honestly believe that was the position.  There is no big money involved in this.  The amount of money collected as a result of the passing of this section will be relatively small, but the section will cause a great deal of nuisance.  I believe what a previous speaker said: this is an urban approach.  It is bad enough in the case of an urban dweller who hands over cash or property to a member of the family who is getting married; it is infinitely worse when it is done in the case of a rural dweller because, in that case, agricultural land is involved.  In effect, the law will have to be breached in order to try to pay off the duties if the property involved is sizeable.  If the property is sizeable the Land Commission will be involved and there will be all sorts of complications. I always understood it was the policy of successive Governments to encourage two things: one to encourage marriages in the country, because we always heard about the small number of marriages and the necessity of having earlier marriages and the second, to encourage the transfer at as early a date as possible of property to the children in order that they could carry on the farm or business.  It appears as if an effort is being made here to penalise them as if they deliberately gave away the property because they were going to die and they wanted to ensure it would not be taxed.  I accept there may be a number of people who feel that way but I am quite sure that 80 or 90 per cent of those who transfer property do not do it because they feel they are going to leave this world very quickly and will have no further use for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should be glad if the Minister would.  Am I now to take it that it is the Government's policy, if somebody works hard and succeeds in getting a certain amount of property or wealth of a certain kind and instead of squandering it in a certain way passes it on to his family so that they will be able to live in frugal comfort, that those people should be taxed to the extent that after the parent or whoever has passed on the property dies they may have to sell out or sell a portion of the property for the purpose of paying tax?  Have the Government reached the stage where they are so tight for money that they are prepared to take any and every step for the purpose of trying to get the last penny out of those whom they can tax in a device like that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section of the Finance Bill has aroused virulent opposition from the farming community and the farming organisations. There have been repeated statements from leaders of the farming organisations and in the newspapers condemning this measure.  If this measure were merely an anti-evasion measure, as the Minister is on record as saying it is, it would not be arousing such opposition. It is clear that the farming community see something much more serious <Col N="1383" /> behind this section.  Farmers, no more than anybody else, have no sympathy with those who are evading tax because that only means other people have to pay more.</P>
      <P>When the Minister said this was an anti-evasion measure he was not telling the truth.  Anybody can see that it is virtually impossible to contrive a situation where this could be used as an evasion measure.  As was said earlier a person cannot arrange for a marriage to take place at a specific time in order to enable him to give the property over and thereby avoid death duty.  Marriages do not take place in order to meet the exigencies of the tax law.  They take place for other reasons.</P>
      <P>The two biggest problems facing rural Ireland at the moment are first, the reluctance of parents, who have passed the stage where they can get the full value from their land, to transfer the ownership of that land to younger members of that family who can work it properly, and secondly, a problem which is closely linked to the first, the fact that people in rural Ireland defer marriage for longer than they should.  This very often results in their dying and leaving children who are too young to look after themselves properly.</P>
      <P>These problems have been recognised by many authorities.  The Catholic Church has set up marriage bureaux all over the west of Ireland because it recognises, as the Government do not seem to recognise, that the problem of low marriage rates is one of the most serious problems besetting rural Ireland at the moment. What is the Government's response to this situation?  It is to introduce a section like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present law gives the person who looks ahead to his death duty liability, and some people do although the Minister seems to think that very few do, a definite incentive to dispose of the land to the parties of the marriage at the time of that marriage.  This section will effectively remove that incentive.  When this incentive is removed he will hold on to the land and keep on postponing the transferring of the land.  Even though he might intend <Col N="1384" /> to do it, he will be getting old, forgetting about things and he will just not bother.  If the non-application of death duties in relation to gifts given on marriage were retained there would be a positive and definite incentive at the time of marriage to transfer the property.  This section will lead to people hanging on to land longer than they should and even longer than they have held on to it to-date, which in some cases it too long anyway.</P>
    <P>In relation to the second point I made about the encouragement to early marriage it is very often the case in rural Ireland that men are not prepared to get married as they are not in a position to support a wife and children, because they do not own the land on which they are working.  If there was this arrangement whereby the parent could see that he would not only be benefiting his own son by giving him land, but also possibly avoiding the greater burden of death duties than he would otherwise have, he might encourage the marriage by transferring land in the hope of availing of the exemption which at present exists.  If this exemption is removed yet another incentive to the people to transfer land and thereby encourage their offspring to get married will disappear.</P>
    <P>I believe this legislation is socially retrogressive.  The reason given for it, mainly that it is intended to avoid evasion, is quite unrealistic as the Minister has himself admitted there is only one known case of evasion under the present exemption.  It is almost impossible to make an arrangement for such an evasion because, as I said earlier, marriages cannot be arranged to suit the exigencies of tax law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard more wild and unfounded statements in relation to this section than I have heard in relation to anything for a very long time. Some were made outside the House and others made during this debate.  I have heard statements about policy enunciated here being anti-social, against national policy, and all sorts of other allegations, but no justification for them.  Indeed, we had an illustration in what Deputy Bruton was saying.  When it came near the <Col N="1385" /> crunch he started saying a person might do this; he might settle money or transfer land on a child on marriage to avoid duty&mdash;might.  The truth of the matter in my belief is what was stated by Deputy Tully and that is that most transfers in consideration of marriage are made because the people want to help their children, to set them up, not for the purpose of evading duty, and that the exemption of marriage gifts from liability for death duty is no encouragement whatever in practical terms to marriage, early or afterwards.  If it is, what we are being asked to believe is that people arrange marriages and make settlements in order to avoid death duties.  I suggest that is a ridiculous proposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It just does not stand up.  The truth is that in what we might call the normal <i>bona fide</i> case people make these transfers in consideration of marriage because they want to help and set up their children.  The fact that as a result there is exemption from death duties is a welcome bonus but they would do it anyway in the normal kind of case.</P>
      <P>There is no change whatever involved in this section in the legal basis or concept of marriage gifts.  For instance, the rate of stamp duty is not being changed.  All that is involved is the question of limiting, for the purpose of exemption from death duty, the value of the gifts which would qualify for exemption to £5,000 on the case of a gift to a child or remoter issue and £1,000 when the gift is made by any other person than the parent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To keep this in perspective let us remember that any gift, whether it is in consideration of marriage or not, will not be liable to death duties if the donor lives for five years after the gift is made&mdash;any gift.  So that, what we are talking about here is a gift made in consideration of marriage and where the parent, say, who made the gift dies less than five years after the gift is made.  That is what we are talking about and these are the limited circumstances on which we are hearing this big build-up of this being anti-social legislation, anti-marriage, <Col N="1386" /> and all the other allegations that have been made.  In this very narrow field, as I think Deputy Cosgrave said, and rightly, we are dealing with only a small number of cases.</P>
    <P>It has been said that this is an urban approach.  I want to ask this House is it an urban approach to take steps which will prevent very wealthy people, on the occasion of a marriage of their children, disposing by gift to their children of very large sums of money or property and thereby evading liability for duty on that property while other people who are not in the same category cannot avoid or evade their liability?  I am not saying&mdash;it would be a ridiculous proposition&mdash;that people arrange marriages in order to evade duty.  Of course they do not. What I am saying is that in the case of wealthy people&mdash;they are human like others; they get married and they have children and their children get married&mdash;where their children get married, because of the exemption that exists, there is an open door for them to dispose to members of their families of large amounts of property and, automatically, if they die the day after, there is no duty payable.  That is the kind of evasion situation with which we are trying to deal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a conscious evasion by the donor because no man knows when he is going to die.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am saying. He does not arrange the marriage to do this but when the marriage is arranged and he has sufficient wealth he can avail of it to an extent that nobody else can avail of it.  The fact that earlier I mentioned only one case does not by any means mean, as I think Deputy Bruton suggested, that there was only one known case.  I did not say any such thing.  There are quite a number of known cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind Deputies also that <Col N="1387" /> gifts in consideration of marriage are not confined to the farming community and, again, my approach in this is similar to my approach in the case of the previous section we discussed of artificial valuation.  I want to stop evasion and avoidance and at the same time I want to preserve the situation for the genuine <i>bona fide</i> case.  I would suggest to Deputies that they consider the situation again where, as I have said, any gift whether made in consideration of marriage or not is free of duty if the donor lives for five years but in the case of a gift in consideration of marriage we are providing that a gift to a child by a parent worth £5,000 will be automatically exempt from duty if the parent dies the next day. If we do not provide this then any person who is wealthy can on the occasion of a marriage of his child dispose of very large sums of money and if he should die the next day no duty is payable whereas anybody else is not in a position to avail of this.</P>

It was agreed on all sides, I think, that people do not arrange marriages in order to evade duty.  Therefore, what are we talking about?  Is it not the only basis for the argument that this provision is discouraging early marriages?  Is not the only logical basis for that, the assumption that people, if they have this exemption, will arrange marriages? Otherwise, there is no basis for the argument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be clear on this. If it is to be a question of transferring the property they can transfer it irrespective of whether the son is getting married, and if they live for five years afterwards there is complete exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often the five-year period can be rather long, whereas if they give it away on marriage, there will be no question of the five-year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right, provided they are alive.  If a person should be on his deathbed at the time he had a son or daughter who was getting married, he would be positively safe in transferring them.  There is a built-in inducement not to transfer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of that.  The argument here is that this provision is an inducement to people not to transfer property but there is no basis in logic for that argument. <Col N="1390" /> The inducement to people to transfer their property in order to avoid duty lies in the general exemption of gifts that have been transferred during the five years before the death.  In the case of a farmer whose son is getting married and who decides to transfer the farm to the son, he will decide to do that only if he considers himself to be old enough to give up or if, in his opinion, the son is old enough and experienced enough to manage the farm.  There are other factors that may be involved but these two are the basic ones and if either of them is not satisfied, he will not transfer the farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the saving of duty eventually the potent factor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That takes us back to what we were saying before.  Does anybody transfer property to a son or daughter on marriage solely for the purpose of avoiding duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not solely but it can be a very important factor in a parent making up his mind to transfer property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>At a particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the inducement of avoiding duty is a potent one, he will transfer the property regardless of whether his son is getting married and he will do so as early as he considers it feasible to avoid duty.  If his son is getting married and he considers the time ripe to transfer, he will transfer but if the question of avoiding duty is what is in his mind, he will have transferred before that because he will know that time is running out for him as regards a gift other than in consideration of marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that the more one examines this, the more he will find that the inducement involved in nonpayment of duty in the case of transfers on marriage is virtually nil.  On the face of it, it may look like a substantial inducement but when one examines the circumstances it is virtually nil as an inducement.  Again, I would remind the House that by dealing with this we are controlling opportunities for evasion which exist and which have been availed of before but <Col N="1391" /> we are not interfering with the ordinary situation that arises on transfer in consideration of marriage.  To suggest that what we are doing here is contrary to established social policy is a misunderstanding and is a misreading of the meaning of the section and a misreading of the actual situation in the country.  The real inducement arises on the ordinary gift and not the one made in consideration of marriage because such gift is made in consideration of marriage by reason of the parent deciding, for various reasons, that this is the time to transfer and not because of exemption from duty.</P>

      <P>In effect, the Minister's argument is that marriage is no inducement to transfer and that the real inducement is the possibility of living for a further five years.  If that is the kernel of the Minister's argument, why put in any exemptions at all for a marriage transfer?  Why a sum of £5,000 in the case of a transfer from parent to child and the sum of £1,000 from a relative to a nephew or a niece?  He should not allow any exemptions at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reiterate what was said here by a number of <Col N="1393" /> Deputies.  How, in rural Ireland, do you raise money on land?  you just cannot do it.  Of course, if it is a really big farm there is probably no problem but even then it may not be a good thing, you must part with some of it or you must part with stock.  It cannot be got.  I am convinced this has emerged from a lack of knowledge of rural conditions. It also applies in urban areas but it is not as great.  We are making great efforts to establish industry here, to induce outsiders to come in.  If Irish people have established industries or business concerns and want them to continue, to hand on the business to their children, if they have children&mdash; if they have not it does not arise&mdash;is it not sound economic and social policy to permit them to do it and to encourage them to do it?  Can anyone argue that because they are getting some benefit in very special circumstances it is denying it to somebody else or that they are being obliged to pay more in duty?  I do not believe that argument stands up.  There is no case here.  If there are cases of wealthy fly-by-nights getting away with it, it should be possible to devise some system to deal with them.  If there are such people it is surely extraordinary that they can arrange marriages and anticipate that they will die within the period.  There are the obvious cases of average holdings.  Deputies who represent agricultural constituencies, whichever party they belong to, will agree that you cannot raise money on a holding, that you can either sell the stock or part with the holding, but the idea of raising money on the holding is just out.  Everyone agrees that it is bad policy to sell part of the holding. Indeed, the Land Commission in most cases will not agree to the subdivision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal here is apparently designed to catch a very small number of people but, in fact, will catch in the net a whole lot of people whom it is recognised and accepted should be facilitated in ensuring that their holding, their business or industry should be carried on and should be in an economic position, strong enough to meet what everyone recognises as inevitable nowadays&mdash;the demands of increased capital and increased liquid <Col N="1394" /> finance in order to operate effectively. I believe this proposal has been transferred from circumstances that are entirely different from those in this country and that it is unsuited to our conditions, our circumstances and our needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister very significantly and enthusiastically &ldquo;hear, hear-ed&rdquo; Deputy Tully when he said that people do not transfer land or property on marriage because they wish thereby to avoid duty but because they wish to set up on a proper basis the new family which is being formed.  Then he comes along and justifies this section by adverting to cases in which people do transfer property on marriage in order to evade duty. The Minister cannot have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will get a chance to meet the argument fairly or unfairly, but I do not think he will be able to do so.  Assuming that people, as the marriages take place, settle a certain amount of property on the parties to the marriages.  There may be three children and the parents settle property on them as they get married. Suppose a parent sets aside the same amount to settle on each one.  We will have the situation&mdash;I may be wrong about this&mdash;that if one of the marriages takes place eight years before the death that person will get his slice of the property without paying any duty. If another marriage takes place six years before the death that person also will get his property without paying duty.  If the third marriage takes place three years before the death that person will have to pay duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the problem. The most recently married person has to pay death duties whereas the people who are less recently married and have had more time to settle themselves in life get away without death duty.  This seems to be unjust.  The person who is two or three years married, who may be buying a house and experiencing all the difficulties which recently married people do experience, will have to pay the death duty whereas the other people will not.</P>
      <P>I was speaking about the effects of this section on people who should transfer land earlier in their lives to their sons.  The existing provisions do provide a definite incentive to this effect.  It is difficult to explain it adequately but I hope I shall succeed in conveying at least something of what I have in mind.  If you are talking about this five-year ruling you are talking about something which nobody can predict because he does not know for how long he will live.  There is no definite and immediate incentive to transfer the land now rather than in a year or two years hence.  In those circumstances there will be the tendency to postpone from one year to the next.  If you have an exemption which is related specifically to one event, namely the marriage of an offspring, there is an immediate incentive to transfer at that time rather than postpone.  It is not that people want to hold on to their land in principle but they are just not prepared to make the effort to do it and they keep postponing it.  If they know that at the point where their son is getting married there is a definite incentive to make the gift that will be enough to overcome the inertia which leads to postponement and ultimately leads to the property not being transferred at all during the lifetime of the testator.  That is what I am trying to get at, this immediate incentive which it is proposed to remove in this section.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to a point Deputy Cosgrave made.  This section is not in the Bill for the social reasons the Minister has been giving us.  This Finance Bill is full of attempts to collect pennies here and there because, in fact, the Government are in dire financial trouble and everything about this Bill&mdash;the taking away of the small amount given to income taxpayers last year and this section&mdash;are all indications of this.  Why did the Minister put this section in the Bill? One could not really say it was put in because he would get a substantial amount of money.  Obviously he will not.  He admits there were 81 cases in three years, an average of 27 a year. This is pursuing minutiae.  We have 700,000 income tax payers because they are now being pursued down below ground level and at the same time we have the other extreme where the Minister is pursuing 81 cases in three years.  People do extraordinary things when they are in dire difficulty.  The Minister for Transport and Power said today that Aer Lingus are down £800,000 and are looking for money from the State.  We know this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall talk about exemptions from estate duty on grounds of marriage.  It was regarded as a good thing to make one's daughter an air hostess but I am not so sure that is the situation now.  Why did the Minister put this section in the Bill?  The reason is that by doing this kind of thing and pinching relatively wealthy people he is proving to those who have to pay income tax on sub-subsistence level incomes that he is being fair, that he is going to grind everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that this is urban minded because the fact is that a 100-acre farm today worth £20,000 on which something like £1,250 duty would be paid, will not give any income comparable with the value of £20,000.  Anybody who knows anything about agriculture knows this. It is a different type of thing.  It gives security but where is the £1,250 to <Col N="1397" /> come from in cash?  Some months ago Deputy Hogan O'Higgins said she wished farmers would be made pay income tax because everybody would become ashamed of how small farm incomes were.  We in this party have proposed that farmers should pay tax, that they should submit accounts if they were above £100 valuation.  I think that is right and proper in view of the low level at which the ordinary worker pays tax.  I cannot conceive of the mind that thought up this section. I do not know where it comes from.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, when people are engaged day after day in a relatively limited area they very often get most peculiar notions and extraordinary ideas come into their minds.  They inflate the importance of their own work and this is true of all humanity.  Some of us like being Members of Dáil Éireann and get a good deal of enjoyment out of it.  But other people get great enjoyment out of their work and that includes people in the Estate Duty Office.  I want to be fair to them: in the past the Estate Duty Office were very reasonable.</P>

      <P>I thought we were on the section.  It is relevant to the section.  The Ceann Comhairle wants me to talk only about marriage.  There is no use in pretending: most of these cases would be cases where a farm would be passed on by a parent to a child who is getting married although Deputy Tully is right in that there could be a gift of a house by a wealthy person to a daughter getting married. These are the type of cases that would happen.  But the most significant case undoubtedly is the case of the land that is passed on.  There is no doubt that the case made from the Fine Gael benches that either some of the stock has to be sold or the working capital has to be run down to pay this kind of money is valid.  If you have the security of a 100-acre farm you have every right to spend your income but if you do, and if you are caught by this provision, you are in real trouble because it will take literally years to <Col N="1398" /> pay off this sum.  I am not exaggerating. Assuming the Fianna Fáil Party have some rural philosophy it is obvious that their attitude towards income tax for farmers is an admission that there is no worthwhile income from land&mdash;not that large sums of money would not be got by imposing income tax on well-off farmers whom, I think should pay tax.</P>
      <P>In view of the miserable size of what is involved I wonder why the Minister brings in this section or allows himself to be codded into doing it by some enthusiast of the type I mentioned. He must know the sort of rumpus that would arise in the House about this kind of section.  I do not understand why the Minister gets himself into this kind of alleyway and allows himself to be pushed against the wall.  He has produced no argument worth mentioning in favour of this.  He has admitted that the yield is relatively small.  The only case he has made is where some old man on the verge of death says to a daughter a week before he dies: &ldquo;Hurry up with your marriage, Mary, because I am near death and I will pass on the farm to you.  I will pass away happy because the State will not get anything from me.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Under existing law the fact is that in such a case such a man will escape only up to £5,000.  There is no use in pretending this sort of thing is a normal occurrence.  There is no use in dealing with head cases in legislation. The case the Minister has put before us is a sort of head case of a man on the verge of death thinking how his successors can evade duty on whatever property he will leave them.  This is not normal.  In other cases, I see no reason why a person, no matter how wealthy, should not pass on his wealth within the laws as they exist already.</P>

      <P>The day when 90 per cent of the agricultural cases coming to the Revenue Commissioners do not pay any duty is rapidly passing away and all the Minister has to do is sit on it as he is doing with the income tax law.

      <P>I issue a challenge to the Minister in regard to this section. If the Minister believes he is right in this matter, let his party remove the whip from the Fianna Fáil members and have a free vote on this section. I predict that the members of Fianna Fáil from rural Ireland will realise that the method of transferring property from a father to his son or <Col N="1400" /> daughter is popular and any changes attempted by way of this legislation will be resisted.</P>
      <P>This method of conveyance has been used by the farmers for many years.  It is a simple and easy method of transferring property.  When a son or daughter is getting married the father is prepared to transfer the property. The cost involved is not large and it was a reasonable and proper way of carrying out the transaction.  I know that many rural Deputies in Fianna Fáil are worried about this legislation.  I come from the midlands&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be honest about this.  I can tell the Minister my practice is very small for the simple reason that I am trying to devote much of my time to the business of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>When a conflict such as this arises, I believe a person has to consider the matter and look at it objectively and I am trying to do that in this instance.  This legislation is a mistake and if the Minister considers the matter he will recognise it to be such.  Many farmers will consider the Minister a wise man if he withdraws the section and I am appealing to the Minister to do so.</P>
      <P>The amount of money to be obtained by this measure will be small. I have discussed this matter with many farmers and I have found that they are very worried about it.  They may not become liable for duty but there is always the worry at the back of their minds that they will be caught by this measure.  The anxiety that is being caused and the hindrance that is being created in regard to marriage settlements, combined with the fact that the amount involved will not be large should be sufficient reason for the Minister to withdraw the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1401" /> If the section is passed it will prove that the Government are desperate to raise money.  The fact that they have even contemplated such a measure shows how short they are of funds. When one considers this legislation and reads about the proposals to introduce the value added tax for the sale of cattle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It demonstrates that the Government are out of touch with rural Ireland.  Farmers are finding it difficult to keep going.  The amount of money that this measure will provide for the Government will be small, but the amount of trouble, confusion and worry caused to the people will be great.  If a farmer wishes to obtain money from the Agricultural Credit Corporation or from the banks, he finds it extremely difficult to do so.  I have frequently come across applications made to the ACC and I know that nine out of ten are refused.  The same situation applies to the banks.  If this section is passed and a person has to pay estate duty, he may be unable to obtain money from the ACC or the banks and, therefore, he will be forced to sell stock to pay the duty.  The result will be that his farm will become run-down; it will <Col N="1402" /> not be stocked to capacity and when the farmer has no stock to sell he will be forced to sell the farm.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about entry into the EEC.  Farmers are finding it difficult enough now.  When we succeed in getting into the Common Market, at that stage I believe it would be a tragedy to see sections like this being imposed upon the rural community here and being imposed upon farmers.  I would be sad to see any farmer in this country having to sell his farm to pay estate duty for which he had become liable and his farm being swept up and bought by somebody from Germany or France, somebody with plenty of money when our farmers are not able to compete on the same level.  It may, in fact, happen if this legislation goes through.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister to be a reasonably fair man and I would ask him to withdraw the section.  I do not know how he ever thought of bringing it in, but I am quite certain that if he listened to what I said at the beginning and allowed a free vote on this section, he would be walking into the lobby on his own to vote for it.  I do not believe that anybody else would follow him.  I believe the section is a mistake and he should be big enough to withdraw it. If he does so, the farming community will think highly of him.  The NFA at present are very worried about this section. They have issued many statements and <i>The Farmer's Journal</i> has pointed out the dangers of it.  Everybody is quite well aware of this section and many of the farmers who worked hard for this country took part 50 years ago in different fights for different causes. These people now are reaching the stage where many of them are handing over their property to their sons or daughters and now find that they are to be penalised to this extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have at present very many commemoration ceremonies and different festivities commemorating different events, and I believe that it would cost as much for one of these receptions as the entire amount of money brought in by this section in a year.  We are getting our priorities very wrong and we should reconsider and have a further look at ourselves and at the existing <Col N="1403" /> position.  It would be sad to see any farmer after handing over his farm to his son or daughter, when his son or daughter was getting married, dying within two or three years, and that son or daughter being forced to sell to pay the duty on a farm which he had worked in his lifetime to build up, or to see them in the position of having to obtain money at high interest rates&mdash;perhaps from a credit company or a hire-purchase company&mdash;to pay off the duty for which he had become liable.  The amount of duty he would have to pay, together with the interest on the money he would have to borrow, would be such that he might be left for the rest of his life struggling to pay off the interest.</P>
    <P>I believe it is not wise; I believe that this section is a mistake and a blunder and I ask the Minister to reconsider it. He would be a much wiser man if he did.  The amount of money brought in by it is small but the anxiety, the worry and the trouble which it is causing is considerable, and in fact in relation to the number of people who will be affected, I believe it is unfair to them and for this reason I ask him to withdraw it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might clarify a point, we have had a long debate on this matter and I have not yet heard from the Minister his reason for this section.  Is it that he considers he is closing a loophole or that he considers as a matter of justice that gifts in consideration of marriage should be on exactly the same footing as purely voluntary gifts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I indicated that the reason for this section is that I want to close a loophole which has existed and which has been used and I want at the same time, while doing that, to retain the existing position for what I might call the normal case.  I would remind Deputies that when they are talking about farms being transferred in consideration of marriage, it brings us back to the section which we discussed earlier whereby the artificial valuation of land can be applied, and if on the basis of the artificial valuation&mdash;that being applied&mdash;you can get <Col N="1404" /> a situation where no duty is payable, then it applies in the case of a transfer in consideration of marriage as it applies to any other case, and Deputies will remember that as a result mainly of that artificial valuation method approximately 90 per cent of the cases of agricultural holdings coming into the Revenue Commissioners do not pay duty.  That is a very important thing to bear in mind in the context of this.</P>
      <P>In the case of non-agricultural cases, I think the limits are not unreasonable &mdash;£5,000 and £1,000&mdash;but they will be effective in ensuring that this loophole I have talked about does not exist any more and I make no apology to any Deputy or anybody else for closing this loophole.  I do not accept the idea that a man who is wealthy should, by reason of this exemption which was not intended for that purpose, be able to avoid very substantial liability for duty and I think it is reasonable, and indeed that we have a duty, to close that loophole while maintaining the position for the ordinary case.  I believe that is what we are doing here.  If one has regard in the case of non-agricultural cases to the levels of £5,000 and £1,000 and in agricultural cases to the artificial valuation of land, I think it is a fair approach to this problem which exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also say to Deputy O'Donovan and to Deputy Enright who made a most inconsistent speech in my opinion&mdash;he seems to be going one way for one moment and another way afterwards&mdash;and who at one stage said that this was going to yield a small amount of money, that he is perfectly right.  I do not know how much it will yield but I am quite certain that it is going to be small. Having regard to the fact that there were 81 such cases over the three-year period, it is clearly going to be a small amount and therefore the suggestion that this is of vital importance to the farmers of this country or a very popular way of transferring property just does not stand up on examination of the facts.  I make no apology because it is small for doing something about it.  Deputy O'Donovan says that I am pursuing minutiae.  I want to tell <Col N="1405" /> him I believe that we&mdash;I as Minister for Finance and he as a Deputy&mdash;both have a duty in distributive justice as far as we can not to ignore loopholes of this nature because they are small, because there are a small number of people involved in it.  I think we have an obligation so far as we can&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This has operated effectively to exempt about 90 per cent of agricultural cases from duty, in general, anyway.  There is no reason why it should not operate in the same way in this case.  Having regard to that, and to the limits here, I would suggest that we are ensuring that the genuine, <i>bona fide,</i> case is being kept in precisely the same position as it has been in for years.  We are closing the loophole on the wealthy people who have availed of it.  I feel that this is an approach to the problem which is reasonable and which should command the support of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I honestly believe that the Minister's argument contained an inconsistency and the Minister has not met my arguments on that matter.  He interrupted, but he did not deal with them.  This charge on my part is that, first of all, the Minister agreed with Deputy Tully that people do not transfer property to their children who are getting married in order to evade duty, and then he tries to justify this section <Col N="1409" /> by saying that it is to deal with people who make such transfers of property in consideration of marriage, in order to evade duty.  There seems to me to be an inconsistency there.  However, perhaps, the Minister will be able to explain it to me.</P>
      <P>The other point he did not deal with related to the question of people getting married six or seven years before death and getting away without paying death duty while those who marry within the five-year period have to pay death duty.  That seems to me to be unfair because it penalises the more recently married couple and that is wrong.  The Minister did not deal with the point I made in relation to the very definite incentive to transfer land as against a very indefinite incentive given to people by the five-year rule.</P>
      <P>He did not deal with the questions asked by various speakers, namely, if this loophole is being used, by whom is it being used, in what circumstances is it being used, how often is it being used, and how much will this section be worth to the Estate Duty Office in increased revenue.  A quantified reply to those questions is essential to an assessment of whether or not this general penalty is justified by the alleged evasions which the Minister says are taking place.  I do not believe they are taking place on the scale claimed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister also claimed repeatedly that there are only 81 cases in a given period on record in the Estate Duty Office.  On Second Stage Deputy Fitzpatrick made a point which I do not think the Minister answered.  Not knowing anything about the way in which a solicitor deals with estate duty cases, possibly I am out of depth in trying to explain this but, so far as I know, what Deputy Fitzpatrick said was that that figure of 81 was not representative because most people, knowing that there was this exemption in existence when filing the affidavit, I think it is, for estate duty purposes would not include it even though it did take place within the period.  They would not bother including it because they knew it was exempt and, therefore, it was of no interest to the Estate Duty Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1410" /> Therefore, this figure of 81 relates only to cases where the people decided to include it in the affidavit, which it really was not necessary for them to do in practice.  There may have been some strictly legal obligation upon them to do it.  In practice, Deputy Fitzpatrick, who is a highly competent solicitor, did not think it would be necessary to include this.  If a man of his competence did not think so, I am sure many other solicitors did not think so either.  Therefore, this figure of 81 is not representative of the number of cases in which this concession in relation to gifts in consideration of marriage was availed of.  Therefore, the Minister in quoting that figure is unfairly and incorrectly minimising the effect of the section.</P>

He did not say that it is a matter of policy with him to equate marriage gifts with ordinary gifts and I take it, therefore, that his motive for this section is to close a loophole, a means of estate duty avoidance that has been availed of.  Am I correct in that?</P>

      <P>Yes, and in the case of agricultural land the artificial valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister's object is to close a loophole, estate duty avoidance or tax avoidance is something that must be within the independent manipulation of the person seeking to effect the avoidance.  The setting up of a private company, the making of a settlement, the setting up of a holding company, all this sort of manoeuvring to avoid duty or tax, is within the province of the person who wants to effect the avoidance.  He may need the co-operation of third parties in doing it but the scheme or the avoidance which he draws up is not conditional on any matter over which he does not have control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case where the Minister is saying the avoidance depends on marriage I would submit to the Minister that there is the world of difference between the normal types of avoidance measures and a marriage settlement because essentially the person disposing of the property has no control over the marriage which is the trigger for the avoidance.  The marriage is entirely <Col N="1414" /> within the compass of third parties over whom the donor has no control.  Consequently, I would submit to the Minister that one cannot have estate duty avoidance where the avoidance is dependent on a fortuitous happening over which the person making the gift cannot and does not have any control. It is invalid of the Minister to state that the reason for this section is to close a loophole because it is not a loophole which is available in general terms to everyone who wants to avail of it.</P>
    <P>The fact that a marriage may be going to take place at an opportune time is not, I would submit to the Minister, a loophole which deserves statutory sanction, particularly when that statutory sanction can and does take with it adverse effects on more innocent people than on people whom the Minister would classify as guilty. The innocent people will, by and large, be comparatively unwealthy, if I may use the word, farmers and business people in towns.  It has been my experience that any farm other than a very small farm falls to be valued at estate duty stage on market value because when the valuation is multiplied 20 times there must be a desperate situation in regard to personality in the estate if the resultant figure does not exceed £2,000.</P>
    <P>Let us take a farm of £60, which is a small farm; 25 times the valuation of £60 is £1,500.  A person with a 60 acre farm would want to be in a dire financial position if he had not net personalty to bridge the gap between £1,500 and £2,000.  He would probably have a tractor and a car and if he had 20 cows, which would not be excessive on a 60 acre farm, they would be worth at least £2,000.  I do not know how the statistics are arrived at in the Estate Duty Office but I am telling the Minister as a matter of fact that there are very few farms&mdash;they are only farms of a tiny valuation&mdash;which fall to be valued on the artificial valuation basis.  These people will now be caught by this section because the Minister wants to close what he calls a loophole which has been availed of by some wealthy people.  It is not a loophole because it depends on circumstances entirely outside the control of <Col N="1415" /> the person who is going to avail of it. I submit to the Minister that his reasons for introducing this section are illogical.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I think I have dealt with it in considerable detail before. I agree in the main with what Deputy Cooney says about the theoretical basis of a loophole and evasion.  This is a special case which can, as he says himself, be availed of by a very limited number of people.  It is for this particular reason that I was making the point that they should be treated the same as everybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>My contention is that we are not doing the harm.  This is borne out by the relatively small number of agricultural cases on which duty is paid.  In the interests of the honour of the solicitors' profession I should draw attention to the fact that the cases of transfers in consideration of marriage which come to the notice of the Estate Duty Office are only those in which the donor dies within five years.  There could well be far more such transfers executed each year but the ones on which any question arises would only be those where the donor dies within five years.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister said that.  It is a matter of custom <Col N="1416" /> that this occurs in the country.  This particular mode of conveying property is a very normal procedure.  Deputy Tully seems to believe it is not an incentive to marriage; that is debatable. I feel that as it is used so often&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that it is a very normal procedure.  This section is going to upset the practice which I believe is a very good and wise practice because it leads to the desirable situation where farmers transfer property to their sons and daughters. This is something I had hoped would increase.</P>
      <P>We are discussing entry to the EEC and if this section is brought in it will have a detrimental effect on our farmers and for that reason the Minister should reconsider the matter.  It is a mistake to upset this procedure at this stage.  The figures quoted by Deputy Cooney in regard to the artificial value are important.  Many thousands of transfers before marriage take place every year.  The figure of 27 per year who are going to be liable for estate duty involves a very small amount of revenue.  It is a serious matter to upset this procedure and for that reason the Minister should withdraw the section.</P>

      <P>I wonder if the Minister would indicate what is the position, under this proposed section, of an executor of an executor who takes on the administration of an estate and goes to a solicitor to have the estate administered.  Is he to be liable, as the accountable person, for what may have been done or seemed to be done by the previous executor and, in particular, is he to be held accountable under subsection (2) (b) to displace the onus of proof?  Would it be accepted that he, having nothing to do with the previous administration of the estate, although he is now the accountable person, could be held amenable for penalties, he having only taken up the administration of the estate?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will note that at the end of subsection (2) (b) the onus is placed on, in the case he envisages, the executor unless he proves that it was submitted without his consent or knowledge.  In the circumstances described by the Deputy it seems to me that the phrase, &ldquo;without his consent or knowledge&rdquo; would exculpate the executor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned to know how he may prove it.  The previous executor may have been with solicitor.  A and may have had the estate in the hands of one particular solicitor.  How does a succeeding person prove that whatever was submitted was submitted without his consent or knowledge?  Why should he have to partake of the onus of so establishing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <P>This, in fact, is a burden undertaken by people, generally people within the ambit of the family to administer the estate.  Is this not a pretty onerous burden to put on somebody who comes along to pick up the chips after the previous executor dies? I am not sure whether the executor of an executor is still executor to the first estate under the Succession Act. He either is or may be made.  If he picks up the executorship by reason of the fact that he is administering the executor's estate he may have no knowledge of what is going on, no means of knowing what solicitor the previous executor had consulted or whether he consulted any solicitor at all.</P>

      <P>The Minister may correct me on the law because quite frankly I am not certain about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1421" /> Person A is the executor under a will to an estate.  He proceeds to administer the estate.  He consults, one assumes, a solicitor and the various steps are taken in relation to the administration of the estate.  He has made his will and he subsequently dies.  Person B happens to be his executor.  Being the executor of an executor he has the responsibility in relation to the administration of the first estate.  He has no information.  He does not know what solicitor has been consulted or anything of that kind.  He is the accountable person I presume and everything that is done prior to his time shall be deemed to have been done with his knowledge unless he can prove to the contrary.  That is my trouble.  It seems to put an onus of proof which is very severe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should say it is not a new onus.  There is a similar provision in section 58 (6) of the Finance Act, 1963.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest to the Minister that the penalties proposed in the section are frighteningly large.  I think the Minister would be obliged to give us some very good reasons why these, to my mind, excessive penalties have been introduced.  Section 1 provides for a penalty of £500 for failure <Col N="1422" /> to comply with subsections (3), (4), (5) and (14) of section 8 of the Finance Act, 1894.  Subsection (3) requires an executor to return accounts of personal property.  Subsection (4) requires a person other than an executor who receives property to make a return of it. Subsection (5) requires a person accountable for estate duty and any person whom the commissioners believe to have taken possession&mdash;I presume an executor or an administrator de son tort&mdash;to make a return and subsection (14) again puts an obligation to fill the forms required by the Commissioners. Section 8 of the 1894 Act provides for a penalty of £100.  No doubt having regard to inflation since then £500 is not that big but £500 to my mind is a huge penalty for failure to comply with these sections.</P>
      <P>There is a further very significant and serious distinction between what is proposed now and what is in the 1894 Act.  Subsection (6) of section 8 of the 1894 Act ends with a proviso: &ldquo;Provided that the Commissioners, or in any proceeding for the recovery of such penalty the Court, shall have power to reduce any such penalty.&rdquo; This discretion to remit would appear to be removed by section 41 and if a penalty is imposed it must be a penalty of £500.  That is altogether excessive particularly when it could apply to a person who would be in the position of an executor de son tort, maybe in that position through no fault of his own.  It is altogether prohibitive and quite repressive. If the Minister wants to increase the monetary penalty he should at least retain the proviso giving the Commissioners or the court power to reduce any such penalties.  That should be retained because there could be varying degrees of guilt for failure to make the returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The first penalty which is provided in subsection (1) is a penalty not exceeding £500.  In subsection (2) we are dealing with fraud or negligence in the sense that we discussed on an earlier section, negligence in the sense that is defined in one of the previous Acts which is considerably more than what is commonly accepted as negligence.  In the later ones <Col N="1423" /> dealing with banks we have stepped it up too but we are taking account of the fall in the value of money plus the fact that we are dealing in subsection (5) with banks for whom a smaller penalty would mean very little. However, having said that, I must confess that the point made by the Deputy has some validity.  It may be justifiable in the case of fraud to have a penalty that will not be reduced below the £500 but, perhaps, in other cases a discretion should exist and I shall have another look at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I further suggest this to the Minister?  With regard to subsection (2) (a): &ldquo;Where a person fraudulently or negligently ...&rdquo; the Minister says that negligence is defined in a peculiar fashion for this purpose. I do not see in that section any back reference to the definition of negligence. Earlier in the Act there is a definition of negligence for income tax purposes but while I may be wrong I do not see any special definition of negligence in relation to making returns for estate duty purposes.  I think the section is unduly harsh here also if it equates fraud with negligence in failing to make returns and provides a penalty of £500 and the additional duty.  Subsection (3) would also cause me considerable worry and apprehension.  It says: &ldquo;Any person who assists in or induces ...&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Induces&rdquo; is fair enough but a person who assists in making out a return &ldquo;which he knows to be incorrect shall be liable to a penalty of £500&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Which he knows ...&rdquo;&mdash;could this mean that he would be held to know if there was negligence in not knowing?  If a person was negligent in informing himself of the facts could he then be held to have known that there was a false or inaccurate return being made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I can pronounce authoritatively on this but I think that would be stretching it too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>A further point arises in connection with subsection (2) (b) where a document is submitted on behalf of a person accountable it shall <Col N="1424" /> be deemed to have been submitted by the person accountable unless it was submitted without his consent or knowledge.  Again it may be stretching the point too far but I remind the Minister that county registrars have powers to apply for and obtain letters of administration and grants of representation and in this connection they must make returns to the Revenue Commissioners.  No doubt it was the intention at the time of passing that Act, in giving that power in the Succession Act, that it should be extended and would gradually become widely availed of.  I remember this because it caused considerable apprehension in legal circles.  You could have a funny situation in which an officer of the court would possibly find himself in difficulty under this section.  I submit that the penalties which are already within the estate duty code are quite adequate.  Has the Minister's experience been that they are inadequate to deal with abuses or have abuses been taking place on a substantial scale?  If they have not been adequate to procure quick payment of duty that is already dealt with in the interest section. There are already severe penalties for not making a return and for making a false return.  It is unduly harsh and, indeed, repressive to impose a penalty of £500 for negligence in the making of a return.</P>
      <P>The facts that may have to go into a return can be of such complexity that the gathering of them would present great difficulty and it could be quite simple for a person after the event, when a certain amount of ground work has been done but has not been fully done, to say: &ldquo;You were negligent in not doing that ground work fully.&rdquo;  When it is being done it might have been very difficult; subsequently, with hindsight, it might appear to the person seeking to impose a penalty for negligence that there should not have been any negligence. I ask the Minister to remove &ldquo;negligently&rdquo; from subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the actual figures involved are not unreasonable having regard to the fall in the value of money.  The Deputy asked if the <Col N="1425" /> existing penalties were adequate.  Unfortunately, there is some doubt about them from a legal point of view and they are not adequate in that sense. That is why we had to recast the sections but I have indicated, and I say again, that I have some doubt that we should have fixed penalties apart from fraud.  I shall have another look at that.</P>

A ruling has been made by his Department that men who are contracting and who are the main body of contractors, who supply labour only or craft only, are not considered to be lumpers and are in some peculiar way excluded from the arrangement.

      <P>I have here a letter from the Minister's Department which states that the rule is that since they are contractors just for labour only they are being excluded.  The gentleman who has been dealing with this section &mdash;I do not want to name him&mdash;has told me that is the ruling, that unless they are supplying some kind of material or something like that as well as their labour, they are not considered to be lumpers.  The Minister has said, and I agree, that they were the people for whom the provision was originally introduced.  I should be glad if the Minister would look at that aspect of the matter because it is causing endless trouble, and many of the men have emigrated because they cannot stand up to it.</P>

They are the people we were talking about when this measure was introduced.  It is unfair to tell them that they should stamp cards.  They do not work normal hours or work in the same way as other insured workers on the site.

If this is to be free of income tax I am against it.  I should like the Minister to clarify this point.</P>

      <P>It appears that in this section there is a new proposal if a person is assessed for tax.  If he is not satisfied with the assessment he appeals the assessment to be heard by a judge of the circuit court.  According to the section the corporation profits tax shall be paid in accordance with the determination of the appeals commissioners. This is an extraordinary situation because it appears the principle that a matter is <i>sub judice</i> while it <Col N="1429" /> is before the courts no longer applies. The Minister decides that the appeal commissioners' decision must stand even though there is an appeal provided for.  This is my reading of the section but I may not be interpreting it correctly.  However, if my reading is correct, perhaps the Minister would say why this decision has been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the Deputy correctly he is mistaken but it may be that I do not understand the point he is making.  Is the Deputy saying that the section is providing that when the appeal commissioners have made a determination that operates as a determination the person has to pay the tax on that basis unless the decision is upset by the circuit court? Is that what the Deputy means?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The section states:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding that, in the case of an assessment to corporation profits tax made upon a person on or after the date of the passing of the Finance Act, 1971, the person has, pursuant to section 429 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 (as applied to corporation profits tax by section 56 (6) of the Finance Act, 1920), required his appeal to the Appeal Commissioners against the assessment to be reheard by a judge of the Circuit Court, corporation profits tax shall be paid in accordance with the determination of the Appeal Commissioners:</P>
      <P>Provided that if the amount of the assessment is altered by the determination of the judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that despite the fact that the person is dissatisfied with the assessment and has appealed to a judge of the circuit court&mdash;which he is entitled to do&mdash;and in normal circumstances the decision given would be final, but the Minister is saying here that whether he is right or wrong he must pay the tax.  The Minister says that he will refund the money if he is wrong and that if the man has not paid enough he will have to pay the extra amount.  This appears an extraordinary section to insert in a Bill. Despite the fact that the matter is <Col N="1430" /><i>sub judice</i> the Minister is saying that the person must pay anyway.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to a point I mentioned earlier this evening&mdash;the Government must be very short of money when they are forced to make such efforts to get every small amount of money collected.  They may have to refund some of the money but their main objective is to get hold of it in any way.  Will the Minister state if my interpretation is incorrect?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has the method by which the section would operate quite clear but I do not think he is right in his interpretation.  First, it is not a question of doing this solely because of the amount of money it would make available to the Exchequer. This matter is in relation to corporation profits tax but there have been similar provisions relating to income tax.</P>
      <P>Let us compare the position of a taxpayer with a person under PAYE. The person will appeal to the appeal commissioners under the present law and then to the circuit court.  Perhaps he will wait until the day of the hearing and then withdraw the appeal. I am not saying this happens in all cases but it does happen in many cases. When it happens people obtain a lengthy period during which they have not paid their tax.  Let us compare that position with somebody under PAYE.</P>

      <P>I have an observation to make on this section, which <Col N="1431" /> I do not think the Minister will like. In this city there is a room with the word &ldquo;court&rdquo; written on the door&mdash; c-o-u-r-t&mdash;and this is the room in which the Appeal Commissioners sit and this is most inappropriate and contrary to the Constitution.  I see the Minister sighing heavily&mdash;I knew he would not like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sighing because it does not seem to me to be relevant to the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly is relevant to the section&mdash;that is just the point.  If you go before an ordinary court and lose your case and then appeal, you can do nothing about it, pending the hearing of the appeal.  In this case you have to cough up so I think my first remark is relevant to the section because in fact it is not a court&mdash;let us be clear about it&mdash;and I appeal to the lawyers on my left that in fact it does not comply with the Constitution&mdash;not for one minute.  Not alone that, but you are going to compel the person to pay.  Do not misunderstand me&mdash;I am not in favour of large corporations being able to keep the Minister out of his money but I do not think the large corporations go in for this kind of thing.  If there be an element of people trying to fob off the Revenue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is much more likely to be the corporation that is finding difficulty in paying the tax &mdash;much more likely to be that kind of person, to whom the money is important. I think they have every right in law to be able to go to the Circuit Court&mdash;and it is not very far off the line, and cases have been taken through the High Court and the Supreme Court.  The Minister knows this as well as I do, but I do think this is contrary to natural justice and contrary to the accepted procedures of our legal system up to the present. It suggests that my colleague, Deputy Tully, is right&mdash;there are so many miserable little provisions in this Finance Bill which are all the time <Col N="1432" /> suggesting there is a grave shortage of money in the Exchequer, such a grave shortage that the Minister has to think up these temporary subterfuges, because they are nothing else.  Once they level out, he will only get the same money&mdash;in a few years time, it will be the same&mdash;but for the moment there is a considerable addition to the revenue, but once it levels out, it will go evenly; but in the meantime this stunt which the present Government have gone in for&mdash;all these stunts of taxes payable under PAYE and all that kind of business&mdash;is now being spread out &mdash;that particular kind of net is being spread wider and wider.  It is not going to help anybody in the long run but it is a temporary subterfuge to get in more money for one year, and there will be more money got in because they will be getting the normal money and getting this extra money.  In other words, it is clear evidence, as I see it, of the Revenue Commissioners pursuing the system into every hole and corner and it is a complete absurdity. It is like the taking away&mdash;I cannot say it too often&mdash;of the small concession made last year in income tax, in spite of the huge increase in the yield of income tax which would have occured ths year without any such thing being done, and it runs right through this Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to prolong this discussion but I must repeat that this does not interfere with the right of appeal at all.  Secondly, I am surprised by the line being taken by Deputy O'Donovan when he says this is contrary to natural justice, when in the case of PAYE taxpayers, if they want to appeal against the assessment, they have to wait until the end of the year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>You can put a company into liquidation by insisting on having a sum paid which they legally should not have to pay and which would be returned to them at a later stage when their appeal is heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The other kinds of cases are far more frequent.  I know of no case in which any company has even looked like being put out of business by having too much tax taken from it, but I know lots of cases of companies which, by virtue of delaying and so on, by making appeals which they do not pursue eventually, have made a good bit of money out of holding on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They have to pay 9 per cent over the whole period.  The Minister is making the case that they will be returning with 9 per cent interest but they would have to pay that on it even if the case went against them eventually.  Frankly, I cannot see the right of the State to do this.  As Deputy O'Donovan said, I most certainly am not in favour of big companies being able to get away with corporation profits tax&mdash;they should pay&mdash;but there is a principle involved here.  The Minister's comparison within PAYE is entirely wrong because if somebody being taxed under PAYE finds his tax assessment wrong, the first day he gets the form&mdash;he may hand it in to the employer&mdash;he will appeal it straight off the reel and while he may not get a decision very quickly, he will get on to somebody who will go to the commissioners and have it cleared up in reasonable time.  In this case what is happening, in my opinion, is that somebody decided to appeal to the court. I do not claim to have a great knowledge of this sort of thing, but it is the only case I know of where in the case of somebody under appeal, the decision is taken in favour of the Government. It is the very same as somebody who is charged with committing a crime and who is let out on bail.  According to the Minister's reading of this, he should be put in jail and a sentence passed on him and even if he appeals, <Col N="1434" /> he should still have to serve the sentence until the appeal is heard.</P>

      <P>In page 27, to delete subsection (1).</P>
      <P>The amendment which follow seeks to delete the words &ldquo;or neglect&rdquo; from subsection (2), and it does appear to me that whatever case was made by the Minister in relation to equating fraud and neglect for income tax purposes, I would feel that it is not right&mdash; I think it is wrong&mdash;to equate these two terms in relation to interest on corporation profits tax.  Fraud, I imagine, particularly from a corporation point of view, is a conscious act brought about by a number of officials concerned in the company.  With regard to neglect, a corporation can only act through its officers and neglect would appear to me to be an omission by some perhaps insignificant official. I would urge that different considerations apply and I would suggest that the word &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; should be removed from the section.</P>

      <P>It is a surprising fact that the form of words can have such extremely far-reaching effects.  We are not really primarily concerned with the fact that the powers of ownership are being transferred as such, but the <Col N="1437" /> power of the owner to retake possession of property vested in another person is our concern.  We are concerned that the person in whom the power would be vested would be a person who would exercise discretion and care in the discharge of his role as a law enforcement officer which is, in fact, what he would be.  We are introducing into the country at present this idea of special service units, supernumerary gardaí, effectively private police forces, who are at the call of anyone who simply has money enough to employ them and who are responsible to him just so long as he continues to pay them.  This appears to be an undesirable departure in the circumstances.  If anybody is needed to enforce the law we believe the gardaí are perfectly competent to do that and we do not think a case has been made for handing this particular power over to anybody. Can a person with money designate an individual with no special skill or knowledge of the job required to be done, a person who has no rights, or powers, or functions to delimit or restrict in any way the activities of others?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody that I know of has any such rights unless these rights are given to him under this Bill. Perhaps the Minister could tell us something about that.  No warrant which can be issued, no insignia, no mark, no uniform, no way in which to identify, as in the case of the gardaí, nothing to indicate that he has a right to do whatever it is he proposes to do, a right to evict an individual and his family from a house of which he may have taken possession, simply because of the failure of the Government to provide housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man has no house.  It may be a very cold, a very wet, a very wild night and he and his family have nowhere to go except into this house.  It is wildly irresponsible of the Minister to incorporate such a loosely worded provision in this Bill, a provision which will allow a wealthy German, a wealthy Frenchman, a wealthy Dutchman or a <Col N="1438" /> wealthy Dane to buy up property here and, because he probably cannot even speak the language, he will be forced to employ an Irishman to go along and assert his right as an owner and evict somebody, somebody of the type mentioned by Deputy Cooney earlier, somebody who has been in a house for many, many years, and generations of his family before him.  This man and his family may be evicted.  It may be an unfortunate man, his wife and children, with no house at all.</P>
    <P>No identifying qualifications are included in this section in respect of either the individual or the agency. Under this section anybody who happens to join a security organisation can be employed in this fashion.  In fact, he need not join a security organisation at all, as someone mentioned earlier.  It could be an advertisement in the paper: &ldquo;Wanted an individual who will clear a wife and family out of a house for me.  Must be able to achieve results and will be paid on those results.&rdquo;  It is as simple and as crude as that.  Any individual who happens to want a few pounds can come along and look for the job of getting rid of these unfortunate people from some property, a property which may be deliberately held empty over a matter of months, or even years, a property being held empty by an individual as a speculative venture, a property he will insist on holding empty because he is waiting to get as big a price as he can for it.  This man will have the right to appoint his own private police force in order to achieve his particular objective in regard to this piece of property.</P>
    <P>Are we to take it there is no serious difference between any member of the public who volunteers for this rather dirty, unpleasant, distasteful kind of work and the qualifications and expert knowledge of a member of the Garda? I do not think there is any doubt that special knowledge is needed in a situation of this kind.  Our police force is particularly concerned with the keeping of the peace.  The Garda Síochána did not become expert at their job overnight. They are men who are heirs to a good tradition.  There are complaints from time to time about members of the Garda but generally speaking, and <Col N="1439" /> as I said earlier I had some experience of meeting them when I was in protest movements and in that way in conflict with them, they are able to exercise remarkable patience and forbearance under very difficult circumstances.  It is not an accident that they are able to behave like that.  It is largely due to the fact that as the years have gone by and as the various authorities in control of the Garda have learned the important prerequisites of a good policeman the standards for entry into the Garda have increased and they are now very stringent and rigid standards. They are the end product of many years of practical experience in handling difficult and distasteful situations of law enforcement of this kind.</P>
    <P>Let us take the man who believes that he has what the Minister called a high moral right to stay in his house because his father was there, his grandfather was there, he grew up there and he hoped to make a home for his own family there.  For that reason he felt very strongly indeed that he had a right to stay there.  When that person is approached he is, understandably, going to be a very difficult person to deal with.  One cannot send in anybody off the streets and say to him, &ldquo;Get him out&rdquo; without the possibility of serious repercussions either for the man who goes in to try to get him out or for the unfortunate man who is to be evicted.</P>
    <P>Let us take the man who, with his wife and his three or four children, goes in, under appalling pressure, to a house because he has no hope and frequently it is no fault of his, he may or may not have the money for a house, whatever the reason he finds himself and his family to be homeless in all kinds of weather.  He looks for shelter in a house because he has nowhere else to go.  If that man is approached by an individual who is told &ldquo;Do the job and you will get paid&rdquo;&mdash;an individual who more than likely will try to cut corners and will not stop short, as we know from the Hume Street incident, of using strong-arm tactics&mdash;that individual, vested under this section with the power to evict forcibly an individual by virtue <Col N="1440" /> of his right of ownership established by this section, is dealing with an extremely potential explosive situation. Doctors, nurses and lawyers all have their little bit of expert knowledge of how to handle difficult situations.  Their knowledge grows and expands as the years go by and they are less and less likely to make mistakes the longer they find themselves dealing with situations of this kind, but under this section any man at all, he might be a butcher, a doctor, a soldier, a lawyer, a builder's labourer, a TD or a Senator, can go along and attempt to deal with a man who has already suffered the humiliation of being unable to find a home for his family.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked in a very patronising, paternalistic and benevolent tone about this man and his family.  He said that they would not be hard on him and as long as he gets out peacefully, as long as he does not bar himself in, as long as he does not drop the snub on the lock and so long as he does not turn a key in the lock nobody will lay a finger on him, no one will touch him.  Could any of us not put ourselves in the position of this unfortunate man with our young children and our wife in a derelict building, which we hate being in anyway, which is most uncomfortable, which is unheated, which has no lighting, which is probably leaking and which is probably rat-infested?  We do not want to stay but we are there simply and solely because the Minister and his colleagues, acting in their capacity as Government, have failed to provide us with housing accommodation.  It is not our fault, it is the fault of the Minister and his colleagues.  The Minister then has the impertinence to incorporate in a section of his law a provision which allows a strong-arm bullyboy to come along to this unfortunate, destitute, homeless family and say: &ldquo;Get out on the side of the street, this belongs to Herr Somebody-or-Other of Munich&rdquo;&mdash;Hamburg, Paris, Amsterdam or wherever it may be&mdash;&ldquo;As an Irishman and as a father of a family you have no right to stay here.&rdquo;  At best they may offer him a place in Griffith Barracks in which his family is divided and as I said the other day <Col N="1441" /> the right of the integrity of the family as a basic unit of our society is taken away from him.  The man can be put out in order to make way for the speculator or the bulldozers who have priority in our society, time and time again.</P>

      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Our concern is with the people who blunder into a situation of this kind or who could blunder into a situation of this kind, people who do not fully appreciate the kind of emotional stress endured by this unfortunate man and his family and lack the understanding and experience in dealing with this sort of situation which we would normally expect from members of the Garda Síochána and which we would normally get from members of the Garda Síochána who have a compassionate and humanitarian approach when dealing with this problem because their job does not depend just on results and getting rid of these fellows, as it does with the individual mentioned here.  He is paid by results.  A member of the Garda goes on whether he gets results or not.</P>
      <P>We are resisting the Minister's attempt to permit under this section the development of the kind of situation which was found in the United States, in New York and in London in the days of Rachmann, the slum tenement landlord exploitation, where they were able in New York to hire a crowd of psychopaths, bullies, criminals without any standards or values of any kind, only concerned to make whatever few dollars were offered, who would do anything for it, who were sent along to a particular property and were told to occupy that property and so make hell for the people in that property that the property would be eventually evacuated by an unfortunate family who could not continue to withstand the tyranny of these thugs sent in by an individual of the Rachmannite type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows well that much the same story happened in London where in the appalling scandal of the exploitation of housing shortages <Col N="1442" /> similar to here, a few years ago, due to Government negligence, equally, of course, completely irresponsible criminals, unfortunate people who did not know any better&mdash;I am not judging them&mdash;were sent along with pick handles and Alsatian dogs, by people who could afford to hire them and pay them, to tyrannise the people living in the tenements so that either they paid extortionate rents or got out. This is precisely the same development in our legislation here, if the Minister had his way.</P>
    <P>We have these people able to go along, without any way in which they can be dealt with.  With a member of the Garda Síochána we know well that because of his uniform he is a member of the Garda Síochána.  We know well, also, that when we see a member of the Garda Síochána coming along we can expect a particular standard, a particular tradition.  He is as much a custodian of that tradition of reasonable, fair play for everybody, and is as conscious of his need to behave with concern and even balance in dealing with this problem as were his predecessors in the force who created the type of reputation upon which we base our assumption that they will deal reasonably and fairly in any set of circumstances.</P>
    <P>In particular I recall in the Hume Street incident, as I mentioned earlier where there was a tremendous temptation, the property owners at the time wanted to get possession and the Garda stood firm and said: &ldquo;No.  We have no authority to do any more than we are doing now.  If there is a breach of the peace we will step in but up to that any further than that we cannot go.&rdquo;  That, of course, implied an enormous number of things.  It meant that this man was conscious, first of all, that he was not in the employment of an Irish Rachmann or a Dutch or Danish Rachmann; he was an employee of the community and had a responsibility to the community and to Parliament and to the people in the house as well as a responsibility even to the man who owned the property. But, it was a jointly owned responsibility. He was nobody's prisoner. He was responsible to every one of us. These people mentioned in the Minister's <Col N="1443" /> Bill are responsible only to the man with the cheque book.  The man with the cheque book knows and cares little about law enforcement other than how it concerns himself, knows little about the rights of the individual in the house or people involved in supporting the people in the house, and cares less.  The garda, on the other hand, must see that the law is carried out and the person in the house has a number of safeguards.  The garda is identified, first of all, by his uniform and, fortunately, here in Ireland unlike some other countries, we are not afraid to look to the police for protection. We know that we can turn to them for protection if we are threatened physically. Not only that but we know also that the garda is a member of a disciplined force that has an honourable tradition behind it.  We know that he was only inducted into the Force after very stringent and high level tests in relation to his education, to his general background, general behaviour&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and his general attitude to this whole question of the enforcement of the law.  Broadly, there are two different kinds of people who like to enforce the law.  There is the public spirited individual who decides that the general position, status and prestige of a member of the Garda and the emoluments provide a satisfactory style of life so far as he is concerned and that it is as a member of that Force that he would like to serve his country. There is the other kind of person seeking to enforce the law&mdash;the person who is of the bullying type and who wants to assert himself.  He loves the idea of a uniform and of being able to order people to do this or that.  He is the aggressive type of person whose aggressive attitudes to his fellow citizens may entail tendencies to assault citizens because he is aroused easily and lashes out at the person whom he believes is preventing him, deliberately, from having his way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A member of the Garda needs to be a person who is particularly mature in personality.  He must be able to meet <Col N="1444" /> a family of this kind and to be able to assess, judge and decide on the emotional stress, the sense of futility, of humiliation, of failure and of agonising distress that is gnawing at this unfortunate family.  The mature garda will know if this is the type of family with whom he is dealing and that the individuals may be unnecessarily aggressive in their attitude to him and refuse to co-operate.  This could lead to a very difficult situation.  It is for the trained member of the Garda Síochána to explain to the person the position as he sees it, to judge the situation as he sees it and to decide whether he can handle it on his own and if not, how much help he needs. If the position becomes particularly difficult and tends to get out of hand and he realises he must use some sort of restraint in order to achieve the particular objective, he is skilled in the methods in which one can use force and not injure or hurt the individuals on whom he is using such force.  That is part of the expert knowledge of a civilised and sophisticated law enforcement body and the Minister is asking us to set aside this very important quality in members of the Garda and replace it by any individual who happens to be in need of money and is willing to make it in this rather disreputable and sordid way.  A member of the Garda will have to know if he is really dealing with a genuine case of a person who is disturbed emotionally because of distress or a person who might be disturbed mentally and who requires care and attention but at all times the person who is put into this awkward and difficult situation should be a person who is well able to carry out the duties involved.  The person with whom the garda is dealing may have had too much to drink or may have suffered an accident as a result of which he would not be aware that he was in a particular building but a garda would have special training in the recognition of conditions of this kind and would be well able to deal with such situations.</P>
    <P>As well as that, a garda is bound by a number of very important and very rigid provisions not only to safeguard himself and safeguard us as <Col N="1445" /> members of the community but, above all, to safeguard the rights of the particular individual with whom he is dealing.  If a person resists, the garda knows what is the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is making it possible for any individual to be sent along to a property and exercise there the rights of ownership.  The right of ownership in this context in our view is the right to claim possession of a property which he believes is wrongfully occupied.  We believe that this power should not be entrusted simply to any individual.  We believe that it should be entrusted only to a person who is skilled and experienced in the exercise of this very difficult and frequently distasteful function of law enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that the individual in the ordinary case if he is breaking the law has the right to be told that he is breaking the law.  He should be told the law that he is breaking and he should then be told that if he continues <Col N="1446" /> to break the law a certain set of procedures must follow from that. These are procedures which we have laid down in this House.  They have nothing to do with strong-arm tactics or pick axe handles or bullyboy tactics of any kind.  They are ones which protect the community, protect property rights but also they protect the individual who is alleged to be breaking the law. In that set of circumstances there is no need at all to use forceful tactics because the police or the law enforcement officers have the right to go along to a police station and seek a warrant. They have a right to bring the person to the police station, to bring him before a sergeant, to make a charge, to explain the meaning of the charge, to explain the section of the Act, to explain the provisions of the Act, to explain the penalties involved before the court in the police station.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir.  We are discussing the procedure which an individual who alleges he owns a property, by right of having purchased that property because he happens to have the money to do so, may adopt, if this section is passed, to reclaim that property. This is a most important diversion from the ordinary procedure of law enforcement and indeed in relation to the recovery of property.  What I am trying to make clear is the extreme fairness of the correct procedure as laid down by this House as opposed to the procedure which was, in fact, adopted in the case of Hume Street where strong-arm bullyboys went along with their pick axe handles and physically assaulted an unfortunate girl, knocked her to the ground and later, to the credit of the House and the Garda, the Department and all of us who form the laws, were brought to justice and dealt with as they <Col N="1447" /> deserved.</P>
      <P>That is now being effectively set aside.  We will not have the same protection from these kind of people.  On that occasion we had the clear case of the activity of a member of the Garda Síochána who refused to intervene. These other people because they were paid went in and tried to take forcible possession.  The Garda would bring the person to a police station, charge him and would be subject to all the consequences of making a bad case, a false charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>You will not mind, Sir, if I return the compliment because if you do read it you will find that the Minister here is trying to introduce a provision which will allow a man who owns property to employ effectively a private army, a private police force, to go and enforce what he considers to be his just right to take possession of a piece of property.  Our case is that a person should only be given this tremendous authority and power if he has experience, knowledge, patience and the legal authority and the knowledge of his legal rights which members of the Garda Síochána have because unlike the private army people the gardaí are men who themselves are subject to very strict discipline.  A member of the Garda Síochána can be <Col N="1448" /> fined, he can be demoted, he can lose his right to promotion, he can be transferred down the country, if in the opinion of his higher officers he is in breach of his correct function as a member of the Garda Síochána.  None of these sanctions exist in relation to this other kind of individual, the member of this supernumerary police force which it is proposed to introduce under this apparently innocuous section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We saw the beginning of this at the last general election.  I was quite astonished to see all these private policemen in their own special uniform running round behind the platform of the final rally of Fianna Fáil.  They appeared to need them; we did not. This is the beginning of this kind of development.  It is this sort of employment of private individuals to enforce the law which was the origin of all the terrible dictatorships&mdash;the Hitler Youth, the Mussolini castor oil gangs, the Falangists in Spain, and so on. This is exactly the same very dangerous deterioration in the whole democratic nature of our society.  These people must be answerable to us, the community, the people who legislate for them.  In my own case a long time ago when we had difficulty in a position of this kind we were able to come to the Dáil and put down questions and we were able to get satisfaction to a certain extent because at least we had this particular hold over the people who discharged this very difficult and rather distasteful function. We had this power of control and they knew that in the last analysis they were answerable to the commissioner, the Minister and ultimately to this House.  Surely these are infinitely preferable, more desirable safeguards which should be retained and should not be diluted in any way by this provision which allows anybody to act in this sort of peace keeping capacity. Somebody mentioned the likelihood of completely irresponsible behaviour by individuals of this kind: you might have them going along knowing there was a provision that the cost of eviction would eventually be charged to the people who were the source of the eviction, and doing untold damage to doors or windows, ceiling or floors or even smashing the windows or trying <Col N="1449" /> to smoke the people out by setting fire to the property or turning hoses on them, or using tear gas or CS gas, to enforce what they believed was the right of the particular individual who happened to have sufficient money to pay them so that they could get possession of the property for him and make the few pounds which would fall to them if they succeeded.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious and dangerous departure from the present system which, with all its faults, has satisfied most of us over the years.  On the whole, it is one that we have been able to control, one in which we held the final sanction, one in which we insisted on seeing that certain standards were laid down in regard to recruitment and training.  Because we did that, we have a Garda force of which most of us are very proud.  As in every profession and section of society there are cases where unpleasant things happen but generally speaking it is a force of the highest standard, dependable, reliable and anxious to see that justice is done to everybody.</P>
    <P>We now have the extraordinary position of the evolution of the private army being permitted.  We heard from an exponent of that general principle, Deputy Gallagher, a man with his own knowledge and experience of the property market, and his general case was that even if starving you should not steal a loaf of bread.  Even a homeless family presumably should not have a home.  He would feel perfectly justified in insisting that somebody should take action no matter what the circumstances because of his particular values and standards.  Under this section he would be allowed and encouraged to enforce this through the use of a private army.</P>
    <P>The community is in a very dangerous situation at present because of this threat of different private armies.  It seems extraordinary to me that on the one hand we should have the Government introducing a provision which would allow the creation and formation of private armies and private police forces for the protection of the rights of speculators, property owners, industrialists and wealthy groups of one kind or another, and at the same time <Col N="1450" /> have this panic stations situation in which the Government appear to be seriously considering the reopening of the internment camps for other private armies which protest that they are anxious to look after the workers, those on strike or locked out or whatever it is.  They have made their case for creating their private army.  The Government are now making their case for creating this private army on behalf of the people they are anxious to protect.</P>
    <P>What right has anybody in the Government, what right has the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Justice to go to the country and say: &ldquo;I want to create private armies for these people and private police forces but I do not agree with the other people and I am going to lock them up.&rdquo;  Surely there is a most wilful and irresponsible level of confusion in the attitude of the Government on these issues.  We hope the Minister will have second thoughts about the dangers of this provision and accept our amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. This is the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; which the amendment seeks to change.  It is a very wide definition. It includes the lawful occupier, every person lawfully entitled to the immediate use and enjoyment of unoccupied land, any person having an estate or interest in land, including a person who remains in occupation after the determination of his tenancy therein, the owner of a servient tenement, the owner of an easement and then the words to which the amendment objects &ldquo;any person acting on behalf of the owner&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objections are well founded because widening the definition to that extent permits all sorts of persons to be appointed as owners by the real owner.  It envisages a situation where what I would call, in lay language, the real owner does not want to act in relation to his property, or in relation to the situation which arises and which might be contemplated by this Bill, and in order to avoid having to do the dirty work himself he can take advantage of this wide definition and employ others to do it for him.  The fact that <Col N="1451" /> this could be the effect is envisaged when I refer to section 6 which assumes or implies that an owner may have to use force in clearing his premises and may cause damage to his property in doing so.  The temptation is there, in fact an invitation is there, to an owner who is dealing with persons whom he alleges are in forcible occupation to employ thugs to do his dirty work for him.  Those thugs, unless this amendment is accepted, will be regarded under this Bill when it becomes an Act as being owners of the property.  It is altogether reprehensible that such a situation could follow from any legislation passed by a democratic Parliament.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke on the rights of fee farm grantors and suggested that such persons should be in some way controlled, the Minister was not prepared to concede anything on that point.  He said it was something rare that would not be relevant in our circumstances.  May I point out to the Minister that the fee farm grantor type of owner is very common and far from being a remote type of ownership in relation to property, is quite near?  It is a real and live ownership in property because it arises in practically every case in this country by virtue of a conversion made under the Renewable Leasehold Conversion Act of 1849.  Prior to that Act a very common type of lease was a lease for life, renewable forever.  Many difficulties arose when a life would fall in and it might not be known that there was need to renew the lease.  Consequently, a difficult legal position could arise as to whether the lessee was entitled to look for renewal.</P>
    <P>This Act was passed to clarify the position.  It gave all the lessees under such leases the power to call for the conversion of their lease into an estate in fee simple, subject to a fee farm rent.  It is a kind of title unique to this country but it is a lease in the sense that it contains all the incidence of a lease.  On conversion all the covenants which applied to the lease now apply to the fee farm grant and the owner of the fee farm grant is in the same position as the lessee.  To suggest, as the Minister did, that Deputy Fitzpatrick <Col N="1452" /> was quoting something extreme is quite wrong.</P>
    <P>The owner of the fee farm grant and anyone deputed by him can act in relation to a property the subject of such a grant with all the force of a lessee because the fee farm grantor&mdash; the person who has to give the grant under the provisions of this Bill&mdash;in effect remains a lessor.  He is entitled to all the remedies which a lessor would have had under the lease which has been converted.  He is entitled to proceed for ejectment for nonpayment of rent, he can distrain for arrears of rent, he can have an action of debt and all the other ways and means, the remedies, suits or otherwise, by which the rent service reserved on his lease is recoverable.  All these things give that person considerable power in relation to the property.  They give similar powers to the people that person might depute to act on his behalf, unless the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; is changed, as sought by Deputy Pattison's amendment.  It is unreal of the Minister to say that Deputy Fitzpatrick's example of quoting the powers of a fee farm grantor arriving from the Bahamas and enforcing his rights is not realistic.  This is quite realistic.  &ldquo;Owner&rdquo; has a wide meaning in this definition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pointing out how wide is the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; within the Act.  It includes any person having an estate or interest in land. It does not have to be an estate or interest in possession.  To my mind it is quite adequate and wide enough to do anything that might need to be done under this Act.  It makes it even wider by stating that such a person can appoint a person to act on his behalf and that the person so appointed will be an owner and, consequently, will be free from any of the sanctions imposed under this Bill for any alleged offence.</P>
      <P>I was about to point out how wide is the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; in the context of a person having an estate or interest in land.  It can mean all kind of persons.  It can mean:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1453" /> Every person seised of or entitled at Law or in Equity to the Reversion expectant on any Lease in Perpetuity as Tenant in Fee Simple or in Fee Tail, General or Special, or as Tenant in Dower or by the Curtesy, or for Life or Lives, or for Years determinable on a Life or Lives, or for a Term of Years absolute of which Forty Years or more are unexpired at the Time of the Applicaaion for a Grant under this Act.</P>
    <P>If there is a conversion as provided by the Act, all these peculiar reversions could be owners, as the definition stands.  Consequently, each of these peculiar persons could appoint someone else to act on his behalf.  It could be executors in certain positions, even executors <i>pour autre Vie,</i> it could be trustees or other types of peculiar oddities and each one of these obscure, unreal persons would have the right to nominate some other person to act on his behalf.  How unreal can one be in legislation when such a situation can exist?</P>
    <P>What it will mean in practice is that these remote owners, the gentlemen in the Bahamas, will come over to this country to see about ancestral property rights and they can employ an agent, a bailiff, a thug, or a bullyboy, and that person is protected by the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill, 1970.  I do not think that would be the Minister's intention but that will be the result unless this amendment is accepted.  There should not have to be an argument about this. It should be plain and obvious that such a result could arise from legislation such as this.  In order to do justice the Minister should&mdash;as he said judges may sometimes have to do&mdash; lean backwards to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>There was a situation in which there was ejectment of a permissive occupier of a gate lodge outside Tullamore&mdash;I referred to this matter earlier today. The occupants had been in possession of the gate lodge for many generations. There was a change of ownership and the present owner decided he wanted possession.  I do not know if the gates were not opened quickly enough, but I am sure he had a good <Col N="1454" /> reason to seek possession of the gate lodge.  The people in the lodge did not want to go&mdash;one of them was in hospital at the time.  An ejectment took place as a result.</P>
    <P>That ejectment took place in the full glare and publicity of the civil law as it stands.  The civil law was adequate for the owner if he wanted to take his remedy.  When this Bill becomes law, that owner will not have to submit himself to the glare of publicity of the civil law and to the ignominy and odium of acting like a 19th century landlord in 20th century Ireland.  He can employ thugs and bullyboys and tell them to clear the cottage for him. They can go in and eject the occupants without going near any court.  They are protected because they are owners within the meaning of this definition. If that situation can arise, I think it reinforces, if reinforcement was necessary, the need for this amendment to be accepted.</P>
    <P>Again this Act envisages that troublesome situations can arise because it makes provision for damage being caused on such ejectment taking place.  There is no doubt that it is an old common law right that every man has the right to clear his own home of a trespasser and to use whatever force is reasonably necessary to do so, but this goes much further than that. It encourages unscrupulous owners, in the situation to which I have referred, to hire a private army to clear the premises.  The situation can also apply in the case of a fishery or a shoot, because the owner of a fishery and the owner of shooting rights are owners within the meaning of the section, and if they employ bailiffs or beaters, ghillies&mdash;anybody in that regard&mdash;and pay them well enough, those persons are for the purposes again of this section owners and are fully protected in relation to anything which may be done under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised that the amendment will not be accepted because the amendment seeks to remove some of the more repressive features, some of the totalitarian overtones of this Bill and the Government are quite determined to ensure that this Bill in all its manifestations will become part of our law and <Col N="1455" /> this very desirable amendment which seeks to remove the temptation for property owners to build up private armies of bullyboys will not be accepted. That temptation is being left in the Bill, and not merely is there a temptation but there is a positive inducement for them to do that by the section which says that if these vicarious owners, if I might so call them, cause damage in attempting to take possession of land or vehicle, that damage will have to be paid for by the person they are ejecting.</P>
    <P>I would like to support Deputy Dr. Browne when he says that the only persons in this country who should be in the position to assist in a matter of that nature should be the Garda Síochána, a uniformed and disciplined Force, a Force that has the respect of the community, but a Force whose morals and sense of discipline have been seriously threatened, and will be more seriously threatened in the future if they see legislation enacted which permits the recruitment and employment of private armies whereby they see their function being usurped and a Force whose discipline and morale unfortunately are being eroded by the existence of private armies already. Anything that goes any further in that direction should be avoided and avoided rigorously.</P>
    <P>If the Minister accepts this amendment, he is not in any way weakening the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo;, which, as I already pointed out, is extremely wide.  It could not literally be any wider and what the Minister wants to do is to allow the employment of any sort of an agent to do work which the owner himself is not prepared to do.  I cannot see any other reason for it.  The only other reason is that the owner might not be present or it might not be suitable for the owner to act.  In other words, it is to benefit an absentee owner, and I do not think that this House in the situations which we all envisage can arise under this Bill should be asked to benefit an absentee owner.  If his property means so much to him that the sanctions of this Bill have to be enforced to protect it, it behoves that owner to be there present himself to see that those sanctions <Col N="1456" /> are enforced or to request their enforcement.</P>

      <P>This Bill is what I might call a sensitive Bill with certain Members opposite.  They have gone so far and are so committed to it without realising how really nefarious it is that they are now becoming a little oversensitive about it.  They may at this stage recover some of the ground lost in propounding it by agreeing to some of these reasonable amendments.  This amendment by Deputy Patterson is most reasonable.  In the situation suggested by Deputy Sherwin, an owner has his civil remedy and our case all along has been that there is no need to invoke the criminal law to enforce property rights.  If the civil law were streamlined and updated and if enough judges were appointed so that the civil remedy could be easily and cheaply made available, there would be no justification at all for this.  Certainly in the odd case of the invalid owner, I do not think there is any justification for bringing in a definition which allows the creation in this country of a private army or private bullyboys, and we have seen it happen.</P>

Their deletion will not do any harm to the intention of the Bill, but they can do harm if they are left in because they can encourage absentee landlords, or indeed landlords who are already on the spot, to recruit their own private armies.  We have seen a tendency to this already&mdash;Deputy Dr. Browne referred to it&mdash;in regard to the Hume St. incident when one of these private armies invaded a premises and committed assault.  If that is the type of thing the Government want to encourage, and they are encouraging it, wittingly or unwittingly&mdash;and wittingly, I am afraid, is the position&mdash;they are encouraging it if they retain these words in the section whereby an owner or anybody acting on his behalf becomes an owner.

I do not see any intention behind the Bill to found, for example, a private army.  I detect, though, a great note of hysteria and a good deal of misrepresentation in the remarks on this Bill.  I also detect the attitude, the cynical sort of attitude, that it seems to be a crime to be able to <Col N="1458" /> buy a house.

      <P>This series of amendments is being used to cloak the real aim of the Bill.  Is it suggested, for example, that any Minister for Justice should fall back on an Act of 1381 in order to enforce the law and to give property the measure of protection which it deserves, after all?  It is suggested, for example, that a Minister for <Col N="1460" /> Justice should fall back on an Act of ten years later, 1391, to enforce the law against forcible entry at present? It would be like going back to the days of the wooden plough and the ox.</P>
      <P>In 1381, we had no squatters of the description we have abroad today.  We had plently of homeless people.  Is it further suggested that a later Act of 1429 would be calculated to help the Government or the Minister for Justice to preserve the law?  Is it suggested that a later Act, of our own Parliament I think, of 1786 would be of any benefit in dealing with the type of forcible entry of which we are aware in present circumstances?  Surely it is not suggested that the one section in the Housing Act, 1970, which relates to this matter would be calculated to deal with lawlessness of this description.

I want to put a fair question to the House: are we in favour of private ownership of any description because I got the impression here tonight from those who spoke that we are not?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told the Government were too lax, that they should deal with the various organisations because <Col N="1463" /> the law was not being enforced. These were the calls from Fine Gael which I read in nearly every paper I took up last winter.  If I had a researcher I would be able to get enough cuttings to make a speech which would last for a month.  It is very hard to relate that attitude to the attitude we have here tonight.  It is very hard to think in the same terms when one listens to the deliberate, destructive speeches which have been made in relation to this Bill.</P>
      <P>Our attention has been drawn to the fact that there were squatters in London&mdash;144 Piccadilly Circus was the highlight of the squatters outing last year.  There were squatters in Birmingham, Glasgow and, of course, in Dublin.  When we try to come to terms with the politics of the street and the squatters it is said that we are heading towards a dictatorship, that we are by-passing this House and that we are not observing the laws of democracy.  It is fair to inquire from those people who are so fond of street politics and at the same time of this House, and who make those speeches, whether or not they believe in a democracy and whether they prefer the politics of this House to those of the street?  That is a fair question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am stating a fact when I say that amendment No. 5, as well as other amendments, is designed to weaken this Bill and leave it finally emasculated and not worth the paper it is written on.  Each amendment here is designed for this purpose.  It is my submission that if we are to preserve the rule of law or to have any regard for or interest in the rights of property then we must ensure that those who own private property will not be molested by any organised gang, whether this is an organised gang subscribing to the aim of squatting or whether it is an organised gang with any other evil design against the State or against property.  When we try to formulate legislation which is designed to curb this activity it should get a fair reading.  It appears to me that from the very start that this Bill has not got a fair reading; the aim of every section in the Bill has been misrepresented and twisted in order to convince the public that we are on the road to setting up a dictatorship.  Any person, whether he be a labourer or professional man who works here, observes the law, pays his rates, rent and taxes and builds a house whether for himself and his family or for letting, should be protected by this House and by the forces of law in the State.</P>

      <P>There are many sorts of owners of property, from labouring men to professionals.  Who is to compensate the owner of a house which is invaded by a gang of squatters&mdash; who usually have all the trappings of deprivation, a certain amount of poverty, a certain amount of anguish&mdash; who set upon a house, forcibly occupy it for as long as they like, do as much damage as they like and get away scot free?  Where will he get compensation? Where can he even take out an insurance policy that would make him immune from this type of private army?  I have been listening for so long to talk about private armies but let us now turn it upside down and call some of the squatters who are led by professional agitators a private army.  When we try to come to grips in a realistic way with those private armies then the manipulators try to turn the tables on us and they call us fascists.  Some of them even dub us followers of Dr. Castro.</P>

      <P>I am construing the amendment.  These are the very words of the amendment.  Does the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; include unoccupied land and is any unfortunate itinerant who may set up his caravan on unoccupied land to be the subject of abuse and to be kicked around in the way in which itinerants have been in the past in parts of this country that are represented strongly on the benches opposite?</P>

      <P>For the benefit of the Deputies who have just arrived I wish to mention again the two questions that I have asked.  Are we to understand that the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; here includes unoccupied land and, secondly, is a caravan a vehicle or a house?  Perhaps Deputy Burke would be able to deal with that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Carter spoke about the Bill and the Minister being misrepresented because we propose to take out of this Bill the right of an owner to apply bullyboy tactics. Under the existing law there is nothing to prevent an owner or somebody acting on his behalf from dealing with such matters.  What is the purpose of this Bill?  It is nothing but a piece of Fascism and it is being handled by a Fascist Minister.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to take out of the Bill a specific right that is being put into it but which was not in the law previously, that is, the right to employ a group of people, to arm them with cudgels, to send them to land on <Col N="1471" /> which people may be taking shelter for the night and throw these unfortunate people out forcibly.  The word &ldquo;forcibly&rdquo; is used in the Bill.  Of course, it is used in reverse.  We all know what has been happening&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate that. Deputy Carter spoke about the type of forcible entry of which we are aware and then went on to say, quite correctly, that many houses were built last year.  If this Bill has any purpose, the Minister is two or three years late in introducing it.  He is displaying bullyboy mentality in introducing such legislation.  There is no squatting in this city at the moment and I challenge the Minister to prove that there is.  The only squatting in this city, which is the only part of the country where it was ever worthwhile squatting, is squatting in a few cases by nieces, nephews or grandchildren of corporation tenants who have gone into houses but who are prepared to pay rent for them.</P>
