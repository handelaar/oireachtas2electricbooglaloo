    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in my reply to a previous question by the Deputy on 10th November, the location of a maternity unit at Dungarvan has been the subject of correspondence between my Department and the Waterford Health Authority.  The latest proposal by the health authority which was submitted to my Department on 2nd December, was to erect a prefabricated building adjacent to the district hospital, to serve as a maternity unit.  It has been pointed out to the health authority that it would take some time to plan and build such a unit and that, in the meantime, there would be no maternity facilities in the area.  In addition, it was most unlikely that such a unit would be erected before 1st April next when responsibility for the health services in the area will be assumed by the South-Eastern Health Board and it would be inappropriate for me to accord approval to a project of this nature before the board had an opportunity of assessing the requirements and formulating proposals for a long-term solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>The health authority had previously been informed that it was of paramount importance that (1) maternity facilities be provided quickly to serve the needs of the area and (2) that surgery be transferred from Dungarvan to Ardkeen Hospital, because of the inadequacy of the facilities in Dungarvan. In the circumstances the best possible short-term solution to the problem would be to locate a maternity unit in the district hospital in the space now occupied by surgical patients.  The health authority have been urged to reconsider the matter on these lines.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that, in fact, there is no maternity unit at any place other than Ardkeen to serve the whole of County Waterford?  Is he further aware that plans for such a maternity unit in Dungarvan were approved in 1953?  Instead of progressing in the field of health we are going backward.  The only things we appear to be getting are reports and reports are no good to sick people.</P>

The letter from my Department suggested that as a short-term arrangement, the health authority might investigate the possibility of making such beds available by a reorganisation of existing accommodation at Ardkeen Hospital.  I understand that the health authority will shortly be submitting proposals on these lines to my Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 45 of the Health Act, 1970, is the provision relevant to this.  This section removes doubt as to whether, in assessing entitlement to the general medical service, other means as well as the person's own and that of his spouse should be taken into account.  I have not yet determined the date of commencement of this section.  I feel that it would be advantageous for each of the chief executive officers of the health boards to have an opportunity, for some months after 1st April next, to review and co-ordinate the existing practices as regards eligibility in the counties <Col N="1481" /> within his board's functional area, prior to the full application of the new law on this matter.  As the Deputy will be aware, it is necessary to continue for some time after 1st April next the dispensary service at present operated by local authorities under section 14 of the Health Act, 1953.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is now some considerable time since Oireachtas Éireann voted in favour of abolishing the old provisions whereby income other than the income of the spouse was brought into consideration and, having regard to the fact that the Minister in this House gave us figures estimating the additional cost which would fall on the Exchequer, would the Minister not consider that the various administrative excuses which he has now offered are, in fact, unreal and that it is unnecessary to delay this much-needed benefit any longer?</P>

      <P>I am giving a very real answer in regard to this matter. The situation varies from county to county.  It would be quite wrong to make a decision as to when to operate this decision until the chief executive officers had some time to examine the extent to which standards in applying the medical card principle varied from one county to another.  In some counties the proposal has an element of reality already in assessing whether a person should receive a medical card or not.  In some counties old age pensioners automatically get medical cards, regardless of the incomes in the family.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said that part of the provisions of the Health Act involves a standardised system throughout the country.  It will not be an easy matter to determine.  First of all, there would have to be reports from the chief executive officers as to what the standards are, and how far they vary, and as to how far a proper standard can be assessed bearing in <Col N="1482" /> mind the differences which exist between the counties.  In one county 47 per cent of the entire population would have medical cards, and in another county where the general wealth of the county would appear to be about the same you might have 29, 30 or 35 per cent of the people with medical cards. Chief executive officers will have to think about the whole matter.</P>

In this particular area of Kilmore and Bonnybrook, there are 20,000 people and there are two telephones, which is one per 3,000 houses. Very often the telephones are out of order as there are many children in the area.  People sometimes cannot get on. An ambulance, when needed, must come out from town and go back again.

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the question refers to the resolution on the phased achievement of economic and monetary union in the EEC over a period of ten years and two decisions on the strengthening of the co-ordination of short-term economic policies and collaboration between central banks which were adopted by the Council of the Community on 8/9 February, 1971. The text of the resolution containing a programme of action for the first three-year phase has been published but the texts of the two decisions have not yet become available.

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the obligation which the Six member nations of EEC have now imposed on themselves to consult with one another in economic and monetary matters would be regarded by them as extending at this stage to the applicant countries, which, to that extent, limits the freedom of economic and monetary operations which we would otherwise have?</P>

      <P>Since July, 1969, 20 Border infringements were reported to me by the Departments of Justice and Defence.  Many of these infringements were of a technical nature but nevertheless representations were made to the British authorities in respect of all of them.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>They were all accidental but I would want to make up my own mind on the description given here.  Some were due to faulty map reading but they were all accidental.  I suppose a technical breach would be a very minimal crossing of the Border, which is not visible, as the Deputy knows.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the definition counts.  The fact is there were 20 infringements, which annoyed me greatly and I think they are dangerous. I do not in any way pretend to be explaining the British position when I relate their answer.  Usually when <Col N="1488" /> someone says it is a technical error it is a dismissive description of a slight breach of something.  However, I must say that I deplore this and every time it happens I feel badly about it.

      <P>This is primarily a matter for Aer Lingus but inquiries have been made into this particular instance.  The vast bulk of cutlery purchased by Aer Lingus is Irish manufactured but in this case the price offered by the non-Irish firm was far below what was represented by the preferential amount allowed, but the vast bulk of purchases have been made from Irish sources.  It just happened that the particular cutlery was a small proportion of foreign made cutlery purchased by Aer Lingus.  They would be entitled, if they so chose, to buy all their cutlery abroad if the quotation were of such a kind as I have indicated, which was away below what would be regarded as the preference allowed to Irish manufacturers.</P>

I asked the Minister was it now right for an Irish person to buy 80 per cent of Irish products and buy the other 20 per cent abroad if the price was cheaper.  The Government, the people and Deputies are willing to subsidise industries here and yet a State industry is willing to buy outside the country.  It is a disgrace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Our present system of budgeting from year to year does not help us to assess the overall effects of policy decisions on expenditure in future years or to align expenditure with likely resources.  Also <Col N="1493" /> most expenditure is largely committed at budget time and the scope for changing the volume and composition of expenditure is relatively limited.  The Government have been considering for some time how budgetary procedure might be improved.  The White Paper published on Public Capital Expenditure in 1965 (Pr. 8562) referred to a need for what it called &ldquo;forward looks&rdquo; at expenditure.  The Third Programme for Economic and Social Development referred also to the need for programming and analysing public expenditure and said that practical experimentation was being commenced in selected Departments with a view to the development of a multi-annual programme budgeting system.  Experiments in this regard are well under way in various Departments but, since it will take some years before a comprehensive programme budgeting system can be fully operational, the Government decided, as an interim measure, to introduce a more simplified form of multi-annual budgeting right away. This will involve extending the present annual expenditure estimates for a further two years ahead&mdash;that is estimating for three years in all&mdash;and making provisional allocations in respect of these estimates based on a projection of resources.  The forward estimates will be reviewed each year by reference to the final allocations made in the annual budget for the first year of the three.</P>
      <P>The new budgeting procedure will enable more systematic control to be exercised over expenditure in the light of expected resources and will enable Departments to plan their expenditure programmes more effectively and with greater certainty about the availability of finance.</P>
      <P>The usual procedures for the submission of Departmental estimates to Dáil Éireann will not be affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Interest on national loans is chargeable to income tax under Case III of Schedule D and the tax is payable on or before the 1st January in the year of assessment.</P>
      <P>Payment of interest on national loans due on or after 15th May, 1970, was unavoidably delayed because of the banks closure.  Payment commenced to be made on the 22nd October, 1970, and was completed by the 27th January, 1971, when the interest payments were brought up to date.</P>
      <P>As the tax in respect of these interest payments was legally due on 1st January, 1971, the Revenue Commissioners in the normal course of their duties issued final demands for tax still unpaid at that date and they did so in the week commencing the 25th January, 1971.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Adoption is not relevant in determining the rate of estate duty, which depends solely on the value of the dutiable estate.  The rate at which legacy duty or succession duty is chargeable is, however, determined by the relationship of the beneficiary to the predecessor.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the abatements of estate duty granted by section 45, Finance Act, 1969, and for the purposes of legacy and succession duties, a child adopted under Irish law is treated as the lawful child of the adopters. Adoption under the laws of another country, which may differ radically from the conditions for legal adoption in this country, has not this effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It may seem simple to the Deputy but this is not the case. The conditions which apply here for legal adoption are very stringent.  In some countries they are not by any means as stringent and anything on the lines suggested here could affect not only rights and liabilities in regard to estate duty but the right to inherit under intestacy.  There would be serious objection if this were to be affected without having regard to the manner in which the person becoming so entitled became entitled&mdash;in other words, under much less stringent laws than we have here.  That is in response to Deputy Belton's remark.  In reply to Deputy Clinton, I would say the only method I can see by which it could be done would be in specific cases where we could ensure a reasonable degree of reciprocity.  We might be able to get an arrangement in such a case but not across the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>It was hoped to have sufficient accommodation available in the new schools for boys and girls at present being built in the Cromcastle/Kilmore area, by September, 1971 and thus end the dual-day system which entails a slightly shorter school day for infant pupils.  As only portion of the new buildings will be completed on that date, however, arrangements are being made for the transfer from a nearby school of prefabricated classrooms, which will shortly become surplus at that school, so that all primary school children may be on a full day's schooling as from September, 1971.</P>
      <P>In relation to the other area, I understand that there is spare accommodation available in national schools in a neighbouring parish.  I am having the matter examined with a view to seeing how best that accommodation can be utilised to cater for primary school going children from the area mentioned by the Deputy. Pending the outcome of that investigation, I could not authorise the provision of free transport to schools outside this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have pointed out in my reply <Col N="1502" /> to the Deputy's question in regard to the post-primary facilities the school accommodation is adequate at the moment and, therefore, the question of providing transport to other centres does not arise.</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked me if the man were dismissed.  At that time he was suspended.  I want to say to the Deputy that when I was approached by my officials because this man had become troublesome and because <Col N="1504" /> they were worried about the operation of the home, and when they suggested to me that he should be dismissed, I gave specific instructions at that time that he was not to be dismissed until or unless his conduct so seriously interfered with the working of the home that it could not be tolerated any longer.  Things became worse and eventually he was suspended. When he was suspended I examined the case very carefully and I felt that dismissal was justified at that stage.  So I can say to the Deputy that I was just as concerned as I know he would be to see that there was fair play.  It was not until I felt that the operation of the home could not be carried on any further as long as he was there that I agreed to his dismissal.</P>

I am as much concerned about a man's employment as anybody else.

      <P>I have no doubt about the essential good sense of farmers generally and the farmers' organisations as well.  I do not think that Deputy O'Sullivan should try to exacerbate any sense of grievance there may be at present, because the farming organisations are well aware that the Minister and the Department of Agriculture <Col N="1508" /> and Fisheries are very anxious to co-operate with them, since their objectives are one and the same.  The purpose for which the Department exist and the purpose for which the farming organisations exist are to raise the general standard of living of farmers. I would hope that the Department and the organisations will co-operate together in this.  I am not aware of any dispute or of any condition of loggerheads as Deputy O'Sullivan suggests.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister have words really lost their meaning?  Will the Minister not agree that not alone is there a dispute between the Minister and the farmers, but the Government are at war with the farmers?  Will he not further agree that they are being relegated to being second-class citizens and that, while others have got increases in their incomes, the gap between farmers' incomes and the incomes of other sections has widened to over £8 a week? Will the Minister not agree that on the eve, perhaps, of our entry into the EEC, when the farmers and the Government should be sitting down together and co-operating and planning for the future, the Minister is at loggerheads with them?  Will the Minister now invite all farming organisations to come in and sit down around the table, and will he give justice to the principal producers, the farmers of this country?</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I just had time to make a few introductory remarks about the circumstances which obtained in this House when the Central Bank Bill, 1942 was under discussion. It was extremely interesting to watch the line-up in the House at the time.  I remember making a list of what the range of opinion was.  It was extremely interesting, moving from the extreme right, the most conservative people in the House, to the extreme left, the most progressive people in the House.  The two most conservative people, though they were pushed hard by the then Taoiseach for the honour, were the then Minister for Finance, the late Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly and the then Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy W. T. Cosgrave.  At the other end of the spectrum were Deputy James Hickey of Cork and Deputy Patrick McGilligan who, to my mind, was the only person in the House who showed any real knowledge of modern monetary matters which I understand he had been studying for some time. There was a full day spent on Second Reading which is about what we have today but this did not satisfy the then Taoiseach so he made a Second Reading speech on Committee Stage and then the real rumpus started.  There were Second Reading speeches for ten days.  I hope that will not happen this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was asked in general at the time was whether this was a central bank at all.  This was the general opinion.  I must be fair.  This Bill certainly is an attempt to establish a central bank but it is not really what is in a Bill or an Act that counts, it is the approach of the people who run an institution and in the 1940s and 1950s the directors of the Central Bank and <Col N="1530" /> in particular the governor had a completely wrong attitude.  For example, there was the attempt by the Central Bank to ensure that the Government would be unable to spend the Marshall Aid moneys, the moneys that came from the US, which of course was given way to on paper in the sense that the moneys were put into the Central Bank and then the Government proceeded to borrow them systematically out of it.  Mr. McGilligan being Minister for Finance at the time, took great care of these moneys and when he left office there was £25 million in cash left in the Central Bank of Ireland.  This was gone in six months by that remarkably conservative Minister for Finance, Deputy Seán MacEntee.  He got rid of £25 million in six months.  Then he had his savage Budget in the year 1952 which pushed this country into grave difficulties for nearly ten years until Deputy Seán Lemass, when Taoiseach, changed feet in the matter.  I regret to say that I could give a number of examples of this.  Conversion schemes are in the air at the moment.  They are not being very successful now.  However, the then governor, in the year 1950 or 1951, persuaded the Department of Finance that where people did not make application they were to be paid in cash. The trouble in 1971 is that too many people are asking for payment in cash but I am speaking about the approach.</P>
    <P>The reports of the Central Bank of Ireland during the 1950s were deplorable documents in the manner in which they criticised the capital programme of the Government, a very modest capital programme indeed and a very much more effective capital programme in the sense that there was not nearly as much waste in it as there is in the present capital programme of the Government.</P>
    <P>Again, during the late 1960s the attitude of the Central Bank directorate was all wrong.  There has been no worthwhile criticism of the galloping Government expenditure.  I drew attention to this on last year's Budget debate. The Central Bank should have been in an altogether better position than I was, and indeed I suspect they were, to talk about Government expenditure in last year's report but did <Col N="1531" /> they do so?  Oh yes, they did, in a sense, but their real attack was directed against the wages of manual workers, the incomes of the lowest paid people in the community.  In equity I should say that the present governor of the Central Bank did surface at last a couple of months ago, in November I think, and he did criticise the Government expenditure but how was it that I, with none of the resources that the governor of the Central Bank has, was able to speak about it in May last?</P>
    <P>The annual report was dated 15th July, 1970 and among the more remarkable statements in it was this:</P>
    <P>For 1970-71 there has been a reduction in the rate of increase in public capital expenditure, but it is to be feared that this will be offset on the current expenditure side.</P>
    <P>That is a very modest statement indeed. The first part is wrong because there was in fact no reduction in the rate of increase in public capital expenditure. Secondly, it was not a question that it was to be feared that there would be an increase in expenditure but it should have been patently clear by the 15th July, 1970, that there would be an astounding increase in the Government current expenditure as it is so turning out.</P>
    <P>This Bill is quite clear.  That is to say, the Bill is well drafted but it is not what is in the Bill that is the nub of the problem.  The nub of the problem is, in fact, the relations between the Central Bank of Ireland and, I might add, the commercial banks, and the Government of this country.  I cannot do better than give an example from the evidence before the Macmillan Committee which sat in England after the second world war.  The Secretary of the Treasury was giving evidence before the committee.  One of the members asked him to tell them how the war was financed.  The Secretary told them that on each Friday he went down to the Bank of England and had lunch with them and after lunch told them how much he wanted. He was asked in another question whether he was ever refused and his answer was &ldquo;I was never refused&rdquo;. So far the present Government here <Col N="1532" /> have never been refused but there is a big difference here.  The Government here are paying the commercial banks nearly 9 per cent, on the Minister's own admission, 8 15/16 per cent, on last major borrowing from them in March of last year&mdash;£25 million&mdash;whereas the British Government cut the rate from 10s per cent per annum to 7s 6d per cent per annum.  The answer the Minister gave in reply to a supplementary question of mine last year was &ldquo;it was the going rate&rdquo;.  What does the Minister mean by that in this context?  This money was not borrowed on a long-term basis, in the way the Government are trying to borrow from the public at 9 per cent.  The £25 million for which the Government paid the commercial banks nearly 9 per cent was borrowed for three years in March, 1970.  This phrase &ldquo;the going rate&rdquo; reminds me of the auctioneer with his words, &ldquo;going, going, gone&rdquo;.  Is the Minister aware that at this moment the official bank rate, not the rate at which people can borrow, is 7¼ per cent and that the Canadian rate is under 6 per cent?  What is the reason for this?  The reason is that the Government are taking altogether too much of the credit resources of the country for their own purposes.</P>
    <P>There is comment in the Minister's speech and in the Bill about the Central Bank being empowered to give directions to the commercial banks.  It gave not exactly directions, because they have not that power yet, but they indicated what they thought should be the increase in the available credit in this country during the past year, and this was to be £75 million.  The Central Bank told the whole community that the Government were to get £50 million of that £75 million and that all the people carrying on all the business of the country were to get was £25 million. I have no doubt that arising from the closure of the commercial banks the public helped themselves to more than £25 million in spite of the bad bet which the Government made when that strike was allowed to develop.  The Government allowed the strike to develop without intervention because they favoured bank closure in the belief that the economy would be damped down.</P>

      <P>Of all the useless efforts I ever saw in my life the effort of the arbitrator was the worst.  He was pushed in.  I could make an addition about that because he is around the Government nowadays.  He could have fixed that closure without difficulty if he was worth a thraneen.  He was not worth twopence.  As a result of all this we have bankruptcies.  Instead of a move towards full employment even in the year 1980, we have more and more workers being thrown out of employment. We have the case of Hibernian Transport, Murphy Bros. in Cork, and the cattle dealer case in Cork.  Was the obvious panic in official circles to bring the bank closure to an end when the final vote was taken which it was believed would be accepted but was defeated&mdash;and I saw panic then&mdash;because of the position of the Hibernian Transport which had filtered through at that stage, whether through the Central Bank or the Department of Finance? It was obvious to me that there was a wave of panic at the end of the bank closure.  How many more firms will be ruined?  The fact is that we had no Government last year in this country. Instead, we had circuses.  We are not an empire like the old Roman Empire which had an official store of bread or wheat and continuous surpluses to keep the ordinary people dazzled while the corruption of their rulers was rampant. We had the circus of the Seven Days Tribunal; we had the Arms Trial; now we have the present continuous circus around the corner of this building.</P>

      <P>All this is to divert the attention of the people from two matters&mdash;the serious financial position and the Government's own difficulties. The extent to which the recent conversion scheme was a failure was alarming because of the extent to which the people took their money in cash which, considering the variety of offers in it, showed clearly their lack of confidence in the present Government.</P>
      <P>Three times in the Minister's speech the words &ldquo;integrity of our currency&rdquo; occur.  On the first page there is a phrase &ldquo;safeguard the integrity of our currency&rdquo;.  What do these words mean?  If they have any meaning at all it is to preserve the purchasing power of the currency.  This is the only meaning they can have.  One must ask how far have the Central Bank as it has operated in recent times safeguarded the integrity of the currency?  Ten per cent was the rate of inflation in recent years.  Indeed, as I pointed out, the Central Statistics Office produced a ludicrous rate of 7.4 per cent for 1968. It has been 10 per cent per annum over the last three years.  That is the answer to the question: how far has the Central Bank safeguarded the integrity of the currency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other answers apart from the arithmetical answer.  We have the activities of the farmers' organisations representing the farmers, the constant interruptions of industry and commerce and the discontent among serious salaried groups.  On the second page of the Minister's brief there is a rush of words which would not have happened if the present governor of the Central Bank had not been looking after the brief.  The Minister runs from the legal tender note fund to the general fund of the banks, in one sentence.  In the earlier part he says that &ldquo;in addition to sterling, it now holds gold&rdquo;.  At one time it was all sterling or sterling securities.  Mind you, as I said in this House already it has got rid of most of <Col N="1535" /> our gold.  The £30 million that we had a few years ago may not have been the largest hoard of gold ever put together in a small country but it was worth something.  It was down to £11 million by 30th September last year.  This was obviously a decision taken, I presume, with the concurrence of the Government as though gold were some kind of fetish, or some kind of absurdity.  I heard one economist saying that great progress had been made in economics over the last ten years.  I do my best to keep in touch with current economic writing and, frankly, the number of worthwhile ideas that have come up in the last ten years is nebulous.  In fact, about the only worthwhile idea that emerged was that at last macro-economics is being analysed and being found out to be what it is, just a system of arithmetic with little or nothing to do with real economics.</P>
    <P>Does anybody believe that humanity has had regard for gold for thousands of years without there being some serious advantage in it?  Originally when the Currency Commission was established, following the report by the committee presided over by Professor Henry Willison of Columbia University in 1926, we decided in favour of what were called the gold exchange standards because, as a member of the commission told me, we would gain interest on the moneys and we would be one remove from the gold standard on which the British were.  When the pound was devalued four years later we had lost three or four times what it would have cost us to have backed our currency with gold.  To this very day even though the price of gold is kept down for the silliest of reasons by the people who are trying to get the Vietnamese to deal with the Chinese&mdash;the Vietnamese, having dealt with the Chinese for 2,000 years without their help at all&mdash;these people have decided &ldquo;We are going to keep the price of gold at what it was in 1935, 35 dollars an ounce.  The dollar is as good as gold.&rdquo;  Of course the dollar is not as good as gold because the purchasing power of the dollar now is about one-third of what it was in 1935. I do not know whether the price of gold was correctly fixed in 1935 <Col N="1536" /> but I presume the people who did the job knew something about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>In 1965 the bank commenced the issue of guide-lines to the Associated Banks on domestic credit creation. This is now an important function.</P>
    <P>Yes, and of course this Bill is going to enable that function to be implemented with more strength.  We come back then to where the Minister in one paragraph puts together a reference to something which is extremely desirable&mdash;the creation of a money market in Dublin; there is no question that the efforts made in that direction are to be commended&mdash;but in that same paragraph there is a reference to the issue of Exchequer Bills to the bank at more frequent intervals, in other words accelerating the pace of inflation and nothing else.  In the next sentence it is stated that money that was formerly placed in London is now being placed at home and a native money market has been initiated with the Central Bank playing a role of increasing importance. I do not think any reasonable Irish person would see any fault in this.</P>
    <P>The Minister also states that under the present Bill many new powers and duties will be conferred on the Central Bank.  However, it is not the powers and duties that are conferred on people that is the important matter&mdash;it is how they operate them.  It is stated in the Minister's speech that it is a major objective to give greater protection to persons depositing money in banks and finance houses.  The truth of the matter is that at the present moment there is too much printing of money in this country.  It is absurd to pretend that the Central Bank has any power to control the situation because as inflation goes on the commercial banks must supply more money to their customers.  Of course, they have an unending supply of paper against which they will get £10 notes.  There was a time before the war when we used only £ notes and a £5 note was rather like a battlecruiser in comparison to the minesweeper.  While the banks were closed the most common note in circulation was the £10 note and even £50 notes were put into circulation.  This is clear evidence as to how far greater <Col N="1537" /> protection has been given to persons depositing money in banks.  The pretence is that the banks might go burst but banks do not collapse during a period of this kind of inflation.</P>
    <P>The admonitions of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Ireland are rather like the reports of the NIEC.  The board of directors are quite obviously under the thumb of the Government.  They are allowed to make exhortations if they want to but it is rather like the cry of a small bird that has been caught by a large cat. The last bank failure in this country was the failure of the Munster bank in 1870 and in that case all the creditors were paid £ for £.  All this talk about protection of depositors is nonsense. What the person who deposits money wants is protection against erosion of the value of the money.  However, as happens in human affairs in more countries than in Ireland the job is being tackled in the wrong way.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to licences and he stated that the Central Bank cannot refuse a licence without the consent of the Minister for Finance.  I think this is fair enough and I do not quarrel with it&mdash;if it were the other way round that they could not give a licence without the consent of the Minister I should have something to say about it.  However, there is a sentence on that page of the Minister's brief that deserves severe comment.  It is stated:</P>
    <P>Every licence holder will have to keep a deposit in the Central Bank equal to 5 per cent of his customers' deposits, subject to a maximum of £500,000 and a minimum of £20,000.</P>
    <P>This amuses me because at the moment we have two large banks in this country&mdash;the Bank of Ireland Group and the Allied Irish Bank Group.  They will be expected to keep a maximum of £500,000 on deposit in the Central Bank.  What percentage is this of their deposits&mdash;1 per cent or perhaps one-tenth of 1 per cent?  I think in each case it would be nearer to the latter figure.  Therefore, we have a situation whereby a small bank is expected to keep 5 per cent of its deposits in the Central Bank.  It is possible that such a small bank might be <Col N="1538" /> making things difficult for the imperial institutions because it is quite easy to carve a chunk out of an empire if one goes the right way about it.  However, the situation is that the small bank will have to keep 5 per cent of their deposits in the Central Bank whereas the imperial institutions recently set up will only have to keep about one-tenth of 1 per cent of their deposits in the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to talk about something that was not in the original version of the Bill which was introduced in 1968, namely, section 23.  This section deals with the regulation of ratios between assets and liabilities of holders of licences.  The Minister states that the Bill also confers additional power on the Central Bank designed to give more effective control of credit. He also states that under this power the bank will be able to require holders of banking licences to maintain specified ratios between assets and liabilities. On every balance sheet are not the assets exactly equal to the liabilities? As this will come up on Committee Stage I do not wish to delay the House now because we shall have plenty to say about it then.  In section 23 there is reference to (a) a specified ratio, (b) a ratio which does not exceed a specified ratio, or (c) a ratio which is not less than a specified ratio, and there is mention of the method by which a requisition may be made, <i>et cetera</i>.  This section is quite remarkable and has come in the new version of the Bill; it was not in the version published in 1968.</P>
    <P>As we are going to discuss this on Committee, let me give notice to the Minister on one point.  Would the Minister mind telling us what ranks as assets in this context?  I take it the colossal quantities of Government paper rank as assets because up to recently Government paper was regarded as a most desirable form of asset.  If the present Government continue getting the commercial banks to write up £50 million in their books every year, as they did in 1969 and 1970, the commercial banks will not want for assets.</P>
    <P>On page seven of the Minister's brief there is the usual absurd reference to the EEC.  Nothing can come into the <Col N="1539" /> House from this Government without a reference to the EEC.  Granted the Minister's brief says: &ldquo;Should we become a member of the EEC.&rdquo;  At least he did not say &ldquo;When we become a member of the EEC&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Later on in that page he talks about &ldquo;the more economic use of banking resources&rdquo;. Since I am getting a reputation for criticising the use of English let me say I think the Minister means the more &ldquo;economical&rdquo; use of banking resources. However, it is not a matter of great importance.</P>
      <P>The next part of the Bill is in many ways the most important, that is to say, it relates to our currency position. The Minister said: &ldquo;I am sure Deputies will act with a sense of responsibility in any comments they might make.&rdquo;  I have never said that devaluation was inevitable.  I have asked many questions of the Minister but I have never suggested that the devaluation of our currency in terms of sterling was inevitable, but I do suggest that, if the Government do not take hold of themselves, if they continue to spend money in the fashion that it is being spent on certain hotels in the west and on certain other matters, it is inevitable. I note the Minister says:</P>
      <P>The Government may by order change the par value after consultation with the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see the most serious objection to this in view of the fact that it is the intention of the Government to put two representatives of the commercial banks on the board.  Have we altogether forgotten the lesson which ordinary people learned from the bank rate inquiry in Britain?  Let us not mind what the report said; let us read between the lines in relation to that famous inquiry. We all know what the answer is. I do not think, if the situation arises where the Government of this country are considering the par value of the currency, any representatives of the commercial banks should be consulted in any way, and when I come to deal with the directorate I shall have more <Col N="1540" /> to say about this.  I know of no country where directors of commercial banks are directors of the central bank.  There may be such.  I do not have that much time to go running here and there to find out what they do in other countries but I do know that the last time I examined the position in the Bank of England there was no director of the commercial banks on the board of directors of the Bank of England.</P>
    <P>Let me stay on the parity question for a moment.  I have said in this House, and it is worth quoting again and again, that nobody devalues a currency. Currencies devalue themselves. It may be the duty of a particular man, whether it be Mr. Jim Callaghan, Sir Stafford Cripps or who have you, to sign some paper recognising the inevitable. That is all it is.  As regards the request of the Minister that we should act with responsibility, is it the responsibility of Deputies to sing dumb?  I think Deputies do have a responsibility. It is of much greater importance to the community that the Government of this country should act responsibly than that any comments from Deputies should be responsible.  On the one hand the Government treat the Deputies like dirt, and on the other hand they suggest that their comments are of such value that Deputies should act responsibly in the comments they make.  I just do not understand that kind of thing at all.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the directors. The 1968 version of this Bill continued with the three representatives of the commercial banks.  Then the amalgamations took place and now we are to have two, the inference being that one is to be a representative of Allied Irish Banks and the other a representative of the Bank of Ireland.  What interests me about this is the nature and independence of the directorate.  When you look at the present board of directors as individuals it might be that you might not like this person or that person.  They are: T.K. Whitaker, Governor; Patrick Burke; D.S.A. Carroll; Juan M. Greene; John Leydon; James J. McElligott; C.H. Murray; and W.J.L. Ryan.  You would search around very carefully before you would find a better board than that, on the whole, but I can only take people as <Col N="1541" /> they behave.  I can only take people on what they do.</P>
    <P>For example, we have this unseemly squabble in the west which was shown up so clearly by Mr. Frank Hall on &ldquo;Newsbeat&rdquo; the other evening about the effort to get the account of the Western Regional Health Board.  First, there was a vote giving it to one group and then there was a vote giving it to the other.  This is a form of oligopoly competition.  There are stories of widespread social activities in the period between the change of decision.  I have not that much connection with the west but even I hear things on the wind.  I will not say too much about it lest we might have yet another inquiry. Is leor nod don eolach.  In other words, for the benefit of the party opposite, a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse.</P>
    <P>The present Board of Governors includes one man to whose membership of the board I have the most serious objection.  This is not a matter of recent opinion.  This is a matter that has nothing to do with the man himself.  I think it is altogether wrong that the chief official of the Department of Finance should be a member of the Board of the Central Bank of Ireland.  I have always held that opinion, and there is no reason why I should change it now.  There has been a long tradition in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries that the Secretary of that Department takes no outside office of any kind.  In recent years there has been a similar tradition in the Department of Industry and Commerce, I am glad to say, because at one time there was an extremely bad tradition in that Department, a very bad situation indeed.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Minister for Finance is entitled to the undivided advice of his chief official.  If the Government want to put a representative of the Department of Finance on the Board of the Central Bank of Ireland, I have no objection to that.  He can then go to see the Minister and his chief adviser and make his report about anything that is happening in the Central Bank, and the Minister can have the considered opinion of his chief official.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1542" /> Perhaps I might be allowed to tell a story out of school.  If the Minister would care to go back and look at the appointments to the Board of the Central Bank in 1942 when it was first created he would see a remarkable letter from one of the people appointed. There were a number of errors in that short letter but one of the most interesting was&mdash;and he remained on the board for a long time&mdash;that he said he was pleased to &ldquo;except&rdquo; appointment as a director of the Central Bank of Ireland.  I am not all that keen on spelling but it would be worth the Minister's while to go back and look at the letter to see the other matters that were in it as well.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in relation to the directors which I should like to mention and that is that there are other groups operating in this country at present, all kinds of other groups&mdash; and, in spite of all we hear about the great improvements in management and all the rest, it would be hard to persuade me that a leopard changes its spots&mdash;who should be considered for representation if suitable people are available from them.  On the whole, it would correspond to what is the case in other countries where persons with knowledge of banking rather than directors of commercial banks are on the boards of their central banks.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted with approval:</P>
    <P>The Government does not, however, propose to interfere with the administration of the Bank which will be independent in the carrying out of its functions.</P>
    <P>A body can be independent in the carrying out of its functions.  A horse that is spancelled is independent in the carrying out of his functions but he cannot move around very much.  The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the general function and duty ascribed to the Central Bank by the 1942 Act which are to take &ldquo;such steps as the Board may from time to time deem appropriate and advisable towards safeguarding the integrity of the currency and ensuring that, in what pertains to the control of <Col N="1543" /> credit, the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is not exactly the same wording as the Minister used at the beginning of his speech where he talked about the welfare of the whole community. That is not exactly the same thing.  It is rather like the distinction made by that remarkable politician of the 18th century, Rousseau, between the general will and the will of all.  I will not dilate on that distinction though politicians are more aware of it than other people. Even professors of politics do not quite understand what it is but anybody in practical politics understands it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The statutory function of the Bank in relation to monetary policy does not, of course, diminish the ultimate responsibility of the Government in that sphere.</P>
    <P>Why then have in the Bill a provision that the Government cannot alter the par value of the currency in international terms without consulting the Central Bank of Ireland unless it is the Government have not that much confidence in themselves?  To get back to what I started with.  The essence of this problem is quite simply this: that the audited Government public expenditure, the audited accounts of the public service, as audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General for the year 1969-70 amounted to £384 million and, in 1970-71, the year just coming to an end, they will be close to £500 million, an increase of nearly 30 per cent in one year, the kind of increase that in a wage or salary causes the Government to be horrified.</P>
    <P>The Minister says at page 12:</P>
    <P>In our case the relationship between Government and Central Bank rests as much on mutual confidence as on statute.  It is sustained by frequent consultations between the Minister for Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank on all aspects of economic policy, by a frank interchange of information and comment in the policy field and by the fact that the Government <Col N="1544" /> have an official representative on the board of the bank.</P>
    <P>The Government really have not got a representative on the board of the Bank and I do not think it would be desirable nor am I suggesting for one moment that, say, a member of the Fianna Fáil Party should be made a director of the Central Bank.  I think the decision which was taken by Fianna Fáil in the early 1940s that Deputies and Senators should not be members of the boards of directors of State or semi-State bodies was a good one.  It underlines the point I made earlier of the undesirability of the chief official of the Minister for Finance being a director of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The Minister promises certain amendments which he does not specify. Perhaps he would indicate what they are about because frankly I do not know what they are about.  He said they are partly to deal with the points arising from the Supreme Court judgment in the Marts Act case and partly for technical reasons.  Of course if a Bill has been lying around for as long as this one has been, a period of nearly three years, amendments are inevitable. Certainly if it is necessary, arising from the decision of the Supreme Court in the Marts Act case, that the law be amended I do not see any objection to it but I just wonder whether this is not the old game of getting around the decision by enacting legislation ruling out the possibility of the courts giving a similar decision again.  If the decision was good law then it should not be ruled out.  A Government which does this kind of thing are ill-advised to attempt it in this way.  It has been done, of course, time and again but it is undesirable.</P>
    <P>These are my main comments on the Bill.  It will not bring about a big difference in the situation if the Government continue to use the Central Bank and the commercial banks as a method for wasteful expenditure.  It is a pretence that if the Government write out a piece of paper that is an asset.  In ordinary bodies the assets are generally something real.  There may be bits and pieces of them cash, say, in the bank but in general they are a reality and the liabilities are usually in the form <Col N="1545" /> of something that is owed to people or the capital and so on.  We are rapidly reaching the stage where the assets, to too a large an extent, consist of Government paper and are therefore purely notes of hand, IOUs.  They are not genuine assets and they are not realisable assets in any real sense of that word.</P>
    <P>It is fine for the Government to come into this House with a Bill like this which has, of course, considerable merits in it but which if it is not implemented properly will make no real change in the position so far as the finances of this country are concerned. After all, banking is merely one of the methods of carrying on the business of the community and central banks exist in countries for the purpose of seeing that things do not get out of hand.  If the Government do not look after their own affairs properly nothing the Central Bank can do will mend the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I would like to comment on is that we are discussing the Central Bank Bill, 1969 at the beginning of 1971.  This particular Bill replaced an earlier Bill, the Central Bank Bill, 1968.  No one can argue that the Minister, or the Government, are being precipitate or hasty in relation to the bringing of this legislation before the Dáil.  That comment is appropriate in relation to the Government's general concern with the entire banking situation in this country. The Minister in his speech referred to what he called &ldquo;the bank closure&rdquo;. It is proper at this stage, which is the first opportunity available to us, to make some comment on the bank strike and its effect on people when it was in progress and on its repercussions now that it is over.  There can be no doubt but that the closure of the banks from May to the end of November, and their partial closure subsequently, has caused very real suffering and hardship to many people.  It is worth remembering that the banks were closed down.  Each customer had a contract with his own bank.  That contract was not being discharged or being honoured and the banking system utterly failed to fulfil its obligations to the public.  In those circumstances if <Col N="1547" /> individuals, traders, shopkeepers, business people or publicans had not stepped into the breach the people would have gone without money and would not have been able to buy food. They would not have had money to carry on.  In fact, it was the decision of many thousands of traders, shopkeepers and business people to honour cheques which enabled the economy of the country to continue in operation. The least of all possible concern was shown by the Government.  Weeks passed, and months passed, and still neither the Minister nor the Government took action to bring the bank strike to an end.  We endeavoured to raise the subject here during the discussion on the Finance Bill but the Minister expressed no concern and the impression was created that the Government felt it was rather a good thing to have the bank strike in progress because it was a good cooling off process for the economy.  I want that point recalled now when we are discussing the Central Bank Bill.  The strike is over&mdash;and no thanks to the Minister.  The strike has ended without any assistance from the Government. I do not know who won out in the strike; I do not know who gained.  I know the banks did not lose.</P>
      <P>There are thousands of people today who are counting the cost because they, although not involved, and not having a right to a say in it, have been the people who suffered.  And there was of course a settlement and then into many homes and into many small businesses came the result of the settlement with thousands and thousands of dishonoured cheques.  This is approaching a national calamity.  It merits a few lines at the end of the Minister's statement, a passing reference to the recent closure of the banks.  What is going to be done for the small two-man or three-man businesses that are insolvent now, put out of business because they trusted a negotiable instrument and provided either cash or goods in order to keep things going?</P>

      <P>The point I have been trying to make is that I know of no case in which a firm or an individual has gone out of business solely because of the kind of circumstances described by Deputy O'Higgins, that he accepted a cheque from somebody and found when the strike was over that it was &ldquo;RD&rdquo;, solely because of that.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about people who became their own bank managers; I am talking about <Col N="1549" /> people who in trading and as a result of trading and trading in confidence and so on, find now that they are in very serious difficulties.  I believe there are thousands of them.</P>
      <P>This is something for which the Government should have concern and for which the Dáil should have concern. Does anyone know the extent of it?  The Minister says &ldquo;Well, I have no details of any individual case&rdquo; but does the Minister accept that there have been thousands of cheques returned to people in whose favour they were drawn but are now the subject of negotiation, putting it no further than that?  Is that accepted?</P>

      <P>If it is accepted then we can accept the fact that we have suffered, in economic terms, very nearly a national calamity.  If it is as wide and extensive as I believe it to be, then as a result of something which ordinary people could not control and as a result of a happening which may, in fact, have been actually in defiance of their own legal rights under contract, or whatever arrangement they had with their banks, if they are forced to suffer financially there should be some effort made adequately to compensate them.  Why not?  If there had been a flood disaster or an extensive fire there would be no hesitation on behalf of the community to try to mitigate the losses suffered by people who had nothing to do with the occurrence.  There have been serious losses and I do not think the Minister or the Government have a right to shrug it off and say: &ldquo;Well, what concern is it of ours?&rdquo;  There is a responsibility fully to examine the extent of the losses involved and seriously to search for some means of compensating the people who have suffered through no fault of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was a bank strike which started in May last.  We had a strike four years before and we had one before that again.  Are we going to have another one next year or the year after?  Nobody can rule it out.  No one can say that it will not happen.  If it should happen has the Minister any plan?  Is there any contingency plan to assist people and to assist the economy if the <Col N="1550" /> banks are again closed as a result of a dispute or a disagreement?  Because next time the traders, the shopkeepers and the businessmen whatever else they will do there is one thing certain, they will not cash a cheque. If there is another bank strike let us face the fact that we will not succeed in keeping things going by passing bits of paper all around the place.  That will not happen.  Whatever degree of fault I attribute to the Government and the Minister for their failure to act, for the dilatory way in which they allowed the strike to continue, whatever blame will attach to them if they do not now examine the consequences of that strike, the blame will be all the more serious if in view of what happened there is not now a preparation on some contingency plan for another possible closure of the banks.</P>
    <P>So much for the bank strike.  In regard to the Bill my party are all in favour of any policy or any measure which is directed towards making our Central Bank a real Central Bank. We are not new converts to this view. We published our views in that respect in the document &ldquo;Planning Towards a Just Society&rdquo; in 1965.  We set out in considerable detail in that document the developments we felt necessary if a developing Irish economy was to be served by the appropriate banking system.  We advocated the exercise by the Central Bank of an adequate and proper control of credit. We pointed out that it was necessary for this purpose that the Central Bank should have power authoritatively to fix appropriate ratios for the commercial banks between their assets and their liabilities.  At that time, and it continued afterwards, the doctrine of moral suasion held sway and it was believed by the Fianna Fáil Government and successive Ministers for Finance that the mere action of the Central Bank in persuading the commercial banks to operate a credit policy in accordance with the advice of the Central Bank would always be sufficient. In 1965 we pointed out that it had not proved sufficient up to then and that nowhere else where a central bank had been set up by the community did such exist without exercising <Col N="1551" /> direct control in relation to credit. Our point of view was not accepted. Not only was it not accepted but let me remind the House that it was met by one of the most dishonest campaigns ever indulged in by a political party. The Fianna Fáil Party went out, following the publication of &ldquo;Planning Towards a Just Society&rdquo; using slogans such as &ldquo;Do not let them get their hands on your money&rdquo;.  &ldquo;They are out to nationalise the banks&rdquo;; &ldquo;They are out to rob you of your savings&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is because we suggested that the Central Bank should have the legislative power to fix ratios for the commercial banks between their assets and liabilities.  We were told it was nationalising the banks and robbing people of their money and now six years later there is introduced this Bill that has been in the womb since 1968. One of the big claims made by the Minister in his introductory statement was that power is now being given to the Central Bank under this Bill to do what we said should have been done as far back as 1965.</P>
    <P>Had our point of view been accepted then and had action been taken to have control of credit by the Central Bank, associated with proper economic planning, many of the difficulties of the past six years would not have arisen.  We would not have had the wild dissipation of credit or the stop/go credit situation that has been a feature of the last six years.  At least there would have been the possibility for an orderly growth of our economy and proper progress towards full employment.  However, it was rendered impossible because of the absolutely intolerant attitude of Fianna Fáil and its Ministers in relation to our proposals regarding credit.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in our policy document &ldquo;The Just Society&rdquo; we advocated another change.  We suggested that the foreign assets of the country should be transferred from the commercial banks to the Central Bank.  This was a simple proposal but it was greeted with shrieks of horror from the present Tánaiste.  He referred to the foreign assets as being &ldquo;our army of occupation in Britain&rdquo;, the standing army in <Col N="1552" /> Britain guarding the resources of the State, and we were told that any attempt to take those assets and give them into the control of the Central Bank would be so revolutionary that it would cause a run on our banking system with a general falling off of confidence in the economy.</P>
    <P>All those things were said at that time and now today we have the Minister saying: &ldquo;Over the years our external reserves have come increasingly under the bank's control.&rdquo;  In fact, in the last few years it has been accepted without question that the commercial banks' earnings in foreign assets should be held, controlled and deposited with the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>In 1965 we suggested also that the practice of freezing sterling assets in the Central Bank's legal tender note fund and keeping them there so that they were untouched and untouchable was absurd.  We said that redemption was such a small element that these vast assets should be transferred and used in the general fund of the bank and become a first line currency reserve.  That was a perfectly simple suggestion and was part and parcel of our policy of getting the Central Bank transformed into something which could be dynamic for the economy. Again, this was greeted with derision but it has now been done.</P>
    <P>Our other proposal, in which we advocated that the legal tender fund should be supported and backed by an increasing amount of foreign securities, instead of having a sterling base and support, was rejected.  Pride is now taken in the fact that these changes have taken place.  I do not like to go over past debates and dissensions because the longer one is in politics the more one realises it is wiser to speak as little as possible.  If any of us claim never to have been wrong we have ceased to live on earth.  However, in relation to banking in particular Fianna Fáil have been so wrong for so long that it is worth recalling that fact in this debate.  They have been wrong every time and it was only because of the determination and sincerity of people who believed in &ldquo;The Just Society&rdquo;, in the principles laid down therein and in the planning that went <Col N="1553" /> into it, that gradually the conservative thinking which is inborn in Fianna Fáil has been changed.  They were forced eventually to realise that we were right in relation to banking and that if this country was to develop there would have to be a complete change in regard to the Central Bank, its powers and the whole problem of credit.  With that background in mind, I can say in relation to this Bill that as a measure directed towards making our Central Bank the real central bank it is a measure that will be accepted and supported by us.  It is supported not because we have been converted but because we have seen the conversion. May I refer to some of the details in the Bill itself?  Generally speaking, as the Minister has pointed out, the Bill aims at providing, by means of the Central Bank, appropriate supervision of banking development in the country and through the provision of licences pretty well retaining control as to who may not in certain circumstances engage in the business of banking.  Then also there are the other powers in relation to credit and so on that I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>First of all, with regard to the granting of licences, I hope the Minister will not mind if in relation to the details of the Bill I ask certain questions which in fact might be more appropriately dealt with at Committee Stage, but I want to do it in order to indicate some of the matters which I would subsequently be raising in more detail on Committee.  In relation to the granting of some licences the guideline laid down is the aim of achieving the orderly and proper regulation of banking. This is a phrase so general as to be capable of almost any interpretation. I would like to ask what is intended by that phrase.  Here the question of competition in the banking system arises.  Does the orderly and proper regulation of banking envisage that we will encourage the development of fair competition or that we will restrict competition merely because it is competition, if I can put it that way?  On a Bill as important as this there should be some definition of what the guideline would be towards the issuing of licences.</P>
    <P>Again in relation to the conditions <Col N="1554" /> in relation to licences which I dealt with in section 10 there is the same type of phrase:</P>
    <P>...A licence shall be subject to such conditions (if any) as the Bank may impose and specify at the time of the grant thereof, being conditions which in the opinion of the Bank are calculated to promote the orderly and proper regulation of banking.</P>
    <P>That is giving too wide a discretion, because the policy in that regard should be laid down by this House.  It is handing over outside the control of this House to the bank itself power which can be far too extreme and which in my view goes far beyond the natural and proper object of the bank which should be related to credit policy.</P>
    <P>In relation to the revocation of licences in section 11, the various grounds upon which a licence may be revoked are set out, but I notice an omission which I feel should be explained.  There may be an explanation for it, but there is no provision for the revocation of a licence on a demand by depositors, and I would propose to deal with that in Committee. In relation also to the deposit of 5 per cent, there is need for greater clarity here.  What is meant by deposits?  Will they include current account balances?  Will foreign currency deposits held by residents of the State be regarded as coming within the term?  Or will currency deposits held by non-residents come within it?  That section would need some clarification.</P>
    <P>There is a provision also in relation to deposits that they should carry interest &ldquo;at such rate and payable in such manner and at such time as may be determined by the Bank from time to them&rdquo;.  Again I would suggest to the Minister that the rate of interest should be specified in the section.  It would probably be the market rate of interest but whatever rate of interest it is should be specified in the section itself.</P>
    <P>There are other details in the Bill that I would like to raise but many of them can be dealt with on the Committee Stage.  I just cannot find the section so I shall have to raise this problem in general without referring to the section&mdash;it is this question of <Col N="1555" /> clearing house facilities.  As I recall the section dealing with that, generally speaking the Central Bank will have power to supervise the cheque clearing process.  It may lay down conditions and so on.  This brings up the question of non-associated banks, the commercial banks from outside that have been operating here and that up to this have found considerable difficulty in getting clearing facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy I think is referring to section 26.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much obliged to the Minister.  I would like to suggest there that any conditions that are laid down should be with this object of ensuring fair and reasonable competition within the bank industry among, of course, licensed banks, and that they should not be weighted in such a way that there is a disadvantage created for one banking group or an advantage for another.  Obviously conditions must be laid down but they should be laid down in that way.  I will attempt to suggest an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter in relation to the non-associated banks.  The Minister was cautious in what he said about them, and I can understand the reason for that.  They are here and it was fortunate in many respects that they were here when the banks were closed last year.  I do not know what their asset holding in the country is.  I have a figure&mdash;it is probably out of date&mdash; of something like £330 million which at that stage would be about one-third of that of the associated banks.  If it is of that order it must be appreciated that they are a significant force in the banking industry.  I should like to suggest that they should be recognised and that they should be given representation amongst the directors of the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the section dealing with the bank directors, section 52, the Minister is changing the present position which is that the Minister appoints three bank directors from a panel put forward by the associated banks, and he appoints five other directors.  The bank directors are now being reduced from three to two and the others are being increased <Col N="1556" /> from five to six.  I would suggest that the section should be amended to provide that amongst the bank directors, or the other six if necessary, there will be a director representing the non-associated banks.  I know they have not got an association but I am quite certain that is not a problem and that such machinery could be got together easily.</P>
    <P>These are some, perhaps, very scattered observations which I wanted to make on this Bill which, may I say, came on the agenda suddenly so far as I was concerned.  I arrived back from Brussels at 10.30 last night to be informed that the Central Bank Bill was already under discussion.  So, any other contribution I will have to make on the details of the Bill may arise from further study and research.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say before Deputy Tully starts that I am sorry if Deputy O'Higgins was inconvenienced but I understand that his party were informed last week of the proposal to take the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the contributions made by Deputy O'Donovan and Deputy O'Higgins.  I always like to hear experts talking about subjects they understand fully.  Let me say immediately that I am not an expert on this matter and, therefore, my comments will be those of a layman.  Perhaps Deputy O'Donovan had an extra advantage because of the fact that he was an official of the Department of Finance and also a Parliamentary Secretary for a period.  Therefore, he knows a lot about the ins and outs of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I listened with interest to what they both had to say.  I agreed with all of what Deputy O'Donovan said and I agreed with most of what Deputy O'Higgins said.  Deputy O'Higgins referred to the fact that the policy which Fine Gael introduced some years ago was attacked by Fianna Fáil during the following election campaign&mdash;I remember it well.  The same thing happened to the Labour Party during the last election.  We introduced <Col N="1557" /> this outline policy document and this was used very much by Fianna Fáil during the election.  In fact, some of them do not know anything at all about policy because they are in the happy position of being in Fianna Fáil and having no written policy and, therefore, they can change around whatever way it suits them.  They got a version of it, I assume from the top, which suggested that everybody on a Labour Party platform definitely had a tail, and possibly had horns too.</P>
    <P>This applied particularly to the question of banking and credit and financial policy.  It was suggested, as it had been suggested previously about Fine Gael, that if the Labour Party had any say in the running of the country we would most certainly try to grab the money in the banks.  When we see what subsequently happened, and see those who are now helping those who were anxious to grab the money out of the banks and were very successful at it, it seems to be a judgment from above.</P>
    <P>One thing that comes pretty loud and clear through all this is that no matter what the Fianna Fáil policy on banking and finance was up to this they now appear to be seeing the error of their ways.  While it may have been all right to suggest that certain things were wrong at election time, they now appear to be doing them and recognising that they are the right things to do. I do not care who suggested these things.  If something is right, and if somebody learns by mistakes I will give him full credit.  While I do not go the whole way with the Minister's Bill, I think that what he has introduced here in the past few days is generally welcomed by the House and could have been introduced by a Fianna Fáil Fine Gael or Labour Minister for Finance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only fair to say that.  I give full credit to the Minister for the effort he is making.  However, there are a number of things in the Bill with which I do not agree and this is one place where I differ from Deputy O'Higgins.  Deputy O'Higgins has suggested that three directors from <Col N="1558" /> the commercial banks should be retained and that he would add in one from the non-associated banks.  I would not have a director from the commercial banks at all.  The commercial bank directors on the Central Bank are there for one reason only and that is to protect the interests of those they represent.  I do not think that is what the Central Bank is for. I do not think there should be any director from the commercial banks on the board of the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>That does not mean that I disagree with the idea that recognition should be given to the non-associated banks. Later I propose to give a very good reason why I think that.  The non-associated banks, or the foreign banks as some people like to refer to them, did a good job at a particular time and possibly they can do a lot for banking in this country if they are given the opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>While I do not agree 100 per cent with some of the pronouncements made by the Central Bank, at least we have come a long way from the day when the contribution made by the Central Bank in regard to remedying the ills of the economy was a statement to the effect that a pool of unemployment was a good thing.  Now at least no board of directors of the Central Bank will attempt to tell us we are better off if there are people on the labour exchanges because if enough people are on the labour exchanges waiting to get jobs those who are working will be a little bit chary about looking for more money for what they are doing.  This has been successfully dealt with by the trade union movement and I would say that we will not again see written in any report of the Central Bank a suggestion that a pool of unemployment is very necessary for the good of the country.  It is a good thing that that day has gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to whether or not the pound would or could be devalued.  The only person in either the Dáil or Seanad who has been consistently preaching the devaluation of the Irish pound is a member of the Minister's own party.  Every time one speaks to him one is told it will take <Col N="1559" /> place next week.  He succesfully forecast that the British pound would be devalued about a year before it happened and that has gone to his head because he is always telling everybody that the Irish pound is sure to go, on its own this time, not with the British pound.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should order an inquiry into the decision of the firm of Messrs. J. &amp; L.F. Goodbody, Ltd., Clara, County Offaly, to close jute spinning at their long-established mills at Clara; that such inquiry be conducted by a senior officer of the Department of Industry and Commerce who shall investigate all aspects of the industry having regard to the amount of public money invested in same in recent years; that papers, persons and records be made available for such inquiry; and that the trade unions involved on behalf of the workers be permitted to give evidence thereat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this motion, first of all, on behalf of the workers involved in this industry.  As the Minister is aware this firm has been in business for a considerable number of years.  At present there is a third generation of workers employed there.  The dismissal notice given to these workers was very short.  It left them with very little opportunity to obtain alternative employment. Many of them were advanced in years and this made it more difficult for them to find new employment.  Because Gentex in Athlone closed down also, employment in this area is scarce. The workers should have had much <Col N="1560" /> longer notice of dismissal.  There should have been much more consultation with the union and with the workers involved prior to the decision.</P>
    <P>My second reason for moving this motion is the amount of public money that has been invested in this industry. I do not know the exact amount that was given by the Government by way of grants to this firm.  Perhaps the Minister would let us know how much money was paid in grants to this firm in the last five years?  Perhaps the Minister would also tell us for what reasons this money was given, for what part of the industry, and whether, in fact, all the money granted to this firm was to be used solely in the firm of Goodbody in Clara.  This is important.  The people of Clara are anxious to know that any Government money that was granted to this firm for Clara was in fact utilised in the Clara firm.  A union official and people in the area are of the opinion that £150,000 by way of grants was given to this firm.  If this sum was given in the last five years and the firm declared approximately 250 workers redundant within such a short space of time there certainly should be a Government inquiry.  Dáil Eireann, the relevant Departments and the people of Ireland are entitled to know just where the money went.  I cannot prove this figure but the Minister will have this information.  I would like if he were in a position to give this information to the House this evening.  I understand that some of this money has gone to the polypropylene section of this industry in Clara and I am pleased that this particular section.  Which makes plastics, is working efficiently and at full capacity.  I do not know what amount of the grants allocated to this firm went to polypropylene.  I and many other people would like to know just what amount of this money went to this section of the industry in Clara.</P>
    <P>A consultant's report has been commissioned privately by the firm in Clara and they have not, as far as I am aware, furnished a copy of the findings to the unions involved.  I believe the Minister received a copy of this report but that it was given to him privately and he is not in a position to divulge its contents.  The contents of <Col N="1561" /> this report would be of interest to all of us.  If public money has been allocated to this firm, this report should be made available to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to the public at large and to the workers in the industry. This is something anybody would expect.  The findings of this report should be made public.  If this report had been furnished to the unions they might have been in a position at that stage to have discussions with the employers.  The unions and the employers could have got together and discussed this report and the unions with the help of the employers might have been in a position to save more jobs in this industry.  This would have been desirable but I am sorry to say that the unions' request for the report was refused.  Indeed I understand the report was given to the Minister at very short notice.</P>
    <P>If an inquiry is carried out as outlined in this motion one of the beneficial results would be to ensure that the Department of Industry and Commerce would have an opportunity of finding out exactly what was contained in the report.  The Department would have an opportunity of studying the workings of the industry.  The industry would benefit from an examination by the Department.  The workers in Clara would know that the maximum number of jobs in this important industry in Clara was being kept open. They have heard that 250 to 300 workers will be kept on.  A proper study could be made with particular reference to the fate of the employees. The employers and management would benefit from the expert guidance of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>A second reason for believing that an inquiry would be important is that the jute industry is closely allied with the worsted material and textile industry. The Minister, my two colleagues on the far side of the House, Deputy O.J. Flanagan and I represent a constituency which is involved in the jute and worsted industry.  This industry is of the utmost importance to the five of us, to the people in Laois-Offaly and to those in the surrounding counties.  One section of the employees <Col N="1562" /> of Salts of Tullamore are on short-time at present.</P>

      <P>Deputy Connolly will have an opportunity of speaking and I will not interrupt.  If the Deputy will have the courtesy to let me finish I will afford him every opportunity to speak later.  The inquiry would clearly benefit the management at Tullamore. They could see the results of the inquiry at Clara.  They might be able to learn something from this inquiry which would be of assistance to them in their own industry.</P>
      <P>We are all interested in this firm in Clara.  We were sorry to see the workers becoming redundant.  We must ensure that the maximum number of jobs are kept open.  The people in Clara have an interest in this firm.  Their families are involved in it.  Their lives revolve around it.  The Dáil must make every effort to ensure that these people are kept in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the inquiry be carried out.  It will give the Department <Col N="1563" /> of Industry and Commerce an opportunity of finding out what has happened. When I inquired from the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Colley, about this firm over a year ago I was told he was in close touch with this firm. We would like to know how so many employees became redundant.  We would like to know how such short notice was given before the firm closed down and let 250 workers go.  They are maintaining approximately 250 to 300 workers still.  My reason for putting down this motion was to give the information that I have given because I believe the results ensuing from an inquiry would be beneficial to the workers in this firm and to the people in the surrounding areas.  I would urge the Minister seriously to consider having this inquiry.</P>

      <P>This matter was well on its way before even the Minister got on to it or before he or his predecessor did anything about it.  The Minister is concerned about it because it is too close to his backdoor.  As I said, the midlands are becoming one of the most depressed areas in the country and no amount of pretence by the Fianna Fáil Party or by way of transfer from Ballinasloe to Clara will deal with this matter.  Clara was a happy town which had a long established industry and the people in it and in the surrounding areas were associated with that industry.  The Minister could tell me, although I already know, what the complement of this firm was.  It was the kind of complement that in a small town of that sort attracts workers from far outside the town.  One could say that this situation is partly due to the replacement of jute sacking by plastic sacks but what has concerned many of the workers in the industry is that at the very time they were being told by the firm that this was the cause of the trouble the machinery was being transferred to Waterford.  I do not know if the Minister or his colleagues know this but it is a fact.  It is also true as Deputy Enright said that this firm got a substantial grant.  Was this grant used by the firm to establish the business in Waterford? Waterford city is a developing area and the Clara area is a depressed area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a depressed area.  The Deputy knows very little about it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I seem to be causing a good deal of concern among the Fianna Fáil Party.  As Deputy Enright said, workers have been there for three generations and there are many workers who are well on in life who cannot possibly be retrained for any other <Col N="1566" /> form of work.  This is a most serious matter.  In addition, for many months the workers had been trying to get a copy of the consultant's report from the firm but were not able to do so. Why?  If people have nothing to hide why do they not disclose the facts?  My understanding has been that this firm got a grant of £150,000.  Even with the present spendthrift Government in office a grant of £150,000 is still quite a sizeable amount, despite the fact that its value is declining rapidly.</P>
      <P>Let us consider a simple method of solving this problem.  The importation of textile bags and sacks for the first 11 months of last year cost nearly £300,000.  This amount would go a long way towards solving the problem, even with the advent of plastic sacks.  I am well aware that the Minister is concerned about the situation because it is in his own backyard.  However, if he and his colleagues were open-minded they would realise that what I say is true&mdash;that the midlands is becoming a depressed area.  What about Athlone and Tullamore?  They are much larger towns than Clara.  Are they not depressed, is there not massive unemployment in both places?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope when the Minister replies that he will make as good a case as I have done, but he will not.  If Athlone, Tullamore and Moate were prosperous there would be some chance for the people employed at Clara because they could move out in different directions.  The question of Goodbody's is not just the 1,500 people who live in this area.  What is involved here is the destruction of a community &mdash;nothing less.  We do not often see this happening in this country; normally it occurs over a long period of time but on this occasion it has happened within six months.  It has suddenly <Col N="1567" /> blown up and I do not think that the Department of Industry and Commerce were wide awake to the situation.</P>
      <P>This proposal I am seconding, that there should be an inquiry, is the least that would satisfy the people of the area.  Of course the trade unions and the workers should be in on the inquiry. They should long ago have been shown a copy of the consultant's report. If the people concerned are not allowed to see a consultant's report&mdash; just as happened regarding the consultant's report in connection with Dublin Corporation where, due to the machinations of Fianna Fáil, nobody was allowed to see it&mdash;the utmost suspicion is aroused and this is quite understandable.  There are very many Fianna Fáil Deputies who wish to speak and whom I wish to hear, and they have the opportunity to do so now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that I am a Deputy for Laois-Offaly means I am greatly concerned with the problem and the redundancy that has arisen in Clara and this concern is increased by reason of the fact that I am a native of, and resident in, Clara.  The wording of this motion is as follows:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should order an inquiry into the decision of the firm of Messrs.  J. &amp; L.F. Goodbody Ltd., Clara, County Offaly, to close jute spinning at their long-established mills as Clara...</P>
      <P>I do not consider the phrasing of this motion to be correct.  As a result of the <i>Seven Days</i> programme on TV and having regard to the wording of this motion, people have come to the conclusion that the jute factory at Clara is about to close.  This is far from being correct.  When the board of directors made the announcement in regard to the redundancy that was to take place there were 528 people employed at Goodbody's.  Due to the phasing out they are determined to introduce, by 1st April there will be between 250 and 260 people employed at Goodbody's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make this point because <Col N="1568" /> people seem to think that industry in Clara is doomed to failure.  Out of the 250 or 260 that will be employed, about 120 will be employed in the jute mills; the remainder will be employed in the polypropylene factory that Goodbody established at Clara some three or four years ago.  Therefore, this means that the balance would be employed in the polypropylene end of the industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright maintained that the workers requested a public inquiry.  I am a native of Clara and I know many of the factory workers very well.  I am sure I would have known if the workers within Goodbody's did, in fact, demand a public inquiry.  I meet them every day and on no occasion did I hear from any of them that they demanded such an inquiry.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy O'Donovan's remarks about the destruction of a community in Clara.  I can assure him that this is not happening.  Of the 250 or 260 people who will be employed after the phasing-out period, 99 per cent will be from the town of Clara.  I should also like to point out to Deputy O'Donovan that of the 528 that were originally employed, at least 150 were from outside the town region.  Therefore, I cannot understand the Deputy's remarks about the destruction of the community.</P>

      <P>A great deal more. The Minister had to bring to the Deputy's notice at the start that it was not a laughing matter.  If Deputies here continue to ask that an inquiry be held into Goodbody's decision, there is a danger of the company deciding to pull out of Clara altogether, thereby destroying their plans to expand this polypropylene industry. It beats me why Deputies should say that the community in Clara would be destroyed.  That will not solve the problem in Clara.  I can assure Deputy O'Donovan that the Fianna Fáil Government will rectify the position in Clara in time.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with Clara, but the position in Athlone will be rectified as well.  While the decision of the board of directors in Clara was disappointing it may in the long term be of benefit to the Clara community. I can go back to the time when I attended the national school in Clara. I saw my own classmates going into the jute works at 14 years of age and working for 14s or 15s a week which rose to about £2 at 17 and at 18 perhaps they could earn £3; and then be let go from the works and told to find employment somewhere else.  That was the situation this industry created within my lifetime and I am not too old. Now we are in the position in Clara that adults are working in the factories, not children taken out of the national school and thrown into a <Col N="1570" /> dirty jute works and never developing physically or otherwise.</P>

      <P>What would this inquiry serve?  Would the workers in Clara benefit from an inquiry?  Is it not a fact that Goodbody are a private company?  It may be said that they got subsidies and grants down through the years.  We all realise that the jute industry is declining.  Over the past three or four years we have all seen that.  Manures and corn are supplied to farmers in plastic bags.  Most of the industry in Clara was concerned with the sack trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to emphasise the fact that the sack end of the jute industry is being maintained in Clara. The board of directors have said that the depots they have in Limerick and somewhere else in the north&mdash;I am not sure of the town but it is in Donegal&mdash; will be transferred to the Clara works and that most of the transport end of the business will be concentrated on Clara.  Assuming that materialises, the figure of 250 might not be the real employment figure in Goodbodys in Clara.  If those depots are transferred to Clara there could be at least another 50 men employed in Goodbodys.  That <Col N="1573" /> would bring the figure to the region of 300.  There is also the possibility of a further expansion of the polypropylene industry.</P>
    <P>I do not know the Minister's mind on this but I cannot see how an inquiry would benefit the workers in Goodbodys in Clara.  As I have said I come from the town.  I have been talking to the workers since the redundancy arose.  In most cases they say that if industries can be brought in to provide employment for those who were let go, eventually Clara will be a better town.  I am not taking from Goodbodys when I say this.  They were employers in Clara down through the years&mdash;for 130 years.  In my time&mdash;and before my time it was worse&mdash;the youth of Clara were thrown into the jute industry and got no real chance to make any headway in life.  They could be let go at 18 or 19 years of age and they were not fit to take up any other employment.  Anyone who was ever in a jute factory would know that it is a filthy place to work in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Amongst the 700 employed, there were many juveniles and teenagers in this factory in Clara. When those who are redundant at present are re-employed in Clara it is my opinion that Clara will be much better off because the local workers will not be dependent on one industry as has been the case down through the years. If you did not work in Goodbodys you cleared out of the town altogether.  If we can get two or three small industries in the town to absorb the unemployment I can vouch for it that, as Deputy O'Donovan put it, there will not be the destruction of a community. It will not take place; it has not taken place; and it will never take place in Clara.</P>

Clara was doomed; Offaly was doomed; there was nothing but closures.  If Offaly were depending on them it would be well and truly doomed.  All they had to offer was talk.  Deputy Flanagan challenged me at a union meeting in Clara and asked me what would I do to improve the situation.  I would like to ask him and his colleague what are they doing? They have done nothing only preach the bad story.  They preached it at meetings of the Offaly County Council.</P>

    <P>This was all under Labour and the Labour Party here and the Labour Party in England are supposed to be all in all and offering what we call pie in the sky and claiming that they can save this and save that.  Why did the Labour Party in England not save the jute industry?  They let all the workers go. They could do nothing for them.  I was told when I was in England that the jute industry was at its worst since 1924 and the English Labour Government could do nothing about it.  The Government here and all concerned are trying to help.  The number of employees in the factory at present is 420.  I am not too sure but I believe that the major let-go that was supposed to take place may not now take place at all.</P>

They stated&mdash;and I am sure it is quite true&mdash;that this firm has had large subventions from public funds.  It is a publicly quoted company on the Stock Exchange.  All this motion asks is that this firm's decision, which threw some hundreds of people out of work and, to use Deputy Cowen's euphemism, will phase out even more&mdash;phasing out means sacking of course&mdash;should be subjected to a public inquiry.  I am surprised that Deputies are opposed to this particularly as they gave indications here of the type of employment which apparently was given by this company in years gone by when it employed child labour at immorally low wages.  I am surprised to hear these Deputies coming to the defence of such a company.  I saw the television programme which investigated this redundancy decision.  It seems quite clear that one of the most important qualifications for management in this company was the accident of birth.</P>

There should be no objection whatever to an investigation into the affairs of this firm.  If it could prevent the likelihood of further unemployment and make industrialists realise their responsibility to employees who have given their life blood to the service of this firm it would be worthwhile.</P>

I am not prepared to tolerate any case of private speculators or people who, by accident of birth, run a factory throwing my neighbours out of employment. In Athlone a mini-tycoon arrived from Cork and threw 300 of the towns-people out of work.  We had not got a Minister in our town with the same energy as Deputy Lalor.

      <P>The principle behind this motion is that the Minister and his Department should be entitled to inquire into a factory like this.  This is a very desirable principle.  The industrialists of the country should be aware of this fact.  In any case where they are receiving subventions from public funds, where they decide to sack workers, they should be aware that their affairs are likely to be investigated publicly.  It speaks badly for this firm to say that they were unable to foresee years ago the trends in the jute industry and to take steps to diversify their work and to have new jobs ready for the date of change-over from jute production.  They should have made <Col N="1581" /> arrangements so that their workers could be absorbed.  Instead, we have a last-minute rush to bring in the sausage meat factory.  I am delighted that the people of Clara got this factory.  I have seen the effects of redundancy in Athlone.  Redundancy <i>per se</i> is bad enough, but redundancy followed by Government neglect is terrible.  In Athlone, the closure took place not because it was economically necessary but, in my opinion, because the people concerned thought it was commercially desirable.</P>
      <P>The principle of establishing the procedure of inquiry is a good one.</P>

      <P>I am quoting the experience in Athlone to show why there should be an inquiry.  The motion in regard to Clara is about whether there should or should not be an inquiry. I am suggesting there should be an inquiry and in support of that argument I am quoting another instance of large-scale redundancies which should not have taken place. This argument reinforces the need for an inquiry into any firm which threatens redundancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hesitation whatever in supporting this motion.  It appears to me that by having an inquiry of the type sought by this motion the Department <Col N="1582" /> would get a more intimate knowledge of the industries which come under their supervision.  The Department would possibly be able to assist managements who were interested in forward planning and to help them to foresee trends in their industries.  There has been a falling-off in jute production. The firm should perhaps have been able to foresee such trends and to have taken steps to counteract the redundancies.  The Department would also get a broader view of an industry under inquiry.  It could help to avoid a situation where a mill which could have been re-equipped at a cost of £300,000 was allowed to close where there was a skilled work force available to man it and yet the Department allowed a new spinning mill, at a cost of £3 million, to open in Newbridge, 60 miles away.  This mill has taken some of the redundant workers from Athlone.  If the Department had the principle of inquiry established as sought by this motion, knowledge would be available to prevent ridiculous and anomalous situations like this arising.  I do not think that an inquiry like this could do anything but good. Deputies opposite seem to fear that if an inquiry took place the directors of Goodbody would suddenly develop a huff and decide to close their premises in Clara.  If this Parliament and the Department of Industry and Commerce are to be frightened by such a threat it would be an outrageous situation&mdash;that a board of directors of any firm could make a threat like this to the Parliament or to a Government Department. The events that have occurred have made it very clear that an inquiry is desirable.  A factory which had 528 people employed last year will end up in the near future with only 250; 278 will go to the wall.  I do not know how many will be employed in the sausage meat factory but certainly it will be a huge factory making an enormous amount of sausages if it is going to absorb 278 workers.</P>

We are also entitled to know why these plans were not prepared years ago when the gloomy future of the jute industry was apparent to all the people connected with it.  No self-respecting firm who pride themselves on honest standards could object to having their affairs inquired into objectively, particularly when the firm were receiving subventions from public funds.</P>
      <P>My information came mainly from the television programme which investigated the redundancy at Clara and it was a sorry and a sad programme. <i>Prima facie</i> it made a very strong case for the inquiry called for in this motion.

This consultant's report which was mentioned is a top secret document.  A man who has given 30 years of his life to the Goodbody family is entitled to know why he is being thrown on the scrapheap.  It is up to this House, and his representatives here, to press for full and frank information from that company and to know why that company have decided to throw those Deputies' neighbours and friends on the scrapheap.

      <P>I am always distressed when I read of redundancies, of people being phased out, or being sacked.  I should like to compliment the Deputies from Laois-Offaly on their efforts to procure new employment for the people who are being phased out.  This is a more realistic approach than the gimmick approach of this motion.  This is just a gimmick to ensure press publicity for the crocodile tears of Fine Gael.  It is in keeping with their attitude over the years of trying to create the idea that this is a depressed area, that there is nothing in this area and thereby turn away people who want to establish industries in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The realistic way to tackle this matter is to ensure the <Col N="1585" /> creation of new jobs.  That has been the policy of Fianna Fáil, to create new jobs to absorb workers wherever they may be.  It gives me great pleasure to be standing beside Deputies who are pursuing this course day in and day out.  As has been said, we have a realistic Minister for Industry and Commerce, a man who is ensuring that Laois-Offaly will have factories to absorb the people who will become redundant. Those people will get redundancy payments which were not in existence when many workers had to suffer in a similar way when the Fine Gael and Labour Parties were in power.  There was no redundancy payment then and no way by which people could be assisted during a depressed period.</P>
      <P>I and members of my party are concerned that there should be unemployment and we are also concerned that there will be a run-down in certain industries.  This is a situation that must be accepted.  These industries must be replaced by new industries.  The retention of an ineffective industry in an area for the purpose of maintaining employment would lead to a situation which would not be to the benefit of the workers whose skills and techniques are on a par with those of workers in any other part of the world.  The people in Clara are no less efficient and no less capable of doing their job than workers in any other part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Cowen and Deputy Connolly said, they have placed many people in good employment and in better employment than they have in Clara and I am quite sure that with the assistance of the Minister, who has a special interest in the area, they will have a number of industries, better industries than Goodbody, to absorb the people already on the labour market and people who may yet be placed on the labour market.  One should look at the figures which Deputy Connolly gave in relation to the jute industry not alone for this country but for other countries as well.  The industry is on the decline in other countries.  An effort was made to diversify industry; people were encouraged to diversify industry and they have diversified to <Col N="1586" /> some degree but perhaps not to the desired degree to absorb the people who are being let go, but with the aid of the Minister and Deputies on this side of the House, who are for ever trying to ensure that new jobs will be created, I am certain jobs will be created in that area to absorb the people.  In time a better atmosphere will be created that will disperse the shadow of gloom that has been spread over the area by Fine Gael.  The people of the area will note that Deputy O'Higgins was the person who said that the industry should not have gone to Clara and it will be obvious to them that Fine Gael wish Clara to be a depressed area and that they are trying to paint this dark picture of the district.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Central Bank Bill, 1969: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the bank strike in 1970 and the same expression was used by other speakers during the discussion before Private Members' time.  Let me repeat for the 20th time that there was no bank strike in 1970; there was a bank lock-out. This bank lock-out was caused because the employers refused to negotiate reasonably with their employees. When the lock-out was settled and work was resumed the amount of money which the banks had to pay out as compensation was as much, if not more, than what would have been accepted by the workers prior to the lock-out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I do not believe in interference by the Government in industrial disputes, in a case like this where an employer causes untold harm not only to the employees but to the community at large the State is entitled to say that such a situation cannot continue. This may be considered a harsh thing to say but we all know that but for the fact that the non-associated banks were in existence and kept in circulation approximately £300 million during the period of the lock-out there <Col N="1587" /> would have been absolute chaos throughout industry and life generally.</P>
    <P>During the period of the lock-out several things happened in the country and I am surprised that an effort was not made by the Minister when introducing this Bill to ensure that such things could not happen again.  The remarkable fact during the dispute was that people who had no money spent more than those who had money. People who had no resources whatever were able to go into any stationery shop in this city and get a cheque book which they could use to draw a cheque and have it cashed.  In this way many of them spent money they did not possess.  An effort should be made to ensure that this does not happen again.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that there was considerable difficulty in clearing those cheques when the dispute was over, even if there were funds available to meet them.  In addition, we had the situation&mdash;although the Minister was not prepared to agree with Deputy O'Higgins today that this was so&mdash;that when the dispute was over, and even up to the present time, considerable distress was and is being caused.  Numerous companies during the dispute cashed cheques for people or accepted cheques for goods, for which there appears to be no money. The Minister has stated that he is not aware of any such case but there have been cases of small businessmen and one or two large business people who told me that but for the fact that the banks agreed to hold off for a few weeks until an effort was made to see if the money could be raised in other ways their firms would be out of business. This situation has arisen simply because they trusted people and agreed to accept their cheques; when the dispute was over there was no money immediately forthcoming to meet them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would agree that in any such case the person concerned has not gone out of business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of one case where the person concerned has gone out of business and in at least a dozen <Col N="1588" /> cases the firms are existing on the charity of the bank manager, something that a businessman does not like to do.  This situation was created because the commercial banks were allowed, for what reason nobody knows, to drag on a dispute for many months.  I do not think the Minister can reasonably say that in the case of the seven companies that went broke the same situation would have arisen had the banks been open.  I know of one case where an employee of one of those companies had seven monthly cheques and was living on credit because he could not cash them.  He was under the impression that when the dispute was over he could cash the cheques and pay his debts.  The man still has the seven cheques; he can paper his drawing room with them if he wishes because they are quite worthless.  This situation could not have arisen if the banks were open.</P>
      <P>I know of other people who were a little luckier because they managed to cash some of the cheques, but they are still left with three or four worthless cheques.  I would appeal to the Minister, if at all possible, to try to ensure that this kind of thing is not allowed to happen again.  I know that people say &ldquo;The bank officials went on strike&rdquo;.  They did not go on strike and I am a little tired of hearing people referring to this as a strike when everyone should know that the banks closed their doors and locked the employees out.  As Deputy O'Donovan has repeated on more than one occasion, they did this&mdash;and the Minister must be aware of this fact&mdash;without authority because by statute they are supposed to supply a service to the community which they were not providing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently the Minister intends to ensure that there is a tightening up of the non-associated banks.  While some people may argue that there are enough banks in the country&mdash;as has been stated by the Minister&mdash;to carry on business, possibly a little more competition might not do any harm.  I mentioned earlier that the Labour Party, in January 1969, and previous to that, had drawn up and published a policy.  I complimented the Minister on the fact that quite a number of <Col N="1589" /> items in the Bill were contained in that policy.  However, I wonder if the Minister could not have gone a little further. He states that an Irish money market should be established and this was suggested in our policy, particularly for short-term securities.  We also suggested that a national investment trust should be set up for long-term investments.  We suggested that interest on capital gains from foreign investments by Irish nationals should be taxed at a higher rate than normal. Another suggestion which may not have anything to do with this Bill, but I am sure the Minister will take it to heart, is that a commission of inquiry into the public debt should be set up immediately.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling said earlier that members of his party studied the policy documents of the party in depth and, in order to get the atmosphere, they held their meetings to discuss it in an empty room on the corridor we occupy.  I do not know whether the full documents have been considered by the Minister but some effort should be made by the Government to ensure that money would be available for various types of development in the country at a lower rate of interest than is normally charged.  The Minister has said that he has to pay the going rate.  This was referred to by Deputy O'Donovan.  It is just too bad when we have reached the stage at which people who want to build houses for themselves and their families find the principal and interest repayments on a 35-year loan can be as high as 10 or 11 per cent.  Would the Minister not consider that it should be possible, through the Central Bank, to ensure that money could be made available at a much lower rate of interest than that?  When the Government float a loan the general public invest a certain amount in the loan and the Government agree to underwrite a certain amount of it and usually it is necessary to find a stated sum, in some cases £5 million, £6 million or maybe £10 million.  Would the Minister like to say when he is replying whether or not it is fact that any money at present provided by the banks has no existence until it is made available for the purpose of investing in the loan?  Is it true <Col N="1590" /> that such money is in many cases repaid with interest and that the commercial banks are getting quite a substantial amount of profit on money which they have created?  Would the Minister say if it is true that people who invest money in commercial banks have that money loaned by the banks not once but several times?  Is it not true that the amount of money which is actually held by the banks would never represent the amount of money which is loaned out, because they know that unless something very unusual occurred there would not be requests for the money at the one time?  I would like if the Minister would comment on that when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Giving more power to the Central Bank&mdash;and I believe the position is the same in most countries&mdash;is the responsibility of the Government.  The Government should ensure that it will be a Government bank and that it should have the right to make capital available at low interest rates for social and national development.  I also believe the Government should attempt to ensure that the control of that bank is in the hands of people who have the interest of the people at heart and not a particular group, and I am referring particularly to what I mentioned earlier, the question of the representation of the directors from the associated banks.  The Minister suggests two; there were three.  Deputy O'Higgins suggested the non-associated banks should have a director to bring it back again to three.  I do not think they are entitled to have any directors on the board.  As I said earlier, their only responsibility is to their banks and that responsibility would cut across the general good.  Therefore the Government should insist that those who are on the Board of the Central Bank will be people who will be responsible only to the people of this country and not to a particular vested interest.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that I have not much quarrel with the board who at the present time are doing reasonably well in the circumstances, doing much better indeed than the people who went before them and who had the audacity to put into a report which they issued that it was in the interest of the economy to <Col N="1591" /> have a pool of unemployed.  We have gone away from those days.  I hope they do not return, but I do not know whether or not the Minister believes it will be possible to continue under the present banking system.  I do not know whether he believes it will be possible to prevent a recurrence of what happened last year.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure the Minister is as well aware as I am that there is great disquiet among the people over what happened last year and that it is not outside the bounds of possibility that an effort will be made to adopt a different financial system.  People do not like being left in the position that whatever money they have is locked up in a bank and they cannot get credit to buy what they want to buy if the bank is closed for many months to please some small group of directors.  Do not forget it was not the general body of bank shareholders who locked the banks.  It was the small group of bank directors who are quite well off themselves and who, I am quite sure, are not short of money.  During the bank lock-out a group of Swedish bankers were in this country and as there were some parliamentarians with them they had luncheon with a group of us in Leinster House.  They could not understand how a country could run for four or five months without a bank.  It was something which they said could not happen in their country.  The country seemed to be going along&mdash;as it turned out it was staggering along&mdash;with the banks closed.  However, there was no doubt as to how the Government were going along.  There was a certain amount of resentment when it was found that the Government had no difficulty in making available to themselves the necessary money to carry on, and they told me, as if I did not know, where the money came from.</P>
    <P>What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.  If banks are closed and no money is available for the general public, then the State and local authorities should be in the same position.  The pressure would then build up to such an extent that the dispute would have to be settled.  When the previous bank dispute took place four <Col N="1592" /> years ago there was a period of depression and the bank dispute helped the economy.  Last year when it took place the very opposite was the case.  The Government were under the impression that the closing of the banks for a period would help the economy.  When they realised it was not doing that it was too late, in their view, to do anything about it.  The result is that we had a very long-drawn-out dispute.</P>
    <P>The Minister will not be doing his job if he allows this Bill to go through the House without making some effort to ensure that, if a bank dispute takes place again, let it be a bank strike or a bank lock-out as it was last year, it will be possible to keep the economy going and that at the end we will not have cheques bouncing all over the place and, as I said earlier, with those who had no money spending money freely and those who had money locked up unable to get it to do anything with it.</P>
    <P>Reference was made earlier to the question of people who had accounts in the Six counties.  I am aware, and I am sure the Minister is aware, that quite a number of business firms would not have been able to keep going but for the fact that they opened accounts in the Six counties and in Britain and, during the lock-out, succeeded in paying for their goods.  One big manufacturer showed me a returned cheque for £32,000 with a covering letter saying how terribly sorry the firm were but they could not supply him with any more goods unless he was able to produce the money.  They suggested that he might have to close down until the dispute was over.  It is a miracle that that did not happen more often.</P>
    <P>As was said by previous speakers, it is no thanks to the Government that they succeeded in keeping going. Nobody bothered about it.  People were just left to struggle on in the hope that something would happen.  I said earlier that we in the Labour Party heartily agree with quite a number of the Minister's proposals in the Bill.  We do not believe he has gone far enough in some of the things he proposes to do.  During the Committee Stage we propose to introduce amendments to improve the Bill.  Even as it is, I am glad that this <Col N="1593" /> Bill has been introduced, but I would suggest to the Minister that there are many things he should do with it before he produces it for Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>There are a few brief points I want to raise on this Bill.  In the Explanatory Memorandum it is stated that one of the purposes of the Bill is &ldquo;to facilitate the merging of banking businesses in the interest of more efficient banking&rdquo;.  We have had a certain amount of merging of banks in the past few years.  Provision should be made for reasonable competition among the different banks.  At a time when there is a credit squeeze, people may find difficulty in obtaining loans. If there is amalgamation or merging of banks to the extent that there are only two groups, a person may not be able to obtain money to carry on his business. A farmer may not be able to obtain sufficient money to stock his land.  A small businessman may not be able to obtain sufficient money to carry on his business.  At present if you are dealing with one bank in a town and you wish to move to another that is possible although at this particular point of time, due to the bank strike, it is not possible to obtain terms in a different bank&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Without reasonable competition it is absolutely impossible to carry on.  Deputy Tully, and I believe Deputy O'Higgins, mentioned some of the effects of the bank lock-out last year.  Prior to that there was a go-slow in the banks.  Then, after the long industrial dispute, we reached the situation in which each person was his own bank manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a rural Deputy, during the bank dispute I asked the Minister to mediate <Col N="1594" /> and try to arrange talks and, in fact, act as chairman at those talks.  The Government took no action.  They felt it was not wise to intervene in an industrial dispute and they did not get involved. I felt at the time that, in the interests of the economy, it was desirable that efforts should be made.  The dispute dragged on unnecessarily and that should never have happened. There should have been some mediation to bring about a settlement.  We are all aware that everybody engaged in the banking business had to be back to work by D-day and, in fact, everybody was.  Enough effort was not made to bring to an end the dispute that dragged on for so long.</P>
    <P>When I mentioned this recently the Minister felt there was no great problem and that the effects were not serious. I can say in all honesty and sincerity that I have seen the effects.  I have met people who have had difficulties, not big business people.  I have met people who were gravely affected by the dispute.  I know numerous business people whose cheques bounced.  Many people do not yet know whether they will be able to continue in business.  It is very easy to stay aloof from that situation and say that they should have known what cheques they were issuing; that they should have known what money they had in the bank; they should have been in a position to say how exactly they were at any particular time.  When speaking of farming and smaller businesses one is speaking about ordinary people.  They may not have taken all the care they should have taken but I have seen people who never had a cheque sent back to them in their lives having this happen to them now.  It may not seem a very serious thing to some people but to an ordinary person, living in rural Ireland, it is important to ensure that any cheque he writes is honoured.</P>
    <P>It means a lot to a person in business to maintain his creditworthiness, to be able to guarantee that any cheque he writes will be honoured when it is brought to a bank.  I know of thousands of cheques that have been sent back.  The people concerned have been seriously affected by this.  I read in the newspapers that Fay Tours of <Col N="1595" /> Drogheda stated when they were closing down that the bank strike was one of the causes of their not being able to carry on.  Travelling around the country as a TD, I have met many people who have suffered seriously from the effects of that dispute.  I honestly believe the staffs of the banks were not responsible for this.  If the directors had been a little more approachable, this dispute would never have occurred.  If this Bill is to have any real meaning it should contain provisions to ensure that such a situation will not occur again.</P>
    <P>It is most undesirable to have a credit squeeze at one stage and some months later a situation where money is flowing again.  I do not know if this is a planned procedure by the Government, whether they believe this is necessary for the economy, but I believe it is not a good thing.  Some years ago when money was freely available in banks, money was obtained by people who would not get it at other times.  Now money is utterly impossible to obtain.  There is a green light at one stage and money is freely available and then a rigid situation when it is utterly impossible to obtain money.  This is undesirable.  At all times we should try to have money available so that people can obtain money for any business that a bank considers desirable&mdash;the setting up of industries, the servicing of industries, money for farmers, all types of credit. There should be a free flow of capital available for people to carry on their business.  Farmers who wish to stock their land find themselves unable to obtain the necessary credit.  Farmers who wish to expand their dairy business are unable to obtain the necessary capital.  At present there is no money available to them from the banks.  This is bad business and it leads to unease among the people.  If they bring a project to a bank manager, which they believe is reasonable and workable, and are turned down they come out with a sense of unease that there is no money there.  This is a bad thing. Credit squeezes, such as we are experiencing at present, are a bad thing for the peace of mind of the public. The Government should ensure that <Col N="1596" /> more money is made available to the public at present.  I would ask the Minister to have discussions with the Central Bank and with the directors of banks with a view to remedying this situation.  There are many people who, after the bank strike, are in financial difficulty but who, if they were granted further facilities or extension of facilities by the banks, would be able to carry on their business.  I should like the Minister to bear in mind the point I have made in regard to making more money available to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is not far reaching enough.  We can now speak from experience of the financial tragedy resulting from the lock-out by the banks for a period of six months.  If people who hire and trade and huckster with other people's money and invest it to their advantage lock the door on a whim on all employees, it is time the Minister responsible took the law into his own hands to ensure that these people who control the mighty pound cannot hold the country up to ransom and disorganise our whole financial system.  Not alone have they done that but they have brought some of our best known industries to ruin.  There is one in particular&mdash;the Hibernian Transport Company.  Prior to the lock-out the bank knew to the last penny where the Hibernian Transport Company stood.  They shut their eyes when they shut their doors.  Our foreign assets have declined.  Six hundred or 800 of our people were thrown out of employment.  Cheques were hopping around the country like yo-yos.  The people issuing the cheques were defrauding others.  I do not know where the law stands with regard to such people.  Cheques were cashed.  Some people owed money to this company but they were asked for payment in cash.  The company were issuing cheques which they knew would bounce.  Most of us concerned with this particular company knew what had happened.  Shopkeepers were cashing cheques for the employees of the company and these cheques have all bounced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am making this charge in order to be helpful and I state that the bank concerned, who handled the account, <Col N="1597" /> knew that this company was about to go bankrupt.  This situation was allowed to develop for six months.  The members of the firm could buy cheque books and write as many cheques as they liked.  This is a matter for the Attorney General, in my opinion.  I am making a serious charge because I know what I am talking about.  I know the damage that has been done to unfortunate people in Limerick and elsewhere. Many are now in receipt of redundancy payments.  Many have left the country.  Men who have spent a lifetime in the service of the Hibernian Transport Company have left.  One man who had spent over 40 years with the company had to clear out of the country because of the manner in which he was let down with regard to cheques he had issued and cheques he had received from the company.  Surely this was a criminal act?</P>
    <P>We all know what happened in the marts.  Men issued cheques for very large sums in some instances.  Where did all the money go?  Why is there not a criminal investigation into this matter?  Why were these people not made account for what they had done? We all want to see the banks controlled and to see the Central Bank with power and authority to control these transactions and the acts of the directors of the banks.  I had to go to the Press last week because of the scavenging attempt by the banks to try to blackmail public representatives for an account with the various health authorities.  I am a member of a health authority in Limerick.  There were blackmailing tactics on the part of the banks to try to grab the account of our health authority.  This account is in the region of £6 million or £7 million a year.  Blackmailing tactics were directed by the directors on the principle that &ldquo;If Coughlan owes you money, put the squeeze on him&rdquo; but &ldquo;If So-and-So does not owe you money tell him he can have his farm stocked very readily.&rdquo;</P>

We all know what happened to the health authority in the west of Ireland and why they had to change their minds.  I am sure the same thing has happened elsewhere.  In the region which I represent we have had bank managers, their sons and daughters coming and saying &ldquo;do this or&rdquo;.  The day the public representatives bow and bend to the mighty £ the quicker we will get out of public life.  I would rather die in the workhouse than bend to the rotten tactics of these banks.  I went to the public Press and I will go again if necessary.  If we are to hand over everything because of the mighty £ and its influence, all is lost.  The people who put us here will never ask whether we owe £1 or have £1.  We were sent here and to local authorities because the people have confidence in us.  If we were directed by the banks, we would be told by them to vote for certain rate collectors and for certain teachers in the vocational education committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to take authority to stop this filthy work.  This is filthy, scurrilous work which is being done by the directors of different banks.  It is particularly directed at public representatives.  I have strong views on these matters.  My experience is that the ordinary man in the street with a bit of common sense and experience is much more effective on any board than the fellow who is tied up in the whirlpool of that particular business.  We have them on the board now that the Minister intends to put two representaives from two different banks on the board and the further we keep clear of this huckstering the better.  The banks will take your £1 and give 6d on it, but they make 5s on the money through hire-purchase and in other ways.  The people are not getting a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bank workers are entitled to talk and to organise.  The bank closure was caused by a lock-out.  It came at, perhaps, 12 hours notice.  The printing companies started work and cheques <Col N="1599" /> could be bought easily.  People wrote cheques knowing that they could never be met.  This situation should not have been allowed to develop.  I know what I would do if I were unlucky enough to be in the Minister's position.  I would nationalise the banking system in the morning.  I would treat all these things on their merit.  We have the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  Are they not doing a good job?  We have the ESB and other bodies.  The Minister, who is amenable to suggestions, should realise that what was allowed to prevail for five, six or seven months was a completely irresponsible act and he has to accept responsibility.  Somebody should have moved in.  We all know that there was chaos and that cheques were yo-yoing all over the country.  Any person with one eye closed and the other eye open could see that happening but nothing was done about it.</P>
    <P>We need stability, not a see-saw affair, stop/go, up/down, describe it how you will.  If this is to be allowed to continue, then let the Minister go ahead, but let me go on record as saying that the warning has been issued that this could happen again and the doors of the banks can be locked again and the employees can go to England or elsewhere and then what will happen afterwards?  I have not come in here in any kind of belligerent or aggressive mood; I have come in to give the benefit of my experience, to let him know exactly what has happened.  He is a busy man who is locked up in his office for five or six days a week and in a way I do not blame him but those of us who meet the people, who live among them, knew what was happening and knew that the Hibernian Transport Company was gone and the bank knew it before they closed their doors and they still let them off to the extent of the best part of £500,000.  Not alone that, but there were the unfortunate employees whose cheques for salaries and wages were worth nothing.  Every day one reads in the newspapers of businesses going into voluntary liquidation and then there is nothing more about them.  Why?  Because people were working away and if there is no check, no matter what you are at, you will keep going.  For that reason I <Col N="1600" /> would appeal to the Minister to go a step further and give the Central Bank the statutory authority to move in and preserve the financial structure of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>During this debate it has been the procedure to refer to the bank lock-out, as it has been called. I suppose if any other section of the community was involved it would be called a strike.  I want to refer to the Official Report for 28th January, 1971, at column 287, to Question No. 52 asked by Deputy Crotty, and to the supplementary question which I asked arising from the Minister's reply and I quote:</P>
      <P>Will the Minister state what directives were given by the directors of the various banks to their managers prior to 15th January?  Will the Minister also state the number of firms that have been placed in jeopardy by this directive?</P>
      <P>And the Minister's reply was as follows:</P>
      <P>I am not aware of the content of any directive which may have been issued by the directors to the managers of their branches other than the details I have given in the reply, which were details furnished to me by the banks about their general approach to this problem.  Consequently, I am not in a position to say how many firms, as the Deputy said, have been placed in jeopardy as a result.  I would repeat that any case I have investigated has not turned out to be in the category referred to by Deputy Tully and referred to frequently in newspaper reports.</P>
      <P>I should like to say that since that date a lot more has come to the Minister's notice as a result of the bank lock-out. My personal opinion is that this lock-out should never have occurred.  When it did take place neither the Minister nor the Government did anything about it.  The whole procedure was immoral.  There are firms which are in jeopardy today and the jobs of various employees are also in jeopardy because of the bank lock-out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accuse the Minister and the Government of doing nothing when the <Col N="1601" /> bank strike, or the bank lock-out which is the proper term, occurred to ensure that the matter would be settled within a reasonable time.  It was common gossip around the country that it suited the Government to have this lock-out. The Government were too much engrossed with the divisions within their party and they allowed the economy to drift and the bank lock-out to continue.  On their heads lies the responsibility for people who have found themselves in difficulty since this strike.  I admit that certain people may have taken advantage of the situation but in the majority of cases people tried to carry on their business, to pay their way.  The Minister, however, could not give me, on 28th January last, details of the directive given by the managers of the various banks.</P>
    <P>I have been a Deputy for ten years and I do not need any Minister to tell me what happened to the public in the last few months.  People who have been asked to call to the banks have been queueing up and the directive to call them into the banks came from the directors.  Yet, when I asked the Minister for Finance on 27th January he was not aware of such cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>For the Minister's information, I will quote from the Official Report, dated 28th January, volume 251, column 290.  I asked the following question:</P>
      <P>Will the Minister state what directives were given by the directors of the various banks to their managers prior to the 15th January?  Will the Minister also state the number of firms that have been placed in jeopardy by this directive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister not agree that the <Col N="1602" /> Government and himself, as Minister for Finance, allowed this lock-out to continue without doing anything about it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be glad to hear the Minister on this matter. However, this situation should never have arisen and, to my mind, the Government's lack of action was completely immoral.  There are individuals and small businesses who have been placed in jeopardy and these were the people who were called in by the banks when the dispute was over. I gather the reason was that they had probably outstepped the limit of their accommodation but the point I was trying to emphasise was that the Minister for Finance could not tell me in the House on 28th January the directive that was given by the directors of the banks to the managers.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows that whatever directive was given it was done by the directors of the banks and the managers were obliged to carry out the directive.  Nobody will convince me that this gave the public or the customers of the various banks a fair opportunity to put their houses in order.  I should like to hear the Minister tell the House what the directive was, what he has since done about the matter and what help the Government are prepared to give to firms, small business people, and individuals who have found themselves in difficulty as a result of the bank closure.</P>
      <P>My greatest concern is for the workers whose jobs have been placed in jeopardy.  I am not going to mention names in this House but I will refer to the coal mining industry not far from my own constituency.  There has been much talk about a certain firm outside the borders of Kilkenny and I wonder what help the Minister for Finance will give&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I did not intend to speak at such length but there were several matters in which I was very interested and it gave me an opportunity to bring them to the Minister's attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what was in the Minister's mind when he introduced this Bill.  I am not too conversant with high finance but I gather there is some doubt in the Minister's mind, or in the minds of the staff of the Central Bank, that perhaps there are people operating here who are shady business people.  It would suggest to me that companies have not got guarantees or collateral behind them to warrant their continuing in operation in this country.  It is my impression that it is the intention of the Minister's Department that some kind of protection might be afforded to the public and I wonder why the Minister did not spell out this fact.  The emphasis is on protecting the public against shady companies who have the facilities to set up as bankers without collateral or guarantees and thereby endanger the money of the public.  If this is the case the onus is on the Minister to spell it out very quickly.</P>
      <P>I have read the explanatory memorandum and the Minister's statement. Banking is a very old business.  It is said that bankers control countries. They can also destroy countries and it is vital for a Government to have some kind of control over the banking system.  However, despite what this Bill pretends to do, we have not control over our own currency or over the banks.  The Minister is merely playing around with this.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows nothing about what is happening in the country today. The Minister states:</P>
      <P>The 1942 Act also gave the Central Bank the general function and duty of taking such steps as it deemed advisable from time to time to safeguard the integrity of our currency and ensure that in the regulation of credit the aim shall be the welfare of the whole community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who is the Minister trying to fool? <Col N="1604" />&ldquo;The aim shall be the welfare of the whole community.&rdquo;  I am wondering how the Central Bank, since its establishment in 1942, indicated that in the regulation of credit the aim was the welfare of the whole community.  In fact the Central Bank had no power whatsoever and the banks were allowed to operate as they themselves thought right.  Money and credit was made available not in the interests and welfare of the whole community but in the interests of making profit for the banks.  The profit motive was foremost in their minds and they did not take into account priority for social purposes. This was never the aim of the banks.  They never took deeds; they never gave out loans for houses, which is what we mean when we talk about the welfare of the whole community.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a Bill being introduced here that would really exercise control over these banks.  I see in this Bill the aim of establishing a monopoly of the banks.  This Bill authorises the creation of a monopoly in the banking business of this country. That is what the Central Bank Bill of 1969&mdash;it says here&mdash;proposes to do. That is another question I would like to ask the Minister: Why is it the Central Bank Bill of 1969?</P>
    <P>It would be very wrong to permit a monopoly of banking business.  Only through competition can people who avail of banking facilities get any kind of service.  The Government are mainly in the hands of these bankers.  They know that the banks completely control finance and they are dependent on the credit the banks make available to them.  There is a certain amount of credit available in a year.  If the Government take too much there is less for the private sector.  If the Government take 70 per cent there is 30 per cent for private business.  This is exactly what has created the credit squeeze in this country.  Increased demand by the Government means less credit available for private enterprise. The Government are merely the tools of the banking service.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should have any sympathy for these banks.  We have allowed them to regulate our lives for too long.  We need a Minister of vision, of ability, of courage and integrity who <Col N="1605" /> would come into this House with an imaginative Bill and would say: &ldquo;We are going to regulate credit.  We are going to see where the banks place their money.  We are going to see that the banks disclose their real profits.&rdquo; There should be compulsion on them to disclose their real profits as is not being done today.</P>
    <P>The Minister should spell out the powers of the bank and what their duties should be.  The powers of the banks should be curtailed.  A bank can literally destroy a business and put it out of action overnight.  Complex as it may seem, a bank loan is merely an entry in a book, and it passes from one book to another; an entry in a ledger, that is all it is.  The way the two banking groups, the Allied Banks and the Bank of Ireland, are operating at the moment there is no actual money being passed around; there is a movement from one ledger to another.</P>
    <P>I am wondering if pressure has been put on the Government by these banks to stop competition from foreign banks. If this is so, the Minister should admit to this House that there is pressure. It seems to me that the Irish banks are concerned at the competition that is coming into this country from abroad. If there is competition, why not?  What is the objection to it?  The more competition there is the more facilities will be available to the public.</P>
    <P>I am very much afraid there is pressure on the Government and that that is the purpose of this Bill.  In Britain the Labour Government suffered at the hands of the city bankers.  They fought and fought against devaluation but they had to admit that the banks put the pressure on them.  Mr. Wilson realised that the bankers are more powerful than the Government of Britain, and if they are more powerful than the Government in Britain why would they not be more powerful than the Government here?</P>
    <P>I am wondering why the Government allowed the monopoly of the giro system to go to the banks.  The opportunity was there to make it available through the Post Office as happened in Britain.  They allowed the banks to take it over completely.  This is a service <Col N="1606" /> which could have entered into competition with the banks if the Post Office had been allowed to operate it.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have referred to the bank strike.  The Minister never stated in this House whether banks had the right to strike.  All he could say&mdash; and it was the present Minister for Finance&mdash;was: &ldquo;Test it in court&rdquo;. Why did the Government not decide that the banks had no right to strike? We were the laughing stock of the entire world.  <i>Newsweek</i> Magazine reported that no country in the world could survive such a strike.  We allowed the strike to happen because we had a Government that were weak, that were not prepared to take action to stop this happening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The democratic system permits the election and appointment of Ministers who are not necessarily the most competent or able men.  Perhaps that is one of the greatest flaws in democracy, but it is there. Anyone, be he a grocer, or a shoemaker, can become Minister for Finance.  He is chosen more on whether he is liked than on how well he is prepared to handle his Department or is able to handle his Department.  I am saying&mdash;and I have said it in this House before&mdash;that the Minister had a duty and an obligation to put the interests of the country before everything else.  We have not even begun to feel the repercussions of the bank strike.</P>
      <P>I have a case of a company who had an overdraft of £4,500.  After the strike, the bank said they were not allowed to go over that.  The overdraft was frozen and they had to open a No. 2 account.  In the No. 2 account they had £6,000.  The receiver walked in to wind up the business.  They were astonished, and so were their workers, that the receiver should walk in unannounced and unauthorised, sent by the bank to wind up the business.  He arrived on a Monday morning at 9.30.  It is a small business.  The directors got their solicitor and went to the bank and asked why this had happened since they had a No. 2 account with £6,000 in it.  Then is was realised that there was an error and the receiver was withdrawn at 4.30 in the afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was not the end of it.  A little notice had appeared in the press stating that the bank concerned had appointed a receiver.  The customers of the firm were afraid and lost confidence in them. Last week I saw that, despite the fact that the bank had made a mistake&mdash;<Col N="1608" /> and they have made many mistakes&mdash; this company's name appeared in <i>Stubbs' Gazette</i>.  The bank made a mistake originally and a notice was sent to <i>Stubbs</i> in error.  They have done untold harm to this company.  They have shaken the confidence of their customers in the company.  That company will never recover the confidence they had established over a number of years, a small printing company in Cabra.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that banks who have not got their own accounts in order should put on the pressure and have their managers call and embarrass customers by demanding that they put their accounts in order within a week. That is exactly what happened.  The small retailers who are represented by the Alliance of Independent Retailers were greatly embarrassed by having their cheques returned, &ldquo;refer to drawer&rdquo;.  Their embarrassment with their own customers must have been terrible because they met in a state of anxiety about it wondering what was going to happen next.  The big boot was in by the banks.  The Minister says that every case is treated on its merits and it is not a matter about which he should approach the banks.  I say the Minister is acting in dereliction of his duty and he should not be in this House.</P>

      <P>Within the next six months I will be proved right about the repercussions from the bank strike.  The Minister is afraid to go to the banks.  He is afraid to tell them that they must act in the public interest. A Minister for Finance who is afraid to act as Minister for Finance should not be in the Cabinet.  I do not care whether he likes it or not.  He has no right to be in the Cabinet and his conscience should tell him that.  He is not fit to be Minister for Finance.  No matter what we may say about the previous Minister for Finance, I believe he was competent.  The Minister for Finance holds the most important post in the Cabinet, and the Taoiseach should choose a competent man to be in charge of the nation's finances.

It was natural for them to do that.  After the strike the bank returned their cheques, despite the fact that they told the manager that their money was with a building society.  The building society required notice but he said he did not care about that, that he wanted to see the money.  They showed him the receipt from the building society.  The building society said they must have notice and since some of the money was in cheques the cheques had to be checked on.  The bank would not wait and &ldquo;RD&rdquo; was marked on their cheques.

      <P>I am talking about an association with adequate finance but despite this the banks acted in a high-handed fashion and returned their cheques.  These are the cases I am <Col N="1612" /> bringing to the Minister's attention.  I am showing how the banks who had their own house in a deplorable state, who have the worst public relations of any company at present, and have had for years, went along in a high-handed fashion and tried to put businesses out and the law of the jungle prevailed. They said: &ldquo;If they are shaky let them go&rdquo;.  This was echoed by many a Minister.  If it is the policy of the Government&mdash;and it probably is&mdash;to push out the small man and arrange takeovers on most favourable terms, I say this Government should get out.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that this is exactly what is being planned and attempted here.  We have a Minister for Finance who sits back and watches it all happen because he is incompetent and unable to take action.  He lacked the courage to go to the banks, when he was asked to, and tell them that they have their house in a state of disarray and that they should put it in order before they ask anybody else to do so.  If nothing else is discussed on this Bill it is good that we shall discuss the situation regarding the banks which we were deprived of discussing for so many months.</P>

I shall read it for the Minister. I like where it says:</P>
      <P>It might indeed be said that we are already overbanked.</P>
      <P>How were we before the line up of the two banks?  Did the Minister think we were overbanked then and, if so, as a member of the Government did he do anything about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>While saying we are overbanked he says that they provided a much needed banking service when the associated banks were closed last year.  I wonder why the restriction on banks coming into this country.  We have not got that fantastic amount of finance that we could be afraid it might be passed out through these foreign banks.  I cannot see it happening. What I see is provision for one bank and this is the merger between the Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland group.  This is obvious in this.  Remember that we have only two Irish banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 38 contains provisions governing the transfer of staff where a banking business or part of it is being transferred to another bank under an approved scheme.  I may be very naive or simple-minded, but that indicates to me that in the event of the take-over of one bank by another, there will be provisions for the staff and rationalisation &mdash;call it what you like&mdash;suggests a take-over, and that we will see one bank in this country.  We will have no competition the way the Minister is planning it.  Perhaps we are all very poorly informed about finance in this country.  We have merchant banks lending money at very high interest rates.  Again, we do not know what the priorities are.  They do not know the social priorities of lending money. They are never taken into consideration at all.  I am wondering where the merchant banks are investing.  Is it inside or outside Ireland?  Have we a way of knowing where they are investing? Is there provision for this in the Central Bank Bill?  I would like an <Col N="1616" /> answer from the Minister for Finance on this point.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister if he would seriously consider asking the banks to give adequate time to businesses to put their accounts in order.  If the Minister did this on a blanket scale, not individually, and said &ldquo;You created a problem.  Many companies have found themselves in difficulties as a result of this.  Would you not give them five or six months in which to put their accounts in order?&rdquo;, this would save much trouble and many businesses which now find themselves in jeopardy would be helped.  In this way he could restore confidence in the economy.  It would not be asking too much of the Minister to speak to the representatives of banks and of the Central Bank and to ask them whether this could be done.  If the Minister is serious and sincere he will do this.  The Minister has resisted all representations until now.  The Minister said this could be done on an individual basis.  This would call for discussions at top level with the heads of the banks.</P>
    <P>When will we be in a position to have a statement from the banks and from the Central Bank on the exact repercussions of the strike?  It has been said that they would be able to make a statement within a month or two. Much will depend on this.  If we have to restore confidence in the economy we must get this point straightened out first.  It is imperative that a statement be made.  Money has poured into this country over the years.  With the present uncertainty about the state of finance I can see this money going out of the country rapidly.  Britain had a reserve of £73 million in December last.  The Bank rate there has remained unchanged and money is certainly flowing into Britain.  It is said that sterling is the most sought-after currency in Europe at the present time because of this fact.  We could have availed of this were it not for the unfortunate and chaotic situation produced by the bank strike.  I cannot see how we can hold money which has come in from abroad in our present uncertain state. Within the next few months there will be an outflow of capital at an alarming rate.  The Minister is aware of this fact.  There are no guarantees that the <Col N="1617" /> foreign money coming in will be secured in this country.  We will all suffer because of this.  Nothing encourages the withdrawal of money more than economic uncertainty.  When <i>Stubbs' Gazette</i> lists many companies going into liquidation, this gathers momentum.  It is like a snowball and has repercussions in every sphere of business.  The Minister has not acted wisely in the financial affairs of this country.</P>
    <P>The Irish banks have been very jealous of foreign banks coming into this country.  They have refused to allow the foreign banks to avail of the banks' clearinghouse for clearing cheques.  The Bank of Nova Scotia was refused the facilities of the banks' clearinghouse here.  Because of this, they could not accept current accounts in Ireland.  I would like the Minister to contradict me on this, but I made a point of inquiring on this matter and asked if they were offered the same services as the Irish banks.  They admitted they were being handicapped by the action taken by the Irish banks.  Because of the provision in the Bill, I am glad to say, there is protection for any bank coming in here. They will not be handicapped or at a disadvantage.  We have no right to restrict their activities where they are in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister says:</P>
    <P>Provisions are included in the Bill to facilitate the transfer and merger of banking businesses.  I hope these provisions, which are basically similar to those of the National Bank Transfer Act, 1966, will be availed of to rationalise our banking system in a way that will make for greater efficiency and more economic use of banking resources.  The two major banking groups have rationalisation schemes in progress and I trust that these will contribute to the general improvement of the banking structure. At the same time, I should add that the Government are fully alive to the dangers that might arise from too great a concentration of banking.</P>
    <P>No.1, the Minister wants them facilitated, and No.2, he is aware of the dangers of it.  If the Government are alive to the dangers that might arise <Col N="1618" /> from too great a concentration of banking, why is the Minister for Finance facilitating the transfer and merger of banking businesses?  That is a contradiction. There are only two major banking businesses.  The Minister is facilitating mergers here, despite the fact that the Government are fully alive to the dangers that might arise from too great a concentration of banking.</P>
    <P>Some months ago Deputy O'Donovan asked about gold and the answer was that we did sell gold, that the Minister for Finance authorised the sale of gold because gold was not earning any interest.  If it is not earning interest why is he keeping the rest of the gold and why is it not sold?  The provision about fixed parity between the Irish pound and the pound sterling is difficult to understand.  The Minister says that despite the decision to change over we need not necessarily remain on a par with sterling.  He said that the Government had no intention of changing the existing parity and that the policies we are committed to will ensure that no such eventuality will arise.  If such is the case, what is the purpose of this clause?</P>
    <P>Is the purpose of the provisions in this Bill to prepare us for entry into the EEC and if so what aspects of the Bill are relevant to that?  The onus is on the Minister to explain this.  I would have thought that where the Government had no control over the banks they would have, through the post offices, engaged in the banking business.  It would have been an imaginative idea for the Government to extend the facilities available in the post offices.  If this were done people with money on deposit in the post offices could be issued with books similar to cheque books so that they could sign cheques.  This would be a banking business conducted through the post offices.  In such a way they would be in competition with the banks.  If this had been done it would have brought a considerable amount of money into the Exchequer.  I see no reason why this could not have been done.  The day the Government go into competition with the banks, the country will benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1619" /> I am somewhat puzzled about the disabilities suffered by the Bank of Ireland Group.  The Minister said that the group suffer from some disabilities as compared with the other banks to which the Companies Act applies.  He also said that shareholders in the Bank of Ireland may be in the same position as shareholders of the other banks in regard to the management of the business. That further suggests that a merger is in sight between these two banks, that they are trying to rectify the disability before merging.  I gather from the Minister's speech that he is not terribly well informed.  There is one paragraph about the Moneylenders Acts and he said that he wanted to ensure that the Acts would not apply to banking.  He should have been somewhat more explicit on this so as to enable us to be fully informed as to how the Acts applied to forms of banking up to now.  He also referred to the function and duty ascribed to the Central Bank by the 1942 Act and I wonder how successful was the Central Bank in the general functions and duties ascribed to it.  He said:</P>
    <P>the general function and duty ascribed to the Central Bank by the 1942 Act which are to take &ldquo;such steps as the board may from time to time deem appropriate and advisable towards safeguarding the integrity of the currency&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the first part.  I wonder how successful they were in:</P>
    <P>ensuring that, in what pertains to the control of credit, the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>I doubt if it has been successful at all in regard to that.  He also stated:</P>
    <P>This statutory function of the bank in relation to monetary policy does not, of course, diminish the ultimate responsibility of the Government in that sphere.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the bank will take over a lot of the functions of the Department of Finance is puzzling and worrying.  The Minister said that the bank would have complete independence in the carrying out of its <Col N="1620" /> functions and he also said that the independence possessed by almost every Central Bank throughout the world had emphasised this very desirable provision but while it has independence the extent of the independence is a puzzling thing.  Not every Central Bank in every country is being granted the independence that the Central Bank is being granted here.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that it is desirable to have a special institution differing in constitution from and enjoying more independence than a Government Department charged with the immediate responsibility for monetary policy.  If the bank will have this immediate responsibility for monetary policy I wonder if the Central Bank should have that and what is the purpose of the Department of Finance. I cannot understand this and perhaps the Minister would explain it.  He also said that the ultimate authority of the Government, even though it may not be expressly defined, is nonetheless undisputed. This dichotomy is very difficult to understand.  The Minister at the moment is perhaps lost in the vision of the coming weekend conference and this might try to bring him back to the present situation.</P>

      <P>The need for quarterly policy review procedures has been emphasised but last year that was a fiasco as we did not have this.  I am talking seriously now to the Minister and certainly I have no fantasies about banks.  I remember what one bank manager said to me: &ldquo;The bank will give you money if you have collateral to the extent that you do not need the money.&rdquo;  I believe many people were put in <i>Stubbs</i> by the banks and that many worthwhile projects were rejected. It should not be forgotten that the banks have public money and they have not the right to put firms out of action.  They can always plead that they are worrying about their depositors but it would be nice if the banks considered their social obligations and did not always look at the profit motive.  There is profit available in offering money for housing.  The policy of the banks to consider only short-term loans is wrong and I should like to see some changes in this matter.  The custom of banks not to disclose their full profits has been bad.  I do not know why they were allowed to do this&mdash;they must have been unique in that they were the only businesses in this country that did not disclose their full profits.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one query regarding section 22.  In the explanatory <Col N="1623" /> memorandum it is stated that section 22 empowers the Central Bank to give a direction to licence holders as to the type of information to be included in advertisements which they publish or are published on their behalf.  The section also empowers the Bank to direct licence holders to refrain during a specified period from advertising for deposits.  This is puzzling and perhaps the Minister would explain some of these points in his reply.</P>
      <P>I recognise the need for the Government to obtain credit.  It is important that credit for current and capital expenditure is available because otherwise there will be slowing-down of important projects such as building and I accept that the Government should have priority in this matter.  However, there is much unnecessary spending on office blocks and I am afraid that much of this money is being obtained from Irish banks by British companies.  We see these blocks being erected throughout the city and they are completely destroying the landscape.  I am fearful of the fact that British companies with the necessary collateral&mdash;and collateral need not necessarily be available cash&mdash;can obtain credit to erect these office blocks.  I can see no advantage in this for the country because the money accruing from rents goes out of the country.  This is an infringement on the available credit because when such demands are made there will be less credit available for Government spending and private spending by Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter should be investigated by the Minister and he should inform the House of the position.  If we allow £2 million for the erection of an office block by a British company&mdash;many such companies are operating under different names&mdash;some steps should be taken in the matter because it is very serious.  I can see unemployment as a result of this because other firms who are employing Irish people are deprived of the necessary credit.  These office blocks obviously cost much money and I do not believe that the companies are bringing in the money from Britain. <Col N="1624" /> Because of this I would ask the Minister to look into the matter and ensure that they are not taking such a considerable amount of the available credit and thereby depriving Irish businesses and the Irish Government of this money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Any Bill dealing with banking and finance presents an opportunity to Members of this House to review the bank strike which afflicted this country for most of last year.  It gives them an opportunity to deal with the hardships that were imposed on the general public and the inconvenience it caused. It enables them to express the wish that steps should be taken to ensure that chaos of this kind does not affect the country in the future.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of last May the Associated Banks closed as a result of a dispute with their staffs and thereby deprived the people of the country of banking facilities.  The banks strike was something much more than a withdrawal of services or a refusal to provide goods or services to the general public.  It was really a confiscation of people's property.  It was an action which deprived people of their money on deposit, and deprived them of valuables which had been placed in the bank for safe keeping.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government should have intervened in that strike early on and taken some steps to bring it to an end.  Several appeals were made in this House to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Labour but they took the view&mdash;and apparently the Minister for Finance, from interjections in this debate since I came into the House this evening still takes the view&mdash;that it is no part of their business to do that, that collective bargaining has to be allowed to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with that.  When the national economy is at stake it is up to the Government to do something about it.  There are many precedents for it, as I pointed out to the Minister by way of intervention.  The Minister for Education has seen fit to intervene in the secondary teachers' dispute.  Before the strike began he saw fit to go and see the people concerned, to meet the Congress of Trade Unions and discuss <Col N="1625" /> the problems with those concerned.  As a result the teachers' strike has at least been postponed for a fortnight.  Why did the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach or the Minister for Labour or somebody else not adopt a similar attitude last May?  It is difficult to understand, and it would seem the Government welcomed the strike. Whether they did or not it was their duty, in my opinion, to have taken active steps early on to meet the people concerned and to try to iron out their difficulties with a view to preventing the country being held up to ransom.</P>
    <P>It cannot be good for the country, especially when we are seriously considering joining the EEC, that we should be held up as a sort of irresponsible island where the banking system is likely to break down at any time, where commerce might be brought to a standstill, according to continental and worldwide ideas.  The Government are to be censured and censured very strongly for having tolerated the bank strike and for having done nothing to try to prevent it or bring it to an end.</P>
    <P>There have been many results from the bank strike.  The state of credit seems to be very indefinite.  No bank manager seems to be able to say what banking policy is in regard to credit. He says that each case must be assessed on its own merits.  He cannot say whether there is money to buy land or businesses.  Everything has to be referred to directors.  I think myself that the banks are acutely embarrassed because they have not got funds to lend to people they believe are creditworthy for a sound economic proposition. A great part of the trouble is that the Government are eating up any credit that is available for themselves and for the public sector and as a result there is no credit left for the rest of the community.  There is general confusion following the bank strike and the Government think they can get away with blaming the uncertainty on the bank strike.</P>
    <P>Another result from the bank strike has been that some very large undertakings were put out of business and left in their wake a trail of worthless <Col N="1626" /> cheques which were cashed in the cities in this country during the bank strike by these firms, who, prior to the bank strike, were regarded as creditworthy, respectable and solvent undertakings. These firms paid their wage bills for the most part of last year at the expense of citizens in this State and at the expense of other firms.  The Government must take responsibility for that because they did nothing to try to end the bank strike.</P>
    <P>The time has come when the Government or the Central Bank, or some other body should clarify the position of our credit.  Nobody seems to know what the position is and least of all the bank managers up and down the country.  They are helpless and hopeless, unable to guide people and unable to give any indication as to what is the policy on credit.</P>
    <P>In relation to credit in the context of this Bill, the Government seem to have decided on a policy of foreign borrowing.  They seem to have decided that if they cannot get money at home they should borrow it abroad and borrow it on a more extensive scale.  On this Bill we are entitled to have regard to inflation and we would expect the Government to cure it or to curb it.</P>
    <P>I remember Dr. Whitaker of the Central Bank appearing on television towards the end of last year and dealing with the question of inflation.  He said one of the factors which encouraged inflation and brought it about was foreign borrowing.  If I understood that television appearance and speech correctly, Dr. Whitaker seemed to be advising the Government to cease from borrowing because he said it was simply injecting into the economy a lot of unearned money, which had to be paid back and that that was what inflation was all about.</P>
    <P>In the light of that&mdash;and I will make only a passing reference to it&mdash;I am afraid that I was rather surprised to receive the other day a Bill called the State Sponsored Bodies (Foreign Borrowing) Bill, 1971, which apparently is calculated to give a blank cheque to many State bodies, including the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Bord na Móna, the Sugar Company and <Col N="1627" /> approved subsidiaries, to borrow all the money they want to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Government have already set the example by borrowing abroad any time they think fit, when they cannot get enough at home.  According to Dr. Whitaker, that encourages inflation. We have the Taoiseach coming into the House now and again speaking against inflation and appealing to people to do everything they can to strengthen the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not hold myself out as a financial expert, but I always thought that a policy of borrowing abroad was a bad policy.  I know other people thought differently.  I have reason to believe that Dr. Whitaker, the Governor of the Central Bank, is a man whose views on financial matters command respect.  I did not think his appearance on television on that occasion was a mere coincidence, or a mere accident, because it was shortly before the Minister announced his wage freeze and price freeze effort.  It seemed to be an effort to build up the importance of and the danger to the financial and economic situation.  He <Col N="1628" /> certainly denounced foreign borrowing on that occasion.  In the light of that, it seems to me that the Government must know that there is no more money left at home to borrow, that they have exhausted the home credit and, not only do they propose themselves to continue borrowing abroad against the advice of the governor of the Central Bank whom they build up in this Bill, but they are also introducing, as the Minister says in his sophisticated way, an enabling Bill to encourage and facilitate borrowing abroad by State sponsored bodies.  I should like to hear a lot more from the Minister about this policy of borrowing abroad.</P>
    <P>In so far as giving a supervisory role to the Central Bank is concerned that is in accordance with Fine Gael policy, published in 1965.  I should like to ask the Minister, if he has not already told us, to tell us what is the position regarding banks in general in this country at present.  I ask him that in the light of Part II of this Bill.  Has he reason to suspect that there are any banking institutions in this country which are in an unsound position?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not.  The Deputy will notice that I drew a distinction between what is commonly understood to be a bank and what may technically be a bank.  I should like it to be quite clear that I have no doubts whatever about what is commonly understood to be a bank, none whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> In the light of Part II of the Bill, the Minister should put the position beyond doubt, because it would appear to a person perusing Part II of the Bill that the Minister either suspects that there are some institutions in the State making available banking facilities under one guise or another which are not sound, or that he anticipates or fears an influx of such institutions, or the incorporation of such institutions within the State.  Section 13 imposes on the registrar of companies the obligation to notify the Central Bank of any new banks that are formed, or any bodies that are formed which might sound like new banks.  Section <Col N="1629" /> 11 of the Bill enables the Central Bank to withdraw licences issued in the case of undertakings unable to meet their obligations, or if they fail to make the required deposit, or if they are convicted on indictment of certain offences, or if their circumstances have changed.</P>
      <P>Section 28 seems to anticipate or fear the necessity for a creditor to obtain judgment against a bank.  It seems to anticipate that a customer might have to sue a bank for money which he had deposited with them. Section 29 seems to deal with the case of a defaulting bank also.  I think it would be a fair summary on Second Reading to say that Part II seems to deal with defaulting banks, or banks which take deposits from people and do not repay them, or banks which have become bankrupt, or banks which have had a judgment given against them.  I should like the Minister to put the minds of the people at ease in this regard if he feels he is justified in doing so or, on the other hand, to warn them, even under the privilege of this House, against any banks or institutions masquerading as banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I refer the Deputy to my speech introducing the Bill?  I tried to distinguish between the two. I said:</P>
      <P>The business of dealing in money is no longer the preserve of the banks as that term is commonly understood by the general public.</P>
      <P>I was explaining what the Deputy is talking about in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I know but in that very context if the Minister thinks that there are such institutions in the country he should warn the people because during the bank strike people were driven, perhaps that is too strong a word but they were certainly encouraged, to place money with finance houses, so-called, other than the ordinary, orthodox, recognised banks and in some of these they were getting better interest rates. Part II of the Bill seems to me to suggest that there is some necessity for the type of precautions that are to be taken in <Col N="1630" /> Part II of the Bill.  I know we would all be shocked to hear that any of the traditional banks or recognised banks are in any danger but if the Minister knows of any other institutions extending banking facilities, particularly by way of accepting deposits, then there is a bounden obligation on him to warn the people about it.  He must have more knowledge of this than anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I say it is a good thing to give the Central Bank certain supervisory functions over credit, I would not like to see the position here where we would only have one bank in the State and no competition whatever.  Two things in the Bill seem to suggest that &mdash;the provisions to facilitate mergers between banks and the transfer from the Bank of Ireland to the Central Bank of the Exchequer account.  That seems to be a move in the direction of, perhaps, making the Central Bank an all powerful bank.  I would not be inclined to go that far.  It is proposed to give the Minister more control over the Central Bank by reducing the directors known as the Associated Banks directors from three to two and by giving the Minister for Finance absolute power and jurisdiction to appoint these two directors himself from among the directors admittedly of the Associated Banks but heretofore he had to appoint them from a panel submitted to him by the Associated Banks.  That is gone now and he can appoint anyone he likes.  That is a pity because for political as well as other reasons, the Minister has been given power to appoint his political friends to the board.  The system which prevailed to date apparently was that the Associated Banks submitted a number of names to the Minister and he was obliged to appoint the three bank directors from this panel. That panel is to go.  I should like the Minister to say exactly why he wants to do that, why he wants to do away with the discretion given to the Associated Banks to say: &ldquo;Here are six people and the Minister can select three directors from these six.&rdquo;  The Minister can now say he is not satisfied. Unless he is able to put forward a very good case, I will be forced to the conclusion that the Minister is doing this to create yet more patronage and to <Col N="1631" /> give positions to people for political purposes and that cannot be calculated to gain respect for the banking systems in the country.</P>
    <P>When dealing with mergers I should have dealt with section 42 which exempts from stamp duty agreements and other instruments transferring a banking business to another bank under a scheme approved by the Minister. It seems to be putting big business in a privileged position, to completely exempt the transfer of perhaps millions of pounds worth of property from one company to another, whereas a young married couple who are buying a second-hand house at £4,000 or £5,000 are expected to pay stamp duty.  There may be some explanation for it but it sounds a bit unjust to me.</P>
    <P>I have nothing more to say about this.  I rose for the specific purpose of dealing with the bank strike which crippled the country last year and to express my views on the policy of the Government on foreign borrowing which I think is very much against the national interest.  I availed of the opportunity to query the Minister on Part II of the Bill dealing with doubtful banking undertakings whether they are of the recognised, old and respected type or of the new mushroom type.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this overdue but most progressive piece of legislation?  The best thanks of the House are due to his Department and, indeed, to the Central Bank for its advice to the Government in relation to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has had the benefit of the collective wisdom of several of my collegaues in the Labour Party in relation to this Bill.  My own view is that, by any political criterion, by any general assessment of the role of the State in the issue and the protection of Irish currency, this Bill is in accordance generally with Labour Party policy as I know it and as I interpret it and as, indeed, it has been advanced in Dáil debates down through the decades. Without question this is the most progressive and necessary piece of banking legislation we have had introduced in the Dáil during the past <Col N="1632" /> 30 years.  Indeed, one wonders what Fianna Fáil have been doing for the past 30 years having regard to its failure to bring in this legislation long before now.  It is certainly more than overdue.  It manifestly strengthens the functions, operations and various mechanics of the Central Bank.  As such, it is very much in accordance with the views of the Labour movement generally in this country, which are that there has devolved on the State the basic obligation, in the national interest within the statutory power of Dáil Éireann, to lay down elementary monetary pre-conditions to State licensing, and general supervisory controls of bank operations within the country itself.  I am very conscious that we in Ireland have not got as great a measure of control over our monetary situation as we would wish.  What limited control we have should be and is enshrined in increasing measure in this Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>It is a source of encouragement that at a time when we are legitimately and quite correctly giving increasing powers to the Central Bank and expanding and developing its role in the Irish economy, we have, in my opinion, the best governor we have ever yet had in the history of the bank itself.  Dr. Whitaker is far superior to the vast majority of the economists in this country.  The Minister has strengthened the board of the bank with the presence of Dr. Louden Ryan.  It is a matter of encouragement to Dáil Éireann that we have, within the setting of this legislation, a Central Bank in which we can have a great measure of trust and goodwill.  No nation's monetary or economic policy can ever evolve around one individual, nor should it do so. The Central Bank have a most distinguished and capable governor and also growing expertise among its advisory and economic staff.  This is an area in which there has been very sparse advice to the State generally in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note the ever-increasing measure of potential and benefit to the nation of the economic advisory work available to the Government.  It highlights one fact&mdash;and I am not making this remark in a snide manner&mdash;that <Col N="1633" /> while the Central Bank have grown in power and function and improved their personnel and expertise the current Cabinet have, in ever-increasing measure, developed into a position of what one might call general economic fifth-rate mediocrity.  It is not unfair to say that about the role of the Irish Government.  If the work of Dáil Éireann was on a parallel with that of the Central Bank most certainly we would be in a better position.  This is not the time to develop that line.  I welcome this Bill.  It is closing a situation which was quite farcical, whereby we were in the general banking world a unique nation where if the Revenue Commissioners were mad enough, it was legally possible for anybody to obtain a licence.  It was possible to take deposits from the public provided that one was issued with a licence by the Revenue Commissioners and had paid the fee of £1.  Such a person could take £20,000 lodgments.  The miracle is that in the 1960s, in particular, and in the recent past, with the very limited supervisory and controlling function open to the Central Bank, we, in Ireland, have not had a banking catastrophe such as has happened in other countries.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that this Bill will give an added impetus to the creation of a general money market, in a very limited sense admittedly, in the Republic of Ireland.  It is a matter of pride that arrangements have been made for the acceptance by the Central Bank of a very wide range of short-term deposits from banks and finance houses generally, for active dealing by the banks in short-term Government securities and for the issue of Exchequer Bill at regular and more frequent intervals.  Money which was being placed in the foreign houses, particularly in London, will now be placed at home in our own rather limited small, native money market. This money market will play a role of increasing importance.</P>
    <P>The Minister became worried about the devaluation question and if he keeps on raising this question someone might ultimately say that he is going to believe it, and then something might happen.  I welcome this statement but <Col N="1634" /> we should bury it for 1971.  We should disregard the perpetual question of devaluation of our currency in relation to sterling.  It is a non-issue.  We should not even raise it generally.  We do not need such off-repeated assurances from the Minister that the Government have no intention of changing the existing parity with sterling.  While undoubtedly questioning the policy of the Government at the moment in relation to the inflationary situation, I am pleased to note that the Minister's denial is again emphasised.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had to listen to some appalling nonsense in relation to this Bill, but he has the consolation of being paid a substantial salary for this.  I welcome the introduction of the Bill and hope that it will have a speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <P>I am particularly interested in the last part of the Minister's speech where he refers to the bank strike and says that he is making arrangements to ensure that this disruption of our finances shall not occur in the future.  Am I being unduly inquisitive when I ask the Minister why he or the Government did not take action to avert the strike when it was about to take place? When the banks did close why did the Government remain inert over that long period?  Many Deputies, both from these benches and also from the Labour benches, suggested to the Minister for Labour, principally, as he was the Minister concerned, that he should have intervened to try to get the banks reopened.  I am not, therefore, being inquisitive when I ask the Minister for Finance to explain this reference in which he has indicated that no further bank strikes will occur or that if they do occur this Bill will place the Government in a position to deal with the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Deputy to quote the statement which he says amounts to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, with the greatest of pleasure.  This erudite statement commences as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I finish, I wish to refer to the bank closure which suspended <Col N="1635" /> the country's main banking services for many months and caused widespread trouble and inconvenience to the business community and private persons alike.</P>
    <P>A fair interpretation of that would be that the Government were worried about the strike while it lasted and one would have expected there would have been some intervention from official quarters, of which I am unaware. I quote:</P>
    <P>It must be the aim of all concerned to avoid any recurrence.  As the House is aware, the Minister for Labour has arranged for Professor M.P. Gogarty to investigate the causes of the dispute and to make recommendations as to what action might be taken to avoid any further similar experience.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be rather like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.  However, I will read on as I want to be absolutely fair to the Minister:</P>
    <P>The Central Bank and the Economic and Social Research Institute are conducting inquiries to ascertain how firms and individuals managed their finances during the bank closure.</P>
    <P>You can see from that that out of evil sometimes comes good.  The Government have awakened to the fact that the entire economy was disrupted for seven or eight months without any intervention whatever.  It is only fair to say that the Minister was not in the office he is now in during all that time but even for the considerable period for which he was I do not recollect his having done anything.</P>
    <P>The information provided by all these inquiries will be of assistance in deciding future action.</P>
    <P>That is where I was a little inquisitive. I want to know what will be the future action of the Government if we are faced with a further bank closure.  He then said:</P>
    <P>Meantime, the powers proposed in the Bill will put the Central Bank in a strong position in various ways to deal with banking problems, <Col N="1636" /> whether arising from a bank closure or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Am I to take it that the one branch of the Central Bank, in the heart of Dublin, is going to deal with the banking problems of everybody concerned if the banks close again?  Of course this is just eye-wash.  It is necessary for the Minister, when introducing a banking Bill such as this, to refer to one of the most difficult things that happened in financial circles here probably since the inception of the State.  I am happy that the Minister realises the inconvenience that was caused to the people with money in the banks and the unnecessary delay in the reopening of the banks due to the total ineptitude of the Minister and possibly his advisers also.</P>
    <P>This is not a very revolutionary Bill; it proposes to do only about two or three things.  It proposes to give directors appointed by the Government greater control over the lives of the people.  All these things are always dished up with a sugar-coated pill. The argument in the Minister's speech is that all the banks will be required to have a deposit of not less than £20,000 in the Central Bank.  This is to safeguard the private investor who may have lost confidence in the banks, as indeed a great many people have. It is only natural that they should have, as over a period of three years we have had two closures of the Associated Banks.  This is the sugar-coated pill dished up to the public, that the Minister will be able to appoint directors to the Central Bank and a certain quantity of the money which is deposited, to whomever it belongs, will be deposited in the Central Bank with the idea of protecting the public.  In addition, they will have control over credit.</P>
    <P>At present the Minister or the Government may not have complete control, legal control shall we say, over the restriction or otherwise of credit but it is a well-known fact that there is a certain amount of money available, invested money&mdash;fluidity I think is the great financial term&mdash;for loans.  When the Government borrow they utilise a certain amount of the money for their so-called programme of economic expansion <Col N="1637" /> which I think is giving us about a 2 per cent increase in our national income.  This leaves a very limited amount of money available for the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that the Government ever had difficulty getting money from the banks for two reasons: first of all, the banks want to keep in with the Government and the Minister for Finance, and secondly, it is perfectly safe for the banks to lend any money they like to the Government because they are aware that the rate of interest is procurable simply by the Government taxing the people.  Therefore in a way this Bill is something of a myth.  This Bill says that it is giving the Government control over the credit facilities but I would like the Minister to tell us what lack of control has he had or what difficulty has he had in procuring the fullest co-operation of the banks to get all the money he wants for the so-called programme of economic expansion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1638" /> The Bill also gives him the right to control credit.  It is recognised that the word &ldquo;credit&rdquo; at the moment, as far as credit goes to the ordinary individual, is a complete misnomer.  The banks, far from giving credit to anybody, are trying to rake in all the money they can and to get business people, who were very hard hit, factories and individuals, to settle their overdrafts.  They are only interested in trying to get people to pay back as much money as they can into their accounts if they got into the red.  I am not too strong financially myself as a result of the strike and I do not suppose anybody else is either&mdash;but the banks are more concerned with trying to get money in than anything else.  Even the Government found when the strike was over that they were in a very unhappy position.</P>

    <P>Information in respect of (d) and (e) is not available for the years in question.  The only available data relate to agricultural holdings and are derived from an analysis of a 10 per cent sample of the returns made in the full Agricultural Enumeration of June, 1965.  Based on this analysis, it was estimated that of the 283,000 holdings over 1 statute acre about 90,000 or 31.8 per cent kept some pigs.  The average number of pigs kept on these holdings was 13.0.</P>

The figures shown are based on the 1966 census of population. However, the precise tabulation required was not prepared at the census, so that the allocation of males in industrial employment to age groups was made on the basis of related occupational data.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have placed in the Library <Col N="1521" /> a copy of &ldquo;Financial Report and Accounts for the year ended 31st December, 1969 and Report of the Board of Auditors&rdquo;, which contains full information on contributions paid and due by member States for 1969, the most recent year for which UN accounts have been published.  This document shows in Schedule 3 that the total assessment on member States for the regular budget for that year was $143,467,267, of which a sum of $49,831,281 was unpaid as at 31st December, 1969.  When balances due by member States in respect of the regular budget for previous years are added, the total unpaid as at 31st December, 1969, was $58,236,915.  The Deputy will appreciate that Parliamentary procedures, Budgetary practices and other factors sometimes delay actual payments by national administrations and that some contributions for 1969 would have been paid after the end of that year.  Certain Governments regard as illegal the inclusion in the regular budget of expenditure items such as the UN bond issue, the UN commission for the unification and rehabilitation of Korea, the UN memorial cemetery in Korea, the UN field service and prior to 1968, UNTSO.  To try to establish accurately how much is due on foot of items such as the foregoing would require a major accounting study, since under the UN financial regulations current contributions are applied in the first instance to liquidating or reducing any arrears.  I understand that by 31st December, 1970, the total outstanding at the end of the previous year had been reduced, through payment of contributions in 1970 for 1970 and previous years to less than $9,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A serious situation continues to exist in regard to two former UN peacekeeping operations.  Assessed contributions unpaid as at 31st December, 1969, for the special account of the United Nations emergency force and the <i>ad hoc</i> account for the United Nations operation in the Congo amounted to $50,510,287 and $82,102,487, respectively. I regret to say that no material improvement in the status of these accounts had taken place in 1970.  The annex to the document to which I have referred points out that certain Governments <Col N="1522" /> take the view, which the Irish Government do not share, that the expenditures involved have been illegally included therein and that they do not consider themselves bound to participate in these expenditures under the provisions of Article 17 of the Charter.</P>

As a result of the failure of that employer five employees, as far as can be ascertained, lost benefit.  The company in question have ceased to trade and a liquidator or receiver has not so far been appointed. Accordingly there is, at present, no way open to my Department to recover the benefit lost.  My Department are, however, keeping the matter under review with a view to taking whatever action is possible when a liquidator or receiver is appointed.</P>
      <P>On the question of providing against loss of benefit by insured persons where employers fail to pay insurance contributions due I propose, as indicated in reply to previous questions, to amend the legislation at the earliest opportunity to ensure that no insured person, who is himself blameless in the matter, will lose benefit solely by reason of an employer's failure or neglect to pay insurance contributions due.  In the meantime I am amending existing statutory regulations governing the payment and crediting of contributions which will have the effect of greatly reducing the number of cases in which loss of benefit can arise due to employers' failure to stamp insurance cards.  I hope to have the revised regulations in force before long.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will state in respect of 15 redundancy cases (details supplied) if the employer had given (a) the notice under section 17 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, or (b) a certificate under section 18; if any action was taken by his Department in connection with the failure to observe statutory duties; if weekly payments were made; and if it is open to the appellants to make a further appeal for a redundancy certificate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The company concerned did not give notice under section 17 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, or issue a redundancy certificate to any of the employees involved in the 15 cases referred to in the question.  No action has been taken, or is proposed to be taken, by my Department against the company.  In six of the 15 cases the Redundancy Appeals Tribunal held that the employees did not qualify for redundancy payments under the Act.  I am satisfied that in the remaining nine cases the company had genuine grounds for doubt as regards their liability to give notices of dismissal or issue redundancy certificates.</P>
      <P>Weekly payments have not been made to any of the employees so far.  The Redundancy Appeals Tribunal have decided that six of the employees were not eligible for such payments.  In the other nine cases such matters as reckonable service and remuneration of the employees have yet to be decided either by agreement between the parties or, failing such agreement, by re-application to the tribunal.  My Department will make the weekly payments to the nine employees who have been deemed eligible for them as soon as their entitlements are settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not open to the six appellants who, the tribunal have decided, are not qualified for redundancy payments, to make further appeals for redundancy certificates.  The other nine employees do not require redundancy certificates <Col N="1524" /> in order to secure their redundancy weekly payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will state in respect of four redundancy cases (details supplied) if the employer had given (a) the notice under section 17 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, or (b) a certificate under section 18; if any action was taken by his Department in connection with the failure to observe statutory duties; if weekly payments were made; and if it is open to the appellants to make a further appeal for a redundancy certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In none of the four cases referred to in the question did the employer give a notice under section 17 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967 or issue a redundancy certificate under section 18.  No action has been taken by my Department against any of the employers concerned as it has not been established that the circumstances would justify such action. Weekly payments have not been made to the employees because entitlement to such payments under the Act has not been established.  Any of the employees who wishes to do so is entitled to appeal again to the Redundancy Appeals Tribunal against his employer's decision not to give him a redundancy certificate.  Alternatively, he may apply to my Department for redundancy weekly payments, in which case I will have the question of his entitlement referred to the tribunal for determination.</P>
