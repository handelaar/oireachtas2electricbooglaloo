      <P>Deputy Flanagan made some plaintive pleas yesterday as to who demanded this Bill.  May I refer the Deputy to column 110 of <Col N="2614" /> Volume 247 of the Official Report, 27th May of last year, when Deputy Fitzpatrick of Cavan, the Fine Gael spokesman on Justice, was congratulating the Minister for Justice on his elevation to the post?  He went on:</P>
      <P>We have very unsettled conditions, restless conditions: the nation is perturbed by crime of all descriptions, ranging from armed bank robberies, resulting in the death of police officers, to what might be regarded as something less, in the form of sit-in protests, fish-in protests, protests of one sort or another.  I do not intend to dwell on this at any length but I think the toleration of the taking over of public or private buildings, whether as sit-ins under the auspices of cultural or architectural activities or sit-ins in protest against lack of housing or fish-ins as a national protest is nothing short of tolerating anarchy and can lead only to total disrespect for the law and to the common commission of more serious acts of violence.  It is bound to generate disrespect for the law and for public and private property. I hope the Minister, in entering his office, will tackle these problems as they should be tackled because they have been overlooked and tolerated for too long.</P>

      <P>We, the Government and the party, have no intention of trying to mute the Press and this is known on the opposite benches.

      <P>Amendment No. 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>This party have no intention of muting the Press, radio or television but they do not intend to give any crackpot who does not like democracy a licence under this amendment to say what he likes.  The man at the street corner who advocates takeovers and sit-ins can be prosecuted but some smart boy in a television room can advocate the same thing and be immune.  The man at the street corner is reaching only hundreds of people but the man on the radio, on television or in the Press may be reaching millions.  The vast majority of journalists are responsible people but they have their black sheep, as is evident from some periodicals and magazines we have seen in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2617" /> Fianna Fáil have been accused of being fascist in connection with this section of the Bill.  If anyone over there could prove that that is so, then the people might be prepared to believe the Opposition but Fine Gael know in their hearts and souls that their background is basically the same as ours. Like them we come from ordinary homes.  We believe in democracy and practise ordinary politics and not in fascism in any shape or form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not intend to act in a Hitlerite manner here.  We are merely giving the individual the right to protect his own property.  This amendment seeks to give immunity to those who would deny people that right.  There were no amendments from the Labour Party down on Committee Stage but when they saw Fine Gael on the bandwagon, they decided to put down amendments as well, the sixth of which is a completely ridiculous one.</P>

      <P>The Members in the opposite benches cannot say honestly that we have any malicious intention in this section of the Bill, that we are trying to discriminate against any section of the community.  It is totally misleading to say we are doing this in relation to the Press, radio or television. We do not intend to deal with these specifically in the Bill, but we shall deal with them in the ordinary course if they step out of line.  I know that the Whip is on the Fine Gael members and while they cannot vote for the Bill, their hearts are with us. The important thing is that the Bill will be passed.  I know many Opposition Deputies will say: &ldquo;Thank God it is passed and at last we can deal with some of the people who interfere with the rights of others, and people will be able to own their own houses and live in them without interference&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is seemingly what you wanted.  Deputy Davern is aware, as are the Fianna Fáil Party, that this Bill is a threat to muzzle the Press and a threat to take criminal proceedings against Press and radio or any other media, or television, if they in their duty to the public consider it necessary to draw attention to the failure of the Government or the lack of action on behalf of the Government. This is a definite threat because no journalist or member of RTE will feel himself free even if he regards it as his duty to criticise the Government because overhead hangs the threat of criminal proceedings.</P>

      <P>We never did.  At the moment we do not wish to curry favour.  We do not want the Press or the media to give us any favours.  We have put down this amendment because we realise that it is necessary in any free democracy to have a free Press.  This party, from the inception of the State, has always stood for free comment, free speech and the freedom and the right of the Press to criticise or praise as they thought fit the actions of whatever Government might be in power and whatever party might be in Opposition.  We have always stood by that.  That is why in this amendment we have taken the stand we have.  It is our wish to see this freedom preserved. That has forced us to put down this amendment.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have said that this section is not intended to be used against the Press and that the purpose of the Bill in general is to use it against illegal or subversive organisations and to prevent them having published in any periodical or journal anything which might advocate actions against the law of the country.  Fianna Fáil said that it was never intended to use this Bill against the Press, radio or television. Fianna Fáil also told us before that it was never intended to use the Offences Against the State Act against the farmers of this country or against the ESB.  We all know that the Government did not hesitate to use this Act any time they felt like using it.  I wonder what is the attitude of quite a number of Deputies on that side of the House?  It is not very long since an ex-Minister of the Fianna Fáil Party publicly and in writing advocated the illegal occupying of a house in Mayo and when that was being debated in this House we were told that this was normal procedure in the West of Ireland.  We were told that, and many Members on the benches opposite applauded and were very strong in their support of the attitude of that Minister at that time.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Corish was speaking last night he drew attention to the non-attendance of the Minister during the course of the debate&mdash;now the Minister is leaving again.  He pointed out how seldom the Minister was here and how he was willing to allow any other front bench <Col N="2625" /> member&mdash;I see we now have a Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;to sit in.  The Minister is so ashamed of the Bill he is afraid even to stay and listen to the debate.  He has been away in the Far East or the Middle East speaking about law and justice.  I wish he would stay at home and see that justice is done and allow the Press, radio and television to comment freely without the threat of criminal proceedings hanging over their heads.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party have always advocated the freedom of the Press and the right of the Press to report any matters whether they were favourable to or against the Government.  The former Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Mr. James Dillon, said on many occasions that he did not agree with comments made by certain Deputies opposite but at the same time he would die to defend their right to express their opinions freely.  The Fine Gael Party regard it the right of every individual freely to express his opinions and the right of the Press, radio and television to report those expressions without having the threat and worry of criminal proceedings being taken against them.  The Government have threatened to stay here without any summer recess until they get this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan advised everybody to use all the means in his power to show the injustice of this particular <Col N="2626" /> section of the Bill.  He asked the Press, radio and television to draw the attention of the public to the injustice contained in this section.  Later on Deputy Corish said that if the Press, radio and television did this they were in danger of criminal proceedings being taken against them.  When the Bill is passed they will certainly be in danger of having criminal proceedings taken against them but now is the time, before the Bill becomes law, to focus the attention of the public on it and show them what really is at stake in this case.  Let them highlight what the Government are trying to do, let them show that it is the intention of the Government to muzzle the Press and not to allow anything which would show them in a bad light to be published without the threat of criminal proceedings.  Now is the time to point this out and to show what the attitudes of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties are in order that the public may know what the Government are trying to do.</P>
    <P>The Government know no matter how long we may talk here&mdash;and seemingly they are prepared to see this out to the bitter end&mdash;they have the necessary majority to force the Bill through but I wonder if they are really sure how many of them will follow the Government into the Division Lobbies.  When a Fianna Fáil Minister advocated that people should squat in houses many members of the Fianna Fáil Party were loud in their praise and agreed with the Minister's attitude. Are those people to be so two-faced as to walk meekly behind the Minister into the Division Lobby? Surely, after yesterday's voting, the Minister must begin to think again. The Minister must realise that representatives of the Press, radio and television have no desire to publish anything that might be regarded as being absurd.  All they wish to do is to give a true picture of the day to day happenings in the country.</P>
    <P>Not very long ago when Press photographers and reporters visited Dublin Airport when a building that had never been used, was being demolished, they were ordered out.  If this Bill had then been law, I have no doubt that there would have been criminal proceedings <Col N="2627" /> instituted against them.  I asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he was aware of this having happened and in fairness to him he told me that he was so aware.  I asked him if he would not agree that lawfully accredited members of the Press were responsible and reasonable people and should be allowed access to any building that came within the ambit of his Department.  He agreed that this would be the proper attitude to adopt and he guaranteed that in future members of the Press would be given such freedom. So far as I know, this undertaking has not been carried out fully because there have been one or two minor incidents in this regard since but, by and large, the undertaking has been upheld. I ask the ordinary members of Fianna Fáil to consider all these matters.  As Deputy Davern said, most of us come from the same type of background and surely they, too, realise that a free Press is necessary in any democracy. The Press should be free to present facts as they see them and to criticise when they consider it necessary to do so.  I appeal to Fianna Fáil to have enough common sense to forget about this Bill for the present and have their summer holidays.  Perhaps when they come back they will consider the Bill in a more reasonable light.</P>

      <P>Of the contributions that have been made, 85 per cent came <Col N="2628" /> from the Opposition.  If the people of this country were to ask tomorrow what is the role of the Opposition.  I would say to them that, with the present Government in power, the role of the Opposition is that of defender of democracy and the rights of the people. I am honoured to be associated with this attempt to prevent the passing of a Bill that is repressive.  I do not believe it to be a personal attempt on the part of the Minister for Justice to force this Bill through the House.  I have been thinking about where the Bill could have emanated from and why it was decided to push it through. The Minister is bearing the brunt of the criticism but I do not believe that, personally, he is a vindictive man.  He is not a Hitler but he is an ordinary human being who has weaknesses and failings but who also has some good points and we should not attack him on a personal basis.</P>
      <P>What we are trying to do is to tell the Minister in no uncertain terms that the Bill&mdash;and this section in particular &mdash;is pernicious and repressive and is certainly not the type of legislation that we should be dealing with.  We should be proud to have a free Parliament. Too often this Parliament is criticised and ridiculed but when we consider what happens in certain places abroad we should be proud to have a Parliament in which free discussion can take place.  However, we should ensure that this Parliament remains free and that any legislation that is passed is of a constructive nature and that it will not be legislation of the type that would be to the detriment of any of our people.</P>
      <P>We cannot overlook the fact that the Taoiseach, as head of the Government, has turned the blind eye on what the papers have been saying.  He has ignored repeated requests from the public to have this section removed.</P>

      <P>This particular section concerns squatting.  If there is one question on which I become emotional, it is that of housing.  Before ever coming here I was greatly concerned with this problem because, as a <Col N="2629" /> doctor, I witnessed the consequences of the problem.  I remember more than anything else, hearing that a house had collapsed in Fenian Street.  I left my surgery and went down there.  I saw the man who had been living in the house and whose children had been killed in the collapse.  He was sitting with his head bowed and there was not a word of protest from him.  A crowd of people had gathered and I considered it to be a magnificent display of restraint that this man did not utter a word of protest.  I was very upset.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I could not have been so contained.  I am afraid I would have lost my head.  I felt too strongly about it&mdash;it could have been my two children&mdash;that I would have taken the law into my own two hands.  I honestly believe I would have if my two children had been killed because of the injustice of the system that permitted this man to live in a hovel in a dangerous tenement house in the 20th century when we talk about affluence. I believe I would have taken the law into my hands.  I would have taken over a place, I would have gone down and, perhaps, I would have put a bomb in the corporation or anywhere that was responsible.  This is how I would have reacted but I do not think the people are like that in this country. Generally, they are very resigned to accepting the inevitable.  I have seen the housing problem.  I have seen the people who are homeless and separated from their husbands and I have seen them accept it.  Very occasionally they have had a protest about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel I was responsible for setting up the Housing Action Committee against which this section is directed because it was set up in my house.  We thought we would start a protest against the housing crisis.  I remember our drawing up the draft rules of the group.  It was non-political.  It was to expose the injustice, the crisis and the fact that there was not a housing programme. I felt so incompetent, inept, incapable of doing anything in this House.  I was constantly told: &ldquo;It is not a matter for the House.  It is a matter for Dublin Corporation.&rdquo;  I was constantly fobbed off with that answer by the Minister for Local Government. <Col N="2630" /> I thought that if public reaction and public feeling could be aroused, perhaps, something more could be done for poor people who were unable to help themselves.  We marched on the Mansion House and we marched to other places and we tried to interest people in the problem of homeless people and people living in overcrowded conditions, in inhuman conditions, people living in hovels with the rats. I have read about this in a book called <i>Strumpet City</i> and as I read it I realised that people are living like that today.  Sometimes you can become so far removed from the problems of the poor that you do not think the problems of the poor exist.</P>
    <P>It is intolerable.  It is shocking to think that we should bring a Bill to this House to stop protest against inhuman housing conditions.  I feel ashamed to be a Member of a House which is trying to push through legislation which is aimed directly at people who would expose inhuman housing conditions, really shocking conditions. We are asked to agree to legislation to do this.</P>
    <P>I see a friend here.  I was appalled and astonished last night when a Fianna Fáil Deputy said to me: &ldquo;This Bill is good; this section is good.  Do you know what it will do in west Finglas?  There is a park up there where young children play and there are big fellows in the park.  These big fellows are playing there and taking over.  This Bill will stop that.&rdquo;  I have never heard such nonsense as that.  Is this the quality of Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party?  I am appalled they would be so naïve, so stupid, as to think that it will stop the big bullies in the park, the big fellows who play around with a ball.  It has happened from time immemorial.  I played ball with young kids around and everyone here&mdash;the Press, the Ceann Comhairle and all of us&mdash;have done it.  If that is the kind of mentality in the Fianna Fáil Party, God help Ireland. God help us if we have a Government composed of such men.  It is a shame and a disgrace that they would be so naïve, so narrow-minded, so stupid as to think that the purpose of the Bill is to stop the big fellows from kicking ball in the park.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2631" /> I wonder are we trying to forget that we have a housing problem.  I have seen a Minister for Local Government here who lost his reason when he was asked embarrassing questions about the housing situation, the numbers on the housing list in Dublin Corporation. He got very annoyed but at least he answered.  His successor, the present Minister for Local Government, has now decided that he will not give the information.  He will not tell us the up-to-date position in regard to the housing situation.</P>

      <P>I was talking about squatting.  They have tried by every means to cover up the housing crisis. They think the best answer is to stop protest, stop groups of people exposing the housing situation.  They think the answer is to bring in a repressive Bill such as this.  I do not think you will solve a problem that way.  I do not think any repressive Bill brought into Parliament will stop a rotting situation, a social evil.  That is the wrong way to do it.  The answer would be to look at the housing situation, assess it, air it and then decide that maybe £50 million or so would solve it.  They might even be guided by Keynes' theory that if you spend £50 million on capital or public works such as housing you will get back £25 million. This is his theory which has been proved right.  The way to solve the housing problem is to start building houses and get our priorities right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would sit here right through the summer discussing how we could improve the housing situation, not how to repress people and stop them from protesting.  Have we gone completely off the rails in attempting to bring in repressive legislation to stop people protesting against injustice?  It is clearly obvious that it is directed against the Housing Action Committee, a group of young people who honestly feel strongly about the housing problem and who have attempted in their own way to expose it.  What <Col N="2632" /> did they do?  They marched on City Hall.  It was said they encouraged people to squat.  Are we going to take measures against the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Moran, because he encouraged a person to squat?  He has told us that he felt sorry for a woman in his constituency and that he told her to squat.  I found no fault with the charity of the former Minister; in fact, I liked him for showing humanity and I should not like to think we will introduce a Bill to take action against him.  Can the Minister for Justice tell us if a case will be brought against Deputy Moran for encouraging a person to squat?  This shows the farcical situation that exists.</P>
    <P>I was in sympathy with some of the remarks made by the present Minister for Justice and I thought we might have been a little unfair to him because he showed the same humanity towards people who were squatting.  At column 231, Volume 254 of the Official Report for 26th May, 1970, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The particular purpose of these two subsections and this section in general, to which I have moved this amendment, is not to get at anybody who might be put into a dwelling-house or other similar premises for the purpose of squatting there, because as often as not those people may be in a bad way.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that this shows a certain sympathy towards the squatters. The purpose of this Bill is not to act against the squatters because the Minister states in the same column:</P>
    <P>I have no desire to make life any more difficult for them than it is.</P>
    <P>The Minister realises people do not squat without good reason; he recognises there is justification for squatting and he assures us he will not make life more difficult for the squatters.  The Minister further states:</P>
    <P>The purpose of these amendments and this section is to get at the real villains of the piece, who, as I have said both inside and outside this House before, organise this sort of thing but very cutely and very deliberately keep in the background <Col N="2633" /> as is in accordance with the normal practice of persons of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister considers people who encourage others to squat are villains; therefore, he is saying in no uncertain terms that the former Minister for Justice is a villain.  This section is directed at Deputy Moran because he is the man in the background who encouraged a person to squat.  I should take strong objection if I were called a villain by the present Minister and it should be noted in this House that the Minister has referred to his predecessor in this way.  This is not the correct way to refer to a Member of this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister further states in the same column:</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, attempting in this amendment and in this section to deal with people who try to remain in the background and try to force on less well-known and perhaps less fortunate people than themselves to break the law.</P>
    <P>The reference to the less well-known people is obvious because the squatters are not as well known as the former Minister for Justice.  The Minister further states:</P>
    <P>I feel I cannot do without section 4 and that is the reason why section 4 is there and why I have put these amendments down.</P>
    <P>If the Minister succeeds in getting this Bill before the summer recess, it is obvious he intends to work very fast.  I should like to warn the former Minister that he may swoop on his house as soon as the Dáil goes into recess because, on Deputy Moran's own admission, he encouraged a person to squat.  I wonder how many other people there are against whom the Minister intends to take action?</P>
    <P>Squatting is no more.  I heard of cases every week of people who were homeless, who had squatted and who wished to make amends.  They would accept any accommodation that was offered because they realised it was not right to squat.  I remember one occasion when a man and his two children were forced to squat.  When I saw them it was a snowy Sunday morning and I could only tell them to walk around <Col N="2634" /> all day.  The children were very cold but the father could do nothing about getting accommodation for them.  The man told me he was going to squat and I could not say anything to him.  He did not want to squat or deprive people of their rights but he could see no other way out.  He squatted in a vacant substandard flat&mdash;I saw the accommodation and it was not fit for human habitation.  He stayed in the flat for a few days during a very cold spell and then came to me.  He admitted he had done wrong and wanted to make amends and he asked me whether Dublin Corporation would blacklist him for taking his children in from the cold for a few days.</P>
    <P>What that man did was not morally wrong.  He was entitled to provide shelter for his wife and children and when he saw vacant accommodation he was entitled morally to take his children in from the cold.  If he had left the children he would be up on a charge of neglect but, because he fulfilled his duty as a father, he was breaking the law.  It is very difficult to say to people : &ldquo;You have no right to squat.&rdquo;  Rather, it was very difficult; it is not so difficult now because things have changed.  But it was very difficult at one period when people could produce a list of ten or 11 vacant houses in a particular area and tell one at the same time that they did not know where they were on the corporation housing list; all they knew was that these houses were vacant.  One could not blame them for feeling sore and annoyed when they were told, as I had to tell them, that they must wait their turn.  Houses in the area were vacant for months on end.</P>
    <P>The system was at fault.  When Dublin Corporation took over the key of a house they did not immediately make that house available to the next person on the list.  This encouraged people to squat because Dublin Corporation would not tell them where they were on the list and what their chances were.  There was despondency and despair.  The whole thing was futile.  The people asked themselves what was the use of waiting on a list when there were empty houses.  This is what prompted people to squat.  They <Col N="2635" /> decided there was no list and they jumped the gun.  I suggested the answer to the problem to Dublin Corporation. Immediately a house became available I said it should be allotted to the next person on the list; any repairs that needed to be done could be done while the tenant was in occupation. This was dramatic in its effect. Squatting dropped to negligible proportions. In fact, those who are squatting at the moment are people who were there before ever this prompt action was taken by Dublin Corporation. Squatting is no longer a problem in Dublin city.  The people are now satisfied.  When a house becomes vacant someone else gets it and the temptation to squat is no longer there. What would be the purpose in squatting? If this Bill is an anti-squatting Bill it is no longer relevant and we question its purpose at this point of time.</P>

      <P>It is, I think, pertinent to explain the purpose of section 4.  As far as squatting is concerned, there is no longer any purpose to this Bill.  We wonder then is it really directed against squatters or is it directed against the good people who have demonstrated that they have a social conscience.  I have met them in the Housing Action Group.  They are good people with a sense of social purpose.  They like to help their fellowmen. I do not see anything subversive in that.  I know people here who have a social conscience; I would not like to think they are subversive.  If this is the way to stop protests it is a very bad approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is not directed at squatters. It has lost its purpose.  As I said, I am sure the Minister is sympathetic to squatters and I am sure it is certainly <Col N="2636" /> not his intention to get at these poor people.  I was interested in an editorial in the <i>Irish Times</i>.  It was about the group, probably the same group, which encourages fish-ins.  It is the <i>Irish Times</i> of Thursday, 22nd July:</P>
    <P>It is in the light of this that one looks at Section 4 of the Forcible Entry Bill, pointed to by Opposition Deputies and by newspapers as being pernicious.  For if newspapers are in danger of being dragged into the courts for &ldquo;encouraging&rdquo; (a very elastic word), the Bill may in fact be prohibiting discussion of the basic social issues.</P>
    <P>To take just one example.  One does not have to agree with the Sinn Féin &ldquo;fish-ins&rdquo; to realise that we are at the transition stage on the question of inland fisheries.  Not everyone who has fishing rights in this country is a robber or a descendant of robbers.  Some comparatively modest people enjoy a stretch of river or a lake or pond, and like to breed and stock trout.  But there is a strong case&mdash;and a Government commission is now sitting&mdash;for turning over all these resources to a body such as the present Inland Fisheries Trust.</P>
    <P>If Sinn Féin groups continue to protest with fish-ins, we may be sure that any newspaper taking up the argument in favour of revision of the laws on fishery, as they now stand, could easily be accused of encouraging these fish-ins.</P>
    <P>The group is protesting against the fact that the ordinary people have no right to fish and no right to their own natural resources.  A Government commission is sitting at the moment because there is a strong case and we wonder then why this legislation should be directed against those who encourage fish-ins. The fact is the commission may come to the same conclusion and, if it does, the whole thing is hay-wire.  Yet, here we are talking about putting these people in prison because they object to people being deprived of the right to fish in their own country.  I think we would be crazy if we did not protest. The purpose behind the commission is obviously to find out if there is anything <Col N="2637" /> that can be done about this.  The commission was set up no doubt in response to public opinion and in response to pressure to have these lakes and rivers handed back to the people.</P>
    <P>The Sinn Féin group is perhaps merely anticipating the findings of the commission.  It is not democracy if we put these people in prison.  Will the members of the commission be also put in prison if they come up with the same conclusion that the Sinn Féin group has reached?  This is not so far-fetched as people might think.  We are talking about something which is happening. I would emigrate rather than stay in a country in which I could not voice my opinions or protest.  I am serious when I say this.  If I saw us moving along the road to totalitarianism I would not like to go on living in this country.  But that is the road along which we will be moving if this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about attempts to muzzle the Press.  I honestly believe these attempts are being made. I have observed Fianna Fáil in office down the years and they always need a very powerful opposition to protect the interests of the people.  They have not liked the attitude of the Press which has been critical of Fianna Fáil in the past year, very critical, but what Fianna Fáil do not know is that the Press was fully justified in being critical because we have never before seen anything like what happened in the present Government in the past year. One ambassador here said to me: &ldquo;In no other country in Europe would the Government remain in power after what happened here last year.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach has had the audacity to hold on to power in the face of just criticism from the Press that he did not have a mandate from the people.  The Government which wanted power for power's sake have attempted in the past year to hold on to office when the honourable thing to do would have been to resign and put the matter to the people.  We have never before seen anything like what happened in the past year.  We have seen top Ministers in the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appreciates that we cannot <Col N="2638" /> discuss the affairs of the past year on this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I just wanted to mention it in relation to a point on which I shall elaborate.  The Government and the Taoiseach have turned a deaf ear to public opinion because unfortunately their views are as expressed by that French king, <i>L'etât c'est moi</i>; the State is I; the State is the Government and the nation is the Government and if you are not with us you do not belong here.  This is the view propounded by the present Government.  They feel they have a divine right to rule.  Perhaps we are not sufficiently aware of this because we actually think Government is synonymous with Fianna Fáil, and they now think they are so well entrenched that nobody could ever take their place.  It would be very unhealthy for the country if we were to permit them to remain in power but they will remain in power if they can muzzle the Press.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach felt the party were declining in favour, losing support&mdash; and that has become obvious in the past year in events which were unprecedented in our history.  The party see themselves losing popularity and the best way of exposing the loss of popularity is through the Press because the Press, and this is very important, is the voice of the public.  We should not forget this: what the Press expresses is what the public feel.  If the public feel that Fianna Fáil are not the proper Government the Press will express that feeling and that expression is most dangerous to the party in power. Naturally, a party wanting to hold on to power would attack the organs expressing in printed words the views and feelings of the people.  The party feel that if they can hold on to power, one would not know what might happen; the tide might turn.  They must prevent the Press from criticising them. That is vital to their interests which unfortunately they think are the interests of the State because they believe the party are synonymous with the State.  That, unfortunately, is the feeling of the Taoiseach and his Ministers, that they have a divine right to rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2639" /> I think they look upon the Press as the irreconcilable enemy of the party. The <i>Irish Press</i> has discarded its cloak of loyalty to the Fianna Fáil Party; it is now standing on its own feet and representing the views of the people and it is critical of the Government. Now the Government can take action against all the Press and not just confine their attentions to one or two.  This is why the Government are attempting to muzzle the Press.  This is why they are going to put pressure on them and they are letting that be known.  The Minister for Justice has said that there is nothing new in this measure against the Press.  I think I should quote this. It is taken from Volume 254, column 230 of the Official Report of 26th May, 1971 and reads:</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Malley : There is the horrified suggestion that newspapers, for example, might well find themselves in difficulty with the law under this section if they were to advocate the commission of a criminal offence. There is the implication in this horrified suggestion that this is something new, but it most certainly is not new.  Newspapers are not any more immune from the law of the land than any other individual or company in the country and if a newspaper at the present moment sees fit to write editorials or articles advocating crime of one form or another, they are guilty of an offence. They can be guilty of incitement or of participating in crime as principals in the second degree or accessories before the fact, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The Minister says it is already embodied in legislation :</P>
    <P>I can only say it in my own weak way with my own weak voice in this House and hope that those Deputies and members of the public who are prepared to look at things honestly and objectively will in fact examine the Bill honestly and objectively.</P>
    <P>He goes on further to say that in effect, this section is a contraction of the existing law but spells out the matter clearly in black and white so that nobody who wishes to encourage or advocate <Col N="2640" /> offences under this Bill need be in any doubt whatsoever as to whether or not he is committing an offence.  If this is not a direct warning to the Press I must not be capable of drawing a logical conclusion.  It is obvious to me that this is a threat to the Press telling them of something already there which is now being reinforced by the present legislation. This is an attempt by the Government to stifle public opinion through the Press.  It will prevent comment by the Press on social evils and Press criticism of the Government. This Government who are now falling into disfavour, who do not now represent the people, must hold on to power by every means at their disposal.  I dare say that when the Taoiseach was considering this matter the question of how to curb the Press was foremost on his list.  The <i>Irish Press</i> itself is now not among the Government's strongest allies and already the threat has been issued in no uncertain terms to the proprietor of the <i>Irish Press</i>, Deputy Vivion de Valera, by the Minister for Justice.  It is obvious now that the freedom of the Press is being assailed and threatened by this Government and because of that the liberties of the citizens are in danger.  Freedom of the Press is the prerogative of writing and publishing what people feel and think and the use of that prerogative is as proper as it is to think and to feel.  The Press is a great danger to the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>People have to realise that it is important that we should have a free Press.  I do not think we should talk about currying favour with the Press. Such talk is abnoxious.  We are not here to worry about that.  We are concerned to see that there is a free Press and I as a citizen would want a free Press.  People who have not realised the importance of a free Press have paid very dearly for their incomprehension and indifference.  The newspaper is the instrument <i>par excellence</i> for the peaceful resolution of political and social problems.  At present the power of the Press may be diminishing because of the power of radio and television.  Because radio and television are in the hands of the Government, in the hands <Col N="2641" /> of the Fianna Fáil Government who are determined to hold on to power so that we in our lifetime, if they have their way, may never see a change of Government, the situation is dangerous.  This is all the more reason why the Press must be free.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the statement on television in October, 1966 of the official advice of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to farmers, which was followed immediately by critical comment from the National Farmers' Association.  The Minister complained directly to the RTE newsroom and the NFA statement was omitted from later bulletins.  There were question raised in the Dáil.  The Minister and the Government were attacked.  The late Mr. Seán Lemass was then Taoiseach.  It is interesting to note what he said about this.  In reply to a Parliamentary question on 12th October, 1966, the late Mr. Lemass said:</P>
    <P>Radio Telefís Éireann was set up by legislation as an instrument of public policy and as such is responsible to the Government.  The Government have overall responsibility for its conduct and especially the obligation to ensure that its programmes do not offend against the public interest or conflict with national policy as defined in legislation.</P>
    <P>To this extent the Government reject the view that Radio Telefís Éireann should be, either generally or in regard to its current affairs and news programmes, completely independent of Government supervision ... it has the duty, while maintaining impartiality between political parties, to ... sustain public respect for the institutions of Government and, where appropriate, to assist public understanding of the policies enshrined in legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.  The Government will take such action ... as may be necessary to ensure that Radio Telefís Éireann does not deviate from the due performance of this duty.</P>
    <P>I think I should quote what the comment <Col N="2642" /> was after this.  Senator John Kelly says:</P>
    <P>No one would disagree that radio and television should not offend against the public interest but the latter is not synonymous with the immunity of Government policy from criticism and the only right which the Constitution, in Article 46 (1), gave to the State in connection with controlling the radio, which must be taken to include television, is the right to ensure that it is not used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.  While the same passage of the Constitution expressly accords to the radio as part of its rightful liberty of expression the right to criticise Government policy, it is scarcely the law that once Government policy becomes defined, or enshrined, as the former Taoiseach said, in legislation, the right to criticise it stops.</P>
    <P>He says it is scarcely the law for this to happen.  He goes on to say :</P>
    <P>In any case the television station in this instance had transmitted criticism, not of legislation, but of ministerial advice.</P>
    <P>Now, finally, Mr. Lemass's description of RTE as an instrument of public policy does not coincide by a long way with the Constitution's description of radio as an organ of public opinion.  It may be added that section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, empowers the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to direct the authority to refrain from broadcasting a certain item but this direction must be given in writing, the result of which is, of course, that the ministerial direction remains on record.</P>
    <P>What he said here is, and it has been shown, that there was an attempt made, and the attempt was successful, by a Minister to interfere with RTE. This is exactly what happened because when the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries protested at the statement by the NFA criticising the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It may be said that anyone can do that; yes, anyone can lift the phone and protest to Telefís Éireann, but we wonder what importance would be placed on the opinion of someone who said he did not like something.  That certainly is far removed from the instance of a Minister phoning RTE and telling them he does not like something.  This would show that radio and television are not free in this country.  They have not the freedom that newspapers have, and that we would want the newspapers to have, because newspapers are not under the control of the Government as yet.</P>

      <P>I agree but I thought I might mention it as showing that this is all the more reason why we should have freedom of the Press and that we should resist any attempt by the Government to muzzle them in any way.  This is all the more important because television and radio are not free. There is an attempt being made to muzzle the Press, to impose restrictions on them, so that they will not be permitted to comment on matters of social importance.  I could imagine an editor who might be in a quandary because he might feel sufficiently aroused to write an article on a particular social problem.  I discussed a particular <Col N="2644" /> matter with an editor of a newspaper some time ago and he was sufficiently aroused to write an editorial on it.  It was a very good article exposing an injustice and calling on the Minister to do something about it.</P>

I have listened to the debate, I have read what the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary, and other Deputies have said and I am really surprised that I should not be permitted to discuss freedom of the Press. I am saying that an editor of a newspaper who wrote an editorial exposing an injustice and asking that action be taken under this present section would go to prison because he said that the action taken by a group was justifiable. Would I not be within my rights in discussing this?  It will be important, if this amendment is not accepted, for an editor to sit back and think twice before he decides to write an editorial on a matter of public importance where he feels that the action taken by a protest group is justified.</P>

I do not say that it goes anywhere near what we would <Col N="2645" /> like, which is to delete this section completely.  I would like to have an audience of Government members because my position in speaking on this amendment is to try to convince them.</P>

      <P>I hope the Deputy will remain so that he will give serious consideration to points I raise.  I hope I will not see a general exodus again because I believe, despite what some of the Deputies have said, that there are some men in the Fianna Fáil Party who do not agree with this Bill.  It was interesting to hear one of the Deputies say the other day: &ldquo;What is all this about?  We have 74, we have a majority.&rdquo;  It is shameful to think that they would just say: &ldquo;We are a machine.  We have 74, you can do anything you like and we will win.&rdquo;  That is not right.  I hope the Opposition will take a stand, try to point out to the Government the wrong in what they are doing and perhaps the Government <Col N="2646" /> might be influenced by what we have to say.  I would hope the Government would be interested in what we have to say.  We are not here to chalk up columns in the newspapers.

He asked me what it was about and then he asked. &ldquo;Which way?&rdquo; He did not know what the division was about.  They walk like sheep through the division lobby.

      <P>Our delaying the business of the Dáil is not important. We are here to try to persuade the Government that this section is pernicious and we hope in some way to amend it and I do not think we should be upset or influenced by statements made about holding up holidays for people.  We should be permitted at all costs to make it clear to members of the Government that what is being bulldozed through the House will have lasting effects&mdash;long after the Minister for Justice, the Parliamentary Secretary now here, and the Taoiseach have gone, this Bill will be on the Statute Book.  Anything we can do now to stop that is important.  Even if it means getting extra staff, I do not think we should go away.  We should not go away until the end of October.  I think we should close down for one month&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is relevant because there were statements in the newspapers about us holding up and stopping the vacation of the House. From the time I came in here I felt we should work proper hours and proper days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid the Government are refusing to listen to reason on this matter, that they are guided by the number they can muster through the division <Col N="2648" /> lobby to get the Bill through.  I fail to see why it is so important that it cannot be left over.  Do they want to put people in prison before the Dáil resumes in October?  Is it so important for this country that the Bill is put through before the summer recess? There are many more important issues that need to be brought in here, aired and passed through the House.</P>
    <P>I do not think section 4 should be rushed because it is too serious in its implications and its consequences.  We have seen what happened to other Bills which were bulldozed through the House.  I heard Deputy Colley, the Minister for Finance, say last week that a Bill he was pushing through the Seanad&mdash;it had been passed through here&mdash;would be, he knew, challenged as unconstitutional.  He knew that a Bill which he was pushing through the Seanad was unconstitutional.  That Bill has been passed through this House and the Seanad and the Minister for Finance permitted it.</P>
    <P>I know this Bill is unconstitutional. They know it is unconstitutional.  Why then are we in such a hurry to push it through?  It is repugnant to the Constitution and they are wasting the time of the House trying to defend it.  We on this side are trying to make the Government see that it is wrong.  If it goes through as it is, it will be challenged and I will be one of the first to challenge it in the courts.  Time and again the Government have pushed through Bills which were later declared to be repugnant to the Constitution.  I had hoped the Taoiseach might sit back and become wise enough to talk to the Minister for Justice about it and tell him there is no good purpose in bulldozing this.  Of course, they have reached the stage of no return.  They have crossed the bridge and have burned it behind them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, the Deputies at the party meeting may express their opinions on this matter and that we might accordingly get a change of heart.  I recall urging the Minister for Finance to withdraw the Prices and <Col N="2649" /> Incomes Bill.  I knew his pride alone would not permit him to do so but he came under pressure from the Congress of Trade Unions and he withdrew it. We should not in this House sneer at or ridicule a Minister for withdrawing a Bill.  Indeed, it is a great tribute to him that he should say: &ldquo;We have seen the folly of something we have done.&rdquo;  We would have nothing but admiration for such action and I would be the first to stand up and express that admiration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with that.  Indeed, it would be a matter for congratulation.  I said to the Minister for Finance last year that he would be a big man if he said in regard to the Prices and Incomes Bill: &ldquo;I am withdrawing this and we will reconsider it in the autumn.&rdquo;  Nobody in the House would sneer at the Minister for Justice if he were to take similar action.  I still hope he will withdraw it.  He said last week if we would agree to allow this to go through he would agree to amendment No. 9.  He should go that little bit further.  He has obviously had second thoughts on it.  He has made a promise to the Taoiseach he would get it through.  Anyone would say that; we all mean well.  I do not think he quite realised that this section was so dangerous.  He has tried to amend it himself on Committee Stage.  It still does not meet what we want.  Deputy Cooney, very rightly, brought in an amendment which certainly does not go far enough but it is the best amendment that could have been put forward. Faced as he was with this section he could do nothing else.  It is far from perfect, and the Minister tried to show up its imperfections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is right to show up the imperfections of it; it is the best that Deputy Cooney or anyone else could have done with this section.  He was quick enough and wise enough to bring in some amendment that would make this less dangerous, and I congratulate him on putting it forward.  It is not right for the Minister for Justice to ridicule him over the amendment. The Ministr for Justice should be <Col N="2650" /> saying: &ldquo;We will leave it alone.  We will come back in the autumn having put some more brains on the job.&rdquo; Would that not be better when we see the organisation against which this legislation is directed is not in existence any more, is not an organisation of any great consequence?</P>
    <P>It would be intolerable if we were to bring in a Bill against everyone we disliked.  We all have our own likes and dislikes, people and organisations we do not like.  You, a Chathaoirleach, could name organisations you do not like and I would defend everyone's right not to like them but you would not be petty enough to bring in a Bill against such an organisation.  I have certain views on organisations but imagine me bringing in a Bill against such organisations because of that. Would it not be a chaotic and farcical state of affairs if we were to do this? I am not presuming that the Minister is doing this, but the Minister has made it clear that he is bringing in this against an organisation that he does not like, the villains of the piece, as he calls them.  As I said, I hope he is not including Deputy Michael Moran as a villain because he encouraged squatting. It seems to me that he is.</P>
    <P>I do not think these people are villains.  If the Minister were to meet them he would see that they have good intentions.  People who protest have a very useful purpose in life.  Protests are a safety valve for pent-up feelings.  The people who protest against the housing situation&mdash;are they villains?  The people who protest against anti-trade union labour&mdash;are they villains?  The civil rights movement people in the north&mdash; are they villains?  No.  The people who started the civil rights movements in the north set up a chain reaction that has brought reform and promise of more reform in the north.  People might say it would be better if things had been left alone, if there were no civil rights movement, no people to show up the injustices that existed there.  We could have left things alone, not lifted up the stone and revealed the maggots and the worms.  People could say: why not let the Unionists remain in power in the north and continue to deprive the minority of their rights?  Why not leave <Col N="2651" /> well enough alone?  How often have we heard that?</P>
    <P>If there had been more protests prior to 1939 we would not have had the 1939-1945 war.  Unfortunately, there were no protests then.  Funnily enough, I read a book on Parliament and the Press.  The Press in Britain were critical of Hitler at that time and protested that it was not right for Britain to placate this man.  The Press was criticised by Chamberlain for this. He called them together and said they had no right to upset Hitler.  Chamberlain said Hitler went into a frenzy because the Press in Britain were against him and told the newspapers not to criticise him.  This was the Prime Minister of a country in which the Press was free, whereas it was not in Germany.  Had they protested a little more we might not have seen the holocaust of the last war.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the civil rights movement in the north move south what will happen.  I daresay if they do we will put them in jail under this section. We are praising the civil rights movement up north and praising the attempts being made to secure reform, so that people, regardless of their religion may be granted full rights.  We hear the Taoiseach praising them and calling for reforms in the north.  I have no hesitation in saying that the Taoiseach is a hypocrite because he has gone back on every single thing he has said.  He talks about what we want for the north, and still he is depriving us of rights here which we are saying the people in the north do not have.</P>
    <P>I am not talking about the Minister for Justice.  I am talking about the man in authority there.  I would have thought the Taoiseach might occupy the time of the House in putting through legislation which would secure more rights for the minority here.  I do not think he should be pressurised by sectional interests.  I would have thought he would be big enough, courageous enough, to come into this House with the necessary legislation. We have seen the hypocrisy of this man, the hypocrisy that is so evident in his refusal to bring in Bills that <Col N="2652" /> would grant equal rights to minorities in this country.  Then he is complaining about the lack of these rights in the North.  I would have thought that we should occupy the hours of this House with constructive legislation and that the legislation which is brought before the House should be legislation for all the people and not just for the people of the 26 Countries.  That is the way the Taoiseach is acting at present. There are many things wrong with the 26 Countries.  Many rights are denied to people.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the people having these rights and I would like to see the Taoiseach take the initiative in bringing in legislation about contraception, giving the people the right to it.  We cannot talk about the people in the north not having rights when we do not have them although the people want them.  The Taoiseach spoke about this being a matter of personal conscience but he has not the courage to come in here with a Bill granting these rights.  I have lost respect for the Taoiseach because he has been a hypocrite in talking about grasping the nettle.  He does not mean anything he says.  There is no honesty about the situation.  There is instant Government, acting from day to day.  They have no policy and no plan.  What the Taoiseach said in his speech at the Garden of Remembrance was in complete contradiction to what he said previously. The Government do not know how to govern.  They are attacked by members within their own party and they spend their time looking over their shoulders. As a result there is no useful legislative work being done.  The Government should bring in constructive legislation which would serve the people.  We must legislate to protect the weaker sections of the community.  I see Deputy J. O'Leary, for whom I have the greatest respect.  I hope that he may consider the aspects of this Bill which are inimical, pernicious and dangerous.</P>

      <P>The Deputy reacted violently to what I said.  I hope that some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies will discuss this matter and that Deputy J. O'Leary will tell them that perhaps they might be able to stop this section being put to a vote.  This is a very serious matter.  It is not enough to talk about the Government majority or to have Deputy Andrews rushing around to ensure a sufficient number of Deputies have been mustered to beat the Opposition.  We cannot jibe or jeer about this.  This is one of the most serious things that has happened in this Dáil since 1969, and since the situation that confronted the Fianna Fáil Party last year.</P>
      <P>We have seen attempts before, in the Criminal Justice Bill, to do unpopular things.  We have seen Bills rushed through this House.  The Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis rejected the Criminal Justice Bill in no uncertain terms.  It is a pity there is not a Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis shortly at which Fianna Fáil Deputies could express their views to the Government and tell them that this Bill is anti-democratic and that it should be withdrawn.  I am not surprised that the Government have brought in this Bill.  They have bordered on the verge of totalitarianism before.  The <i>Irish Times</i> editorial of 22nd July said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record of bad Bills from Fianna Fáil is considerable.  This time they may have the same experience as they did over the Marts Bill, another <Col N="2654" /> measure conceived in a mood of vengeance.  The late Seán Lemass once said that Fianna Fáil was a &ldquo;slightly constitutional party&rdquo;.  This may have been said in a moment of jocosity.  The phrase is relevant today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most pernicious section of the Bill.  The <i>Irish Times</i> said the late Seán Lemass's phrase was relevant today.  A good competent Government could accept an amendment on this section.  A divided Government cannot.  This is the time for Deputy John O'Leary to talk to his colleagues and to say that what they are doing is wrong.  Maybe we should defer this discussion until the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Press all over the country have made it clear to this Government in no uncertain terms in editorials that this section of the Bill is wrong.  It is an attempt to muzzle the freedom of the Press.  I cannot understand how a Government would persist in the face of this opposition from the national and provincial Press.  The Minister has heard Deputies say that the Press was not mentioned, but the Minister has mentioned the newspapers.  If they are not involved, why are we discussing this section?  We are not discussing this with a view to currying favour.  In the Labour Party we never gain from the Press.  The Press have never been our real allies.  It does not matter whose allies they are.  I would like to see a Press with freedom to criticise.  It has been made clear to the Minister that the Bill is inimical.  I cannot understand a Government pursuing this Bill in the face of this opposition from the national and provincial Press.  I can only think that the Government have closed their ears and eyes because they are so torn themselves.  There is strife amongst them which is so bad that they have not had time to pay attention to the voice of the Press, which is the voice of the people.  I would hope, if I were in a Government who were bringing in this Bill that we would <Col N="2655" /> have consultations with the Press.  I would say to them.  &ldquo;If you feel this is an attempt to curb your freedom in any way let us see what can be done to amend it&rdquo;.  There is nothing wrong in consulting with the Press.  I would hope this could be done in order to ensure freedom of the Press.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Government have ignored the demands which have been made.  Editorials in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> have stated they were not interested in what the Opposition had to say, they themselves felt this Bill was wrong.  The only explanation I can think of is that the Government are embroiled in their own problems and because the monolithic structure around them is collapsing and crumbling they are trying to do everything they can to prevent this.  The Government are acting in a disorganised way and this indicates to me that they are in disarray; they are clutching at any straw in order to remain in power.  If this were a proper democratic Government they would listen to the people.  We do not know exactly what is happening; we hear rumblings and rumours but I feel the Government are embroiled in a bitter struggle at the present time.  The Taoiseach must be having terrible trouble. He is trying to hold on at all costs and consequently he has not paid any attention to this Bill.  This is the only reason I can give for the intransigent attitude of the Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach at present.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is passed we are on the way to a totalitarian State.  I should like to see a list of all the legislation the Government intend bringing in during their term of office; we have seen some of it already, but unfortunately not enough people pay attention to what is happening in Parliament. The Minister said that the Press would be restricted no more than they are at present, but one point which the Minister has not clarified, although the Press have, is that &ldquo;encourage or advocate&rdquo; could occur without intention by means of photographs.  Deputy Keating rightly said that people can be influenced and roused by photographs in a newspaper.  How often do <Col N="2656" /> we see photographs of people being beaten up?  I was very aroused when I saw photographs of events in the North and I dare say many other people were as well.  This is where newspapers could be in trouble.  The Press realise that difficulties could arise here and they have made their views known to the Taoiseach and the Government, but they have refused to listen.</P>
    <P>It will be a sorry day for Ireland when this Bill goes through.  It is dreadful to know that there are men at the helm of this Government who are determined to bulldoze this Bill through.  With the limited resources available to us we will try everything to stop them.  We are not filibustering we are saying what we feel about it. We were put here by the people to ensure that legislation which comes before the House is not repressive and we would like to see constructive legislation before the House.  I would hope that the dissidents who have already told the Taoiseach that they think what he is doing is wrong will show by their votes that they object to it.  Unfortunately, I wonder if the dissidents are really in favour of a democratic State.</P>
    <P>In May of last year when the dissident Ministers were sacked we Deputies did not know whether or not the Dáil would be taken over.  I thought we were on the verge of a <i>coup</i> at that time because there were rumours that the dissidents were going to take over the State.  It might be said that the actions of these dissidents was subversive and perhaps this Bill is intended against them.  No matter what the intention of the Minister is, he will not be in office for ever, the courts may decide otherwise and they will read into the Bill what is there.  It is all very well for the Minister to say that the courts would not treat it like that but it is what is written into the Bill that matters.  Everyone who is brought to court cannot bring the Minister for Justice with him to say, &ldquo;I did not mean what was there, you have taken it up wrongly&rdquo;.  The judge will read what is in that section but not what the Minister thinks.  The Minister may have the best intentions in the world but that is not important. <Col N="2657" /> When the Bill becomes law the Minister will have no control over it at all.</P>
    <P>Our Leader said last night that if we come to power whether in a coalition or otherwise we will repeal the whole Bill.  I would hope we would win Fine Gael then to our way of thinking.  We believe we have already won them over to our way of thinking because they now know this Bill is not as simple as they initially thought. There are men in that party who did a little thinking for themselves and decided they would not follow the leader as sheep do.  They looked at this Bill and said: &ldquo;No, this is a fascist Bill&rdquo;.  I admire men who think for themselves and then persuade the party that something is not right.  These are the people I would rely on to ensure that this fascist Bill would be repealed if and when the country has a chance to choose an alternative Government.</P>
    <P>I would hope that Deputy John O'Leary and his colleagues might even talk to the Taoiseach.  They are in a position to go to him and say: &ldquo;You may be right but would you reconsider the Bill to ensure that we are not trying to curtail the freedom of anyone&rdquo;. It is important that freedom is maintained. It is something that should be cherished.  Too often people are deprived of freedom.  Therefore, I ask the Fianna Fáil Deputies to approach the Taoiseach as I have suggested. They must realise that there is something wrong and that the newspapers, the people of the country generally and the Opposition cannot all be wrong. The Government will not lose face by deferring the Bill until the autumn. Rather, they will win the admiration of everyone by so doing. I have no doubt that the newspapers would respond to this by expressing their admiration. This is not a matter of any great urgency and there is no national emergency at present that necessitates acting in such haste; there is no attempt by anybody to take over the functions of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>When people tell me that they are about to make a vital decision I always advise them to think about it for a while and more often than not it <Col N="2658" /> proves beneficial to them to have second thoughts.  If the Fianna Fáil Deputies will do as I ask, I will have served a useful purpose in speaking on the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe section 4, subsection (1) to be vital to this Bill.  If this subsection were deleted or amended in the manner suggested by the Opposition, the whole purpose of the Bill would be defeated.  The subsection states that:</P>
      <P>A person who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence under section 2 or 3 of this Act shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>I cannot see any reason why any person should be exempted from the terms of this subsection because, if we were to exempt one person or one organisation, we would have to exempt others and, thereby, the purpose of the Bill would be defeated.  I am convinced that the Government inserted this subsection not because of any dislike for the Press&mdash;I would say that the reverse is the case&mdash;but in order to ensure that any person who encourages or advocates the commission of a crime would be brought within the scope of the law. That is reasonable legislation.</P>
      <P>I am amazed by the use of the word &ldquo;verbally&rdquo; in the amendment.  We all know that it is practically impossible in certain cases to prove that a person advocated or encouraged the commission of an offence.  Even if the word &ldquo;verbally&rdquo; were to be inserted into the subsection, it would detract from the purpose of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Opposition agree, more or less, that a person who stands on a soap box at a street corner and who encourages and advocates the commission of a crime should be brought to justice; but I cannot understand how they can say, at the same time, that a person writing for a newspaper or speaking on radio or television in a manner that encourages people to commit a crime should not be brought to justice.  This has nothing to do with freedom.  It appears that the Opposition are bowing to pressure groups. Certainly, they are not bowing to the Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no intention on the part of <Col N="2659" /> the Government to curb the powers or the freedom of the Press.  In any democratic society it is necessary that there be a free Press but nobody could condone any journalist who would use the medium of Press, radio or television to advocate the commission of an offence even in the course of bringing injustices to public attention.  There are numerous ways of bringing injustices to the notice of the public and the authorities.</P>
    <P>I do not know who is afraid of subsection (1) of section 4 exactly as it is worded.  I cannot see any members of the Press taking offence, neither can I see the journalists attached to radio and television.  By and large these are sensible people interested in our country and in doing their job to the best of their ability.  I cannot see why journalists should be afraid of this subsection. The only thing they may be afraid of, to my mind, is that either in an editorial or an article they will be caught on the wrong foot unintentionally, on a technicality, and prosecuted under this subsection.  I believe that with a little extra care after all the publicity which this subsection has got there is no danger whatever of anything like that happening. The risk is certainly minimal.</P>
    <P>I have heard a number of Deputies say that this Bill is directed against protest.  That is not so.  This Bill is concerned with the prohibition of forcible entry and occupation, with the penalties to be imposed on persons found guilty of such forcible entry and occupation and with persons encouraging and advocating the commission of these offences.  That is what this Bill covers.  It does not cover protest where protest is carried on within the ambit of the law.  There are numerous forms of protest which can be carried on within the ambit of the law.  I have heard numerous Opposition Deputies speak in such a manner that one would think this Bill was directed against protest.  It is about time this was denied in no uncertain fashion.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at the weakness of the Opposition case in support of their amendment when it was necessary for them to refer to the Castlebar case <Col N="2660" /> and to the former Minister for Justice where a man who appeared not to be No. 1 on the housing priority list got a house, but it must be remembered that in this particular town all the other people, and there were only a few, as far as I know, who were higher than that man on the housing list, were re-housed in or around the same town with the able assistance of the former Minister for Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No. However, this is completely irrelevant.  I brought it in in order to refute the allegations made by the previous Opposition speaker.  I believe that the squatter is very often the tool of subversive organisations and of the backroom boys of these organisations, men who would not dare to be publicly associated with squatting and with the activities of the organisations.  These are the real culprits and I believe that if we were to amend in any form whatever subsection (1) of section 4 we would indeed give way to the backroom boys of the subversive organisations to take over entirely.  That is my firm belief.  Some of these people would hate to be publicly associated with some of these organisations but they have planned their campaign for them and they will feed them and keep them going as if the unfortunate people out at the front were mercenaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition party are merely playing up to the Press in a very big way, particularly in relation to the debate on this amendment.  Deputy Oliver Flanagan stated last night that there was a very high standard of journalism in this country.  I agree entirely and I think that the journalists understand quite well the reasons behind section 4 (1) of this Bill and are well able to guard themselves against the implications of any offence under <Col N="2661" /> this section which is very unlikely to occur as far as they are concerned.  I could not see it happening.</P>
    <P>I have heard many Opposition speakers say that this Bill is an effort by the Government to suppress the Press and to suppress the truth.  This is ridiculous.  I had no intention of speaking on this Bill, particularly on Report Stage, but I could not restrain myself from speaking and contradicting some of the wild allegations made by Opposition speakers.  There is no doubt that it could not possibly be inferred from this Bill that there is any intention on the part of the Government, or on the part of Fianna Fáil, to suppress the truth, to suppress the Press, or to suppress protests which are properly organised and come within the ambit of the law, as do the vast majority.  If this amendment is carried it will defeat the whole purpose of the Bill.  It will be impossible for the law to catch up with the backroom boys for whom the unfortunate squatters, in many cases, merely provide a front.</P>
    <P>From the manner in which most of the Opposition speakers have referred to the impact this Bill would have on the Press, one would imagine newsmen and journalists were inciting the public to commit crimes every day of the week and this is the impression that has been created by some of the contributions to this debate.  We believe journalists and newsmen are a capable body of professional people who carry out their duties in a serious manner, who inform the public to the best of their ability and who give first priority to the interests of the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell stated repeatedly that we must have a free Press and that people employed in radio and television must be free.  I agree with the Deputy but I do not agree that these people should be free to break the law.  It is as important to ensure that persons who encourage or advocate the commission of an offence under this Bill should be brought to justice as would any person who advocates or encourages the commission of an offence under any other law.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are pursuing this <Col N="2662" /> amendment at length because they have succumbed to small pressure groups but they will not gain anything from this.  They are putting what they consider a short-term gain before the interests of the country and before the rights of a few hundred people in Dublin who have been deprived of houses granted to them by the corporation because the houses have been taken over by squatters.  It is impossible to determine how many people on the housing list would be deprived of their houses if this Bill had not been introduced, with the probability that it will be put through the Houses of the Oireachtas in its present form.</P>
    <P>Members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party will be failing in their duty to the country if they do not support section 4 (1) in its present form. To my mind, any deviation from the wording of the subsection would defeat the purpose of the Bill.  Even if we excluded radio and television from the section there would be nothing to stop any of the subversive organisations from publishing their own newspaper and circulating it throughout the country, thus inciting the public to commit an offence.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition were in power now the House would have adjourned long ago because they are so committed to the pressure groups that Dáil Éireann would have been taken over by squatters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to hear Deputy O'Leary state that this Bill is being brought in to deal with a few hundred squatters in Dublin and that this should be done.  However, in an earlier part of his speech he defended the previous Minister for Justice who encouraged a woman to take over a house to which she was not entitled. Deputy O'Leary saw nothing wrong with this action and this is a typical example of a person falling into his own trap.  Fianna Fáil have berated Fine Gael and Labour in the past week and stated that our amendment proposed to introduce selective justice.  Deputy O'Leary has defended Deputy Moran's action but he has stated that anyone who encourages a person in Dublin to squat is wrong <Col N="2663" /> and that this Bill is necessary to deal with such people.</P>
      <P>The amendment, which I support, deals with section 4 (1).  This subsection states:</P>
      <P>A person who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence under section 2 or 3 of this Act shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>Section 2 defines the offence of forcible entry and section 3 deals with those people who intend remaining in occupation.</P>
      <P>The amendment in the names of Deputies Cooney and Fitzpatrick seeks:</P>
      <P>after &ldquo;who&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;verbally (otherwise than on radio or television)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Many of the Fianna Fáil speakers whom I have heard in the past days threw down the challenge that there was no mention of the Press or radio or television in this section.  It is because they are not specifically mentioned and, therefore, not specifically protected that this amendment is introduced. It is because of that we hope to carry this amendment.  I suppose hoping to carry it is really wishful thinking.  Obviously, we have very little chance of carrying it so long as the 74 or 75 Fianna Fáil Deputies are prepared to vote against it.</P>
      <P>There has been a good deal of talk about Fine Gael and Labour wasting time by their support of this amendment, thereby depriving Deputies and staff of their holidays.  Deputy O'Connell said this morning that his motive is that he hopes to persuade some members of the Fianna Fáil Party, who will, in turn, persuade the Taoiseach that this is what he termed &ldquo;oppressive legislation&rdquo; and that the Minister will be advised to accept the amendment.  I have no such hope.  I see no possibility at all of persuading any member of the Fianna Fáil back benchers that this legislation is unnecessary or that this section should be amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also been accused of currying favour with the Press by our defence of this amendment and our objection to section 4.  I do not agree that currying favour was the intention <Col N="2664" /> but, if it were the intention, then that was done two months ago when the Bill was debated on Second Stage.  What I hope to do now is to bring to the attention of the public and to the more enlightened members of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;there are many thousands of them throughout the country&mdash;that this Bill, if passed, could in the long term be detrimental to the interests of the Fianna Fáil Party and certainly detrimental to the interests of the country. I hope that Fianna Fáil Deputies, seeing us standing up here and taking up the time of the House for so long opposing this Bill, will take the trouble of really looking into it to see what the long-term effects could be and how dangerous they could be and, having done that, I hope they will form a pressure group which will succeed in prevailing on the Minister to either drop the section or accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney said yesterday that he thought this was the most important matter we had to deal with in the past 12 months and he was encouraged in that view by Deputy Cunningham, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government.  I regard Deputy Tunney as one of the better members of the Fianna Fáil Party and I really wondered at the time could he possibly believe what he was saying. During the past 15 months this country has been going through a very traumatic experience.  The economy is in a dangerous condition.  Houses are in short supply all over the country.  EEC membership is staring us in the face. According to Deputy Tunney last night, all these things are less important than dealing with a handful of people.  Outside of the city of Dublin I do not think there is any large-scale forcible entry.  The Minister said that forcible entry and occupation was widespread throughout the country in the past two or three years.  There is no widespread forcible entry and there is, therefore, no necessity for this Bill.</P>
    <P>Forcible entry is largely confined to the city of Dublin.  It may be of some concern in Deputy Tunney's constituency, but there is no large-scale incidence of forcible entry anywhere in the country.  One or two people may <Col N="2665" /> from time to time have taken possession of premises, but the incidents were isolated.  They were by no means widespread.  One woman told me in the past month that she had been advised to occupy a vacant corporation house. I suppose the situation in Cork is similar to the situation in other areas. There are so many applicants for houses one might as well throw the applications up in the air and the first one down would be as much entitled to a house as any of the other 19 or 20 people.</P>
    <P>This woman was advised, as I say, to occupy this vacant house.  I told her she would do herself harm from the point of view of her place on the housing list and she would not be housed as quickly as she would otherwise be had she remained in her place in the queue.  She went to the tenants' organisation and I am very pleased to say they gave her exactly the same advice. I am also pleased to say she rejected the advice given her in the first instance to occupy the house.  She will be housed within the next two months. While this Bill would have got her out had she taken forcible possession, it would not have got at the people who encouraged her to break the law. She refused to name them to me&mdash;I know who they are&mdash;and I do not think she would name them for anybody else.  They would not be caught under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that the words &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; and &ldquo;advocate&rdquo; have precisely the same meaning as &ldquo;incite&rdquo;.  He said that in reply to a point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick. There is already legislation to deal with people who incite others to commit a crime.  I looked up the <i>Concise Oxford Dictionary</i> and I see that incite means to urge or stir up; encourage means to incite, help, advise a person to do something; advocate means, and this is the one the Minister would use, I believe, if he wanted to get at the Press, to plead for or to recommend. I do not know about legal definitions of these words.  I understand there is a legal definition of incite but not of encourage or advocate.  It seems to me that encourage and incite could have the same meaning, but advocate has a different meaning and could be <Col N="2666" /> used in a different way.  Advocate means to plead for, defend or recommend. If a newspaper editor in an editorial defended somebody who had broken the law, or had forcibly entered a premises, even though the editor's motives were good, his very action would render him liable to prosecution under this Bill.</P>
    <P>This is what concerns people on this side of the House, that the traditional freedom of the Press to criticise Government actions and legislation now seems to be threatened. Unfortunately, this is in character with the Party introducing this legislation; they have always had a tendency not to accept advice or criticism or, indeed, the wishes of the people. Very early in their history one of their leaders said that the people had no right to do wrong.  When I hear Deputy O'Leary saying that we are a democratic society and we must have a free Press, I wonder how deep-rooted is their belief in democracy.  I know that this section of the Bill, if passed, would help further to dilute what little democracy has rubbed off on them after 40 years in this House.</P>
    <P>The reluctance with which they accept any form of criticism was shown a few years ago before I came here when one of the farming journals, <i>Farmers' Journal</i>, criticised the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries for&mdash;I think&mdash;the Marts Bill&mdash;I am not sure of that.  He promptly withdrew advertising from that organ for two years; they may be still not carrying Government advertising in that journal because they had the temerity to disagree with something the Minister was doing.  If this legislation were enacted, the Government could still advertise in the journal because they would have a far easier way of getting at the editor and contributors to the journal than by merely withdrawing advertising.</P>
    <P>A little paper with which in my private life I have some connection, the <i>RGDATA Review</i> came out last week and criticised the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lemass, in very strong language because he opened a premises for a stamp trading firm.  For a number of <Col N="2667" /> years the <i>RGDATA Review</i> has been advocating legislation to abolish dealing in trading stamps.  So far, they have failed and their criticism of Deputy Lemass was certainly not gentle.  If this section of the Bill goes through, the journal could be wiped out immediately for criticising a member of the Government. This is the Papa Doc mentality of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They have been accused of being fascists, perhaps, fascists of the type we saw in the 30s in Europe who wanted repressive legislation to build up their own countries in a certain way until it became dictation.  They are more to be admired than the Papa Doc type, who every time they hear criticism introduce legislation to knock on the head some unfortunate small group of people who do not agree with them.</P>
    <P>We would all be most reasonable people if we got our own way always. We do not, and we cannot expect the whole country to agree with us all the time.  Criticism is very good for us and the Minister would be very wise to accept this amendment because the Bill, as it stands, opens the gates for prosecution of Press and television personnel.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell and Deputy O'Leary referred earlier to Telefís Éireann and the fact that they were a monopoly and under Government control. I have a good deal of admiration for the journalists in Telefís Éireann because in the almost 10 years since it was founded they have shown some courage in their willingness to criticise members of the Government to which they owe their establishment.  They might be less willing to do that if they thought this section would become law. The fact that Fianna Fáil Deputies said that there is no intention to get at the Press in this measure is not convincing because I think the Minister himself showed very clearly that he does so intend, or at least has the mentality of a man who would use the legislation in that way.  I quote from Vol. 255 of the Official Report of the 13th July when Deputy O'Malley was replying to Deputy de Valera who had raised the matter of prosecution of certain journals that were carrying advertisements for contraceptives.  The Minister for <Col N="2668" /> Justice pointed out that these journals were published in England and they could not be prosecuted.  He then went on and said:</P>
    <P>I have a recollection of reading in recent months, in all the Dublin newspapers, to a greater or lesser extent, numerous articles on the topic which is the subject of our discussion this evening.  In particular, I recall quite a considerable number of articles by a lady who was, I understand, the woman editor of that particular newspaper&mdash;unfortunately, I believe she has left that employment now.  On behalf of a recently formed organisation she consistently and almost daily appeared, to me at any rate, to advocate certain things which might or might not come within the ambit of section 16 (1).  As a result of my attention having been drawn so eloquently and so forcibly to the very strict provisions of this section this evening, I consider the gardaí presumably will have to go through the files of a number of newspapers to see, not whether the advertising columns might potentially offend section 16, but whether the editorial matter might also be in breach of the section.</P>
    <P>That, to my mind, was a clear threat to the proprietors, the editor and journalists of the <i>Irish Press</i>, that they should either behave themselves or pay the price in the courts for continuing to criticise Deputy O'Malley in his handling of the Censorship Act.  I have no doubt that if this amendment is not accepted, the same threats will become realities very shortly afterwards.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the desire of the Minister to get this measure through before the House adjourns.  He will have to face exactly the same battle in the Seanad as he is facing here and he will be lucky to get out of the Seanad by Christmas, never mind by the middle of October.  He would be well advised to accept the amendment and the Fianna Fáil Party would be collectively wise&mdash;I am speaking of the members outside the House as well as inside it&mdash;if they went to the Minister and persuaded him to withdraw the Bill until the autumn which would <Col N="2669" /> leave him more opportunity to consider it in the calmer atmosphere of the summer holidays.  If, by chance, this Bill goes through, I believe that some paper will immediately take the opportunity of testing it in the courts to find out whether it is unconstitutional or not.  If it goes through here before the summer recess&mdash;there are only another two days left in the summer&mdash;and if it becomes law, I believe that before Christmas it will be tested in the Supreme Court to see if it is constitutional.  I have no doubt the finding will be that it is unconstitutional. Therefore, I would recommend that the Minister should accept the amendment and exempt from prosecutions under sections 2 and 3 of the Bill offences committed verbally other than on radio or television.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to reduce the lethal content of the provisions in the original Bill and, like all amendments, can be criticised from the Government side as not leading to a great improvement.  The amendment can be criticised from the Government side as raising anomalies and introducing restrictions on freedom of expression.  Remarks to this effect have been heard from the Government benches.  That does not negative the value of these amendments because the spirit animating the entire opposition to this Bill is a realisation of the consequences which may follow the implementation of the Bill as introduced by the Minister.  There is a mystery surrounding this Bill, why it was thought necessary to introduce it, why these provisions were considered necessary. Over and over in this debate Opposition speakers have referred to the fact that the civil law was quite adequate to deal with any trespassing that occurred, that there was no need to introduce a criminal element even if the problem existed to the extent that the Government believed it did.  Even if the Government were right, and we do not believe that they were, the case is still to be made as to why this conviction on the Government's part of the necessity for introducing a criminal element into the law governing trespass, should also extend to restricting freedom of comment in the Press where this was seen to encourage or <Col N="2670" /> advocate incursions into the civil or criminal law.  The particular clause in section 4 which we seek to amend is probably the most serious incursion of all in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Those who seek to know the reason why this opposition continues into the summer months, instead of being indignant at the kind of opposition shown to this section, should go to the trouble of examining what the Bill proposes to do.  It would be a very rash man, indeed, who would say that this Bill should go through with this provision without the most serious and strenuous opposition in this Parliament. I do not think we could say we have a Parliament if we allowed such a measure to go through without strenuous opposition.  However great may be the desire amongst members of the Government to go on their holidays, more serious matters detain us in this House and they include section 4 of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People apart from the Opposition have spoken about the repercussions this may have on public comment in the Press and on television on its introduction. Speakers in this debate have referred to the delicate relationship between Parliament and Press and we must spell out all the consequences that may follow the introduction of section 4.  The Minister keeps on protesting throughout this debate that, in fact, nothing new is suggested, no change in the law is advocated; it is simply a modernisation of the law. The Minister says the Press are not free now to carry news that may involve them in legal action.  This is true.  Why, therefore, the question may be turned back to the Minister, is it necessary further to curtail the freedom of expression of newspapers? It is true that under the present law on defamation strict laws are laid down controlling the extent of the commentary allowable in any newspaper. These laws continue.  Nobody in the Opposition is suggesting any amendment of the Defamation Act of 1961.  That continues in full force and the force of that Act involves editors of newspapers, those who publish them, those who write in them.  Noone from the Opposition benches suggests that newspapers should be <Col N="2671" /> free to say anything they like.  There is strict law setting down the extent of comment newspapers may carry which may affect the reputation of individuals or groups.  Those laws are there and any working journalist knows them.  Why, therefore, was it necessary to introduce a further element into this already strictly controlled area of public comment in newspapers?  Why is it thought necessary to introduce a new term &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;?  The slightest acquaintance with the law in this area would suggest extreme caution in the introduction of any new term into this area.  The Minister says it is a modernisation. We must be careful about modernisation and the introduction of new terms into the legal code.  Words have been devised over many centuries to mean certain things and we know the limitations of particular words. That is why in most Bills we find ourselves using the same terminology, going back over a long period of time, because these words have been tested and their application has been tested. The application of this new word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; has not been tested. This is why we spend so much time in these summer months discussing this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is not as though these suggestions of the Minister were being made in a country noted for its independence of expression, noted for its courage in propagating opinions or ideas.  We have a Press which, largely, can be described as a very timid Press, a Press which is over-sensible of the due acknowledgment that must be paid to the Executive.  Where that Executive has almost perpetually come from one political party it means we have a Press which, by comparison with the Press of most West European countries, is over-indulgent towards the mistakes of the Executive and which certainly could not be described as over-critical of the Executive; a Press that knows its place in the scheme of things.</P>
    <P>What would be the effect of a new term like &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; being introduced into the law, with criminal consequences for those who break the <Col N="2672" /> law which will emerge from the passing of this Bill?  It certainly cannot be claimed that it will make more independent that Press which has been most responsible in its political reporting and carrying of political comment. It cannot be said that the passing of this measure would encourage people to think for themselves, would encourage journalists to lead their readership on, by the aid of their own intelligence and honesty in commenting on a problem, to the realisation of the underlying factors in any particular situation. Instead, we will be saying to the journalists of Ireland on the passage of this Bill that here is another massive impediment to their capacity to report impartially on events; that they must be careful as to how they report events because the law has certain sanctions, certain penalties for those who transgress the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Various speakers in this debate have wondered how firmly Parliamentary democracy is based in this country. Speakers have pointed out that our tradition of a native Parliament does not go back very far and that there is quite a strong body of tradition in our history that has little time for Parliament or democratic representation. If we carry through the measure proposed here, we weaken the very delicate relationship between a free Press and a free Parliament.  If the free Press is interfered with, if its freedom of comment is curtailed, particularly in the way matters discussed here are relayed to the public&mdash;the people who matter most&mdash;then we finally damage the institution of Parliament itself.</P>
    <P>I am not entering into the rights or wrongs of freedom of expression, but in this country freedom of expression has always been seriously curtailed.  We have the Censorship Act and all those other matters.  Evidently the Press in Ireland must be more protected against thinking for themselves than that of any other republic in Western Europe.  That may or may not be necessary.  I am not entering into that discussion as it does not arise here.  The Executive are seeking to introduce this Bill into a country which is not accustomed to <Col N="2673" /> and has not great respect for freedom of expression and listening to the other person's point of view.  In fact the reverse obtains because this is a country where we keep our opinions to ourselves, where the better part of valour is thought to be to remain silent and to agree with the status quo.  That is the nature of our politics, as we discovered some two years ago, when our Party suggested certain changes in the traditional practice of politics in this country.</P>
    <P>Politicians in this House have been well served by a Press that was prone to be charitable to their faults, a Press which has been far from critical of many mistakes made and of many failures.  That Press has traditionally been most respectful towards the Executive.  Ministerial mistakes in other countries with a stronger tradition of Press independence have been criticised but in this country there has been a muffling of comment, a muffling of criticism.  Of course our friends in the Press may argue that this is an expression of their respect towards the Executive, that this really is the fault of the politicians who have left them with one Executive to deal with for nearly 40 years.  That may be.  It may perhaps be argued that the reason we have a Press in adjacent countries which appears to be more independent is that that Press there very often see changes of government, new faces in the old posts, but here in our own country it is the old faces in the same posts for too long.  The Press may well ask whose fault this is.  They may be tempted to believe that one of the laws of our country is that this Executive is to be with us for all time.  The unfortunate person covering politics in this country may finally lapse into a frustration of despair and lethargy and imagine that this Executive must be here forever and accordingly this realisation would colour the kind of reporting which we would get.</P>
    <P>This in fact has happened to certain respected members of the Press Corps covering this House.  I notice in many of their articles an acceptance of things as they are and a total hopelessness about anything political ever changing the Government of this State.  We <Col N="2674" /> notice a tendency in their writings to regard all politicians as being the same.  We find them telling the Irish public that a cynical approach to politics, political parties and Parliament is the only wisdom in this most unfortunate of all countries.</P>
    <P>The people in the Press may plead that the real fault lies with the politicians who have left them for one reason or another with one group in semi-permanent rule for so many years.  They may ask: &ldquo;How can you expect freedom of expression on our part where you, the politicians, have failed so consistently in election after election and have left in one particular group?&rdquo; To see the effect the realisation that one group controls politics in this country has on a group of people, I do not think we can do better than look at Radio Telefís Éireann, that most sensitive barometer in the area of moulding opinion.  Here we have an institution and organisation paid for by the taxpayers which over the period of its lifetime has known only one Government.</P>

      <P>That is right and radio and television are very much involved.  Throughout this debate we have referred to it It is a most important element in communicating to the public what happens here and the kind of public life we have.  Other speakers have referred to it at length in this debate, including the Minister. It would be ludicrous to think that we could talk rationally about section 4 without talking about the effects of that section on this semi-State body, RTE.  It is of immense consequence to the kind of case we are making against this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not live in a country noted for an independent Press.  In fact it can <Col N="2675" /> be described accurately as a most timid Press in that it is very respectful towards the Executive drawn almost consistently over a period of almost 40 years from one political party. My argument is that we see the consequences of this bad situation which has had most disastrous effects on one body of people, RTE.  There is an Act governing the relationship between this Government and RTE but the extraordinary thing is that the Act has never been invoked.  We have never seen that Ministerial instruction go from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to RTE.  Instead, we have heard of various Ministers on the telephone to RTE.  The strategy appears to be that the instructions will be delivered to the patient but like any professional third degree practitioner there will be no sign on the patient's body that in fact he has been punished most severely.  There is no evidence left.  There is just a telephone message. The Minister rings to say he does not like this, the Minister rings to say he does not want this programme on, the Minister says that X should not appear.</P>
    <P>What are the consequences in the RTE set-up for the producer who receives a ministerial reprimand?  Could anybody say that his promotion prospects are improved?  Would anybody suggest that the Director-General would immediately consider that this man by his courage and independence merits consideration for movement up the line?  The Director-General knows the political system as well as any other person and he knows that people who show this kind of courage have to go somewhere else down the line.  If we pass this measure we give legal sanction to those mysterious ministerial phone calls which have occurred consistently over the lifetime of Radio Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>In Telefís Éireann we can see the effects of this one-man permanent executive.  We can see it in the caution that has developed in this station, the lack of independence, so that now we may say of RTE that it is safely in the control of those who know on which side their bread is buttered, people <Col N="2676" /> more intent on promotion than on preserving standards of journalistic independence. This may be the chief wisdom for any journalist if this Bill is passed&mdash;to forget about freedom of expression, to report the way the Ministerial brief tells him to report.  That will be the only way to survive in this difficult state.</P>
    <P>I forget which French statesman said that his achievement was that he had survived.  Other people may have tried to do it but they were not around to say that they had survived.  This whole situation becomes intolerably worse if we pass the Bill which the Minister for Justice suggests we pass.  The behaviour of the Minister for Justice in discussing this Bill cannot give anyone any confidence. We cannot with confidence assume that his approach in framing the section indicates that transgressions against the Act would be dealt with in a calm and temperate manner.  Only last week on an Adjournment Debate, in reply to Deputy de Valera, he spoke about the desirability of the Garda going through the editorial matter of the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>
    <P>We may assume, therefore, that on the passage of this Bill the phone calls which before this occurred on a seasonal cycle will become more frequent.  There were not many phone calls in the summer because RTE during that season learned the wisdom of depending on the &ldquo;Forsyte Saga&rdquo;. The same could not be said of the autumn and the winter when usually there were two Ministerial phone calls. Then as we moved on to summer we could ignore RTE once more.  On the passage of this Bill we may expect weekly phone calls from Ministers telling RTE exactly what they want on programmes.</P>
    <P>It has always struck me that those people most enraged with any responsible political reporting from the television station, which reporting will be further curtailed on the passing of this measure, apparently never had the opportunity of watching BBC or any other overseas programme.  Of course RTE have to compete with these programmes in Dublin and in other areas. If viewers can see on BBC and other <Col N="2677" /> stations politicians being mauled during open discussion on particular measures in Parliament they will not be satisfied with smooth interviews prearranged with this Minister or that Minister as he explains this or that. They will switch off.</P>
    <P>The means of control which the Government have been utilising with most effect is the licence fee.  As Deputy Lemass told us here, RTE is a creature of the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas, being controlled by the Government, must carry out public policy and the Fianna Fáil Party being so long in Government, &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; means Fianna Fáil policy. The Government have been saying to RTE: &ldquo;Unless you change your tune you will get no increase in the licence fee and we who hold the financial strings will ensure that you do what we want you to do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, there has always been sublime arrogance in the way the people opposite expropriate the taxpayers' money as being almost in their own gift.  It does not belong to the taxpayer at all.  It is a tax that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs gives to his creature.  It does not come from the ordinary taxpayer, from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or any other political group but out of the largesse of the Government, and their interpretation is that the recipient of this cash must obey the whip, the diktat of the Party opposite in anything they do.  Therefore, the unfortunate people who pay the licence fee annually to RTE&mdash;those who fall before the warnings on &ldquo;spongers&rdquo;&mdash; must look forward on the passage of this Bill to very flat programmes.</P>
    <P>What kind of political programmes will we have?  They will include, possibly, long interviews with various Ministers telling us about their early boyhoods and ambitions.  One could almost see from the Cabinet changes made lately that they will need interviews from now until Christmas to catch up on all the changes.  There is obviously great scope for programmes that will not rock Government susceptibilities, or for good colourful programmes <Col N="2678" /> dealing with the Bruree boyhood of Gerry Collins.</P>

We are here when the weather is fine outside and the beaches beckon to most Members.  There is general hardship in this House and we are aware of this. Still, the matters that detain us are of some importance both to us and to the members of the Press Gallery who have been put to major inconvenience as a result of the length of this debate in the summer months.</P>
      <P>I would say in our defence and in defence of all those who spoke at such length and so eloquently that we know not the consequences of the passage of this Bill.  There are certain new concepts being introduced into criminal law.  For instance, this word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;. The consequences of that word, the effect it may have on public expression, we cannot foretell.  It, therefore, behoves all of us to explore the possibilities of this word and to hope for a death-bed conversion on the part of this Minister who apparently is intent on going his own headlong course and of getting every provision his civil servants have advised him to get through the House.  Civil servants, like any other body of men, are apt to make mistakes and we as politicians must examine all the possible consequences. This is one of our functions and we must fulfil this particular duty.</P>

      <P>As I was explaining, we on these benches here are only too well aware of the inconvenience of these long discussions at this season of the year but the matters which detain us and which keep so many of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party from their farms, from their true avocations, are of serious consequence. They could affect the quality of the reporting in, say, the <i>Kerryman</i> or the <i>Southern Star</i>, or the <i>Tipperary Star.</i> The Deputies of the Government party are avid readers of their local newspapers, watch exactly how their statements are reported and how those of their opponents in the local county council are reported.  Let us suppose that the county council were discussing some eviction case and in a moment of indiscretion a member of the Government party said: &ldquo;I think they were right to go into that place.  It was empty&rdquo;, that good Fianna Fáil county councillor could find himself in serious trouble if this Bill is passed.  That is why this measure is so serious; it could affect the quality of life in these constituencies which is of such importance to the Deputies of the Government party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite apart from what is contained in the Bill, it has always been realised that in conditions in which censorship was imposed by Government edict, the most dangerous consequence of this legal censorship was in the minds of the people who were censored in this way.  Writers like Seán Ó Faoláin have commented that on the mind of the writer, on the mind of the person who is so censored and whose freedom of expression the law sought to limit, there was a sort of spin-off of censorship to curtail his own thinking. What we find happening in organisations like RTE, what we will find happening increasingly in our national newspapers on the passage of this Bill will be a self-imposed censorship.  We will find whole sections of comment missing from our newspapers and the Government can hold up their hands and say: &ldquo;This is not our fault&rdquo;, but in fact it will be their fault, being the consequence of the passing of this Bill.  Other commentators have noticed this phenomenon before, where such a measure as this was introduced.  They <Col N="2680" /> have noticed that the people who are themselves controlled and curtailed become infected with the same restrictive madness that the Government are now seeking to impose.</P>
    <P>Whether the Press as a whole is aware of the consequences and dangers of this Bill is open to question.  Certainly the Independent group of newspapers are only too well aware of them. Other newspapers, evidently, are waiting for the courts to save their liberties. This is a dangerous principle to follow. The greater wisdom would be for the newspapers, who, subject to the laws of defamation which none of us seek to amend, have freedom of expression, to seek to protect that freedom.  They should not stand idly by and see this Bill go through.  Their editorial columns should be more alert to the dangers.  It might seem strange for us in these benches to compliment the Independent group of newspapers, knowing the traditional background of the group, but the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> and the <i>Evening Herald</i> have been foremost in this campaign of opposition to this Bill, and they must be congratulated on their stand.</P>
    <P>We are as much mystified as anyone else that the Minister should seek to introduce this Bill.  None of us has the answer to that puzzle.  The Minister has not brought forward any satisfactory reason in his numerous and almost incoherent interjections on the Bill.  He is the most choleric young man we have seen in those benches opposite for some time; in fact he is the most extraordinary Minister for Justice we have seen for a long time.  Promotion has been rather rapid in Fianna Fáil in recent years and possibly they did not have much time to consider the suitability of applicants for the different vacant posts that arose so strangely and so quickly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that a filibuster is being engaged in by the Opposition in relation to this Bill.  Again the newspapers who carry this kind of comment may not be carrying it for much longer if this Bill is passed.  I am not suggesting there is any clause in the Bill which would forbid them to do this, but I am talking about this spin-off of censorship <Col N="2682" /> once public expression is controlled. Realising the way the law stands, realising the disposition of this Executive towards free expression, journalists may begin a self-imposed censorship.  This has happened elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We believe that in our approach to this section the Opposition in this House have been properly utilising Parliament, because if Parliament means anything&mdash;it means little to the Members opposite as we are aware&mdash;it must be a place where Members discuss contrary viewpoints and where the full implications of what may become law are probed and brought into the open so that the people of the country may make up their minds about what is intended and what is likely to happen after the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government have done their best to whip up resentment both among the staff of this House and among the people of the country against any Opposition which would seek to hold them up in the passage of this Bill. There is no one in the Government, or in the Opposition, who would not like a holiday at some stage but the matters which detain us here are too important to be allowed to go through without long and strenuous opposition.</P>

      <P>We have suggested to the Minister, who is intemperate in his handling of replies to Parliamentary questions and other matters in this House, that he should spend the summer months revising this Bill and discussing it with his advisers in the Department to see whether there is anything in the Opposition representations. There need be no diminution of ministerial power in admitting <Col N="2683" /> that the Minister for Justice has made a mistake.  This may sound heretical, but later on if this Bill is passed it will be impossible to say such things about a Minister.  It might be an offence for a journalist to say that the Minister was making a mistake.  This could happen.  We have seen other men making mistakes on the benches opposite.  Mightier men than the present Minister for Justice have made mistakes and have paid dearly for them.  Visits are made by backbenchers to men who made by these mistakes&mdash;at least, it was a decision of the Taoiseach that they had made mistakes.  It is possible even for a Fianna Fáil Minister to make a mistake.  The present Minister for Justice may be making a mistake in this present Bill. The difference between the mistake of a Minister and a mistake by the Opposition is that an Opposition mistake will not affect the ordinary electorate of this country because our mistakes do not involve the enactment of any legislation.  If the people opposite make mistakes we all have to live under the laws which they make.  That is why the opinions of those opposite concern us all.</P>
      <P>We will be still debating this measure probably in the early weeks of September.  Every Member of the Opposition in this House must speak against this Bill.  Over the next few weeks and into September we must continue our opposition to this Bill. This does not give us any satisfaction or enjoyment.  Good weather is in short supply in this country, but this is the only alternative we are left with. We must continue our opposition to this Bill.</P>
      <P>The defenders of the Government Party are willing to come in and defend the provisions of the Bill.  When it comes to a vote, the Government will be able to frisk up the votes.  They have a great capacity for that.  No doubt the proper coercion will be applied and they will get the necessary votes for one reason or another.  The so-called dissidents will be at one with the Government Party on this Bill.</P>

      <P>This is a very important section of the Bill.  It is probably one of its most objectionable features so the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will forgive me for mentioning the Bill.  One of the most annoying features of the Minister's inadequate defence of this particular section has been the way he sneered at the Opposition, whom he referred to as subversive. Members of his party have come in here and suggested that some alliance between the Labour Party and anarchy is behind the Opposition to this Bill.  That argument brings us to the ridiculous level where we see the <i>Irish Independent</i> referred to as a subversive organ.  There is not much merit in it, but that is the kind of argument to which the Minister has been reduced. He has had to come in here and rely on the incident of the Springboks. No doubt Labour Party Deputies counselled the trade unions concerned that their members should not cover a particular sporting event.  We lived in a free society then and the unions could ask their members to do anything they wanted or liked to do so long as they continued to be members of the union.  They could walk out of the unions on receipt of these requests. We can only assume that they accepted these requests from their unions.  The most dangerous thing of all, whether one agrees or disagrees with this expression of abhorrence at the regime in South Africa and their sporting ambassadors, would be if the union said: &ldquo;This should not be covered by journalists who accept any decent standards of humanity.&rdquo;  They are entitled to their opinions.  It is ridiculous to equate these sentiments with opinions of people in opposition to Government legislation which all of <Col N="2685" /> us must obey.  There was no penalty attached to anybody for disobeying union rules on instructions to the Press at that time.  After the passage of this Bill we will not be free to act in such a manner.  One will not say: &ldquo;You are free to do this or that and to ignore a section of the Bill.&rdquo; Where is the equation between the attitude of any Labour Party Deputy or any person in opposition to the union instruction at the time and the attitude of the Opposition to the provisions of this Bill?</P>
      <P>This is a ridiculous argument which various members of the Government, who do not know where South Africa is, who do not know what goes on there, have been reduced to relaying in speech after speech.  The people who wail about conditions in Northern Ireland speak about the South African regime as though it were the home of justice.  The Minister's defenders will go to any length to find an argument to defend him.  They will all be eating their words yet.  They will all be explaning that they were under a misapprehension and if this Bill is passed we may, in another year or two, see a fresh set of dissidents arise on the basis of this Bill.  Members opposite never seem to resign on a matter of principle or theory, they always appear to resign on a matter very closely affecting their purse.  That appears to be the law of resignation in the Government, a member is either kicked out or else something happens to a member's financial standing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I see no equation between the kind of argument advanced from those benches on the occasion of the Springboks affair and the kind of argument which is being presented to us now. One argument recently put forward was that the Opposition were involved with the all-Party Committee on the Constitution which suggested certain things that would limit freedom of expression by the Press.  This argument has been used to prove that all politicians are essentially the same.  I want to make a careful distinction between the sentiments and opinions, whether they be objectionable, or agreeable, or not, expressed by people in Opposition and those of the people in Government passing legislation which will affect us all.</P>
      <P>We can see no reason for this particular section.  The Minister has said it merely modernises the existing law but it introduces a new concept of &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;, the ramifications of which we do not know and it is doubtful indeed if the Minister knows.  Certain people may say that our courts will ensure that freedom is preserved but Parliament should be&mdash;whether it is or not is another matter&mdash;the first bastion of freedom.  It is for this reason that the Opposition seek to utilise Parliament to the full during the summer months.  I do not think we should relax and wait for the courts to rescue our liberties; our liberties are on trial in this section of the Bill and that is why we must continue to oppose the Bill section by section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; inquiry an attempt has been made by the Executive opposite to eliminate public comment.  The Taoiseach has let it be known to the staff in RTE that he was not responsible for the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; inquiry.  This is a familiar argument which the Taoiseach uses on occasions&mdash;members of his own party are more familiar with the methods of that argument than I am. The usual argument is that some other bully or some other person in the Fianna Fáil Party made the decision and it was the Taoiseach's humble <Col N="2687" /> role to back him up as a loyal leader. This may mean the person who made the original decision loses his job but the Taoiseach will continue in his post and the argument goes that the Taoiseach is innocent.  Similarly in the case of the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; inquiry the Taoiseach let it be known in his charming way that he was not responsible for that inquiry and that Deputy Ó Moráin and other evilly disposed people launched it.  He may or may not be right, I do not know.  He certainly shows admirable survival qualities.  He always has an excuse, he always has a victim ready when the mistakes are made and he always has his alibi correct.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach does not like the Press, he is secretive towards the Press, he does not let his thinking go out to the Press.  Members opposite know what the penalties are in the Government benches for talking to the Press. The only section of the party which talks to the Press is that section which is in revolt against the leadership.  The other element in the party is preserving a tight-lipped approach to the Press.  We see the fruits of this suspicion towards the Press, this suspicion towards public comment in general, this suspicion of any kind of examination of Government policy in this Bill. The Taoiseach is as much responsible for section 4 as the Minister for Justice is on the principle of collective Cabinet responsibility.  We may take section 4 as the logical follow-up of the mental make-up of a Taoiseach who does not trust the Press and who would, in fact, be more comfortable without a Press which was not so independent in the way it covered events, even though the Press we have is not noteworthy for the manner in which it independently examines social questions.</P>
    <P>It is a long time since Connolly said that the Irish might have physical courage but lacked moral courage. This is true.  Various explanations have been put forward as to why we do not favour freedom of expression and favour silence instead.  It is argued that this is the result of the kind of colonial history we have endured, which may or may not be right, but <Col N="2688" /> it is certainly a fact that we do not have a great tradition of being honest in public about our true opinions and that we constantly seek to hide our true opinions and evade the awkward questions.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of this Bill must mean that men in future will have to rely on a television station which will fill in its viewing time with American cartoons, &ldquo;Peyton Place&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Forsyte Saga&rdquo; or even more advertisements, but whether there will be any viewers to look at this splurge is another question. Certainly it will not be a television station which will have programmes devoted to the exploration of public issues with elected people taking part in these discussions in an effort to involve the ordinary citizen in the resolution of these important questions. Towards the end of the Roman Empire the emperors felt the best way to deflect the attention of their insubordinate citizens from matters of State and to ensure that a rational and discursive temperament did not grow up among their citizens was to give them plenty of entertainment and in a modern dress, in a modern setting this is, in fact, what the Executive are seeking to do with RTE.</P>
    <P>The message must go out to those in radio, that, on the passing of this Bill, what independence of expression they have enjoyed so far must now be abandoned and that they must expect an increase in the number of telephone calls from Ministers.  It is probable that Ministers will come here in the future and not be ashamed to admit that they phoned so-and-so in relation to a certain programme.  We know that their tactics up to now have been not to utilise the sections of the 1961 Broadcasting Act in this regard but, instead, they have given instructions over the telephone to persons involved in certain programmes.  Of course, in such cases the loss is the viewers', especially in the rural parts of Ireland where only the home station can be received.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to suggest that the measures being taken by the Government in this Bill can be compared with other pieces of bad legislation. This argument was put forward by the <Col N="2689" /><i>Irish Times</i> in an editorial on the virtue of humility which they published about two weeks ago.  It is true that other Bills may have been wrongly conceived and may have had bad consequences, but this particular Bill seeks to destroy the reserve of independence in our news media and, as all Opposition speakers have indicated, there is not a great reserve of independence in any medium in the country.  The number of people associated with our newspapers and television media who are ready to speak their minds and who are not in any one's political pocket is very limited.  Certainly, the number of such brave men and women is decreasing, especially in the newspaper world, although at no time have they been numerous and at all times their path has been a difficult one.  Promotion has not been within their grasp.  Any of us who is involved in minority politics, as is any member of this party, knows exactly the kind of prejudices one is likely to encounter if he tries to open people's minds to new ideas or tries to suggest remedies that are different from the traditional ones.  Such a person learns quickly about the kind of sectarian opposition with which one must contend.  Therefore, probably because of our minority position, we understand better than other people the possible disastrous consequences that can arise from this section.  That is why we must continue to oppose it. We know the Minister for Justice and we are familiar with the Department of Justice but that does not mean that we can accept the Minister's assurance that nothing lethal is intended because we know also that the number of people in the media who are prepared to pinpoint the underlying factors in any particular issue are limited.  We know the problems that these brave people must face.</P>
    <P>The Minister is wrong in suggesting that this is simply the modernisation of the existing law.  He knows that is not so but he knows also that there is no place for courage in the law as it exists and he must know that this Bill would have results, the extent of which neither journalists nor anybody else can foretell.  The unprecedented step taken by the Dublin branch of the National Union of <Col N="2690" /> Journalists was courageous.  I might point out at this stage that there is some contrast between the working journalists and certain newspapers in their opposition to the Bill.  We can see how the <i>Irish Press</i> must pull their liberal punches on this particular occasion, because there is an old law that obtains for the paper and that is: &ldquo;When the Government are under fire the <i>Irish Press</i> must be silent.&rdquo;  They are liberal up to a point, but we have seen that liberalisation depart from their editorials at times of by-elections. It is a case of supporting the patron when he is attacked.  The attempt on the part of the <i>Irish Press</i> towards liberal expression is coming to an end. I cannot say, either, that I am enamoured with the attitude of the <i>Irish Times</i> who, in their editorials, say simply that people must rely on the courts for their freedom.  They say that perhaps it would be better if the newspapers would save their breath for the courts.  I wish the <i>Irish Times</i> well in holding their breath but I hope they do not hold it for too long.  Certainly, we have no intention of holding ours during the coming months in so far as this Bill is concerned.  It is our duty to continue to oppose it.  It is not simply a matter of filibustering because we must involve ourselves in exploring the possible consequences of such a measure, a measure that is probably the most nefarious ever to come before the House.  Fianna Fáil are past masters in the art of political black magic but this is the most diabolical measure they have ever introduced. I wonder which Minister claims the Bill as his own.  The Minister for Justice has been rather reticent on this matter.  He has not said that the Bill is solely his.  My contention is that the Taoiseach has had more to do with the introduction of such a measure than has had the Minister for Justice.</P>

The Taoiseach has used such an alibi before to effect and when he has done so, someone has lost a job either by being fired or by resigning.  I would suggest to the Minister that he watches this aspect of the passage of this Bill.  The Taoiseach may yet be calling him to his office, and saying that this Bill was a bad mistake and he may be demanding an explanation from the unfortunate Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the lack of public transport services to the proposed new general hospital at Blanchardstown and the inaccessibility of this hospital to the vast majority of residents on the north side of Dublin city; and what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of public transport services is primarily a matter for the Minister for Transport and Power and Córas Iompair Éireann.  However, I have made inquiries from CIE and I understand that, in addition to the normal scheduled services to Blanchardstown, special bus services for visitors to the hospital operate from the city centre every day of the week. The existing services are adequate to meet the present demand and CIE are keeping the position under regular review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the accessibility of Blanchardstown, the position is that in Dublin the distance involved from any area to a major hospital is not great. It would be altogether impracticable to provide a general acute hospital in <Col N="2692" /> each area in which there has been large scale housing development.  In recommending the Blanchardstown site for development as an acute hospital, the consultative council on the general hospital services took all the relevant factors into consideration including the major development being planned for the Blanchardstown area.</P>

      <P>I have, of course, read the June, 1971, edition of the Code of Advertising Standards for Ireland to which the Deputy is no doubt referring and I shall be writing in the near future to the appropriate authorities about it.</P>
      <P>I should, perhaps, explain that, in its own terms, the code is a voluntary code drafted for the guidance of advertisers, distributors, advertising agencies, those controlling advertising media and the suppliers of various advertising services, and its purpose is to formalise existing advertising practices here and to define practices considered undesirable.</P>
      <P>The present edition contains a part dealing with the advertising of alcoholic beverages.  This is the first time that advertising practice in this area has been formalised and to this extent is a clear and responsible recognition for the industry that the time has arrived for guidelines to be set down.

      <P>In the Government's continuing examination of the implications for Ireland of membership of the EEC, the possible effects for the country of our remaining outside the enlarged EEC are taken fully into account.  As the Deputy will appreciate, precise quantifications in these matters are really not possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall see what can be done.  The various Government Departments are making continuous studies. As the Deputy is aware, quantifications are calculations based on assumptions which themselves are based on a number of variables.  The only way one can approach it is by taking different sets of assumptions and guess which will be nearer to reality.  In fact, in regard to quantification of the future&mdash; whether the EEC question arises or does not arise&mdash;it would be a very doubtful matter as to whether it would have any relation to fact.  The Deputy will be aware that forecasting is based on assumptions of certain matters remaining the same, whereas the future &mdash;irrespective of whether we join the EEC&mdash;will not be the same as the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said with regard to the difficulty of forecasting.  Nevertheless, is it not a feasible economic exercise to make quantified projections?  Is it not essential for our negotiators that these should be made in advance so that they may have the advantage of information on projections which will obtain, to provide the minimum baseline after which the advantages or disadvantages become apparent?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that on a previous occasion he accepted that in the White Paper to be published there would be a quantified assessment regarding the effects of membership?  Would the Minister not accept that it is of vital importance to have this?  Further, does he not accept that the House and the country will realise clearly that any such assessments or estimates must be based on stated, but reasoned, assumptions?  The people can make up their own minds because they can judge for themselves whether the assumptions are reasonable. Is the Minister aware that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries stated here yesterday that he could not even estimate what would be the Irish price at this moment for agricultural products if we were members of the EEC now?  He showed the greatest reluctance to consider any type of quantification for the present or for the future.  Will the Minister reconsider the position in the light of what I have said?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under social welfare legislation the claimant who satisfies the conditions for receipt of benefit or assistance is statutorily entitled to receive payment, including any increase of the benefit or assistance that may be payable in respect of dependants. Where a claimant is unable to act the Department has power to make arrangements for payment of benefit or assistance due to a person acting on his behalf.  In the majority of cases claimants are competent to look after their own affairs but if a claimant wishes he may have a person nominated by him appointed to act as agent.  In the case of married men their wives would normally be the persons nominated to act.  I accept that difficulties can arise where, for one reason or another, a beneficiary does <Col N="2707" /> not contribute to the support and maintenance of his dependants and is unwilling to make arrangements in this respect.  The Department have in the past been successful in arranging <i>ad hoc</i> settlements in some such cases, in which, of course, in the last resort, the wife may also obtain a maintenance order from the district court.  This particular problem has, however, been under examination in my Department with a view to seeing if power to enforce a suitable solution compatible with the rights and interests of all the parties concerned could be legislated for.  The matter is complex and one which, in view of the fundamental issues involved, requires careful consideration.</P>

Complex it may be but, if the lawyers and the Minister's advisers concerned sat around a table on a couple of occasions, they should be able to hammer out some solution.

      <P>The EEC regulations do not provide for target or intervention prices for poultry and eggs and if Ireland were now a member of the Community it is likely that our output of these products would be disposed of almost exclusively on the home market as at present.  In the case of potatoes there is as yet no EEC regulation providing for a common organisation of the market.

      <P>I have tabled Question No. 23.  The Minister has given an answer to that question.  I am asking a supplementary on his answer.  He seems to suggest by his answer that there will be no effect on Irish prices of poultry and eggs.  I am asking is that because of some problem of free movement in the export of poultry and eggs to these countries or for some other reason or is the Minister right at all?</P>

      <P>The minimum growers' price fixed for sugar beet in the EEC for the years 1969-70, 1970-71 and 1971-72 was £7.20 per ton for beet of 16 per cent sugar content delivered at a collection centre, wet pulp being returned free of charge to the grower.

      <P>The Community have agreed to our proposal that the implementation of the transitional arrangements should not involve any reduction in the degree of freedom of trade already existing between this country and Britain as a result of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  This is a matter of particular importance to us as the volume of our agricultural exports to Britain makes it essential that trade with that country should not be disrupted during the transitional period.</P>
      <P>The Community side have also taken note of our interest in the British fat-stock deficiency payments so long as such payments continue to operate in Britain.  At this stage it is not possible to say when those deficiency payments will cease.</P>

      <P>It has been the policy of the Government since the publication in 1962 of its White Paper on the Irish fishing industry to bring about by all <Col N="2728" /> possible means a substantial expansion of our fisheries and this is kept constantly under review.  As the Deputy is aware, the catching and processing sectors of the industry are in the hands of private interests and increased investment by these interests is actively encouraged by means of generous grants and loans from State funds. In addition the State is carrying out a programme of direct investment in fishery harbours, fishery research and training and in the provision of advisory services.</P>
      <P>As a result of this policy, investment in the fishery industry has increased steadily in recent years with beneficial results in terms of fish landings and exports.  There is undoubted scope for further development of the industry which will require still greater investment, particularly in the light of the enhanced opportunities that membership of the EEC will provide.</P>

      <Col N="2729" /> As the Deputies are aware, the Government, through Córas Tráchtála, has made a wide range of grants, incentives and other services available to exporters.

    <Title>Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill, 1970: Report Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 7:</P>
    <P>In page 3, line 34, after &ldquo;who&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;verbally (otherwise than on radio or television)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Cooney.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On coming to the conclusion of my remarks on this amendment I should like to say that it is interesting to gain insight into the rather unknown territory of the Minister's mind.  He admitted during the debate that he would have been willing to drop section 4 in response to the pleadings of this House but that he wished to get at the subversives and therefore he thought section 4 was <Col N="2732" /> necessary for the carrying out of this task.  In this respect, our argument was that we did not see why it should include new legislation or even the use of this new word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;.  We said we regarded this as having dangerous consequences&mdash;the introduction of new terms which had not been tested previously.  We said that one does so at one's peril when one introduces new concepts into a branch of the law which has been well tested over the years.</P>
      <P>This can be said about the new concept introduced by way of the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;.  There are many working journalists who cannot foretell the implication of this word or how it will affect them in their journalistic lives in the future.  The Minister was not accurate when he suggested that simply all that is involved here is a modernisation of the law.  In reply to all those who criticise the inconveniences of remaining on here throughout the summer witnessing this debate, which to them has little significance, we would say that is a very foolish observation. They are playing with fire if they think these concepts can be allowed to pass into legislative form, wrong if they imagine they can be allowed pass without the Opposition opposing these sections strenuously.</P>
      <P>That is not to say that politicians in the Opposition prefer Press criticism, that we do not mind the Press attacking us for our actions or our motives.  I do not think any human being likes being attacked in any newspaper, but a careful distinction must be made between those Opposition politicians, who may often wince when they see themselves attacked, as they think wrongly&mdash;they are entitled to feel resentful and to declare their resentment; that is their right; they need not remain silent if they find an argument being used against them in the Press, they may reply&mdash;and the resentment of a Minister who may pass his prejudices into legislative form.  This distinction is too wide to be equated with any Opposition sentiments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That attempt has been made in some of our newspapers&mdash;the attempt to defend the Minister's approach has <Col N="2733" /> been put forward as if politicians are all the same, that their opinions are as one, that such equation exists.  This attempt at a defence of the Minister's approach has been put forward.  I deny that any such equation exists. The Minister introduces Bills which all of us must obey when they are passed, but for the prejudices, the mistakes and the misgivings of the Opposition the electorate will not have to suffer.  No journalist in his working capacity will suffer for any objection any Opposition member may have to make.  However, in respect of the man invested with the powers of Government, his opinions, his mistakes are things which we may all have to suffer from equally, whether we agree or disagree.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if we detain the journalists attached to this House and the Members of this House over the summer months, please do not think it is for any trivial event but because we feel there is an important principle involved in this Bill, one which we think could have very dangerous consequences in the future in regard to free expression.  In the long run, whoever is in Government or in Opposition, it is safest to have a free Press. We have, largely, a Press which is timid, peopled by journalists who come from areas known for their support for traditional politics.  I am not blaming them for this.  They come from areas in the country which know no other representatives than those of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and their thought habits had been laid down long before they arrived in Dublin to comment on politics.  Fair enough, but the fact is that their ability to the extent it now exists to put forward in the future honest expressions of opinion may be seriously curtailed if this Bill goes through.</P>
    <P>It has been discovered that when you bring in laws aimed at the curtailment of freedom of expression, when you legislate in the direction of censorship, then the victim, the person to be punished, the person whose comments you seek to curtail, will himself cooperate in this tendency, enthusiastically continuing in his own mind a spin-off from this coercive legislation.  This <Col N="2734" /> we have seen happening in Telefís Éireann.  We have seen it happening throughout the country, and the message that will go out to any working journalist when this Bill becomes law will be to watch even more so than in the past what he does in the future.</P>
    <P>Nobody in the Opposition is seeking to alter any of the laws of defamation which at present curtail journalists in their work.  There are penalties laid down for any newspaper editor who may injure the reputation of any group or person in the public esteem.  These laws continue in force and we do not seek to abolish them.  We do not seek to curtail their effects or implications. However, we do not see that a case has been made throughout this debate why a new concept called &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; should become a criminal offence.  We say to all those journalists who see in this debate over these summer months no more significance than an annual replay of the old Leinster House comedy about who will chicken first in prospect of the summer holidays: there is more at stake.</P>
    <P>Those journalists who see no more at stake than that, who just think that this is the re-enacting of the annual comedy, have not read this Bill properly nor have they looked at the implications of this section.  I do not think it is sufficient to say, with the <i>Irish Times</i>, &ldquo;Wait for the courts&rdquo;.  I look on this House as an important institution of liberty, the first institution of liberty, and I do not think we can wait for other bodies to vindicate the fundamental liberties of the people. This House has a duty and we in Opposition have a duty to uphold it in at least probing these measures which the Government have brought forward.</P>
    <P>We are not a country known for great honesty in putting forward political opinions.  We know that the path to promotion does not lie in the direction of expressing our true opinions and there are many people in Telefís Éireann who know that to their cost.  They will know it even more if this section is passed into law.  The Bill seeks to limit even more the right of journalists to write freely.  The Minister has given us no satisfactory <Col N="2735" /> explanation as to why the section is necessary.  He says it is to get at subversives. Other Deputies in recent weeks have referred to the Government's reluctance to get at known subversives, both in their own organisation and outside, under the present laws of the land, but they now wish, under this new section, to terrorise, to intimidate, to ensure that a very small number of people in our media, in our newspapers and television, will get a strong warning to desist even from the position of honest reporting which that small group up to now have carried on.</P>
    <P>This really will be the result of this section being passed.  Would it not be a very foolish Opposition which would depart complacently for their summer holidays allowing any Government to bring such a measure in here without putting them to the pin of their collar by going into the Division Lobby in division after division?  Allowing this section to go through would remove any possibility of this House having any serious effect on the future of public policy.  The people in the media may say that the reason they cannot be compared for courage, for the free use of their critical faculties, with their counterparts in other countries is that the politicians have given them the one Executive for 40 years.  I do not deny that a great deal of the fault lies with the politicians in a situation which has given us a Government selected from one party for so long.  The working journalist may say: &ldquo;If that is the kind of State in which we live, then one of the laws of expression is that you do not offend that Executive too much.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have noticed, as I am sure other Members have noticed, that while Press commentators can be pretty rigorous in their examination of the motives of the Opposition, they show a great deal of charity towards the mistakes of the Executive.  I should have thought it would have been the other way around, but that might just be Opposition prejudice.  They have shown a great deal of ardour in their exploration of the motives of the Opposition in, for example, keeping this House going into the summer <Col N="2736" /> months.  I would hope for the same ardour, the same degree of honesty, in probing into the mistakes of the Executive, mistakes which are far more disastrous for all of us than any shortcomings of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that any alternative Government composed exclusively of Opposition people would be any better in its approach to, for example, an institution like Telefís Éireann.  I am not saying that it is possible for any Executive to avoid being involved in a certain amount of strain with the television station.  Such a temptation would always lie in the path of politicians in power, and politicians who have been in power for so long as the people opposite may have a greater tendency to fall than people who go in there once every 20 years.  However, I would hope that the new people in that situation could resist for a longer period.  I would certainly make this prediction that on the day that any alternative Government attempted to pass legislation that would approximate to the dangers involved in this clause of section 4, that is the day that Government would fall.  I think I know the minds of the parties involved and the principles they advocate well enough to know they would not stand idly by while some Executive attempted to put through this clause.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley, Minister for Justice, is the person shepherding this Bill through, but I clearly see in it the hand of the Taoiseach.  He does not like the Press.  He has never liked the Press.  He has told each member of his Cabinet and those who matter in his party to keep their mouths shut when approached by the Press.  This legislation is the logical follow-up to the attitude of the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach, of course, will have his alibi when the proper time comes, just as he had in relation to the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; Inquiry, when he let it be known to the people in Telefís Éireann that he was not behind the inquiry, that it was a rough diamond like Deputy Michéal Ó Moráin, the then Minister for Justice, who was responsible for the inquiry.  I am saying to the Minister for Justice: &ldquo;Make sure you have your alibi when the Taoiseach calls <Col N="2737" /> you to his office.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach always has an alibi and somebody else gets fired.  We have seen this quality of the Taoiseach, to be able to survive in the most extraordinary situation. While the Taoiseach may have the Minister for Justice putting through a Bill which in the opinion of many people in the Opposition is an unpopular measure, at some stage he may need to dispense with the Minister for Justice.  Is the Minister for Justice quite sure that the Taoiseach is not saying to certain groups throughout the country that he is not responsible for this Bill, that it is the idea of somebody else or some other group of wicked people, that he is just there as the presiding chairman and that these other wicked people are putting through these intemperate Bills?  That is what he said to the people in Telefís Éireann about the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; Inquiry.</P>

      <P>I am merely making the point that we can see the effects on a body like Telefís Éireann of the power of an Executive which has been in office so long.  We can see the way instructions have been issued without adhering to the letter of the 1961 Broadcasting Act, instructions which have come over the phone to producers. I am suggesting that, whereas previously we had instructions from Ministers being phoned on a seasonal basis, on the passage of this Bill we shall find them shamelessly coming into the House and telling us as a good joke: &ldquo;Yes, I made five phone calls last week&rdquo;, if that is necessary any longer.  The message must go to the people in Telefís Éireann, those who survive there, that on the passage of this Bill that little independence they have will flicker out.</P>

It has been given the name &ldquo;filibuster&rdquo;, the intention being that the ordinary man would come to the conclusion that some sort of Leinster House game is being played out here which is without significance for him.  It is of great significance for <Col N="2738" /> ordinary people that they should be able to read comments in their newspapers, see programmes on television, for which they pay quite an amount of money through licence fees and so on, which have as their aim the pursuit of truth.  As I say, we have a Press which is not noteworthy for its courage in examining these questions.  The working journalist may say the blame for this lies with the politicians for giving us one form of Government for so long.</P>

      <P>The politicians, being the people who go before the electorate to look for the right to govern, are responsible if, considering the various programmes presented, one group succeeds all the time in getting that support.  We must say in regard to the other groups that there must be certain faults in their presentation, to say the least of it, leaving out of account certain machinations of the politicians in power which result in constituents finding themselves in a different constituency in successive elections.  There is ample scope for the politicians in power to engineer their own survival in power.  Therefore, while Deputy Crowley may put it forward as an interesting point, it is not in accordance with the facts to say that the people take part in a pure-minded decision at each election as to which group should represent them in Parliament.  Deputy Crowley will know what I mean when he considers the various parishes he has lost in the last few years as a result of the activities of the Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <P>We must give due credit to the Dublin branch of the NUJ who themselves admit the unprecedented nature of their intervention on this Bill when they voiced their objections to it.  As I say, the editors or journalists of newspapers other than the <i>Independent</i> group&mdash;which must be praised for its strong line on this whole debate and towards this Bill&mdash; who can submerge their critical faculties and say that this can be compared with another piece of mistaken legislation are making a profound error. They are misunderstanding the unique nature of this Bill.  In section 4 the Minister seeks to curtail the freedom of the Press in a country which is not famous for freedom of expression.  We obviously limit even further the possibility of freedom of expression arising in any of the media.  This is not the same as any mistake in the Livestock Bill or any other legislation which has been introduced over the years.  We will continue our opposition to this Bill.  Nobody, least of all the Minister for Justice, can tell me the implications of the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; or how far the courts may go and how far journalists may find themselves impeded when this idea is fully teased out in all the courts.  Perhaps some of our fears are ill-founded.  Perhaps the consequences will not prove as grave as some speakers have forecast, but the necessity of probing its possible application is important to all of us.  Why does the Minister not amend this Bill and listen to the points made?  I cannot see the reason why this new concept of &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; should be introduced. Why can the Minister not be satisfied with the old word &ldquo;incite&rdquo;?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>He will be saying it is not his property but was dreamt up by a person or persons unknown.  I am telling the Minister for Justice to be sure that the Taoiseach is not repeating his criticism of this Bill somewhere else.  This has happened before and people have disappeared when the Taoiseach has commenced to talk in this way.  It has happened to better established people than the Minister for Justice of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Their power no longer exists. We could not stand idly by while the Minister for Justice attempted to get section 4 of this Bill through.  It has repercussions for Press freedom, which <Col N="2743" /> is not to say that we wished to strike a more imposing posture in front of the Press.  I earnestly say to such people that they should examine this Bill so that they may know more intimately how it will affect their working lives in the future.  Section 4 will have repercussions on the manner in which they can report news.  It is rash for them to take the line that section 4 is of no great consequence.  No one can say exactly where the writ of section 4 may cease on its passage through this House.</P>
      <P>There has been a general clampdown by the Government.  The only way the Government know for responding is to cut off communication with the media at Cabinet level.  Their whole approach to RTE has been marked by the assassination of the various people who have caused them trouble. We all know the roll of honour of people who have fallen to the ministerial telephone call in Telefís Éireann.  The threat of refusing to increase the licence fee unless certain things are changed in the production of news and the manner in which it is reported has been held over the head of RTE.</P>
      <P>This debate is one of the most important we have had since I first came into this House.  This Bill seeks to introduce a totally new concept in the way in which news is reported. Whether for noble or ignoble motives members of the Opposition have spoken against this provision and have advocated the retention of the present freedom which the Press enjoys under the existing laws.  We do not have the votes to deflect the Executive from this course.  I would advise journalists and newspapers generally to use this valuable time to get the Executive to withdraw sections of this Bill even if they will not withdraw the entire Bill.  The Government swallowed the Prices and Incomes Bill very rapidly because the trade unions spoke out but on this occasion all we can bring to bear on them is public opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since RTE must be silent in this debate all we can depend on is the newspapers.  Whatever the political approach of newspapers it is in their <Col N="2744" /> interests and in the interests of every working journalist to see to it that section 4 is not implemented, whether he likes the speeches of the Opposition or not, whether he likes their character or not, whether he agrees or disagrees with any action of theirs in the past, it is his duty at this time to get the people talking about the provisions of this Bill.  I do not give up hope that even this Executive may change their mind in respect of certain features of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach attends a great many functions around the country, he meets many people and he occasionally speaks to them on political subjects, though he likes to avoid such, and he may get a message from those people that they do not like this section.  There is a faint possibility that this section may, in fact, be dropped.  Nobody has any pleasure in preventing people from going on holiday on time but the fact is that the serious nature of this Bill must keep us talking here; I hope every member of the Opposition will talk throughout August and into September on the provisions of this Bill.  There are sufficient people in the Opposition to talk this thing over for a good while longer.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the Minister must prove impervious to every argument raised here.  He has not proved his case, perhaps he does not consider it necessary to prove the case as he has the votes; that is an attitude we have grown accustomed to.  The Minister has not proved the necessity for this section.  It is quite incorrect to suggest it is just a modernisation of the law. Nobody on this side of the House is suggesting any tampering with the laws of defamation.  We understand that newspapers work under the constraint of the Defamation Act and we do not seek to change that but we do not understand why this section should be added to the constraints of people who work in journalism at present.</P>
    <P>All the pressures on journalists are to conform and to take the ministerial brief.  All the pressures in R.T.E. are to accept the statements given by one's superiors.  Our national character is such that we like to evade the awkward decisions and the awkward questions <Col N="2745" /> and prefer to take refuge in silence. This tendency must be intensified if this Bill is passed and that is why the Opposition keep talking on this Stage of the Bill.  That is why I consider this section the most important in the Bill. The Minister has not offered any sound argument why he must have section 4 to get at what he calls the subversives.</P>
    <P>When a member of his own party, on the adjournment last week, raised the matter of magazine advertisements, the matter of the woman editor of the <i>Irish Press</i> was raised by the Minister. Whether he meant in the course of his remarks that because she had left her employment gardaí could not be put on her trail is open to interpretation, but the sheer gusto evident in the way he pronounced the possibility that gardaí may have to go through the editorial files of that newspaper makes me even more alarmed about what is likely to happen when section 4 becomes law and these powers of censorship and detection become that much more strengthened.</P>
    <P>While this legislation is being put forward no journalist worth his salt can see this simply as a trivial event which happens every other year.  I have not seen such an attempt to change the essential legislation affecting the media of this country being passed in the six years I have been here.  I do not see how the viewpoints of the Opposition on the Springboks affair can be equated with what the Government are attempting to do in this legislation.  We may or may not agree with what opposition people said about the Springboks match, we may or may not agree that that match should not have been covered by journalists, but these were Opposition sentiments.  There is no equation between that sentiment and actually enacting repressive legislation which will affect all of us, journalists and public alike.  This is the distinction which must constantly be made about the sentiments of the Opposition and about the sentiments and prejudices of a man who has the power to elevate his prejudices into legislation.  There is a vast difference between the result of the Minister's prejudices and those of <Col N="2746" /> any member of the Opposition.  If the Minister is willing to drop section 4, which is the serious proposition he made a while ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no secret about what we think about those things.  As the Chair knows we were made to look rather ridiculous at the last election as a result of the caricatures put about by the people opposite concerning our policy but that is their entitlement.  There is no secret about what we think about most things.  We are probably a party who do not realise how politic it is to keep our mouths shut on occasion.  I am on the side of those politicians who let the public into their attitude on many issues.  I know the tendency of the party opposite is to keep the people in the dark but that is not our tendency and in the long run it is a more healthy failing for our democracy's sake.  In <Col N="2747" /> this country, at any rate, if there is to be any hope of a new approach to politics we must get away from the attitude of native cunning and silence when awkward issues arise.</P>
      <P>We have been subjected to a good deal of misrepresentation in our opposition to this Bill but we had no choice but to oppose it after we considered this particular section.  However, it is opposition with a definite purpose because in Fianna Fáil, whatever may be that party's degree of imperviousness to public comment, there are men who are having second thoughts on this section.  We propose to give these men time to voice these second thoughts.  We propose, too, to give them time to permit their opinions to reach the ear of the Minister.  We understand that there are few occasions now on which members of that party have an opportunity of making known their views to those at the top of the party. We understand also that people who were at the top in that party might have had a different approach to this section of the Bill.  We propose to allow these people to use their influence and their undoubted strength within that party.  We propose to allow them the opportunity of bringing this democratic pressure to bear and we are hopeful that section 4 will be deleted.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment proposed by Deputy Cooney. At the outset, I should like to say that I do not propose to engage in any detailed analysis of the legal implications of section 4 nor do I propose to treat the House to a lengthy dissertaton on the philosophical concept of liberty, of democracy or of freedom of the Press.  As an elected representative and, particularly, as a Deputy representing the same constituency as the Minister for Justice, I wish to protest as vigorously as possible against this section and against the Minister's dictatorial attitude and, what I must describe, regrettably, as his Hitler-like tactics in trying to bulldoze this piece of legislation through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section has been condemned universally.  There has been an unprecedented and remarkable unanimity of <Col N="2748" /> opinion from the national and provincial newspapers and from the people of the country generally.  The Minister has indicated that he is prepared to keep the Dáil in session for as long as is necessary to put this Bill through. Reference has been made to the inconvenience being caused to Members and to the staff of the Oireachtas in having to remain here into the month of August.  I must say that I do not object to remaining here through the month of August and even through the month of September provided the Government introduce legislation designed to tackle the very pressing and urgent social and economic problems facing the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I should have proceeded in a philosophical discourse when I would have been in order.  Instead of the Government persisting in bulldozing this measure through the House&mdash;a measure that is unnecessary and unjustifiable and, particularly in relation to section 4, is unwarranted&mdash;they would have been better employed in trying to find a solution to the problems I have mentioned. I suggest, respectfully, that the Minister for Justice also would have been far better employed in ensuring that the existing laws are effectively and impartially administered and that he would utilise his time and his efforts in ensuring that the armed bandits and other thugs who are causing destruction throughout the country would be brought to justice under the existing laws of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my ten years here I have never indulged in personalities and I have no intention of doing so now. Therefore, when I refer to the Minister I do so in the context of his office as Minister for Justice.  In my humble opinion the record of the performance of his duties as Minister for Justice would not allow me to support him in the further powers that he is seeking in this measure.  With the possible exception of the Cattle Marts Bill in relation to which we had the same type of situation as we have now, I do not <Col N="2749" /> recall any other piece of legislation during the past decade that has met with such universal condemnation as has section 4 of this Bill.  I cannot understand the mentality of the Minister and the Government.  In particular, I cannot understand the mentality of some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies who have spoken on the section.  Confronted as they are with its universal condemnation and with the unanimity of opposition from all sections of the community, they still persist in bulldozing it through.</P>
    <P>I listened this morning to Deputy John O'Leary.  Deputy O'Leary is a man for whom I have the highest personal regard.  After he had spoken I went to the Library and perused the latest issue of the provincial paper that circulates in his constituency.  On the front page of that paper was a lengthy leading article condemning, in the strongest terms possible, this section. I took the trouble, too, of looking up the newspaper that circulates in Deputy Davern's constituency and that paper, also, condemns the section strongly.  Do these Deputies not realise that the provincial Press reflects the opinion of the local people?  I wonder whether the Minister has ascertained what is the reaction in his own constituency. If he walks down O'Connell Street in Limerick any Saturday and talks, as I do, with the man in the street, he will find that there is strong opposition there to the section.</P>
    <P>As a layman, it seems to me that this section cannot be interpreted in any way other than being a definite attempt to curb the communications media.  The Minister certainly has no mandate from his own constituency for this particular section.</P>
    <P>I have been impressed greatly by the unanimous manner in which the communications media have condemned the section.  I am not aware of any organisation, of any newspaper, of any publication or of any Fianna Fáil cumann having passed a resolution in support of this particular section. There is no doubt that in section 4 the Minister is attempting to curb the communications media.  The Minister's refusal to consider the amendments which have been put forward, particularly to section 4, clearly confirms <Col N="2750" /> what is the opinion of most people in the country&mdash;that by means of section 4 the Minister is attempting not merely to muzzle the Press but to muzzle all the communications media.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the striking manner in which the Press of this country has come out against this Bill.  I would also draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the journalists, through their union, have felt compelled to express their concern, professional and ethical, about section 4.  This is something unprecedented.  I do not recall any other occasion on which professional journalists in this country, through their union, felt so concerned as to pass such a resolution which has been circulated to all Members of this House.  To me this is very significant because, by and large, journalists in this country have refrained from involving themselves in a biased way in political matters.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to take note of the outcry&mdash;I do not think it is exaggerating reaction to this measure to describe it as a public outcry&mdash;against what he is attempting to do, particularly in section 4.  I believe that not merely journalists but the people of this country have a right to ensure that the news media retain their freedom of expression and any attempt to compel journalists and those who are responsible for the promulgation of news to conform with the thinking, the mind or the attitude of the powers that be is totally repugnant to the people.</P>
    <P>One phrase of the late President Kennedy has stuck in my mind, one which is not too often quoted but which is pretty relevant to the discussion on section 4.  President Kennedy said that in a democracy those whose responsibility it is to wield power perform great services but those who question how these powers are being used perform even greater services.</P>

      <P>In view of the manner in which particularly section 4 of this Bill has been condemned by <Col N="2751" /> many people I find it difficult to understand the attitude of the Minister and of the Government and particularly of the various members of the Fianna Fáil Party who have spoken on this amendment.  I see Deputy Noel Davern here now.  I mentioned his name in his absence.  I was referring to the fact that he was one of the few Fianna Fáil Deputies who have spoken on this section.  Following his speech last night or some time this morning I was looking through the various provincial newspapers.  The newspaper which circulates in Deputy Davern's constituency the <i>Nationalist</i> expresses very strong views about section 4 of this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;views which are totally in conflict and totally opposed to those expressed by Deputy Davern last night.  I referred to Deputy J. O'Leary's speech this morning and the views of the newspaper in his constituency. Surely there must be something radically wrong if the Government and the Minister and the Deputies in the Government party are so totally detached from reality.  I suppose it is amusing in a way that a party which prided itself on being the party of reality, a party which claimed to be the party of the grassroots should now in regard to this measure show itself as a party which is totally out of touch with the thinking of the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister as a constituency colleague to withdraw this obnoxious section and bring an end to a situation in which the Opposition Deputies are compelled to fight this measure line by line and word by word. As Deputy O'Leary has pointed out, we have no alternative but to fight this measure because public opinion is <Col N="2752" /> totally against it and if we do our duty we must reflect public opinion.  I am not without hope that the Minister for Justice at this late stage will see the light.  If he does not, so far as his own constituency is concerned he will rue the day he persisted in this attitude in trying to bulldoze through Parliament this obnoxious piece of legislation against the wishes of the vast majority of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a long and useful debate on amendment No. 7.  However, after listening to a number of speakers one wonders if they understand what the section and the amendment we are discussing is about. What has surprised me is the charge made by members of the Fianna Fáil Party, not only inside the House but outside it and particularly among members of the staff, that the Labour Party mainly&mdash;and Fine Gael to a certain extent&mdash;are preventing these people taking their holidays.  It is puzzling that such a charge could be made by a party who have put in speakers in this debate&mdash;in one case one speaker spoke for more than an hour and in a number of cases speakers spoke for more than half an hour.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have listened to criticisms on radio and television, they have read criticisms in newspapers and periodicals, but they do not seem to understand that what they are looking at and listening to is public reaction to bad government.  Finding that this criticism is being expressed a small section of the Government are attempting to create a situation whereby it will be impossible for fair comment to be made on matters on which the Government hold strong views.</P>
      <P>This has been an audacious attempt by the Government.  Someone has tried to absolve the Minister for Justice and has said that perhaps the Taoiseach is the person who is mainly responsible. I do not care which of them is responsible; the fact is that the Government have introduced this obnoxious section and have tried to bulldoze it through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week we heard shouts from members of the Government, particularly from the Minister for Justice, <Col N="2753" /> about keeping us here until September. Can Fianna Fáil not get it into their heads that we will stay here until Christmas 12 months if we can to try to ensure that this Bill is properly debated and if we can have this section deleted we shall cheerfully stay here. As long as we stay here the Government must remain also and they should not forget that.</P>
    <P>Although most people have been talking about what will happen to the Press, to radio and television if this Bill is passed, there is much more to it than that and this does not seem to have been fully understood.  Section 4 (1) states:</P>
    <P>Any person who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence under section 2 or 3 of this Act shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>I should like to get a definition from a responsible member of the Government of what exactly is meant by &ldquo;encourages&rdquo;.  We are all politicians; we speak to our supporters, to organisation members and to others not only at election times but during the period of membership of this House.  If any Member of this House meets some people and expresses a view which is contrary to what is laid down in section 2 or 3 of the Act, is he committing an offence?  What happens if he commits that offence?  For the heinous offence of encouraging someone who is in possession of a house to which he considers he has a right but which, according to this Bill, he has no such right, the penalties are laid down in section 7.  This section states:</P>
    <P>Every person who commits an offence under this Act shall be liable&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on summary conviction in the case of a first offence under this Act, to a fine not exceeding £50 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both such fine and such imprisonment,</P>
    <P>(b)  on summary conviction in the case of a second or subsequent offence under this Act, to a fine not exceeding £100 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding <Col N="2754" /> 12 months or to both such fine and such imprisonment,</P>
    <P>(c)  on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>This is not confined to somebody who breaks the law by breaking into a house or a vehicle or damaging property, which offences can be dealt with by the law at the moment.  It will apply to everyone who commits the offence of encouraging people to do what is considered to be a breach of the law.  The Minister for Justice was very quick earlier today to throw across the floor of the House to Deputy Michael O'Leary the query whether the Labour Party were prepared to withdraw their opposition to the Bill if section 4 were withdrawn.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, who is representing the Minister, the following question: will the Minister put to the Whips in writing a proposal that he will withdraw that section? We will see what happens.</P>
    <P>We cannot fool ourselves about this. It is always nice for people if they can &ldquo;smart aleck&rdquo; their way through the House and get away with things that are not strictly what they should be but which, by a twist of a word, can give the impression they are giving a guarantee that certain things will be done.  We are tired of Government Ministers giving half promises and finding out subsequently that it is not possible to carry out those half promises. We had a typical example of this yesterday when the Minister for Health who had promised to do something five or six times, both outside and inside the House, said in a throwaway sentence at the end of his speech he regretted he did not find it possible to do what he promised.  I am quite sure the Minister for Justice would regret he would not find it possible to withdraw section 4 if he could get away with offering it in a bantering way across the floor of the House, having opposition withdrawn as a result and then getting through the remainder of this obnoxious legislation.</P>
    <P>There are various views on certain sections of this Bill.  Some speakers <Col N="2755" /> on the Government side have made certain comments in favour of this Bill and the personnel of the group who have been doing this have not passed unnoticed on this side of the House nor, I am sure, in the Press Gallery.  These people have made statements that usually were miles away from what was being discussed. They tried to throw a certain amount of blame on us and to give the impression that what we here on these benches and Fine Gael speakers were saying was that we were in favour of squatting on someone else's property, breaking into an unoccupied house and taking possession of property that did not belong to us, knowing very well that there was nothing like that involved in it at all and that we are sticking strictly to what the Minister has written down here in section 4, which we, by amendment No. 7, are attempting to have changed.  It does not matter to people who do not, perhaps, bother very much about these things whether or not this Bill goes through as it is, or as amended in the way suggested, but it will matter a great deal when it comes to the next general election.</P>
    <P>I had the experience a few days ago of meeting an eminent member of the legal profession who had been out playing golf with an equally eminent member of the legal profession who happens to be very prominently involved with Fianna Fáil.  This gentleman started to give me an interpretation of what this particular Bill says and particularly what section 4 says.  I could not understand how somebody of his standing could be so far wrong until I started to question him as to where he got his information.  Then the game of golf came up and the impression I got was that he must have won the game.  It would have paid the gentleman who was giving him the brainwashing to allow him to win, because he certainly impressed him, and it took a great deal of discussion and the production of the actual Bill before he understood. Obviously, the game his colleague was playing was one he did not understand at all.  It certainly was not golf.</P>
    <P>Now, if the Government are serious <Col N="2756" /> that they want to have the business of this House terminated in an orderly way and do something about the problems they claim they are dealing with in this Bill, they can do that very simply.  They certainly will not do it by pulling the oldest trick in politics, waiting until arrangements are made for the business to be concluded before an adjournment and then dumping in a controversial Bill.  They should give us credit for more intelligence than to think that we would be caught out by that sort of trick.  This is not personal, but I think the comment should be made: we have a Minister, who is attempting to get a very controversial section of a controversial Bill through the House, who suddenly finds that he has no time to spend here and sends somebody like the very decent Parliamentary Secretary, who spends most of his time here, to deputise for him in this House.  If that is the way the Minister thinks he will get his Bill through, then he has another think coming to him.</P>
    <P>Some people here, when speaking on this amendment, were inclined to say that the Press reporters, radio announcers and what-have-you were, in fact, people who were in confined positions and were tied down by what was handed out to them.  My experience of journalists, whether they be radio, TV or newspaper men, is that they seem to be people of fairly strong character.  Some of us occasionally attend a meeting and, having listened and taken part in the meeting for a number of hours, and seeing it being fully reported, on reading the report in the following week's paper wonder was it the same meeting we attended at all.  This does happen; but, in the main, the people who report the news report it as they see it.</P>
    <P>It does appear that there is a very definite attempt being made here to prevent that practice being continued if this Bill, with this particular section, becomes law.  I can visualise someone working for a considerable period with an employer and having possession of a house as part of that employment. He changes his employment and the employer asks for the house; he is told that he cannot have the house until <Col N="2757" /> another house is found.  I can visualise this Bill then being invoked to remove that man and I can visualise the local county councillor, or the Deputy or the local parish priest commenting on how unfair the whole thing is.  I can visualise the tenant going to jail, first of all, and then the person who makes the comment going to jail.  I can visualise the local newspaper printing a report of that and whoever is held responsible for that report also going to jail.  The thing is so ridiculous that, unless the Minister for Justice is being forced by someone else to get this Bill through or, perhaps, the kite he flew here recently is what he is thinking of, he would be very well advised to take this section out altogether.</P>
    <P>I should like to pose this question: as far as I can recollect the Second Reading of this Bill took place some time around February last and why the urgency just now, apart from the fact that it is a try-on?  Would the Government lose face if they did what governments have done before them and what, I assume, governments will have to do again; would the Government lose face if they deferred further consideration of an awkward piece of legislation until the next session?  There is no guarantee that the Seanad will deal with this Bill any more expeditiously than the Dáil.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary, for his own information and the information of his Government that, when this Bill does go to the Seanad, it will be no mere formality getting it through there.  It will be debated day in and day out until everybody is as sick and tired of the Forcible Entry Bill as they were&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is no use in a Government trying to govern by bullying.  This is what is being attempted here.  If we have a situation being built up here, maybe for the reason I have just given or, maybe, for a different reason altogether, it is quite <Col N="2758" /> possible the Government had at the back of their mind some kind of master plan whereby they would write into this particular section certain things which could be used at a later stage for other reasons entirely.  If that is their idea, then it is even worse than we thought.  I see the Parliamentary Secretary smile.  He might, possibly with benefit, read the section we are trying to amend.  The section simply says:</P>
      <P>A person who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence under section 2 or section 3 of this Act shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>The result of that is that, under certain circumstances, such a person can be fined £500 or three years in jail, or both.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Fianna Fáil Ministers have found themselves in the dock but we cannot help that.  The Government are attempting to put this measure on the Statute Book and they are creating a situation which in fact can bring about their own downfall <Col N="2759" /> if anybody is malicious enough to use it against them at a later stage.  Some of them are pretty noisy about those things.</P>
      <P>This is the final matter on which I want to touch.  It has been suggested that the entire Fianna Fáil Party are behind this Bill and this section and, therefore, are opposed to the amendment. We shall see what the vote produces.  We shall see whether we will have anybody sitting in the Distinguished Strangers Gallery to prove that they are not voting for Fianna Fáil on this occasion as they did two weeks ago.  Or will we see somebody staying out of the House, staying away out of malice because he does not want to be involved in this and does not want to vote against it and, in other words, does not want to be seen?</P>
      <P>The situation is this: If the Government want to get any of this Bill on the Statute Book they had better take out section 4 quickly.  If they are not prepared to do that we shall stay here as long as they stay here and they will have to stay as long as we do. We have no objection.  Somebody suggested that they had money enough saved up for a holiday.  I understand that a winter holiday in Switzerland around Christmas time is very nice. Some of the Ministers accustomed to having expensive holidays abroad might try booking for Switzerland because they certainly will not be going to Majorca or Greece as long as we have this section in this Bill, as long as we have this amendment opposed. We shall fight them as long as we stay here.  They might as well make up their minds about it.  They have the option: take the section out and we shall talk about it: take the Bill out until the next session and we can finish the business and go on holidays.  Otherwise, we shall stay here and they will stay here also.</P>

All of us will agree that a Government should stay here until legislation is fully discussed and debated and until laws which are <Col N="2760" /> necessary in the eyes of the Government are enacted, especially when you have a democratically elected Government and a Government who have been in office for quite a number of years and who have put through this House during their long term in office all kinds of legislation.  Admittedly some of it was challenged as being unconstitutional.  This is fair enough. I agree this has happened and can happen again.  I do not think any Government having made provision in a Bill to legislate for certain offences should be panicked by the threat&mdash;this is probably a rather strong word; I admit it is&mdash;by the statements of Deputy Tully, for whom I have the highest regard.  I do not regard as a threat his statement that he will stay here while we will stay here.  Is this a childish attitude?  Is he trying to influence the Government?  He should try to influence the Government in other ways than by the old schoolboy method of saying: &ldquo;When are we going to get our holidays?&rdquo;</P>

There are people who are not all property owners who are worried about these things and anxious that provision should be made to prevent or stop some of the serious things which are happening.  There is a demand and there is a feeling which does not apply only in this country about this matter.  This is not peculiar to the Republic of Ireland.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which will mitigate the effects of these actions on the ordinary people, the farmers and others who own property and, if they do not own property, who enjoy public property, public buildings.  It is necessary that the property of the private individual, public property and the facilities that are free and accessible and can be enjoyed by the public at large should be protected.  It is not alone property which is involved here &mdash;facilities are involved.  In section 4 we are making it an offence for people to be physically present and doing this and also for people to encourage this sort of thing, to advocate it.  With modern communications, and so on, it is not the front line man who can do that much damage.  If a law were passed to prohibit a person standing on a street corner and recruiting people to do damage&mdash;if it only went that far, then all he would have to do the next day is to get some leaflets and get across the same thing by way of publication in a leaflet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well for Deputy Keating to say that the number of these protesters is small&mdash;that is not so&mdash;and that you may have a situation <Col N="2763" /> where somebody gets a duplicating machine and turns out a few copies&mdash; that is not so.  We have examples of very many leaflets being distributed in very large quantities and where they are done or from what centre they come, we do not know.  They certainly reach all corners of the country.  There is a similarity about these things.  To give one example&mdash;and it is not in connection with incitement or with advocacy to commit any crime&mdash;there are the &ldquo;No EEC&rdquo; signs, done in a stencil, in various places.</P>

The ordinary people do not like some of the things that are happening.  They ask, as I know and as the Deputies opposite know and as Deputies behind Deputy Fitzpatrick know, what are the Government going to do or what are they doing about these offences which are being committed here and which are a pattern in very many countries at the present time.  This Bill and the provisions of this section of the Bill will to a certain extent limit the worst features of this modern trend in crime.</P>

      <P>This case has been made by the Labour Party.  They have instanced what could happen.  In other words, they have said we are legislating for Northern Ireland, that our legislation here should not be such that it would be an example to those up there.  There is a different set up there.  They have a Government which is propped up.  We took the same action when we said: &ldquo;Burn everything British but her coal,&rdquo; Here we have a Government which is democratically elected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a Government democratically elected by the people which will make laws to govern the daily lives of our people. The Fianna Fáil Government have been doing this successfully down through the years.  I listened to Deputy Keating.  It was a very well documented and incisive contribution.  He attacked the judges.  This attacking of the judiciary may not be overall Labour Party policy.  The judiciary were attacked by a number of members of the Labour Party.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We then get an area in which we would have to rely on the specific benevolence of judges.  In recent years we have not been entitled to rely on that benevolence.  We have to take judges as they come in a sort of statistical sense.  There are some good judges and some bad judges, some benevolent judges and some malevolent judges.  Taking into consideration our mechanism of appointment, with due thought about it, I expressed grave reservations about the quality of many of our judges and about the quality of many of the judgments they hand down.  We cannot <Col N="2766" /> claim that we can look for any special wisdom or benevolence from our present collection of judges, although there are honourable exceptions in any such blanket denunciation, of course.  Taking them by and large, as a group, taking them statistically, they do not inspire me very much&mdash;rather the contrary.</P>

      <P>It should be the legitimate policy of a political party to attack the Government and to attack the party in Government but I do not think they should have the added advantage, especially Deputy Keating and some of the other Labour Deputies who did the same thing, of undermining the judiciary.  It is all right to attack the Government but not the judiciary.</P>
      <P>It may be a part of the present policy to destroy the institutions of the State or help to undermine the confidence of the public in our well-established institution. If this system of appointing judges is wrong, then let us have proposals to amend the system.</P>

      <P>A lot of play has been made as between advocacy and incitement.  The term &ldquo;incitement&rdquo; is in a lot of our legislation.  We are here dealing with an <i>ad hoc</i> situation where one is physically present to incite.  We are talking about forcible entry, not about muzzling the Press.  Advocacy can be done easily through modern communication.  Deputy Keating used these words:</P>
      <P>People at large recognise the right to publish a book unless it belongs to some special category of objectionable books, unless it is obscene or libellous and unless, in Ireland, it advocates what is described as the unnatural prevention of conception.</P>
      <P>He admitted there that it should not be advocated.  He did not use the word &ldquo;incite&rdquo;.  To me it seems logical that if it should be wrong to advocate the things Deputy Keating mentioned, to use his word &ldquo;advocate&rdquo; in this section seems to be the correct thing to do.  The Opposition have opposed this Bill rather strongly and given us examples of repressive actions by people in other countries.  It is strange that people such as Deputy Keating should mention countries in western Europe who muzzle the media, for instance, Germany.  Last night Deputy Thornley dealt with the actions taken by the French Government and by the Italian Government, especially in connection with television.  There were other references to repression and to muzzling of the Press.  It is strange that these people have confined their examples to western Europe, that none of them thought of countries like Russia, Cuba&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Let me conclude by repeating what I said at the beginning, that the man in the street does not want some of the things which are happening and this Bill makes provision to deal with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>To anyone listening to this debate, which has proceeded for a long time, it is very difficult to know exactly what is the attitude of the Government, because it seems to change from day to day and, indeed, from hour to hour.  Yesterday and in the course of some of the speeches last night the charge was made that the Opposition were mounting a filibuster in relation to this Bill.  That is a term of parliamentary abuse which has been used traditionally by government Ministers in all the parliaments of the world who wish to describe in disparaging terms a persistent, strong and determined opposition to a measure that they want passed.  If by suggesting that a filibuster is being mounted on this Bill and particularly on this section Fianna Fáil Deputies are directing attention to the opposition, then they are perfectly correct, because the opposition to section 4 is strong; it is convinced; it is determined, and will remain so.</P>
      <P>Section 4 is one of the most obnoxious legislative proposals that has come before this House in recent years.  Of course, it has aroused indignation among Deputies who are free to think and act in this House and it has aroused indignation throughout the country.  I want to join with some other Deputies in registering a protest that legislation containing this kind of section should be brought before Dáil Éireann at this time of the year.  It is perfectly clear to me that the Minister or the Government hoped that by bringing it here at this time of the year Deputies who have been working hard all the year, perhaps, looking for some rest or leisure or holiday, would let it through.  It is quite wrong and it is, to my mind, evidence of a very guilty conscience on the part of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill, <Col N="2772" /> 1970.  It was introduced in the House last year, but what happened to it? After its introduction it lay dormant. It was circulated but no steps were taken to have it debated.  The Second Reading did not take place until this year.  What is the explanation?  The Government allow a year to pass doing nothing about this kind of proposal and then they come in at the end of the legislative year and try to get it through.  They have only themselves to blame.  Last year we know they were concerned with other matters, desperately concerned to try to patch up the breaches in the Government party. They had no time for legislation.  They were concerned with their own troubles.  However, we have to face the fact that at this stage we are presented with a Bill containing a proposal which shocks the conscience of many people who think about a matter of this kind, a section which proposes to introduce into our laws a very unwelcome notion of guilt by association.</P>
    <P>There was a time when a man used to be held responsible for what his wife said and could be sued because the wife had gossiped a little unkindly about a neighbour.  That idea of a man being held responsible for what somebody else said or did merely because they were associated and married was eventually rejected as offending against justice and any notion of common sense.  But here is a section which proposes to incorporate that notion into our statute law.  It is wrong and I believe it would be condemned by the general public had they the opportunity of doing so.</P>
    <P>Involved in the debate on Deputy Cooney's and Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment has been the allegation that the section, as it stands, may lead to a muzzling of the Press, to a statutory censorship of what may be written or advocated by the Press of this country.  The very moment censorship is mentioned one recoils to some extent.  Censorship, if it has to be used or put into operation, must always be used reluctantly and with great caution.  Excessive use of this procedure can only be inimical to the development of a healthy and enlightened public opinion.  A healthy <Col N="2773" /> and enlightened public opinion is the lifeblood of a vibrant, strong democracy. If, because circumstances are difficult or awkward at a certain time, or if it becomes a nuisance to have to listen to people advocating a variety of points of view and writing about these and pursuing ill-assorted ideas, a Government are tempted to say that the country cannot afford this discordant situation and that they will have to stop people saying and doing things, then, inevitably, democracy disappears and dictatorship in one form or another comes in its place.  We should all pause and take stock if there is a suggestion in any legislation here that censorship of one form or another is in question.  Under section 4 a situation can be created in which the use of the Press, radio and television&mdash; but of the newspapers in particular&mdash; to point out areas of social want and distress and to advocate a change may be restricted because it may involve encouragement towards the commission of an offence as set out in sections 2 or 3.</P>
    <P>In Dublin city and county we have a very serious housing shortage.  The problem that was supposed to be dealt with by this Bill was symptomatic of that shortage.  It was symptomatic of the crying need that has existed and still exists for houses for people with families and for people hoping to get married.  Under section 4 a newspaper that continues to advocate action or continues to point out this great social want could be muzzled.  That is what we believe.  That is how we read section 4.  I hope it will be accepted that we are a responsible Opposition.  We, as an Opposition, have a duty to act in this House according to our beliefs. If we think that something is wrong or that there is danger in a particular proposal we have a bounden duty to speak out, to act and in every way possible to protect the people we represent.</P>
    <P>We believe section 4 contains a threat to the freedom of the Press. Section 4 as it stands unamended may restrict freedom of speech.  Freedom of speech is something for which we have suffered much and have struggled hard <Col N="2774" /> to maintain.  Not many decades ago freedom of speech had almost disappeared in this country.  An organised gang tried to wipe out the opposition and the right of people to advocate views contrary to theirs.  Fortunately, good sense prevailed and everybody began to learn that there is merit in reasonable dissent and controversy and that democracy thrives on the strongly-held views of people who together are loyal to the State we all serve.</P>
    <P>Speaking in relation to my own party &mdash;and I am sure that these views apply to other parties also&mdash;I can say that freedom of speech is something we will all try to protect if we think it is being threatened.  We think it is being threatened under section 4.  The Minister has denied this.  The Minister said that there is no intention to use section 4 in any way to muzzle, hamper, intimidate or threaten the Press.  Does the Minister's denial carry conviction? That is the question.  I am afraid it does not.  If this denial were sincerely expressed as representing the Minister's view and that of the Government why could he not say &ldquo;I will accept this amendment because the Opposition apparently sincerely believe this danger exists.&rdquo;  The Minister could say &ldquo;I will accept an amendment along these lines to make it crystal clear that this section cannot operate in any way against the freedom of the Press.&rdquo;  The Minister does not do that.  He says our allegations are nonsense and that the fears we express are foundless, but he sits there absolutely immutable without being prepared to concede any amendment to this section.  I do not like that. In my years in the Dáil I have seen Ministers sitting like bumps on a rock, immovable, obdurate and obstinate and there was always something behind such an attitude.  There was always a realisation that they were advocating or standing for a point of view which could not last in fair argument, but to concede the other point of view was to lose face.  I hope that is not so on this occasion.  I hope the Minister's obstinate refusal to listen to what is being said here will not continue and that he will be big enough himself to realise that he grows in stature if he makes a move to concede something to <Col N="2775" /> allay fears which are genuinely held and sincerely expressed.</P>
    <P>Ministers, being only human, can become very arrogant.  They can get their heads turned; I know it, I was a Minister.  It is a very difficult experience for any human being to live through.  The first day one is a Minister one realises one is surrounded by people who are saying, &ldquo;Yes, Minister; you are so right, Minister.&rdquo;  Every word a Minister expresses is applauded. Every idea that comes to a Minister is the greatest thing since the sliced pan. One lives through one's first day and one may begin to think maybe there is something in it.  If one has a bit of sense one gives oneself a sharp kick in a certain part of one's anatomy, but if one does not do that one loses one's head, particularly if one continues for one year, two years, three years, five years, ten years, 12 years and 16 years as some of the Ministers in this House have.  I sympathise with them because throughout that period they have been continuously told that they are the greatest thing that ever came to that particular Department.  Their views are always correct, their decisions are always perfect; they never make a mistake&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when a proposal has to be brought into legislative form it is perfect.  When the Minister comes in with his proposal he has to face the Dáil on his own, he has to do his own fighting, he has nobody to say, &ldquo;Oh, Minister, you are so right, everything you are saying is so correct.&rdquo;  The Minister has to defend in the Dáil the proposal, whatever it might be, that has been so extensively praised by those who surround him in his Department. It is at that stage that Dáil Éireann begins to test the quality of the man. It is at that stage&mdash;at the stage we are at now&mdash;that we are beginning to test the quality of the present Minister.  Is he big enough to realise that the fears being expressed here in relation to section 4 are, first of all, being sincerely expressed?  Secondly, is he big <Col N="2776" /> enough and generous enough to say &ldquo;Although I do not agree with these views I will, by my action, make it clear in this section that the freedom of expression and the right of free speech shall not be endangered&rdquo;? There is a challenge that the Minister has to face and it will involve the testing by Dáil Éireann and our procedure as to whether he has been ruined as a man by the unfortunate system under which a Minister has to act and think.</P>
      <P>As I say, Ministers can be proud, arrogant and utterly impatient with those who criticise them.  One Minister for Agriculture in the past, the House will recollect, was so incensed and annoyed because the President of the National Farmers' Association had the temerity publicly to criticise some action he had taken and some point of view he had represented, that he started a row with the National Farmers' Association which had the dismal result of thousands of farmers coming up to Government Buildings and sitting down on the pavement in the middle of winter.  That was a Minister who was both impetuous and impulsive in his reaction to criticism freely expressed by somebody who did not agree with him.</P>
      <P>Do Deputies remember the Minister who telephoned RTE and proceeded to act as if he were a little pocket dictator ordering what should be shown and what should not be shown?  He said to people &ldquo;Take that off, put on something else.&rdquo;  We have had far too many very sad examples in the past of Ministers with their heads turned because of the treatment to which they are subjected and proceeding to behave in a very unreasonable fashion.  It is for that reason, if for no other, that we have the obligation carefully and fully to examine this kind of legislation and this kind of proposal in order to ensure that if it becomes law, if it is operated and if the Minister who has the power to operate it has his head turned or is unreasonable, he will not have the power to do harm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have suggested there is a real danger in the section.  I want again to put it on record that the point of view represented by Deputy Cooney's <Col N="2777" /> amendment is a point of view which is strongly held by Deputies in my party. This is no gimmicky opposition; it is no stunt.  This is something we are going to stand by whatever may be involved.</P>
    <P>It is a pity in the interests of the proper functioning of Parliament that the Government will not take another look at this entire Bill and at the time schedule involved.  If they are not willing to accept the amendment to section 4&mdash;I think they ought to be able to do it&mdash;what is to prevent them from putting this Bill in the ordinary legislative session in October?  This Bill was introduced in 1970, allowed to lie dormant for almost 12 months, came up for a second reading in February and is now before this House at the end of the legislative year.</P>
    <P>It is not treating this Dáil in a proper manner to act in this way.  It is utterly wrong and I am afraid it is indicative of some kind of midsummer madness that affects people sometimes.  Nobody will lose anything if the Bill is put back until October when it can be examined further, if further examination is necessary. Action of this kind savours of force and bullying and will have a reaction. There are people on this side of the House who can be every bit as tough as the Minister.  There are people on this side who can be obdurate and who will not move and there is plenty of ammunition left yet.  So it will continue until the stage is reached when the Ceann Comhairle will propose the question &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo; How many speeches will that question provoke?  I suggest that the time has come for a second think.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken on most of the amendments so far on Report Stage, some of them in my own name and others in the names of Deputies Fitzpatrick and Cooney, but I consider this particular amendment and the three that follow it to be the most important amendments to have been tabled in relation to this Bill.  In the years ahead when Deputies are preparing certain records at this time of the year, I expect it will be recalled often that the House sat well into August and, perhaps, September of <Col N="2778" /> 1971 and it might be wondered in those years ahead why the House prolonged the session to such extent.  However, when the particular proposal of section 4 is considered and when what in my opinion is a mild attempt in this amendment to amend this section is considered, one must realise that it is important for us to stay here as long as is necessary to pull the teeth out of this Bill and to have section 4 deleted or amended in such a way that it will become ineffective.</P>
      <P>The question of why the Bill was introduced has been discussed at various stages of the debate.  I intend making the point that the previous speaker made concerning the fact that there appears to be great urgency on the part of the Government to have this Bill passed before the Recess.  The various provisions of the Bill were known more than 12 months ago because in the Seanad in July last the Minister for Local Government quoted sections of it.  This House is now being held up because suddenly it appears necessary that the Bill be passed.  We are all wondering what is the reason for this urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been here during most of the contributions from the Government side but I have failed to hear any Fianna Fáil speaker give any reason for the Bill being introduced at all.  In particular, I have heard no reason from them as to why the Bill should contain a section such as the one we are discussing.  The news media, whether in the form of the national or local newspapers or in the form of radio or television, express, to use the Parliamentary Secretary's words, the point of view of the average man.  All of these organs of the media have been unanimous in their condemnation of the provisions of the Bill and, in particular, the provisions of section 4.  Usually when a proposal put forward by Fianna Fáil reaches a crisis stage, word is sent to the country from headquarters to have the cumainn pass resolutions in support of the Minister's stand but on this occasion we have not heard of any such resolution having been passed so far.  There must be some breakdown in communications because we have seen such <Col N="2779" /> resolutions published in the newspapers when other Ministers were in difficulty in regard to certain proposals during the past 12 months. Those Deputies in Fianna Fáil who have contributed to the debate gave the impression of having been forced to do so in order to save face for the Government.  That is obvious from the contributions that have been made by the Parliamentary Secretary who has sat through quite a lot of the debate.  It is my opinion that, having sat through so much of it, he was forced out of shame into the position of having to do something.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Because he had to sit here for so long and listen to so much of the debate he felt it his duty to defend it.  I doubt if he would have come in freely, even if he were not a Parliamentary Secretary, to defend section 4 of this Bill.</P>
      <P>According to the Parliamentary Secretary the average man, whoever he may be, is looking for legislation like this.  I do not know how one would describe the average man or what he looks like or sounds like, but I regard the opinions expressed through the news media, taken all together, as reflecting public opinion and also the views expressed in this House as reflecting public opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was said that the Government had a democratic right to do what they wished to do, but I would remind the Government that they represent less than 50 per cent of the people and that we on the Opposition benches represent about 50 per cent of the people. This can be proven by reference to the first preference votes cast in the last <Col N="2780" /> general election.  The Parliamentary Secretary seems to think that democracy means that you take no heed whatever of the wishes or opinions of 50 per cent of the people and that you just do what your own 50 per cent want.  In this case it is extremely doubtful that even the Government's 50 per cent support this measure.  We have a duty to speak out as strongly and as effectively as we can and to voice the views of the people we represent.</P>
    <P>I have been sitting here for hours and days on end waiting for a case to be made from the Government benches that this section is necessary for our entry into the EEC.  I think it was the Tánaiste who, at one time, said that we will have a tremendous influence in the EEC with our culture and our way of life.  I would think that our laws, our administration of justice and our concern for the less privileged of our society would be important.  If we can show laws concerned with the less privileged, laws that are not of a fascist and repressive nature, we might be able to have some influence.  If, on the other hand, we have laws on our Statute Book such as the proposals in this Bill we will certainly be giving bad example and we will not have the influence we would wish to have.  We have not very much to offer by way of example to other countries, we have not the financial means of impressing other countries but if we can have on our Statute Book laws of which we can be proud, laws that we can hold up as examples of justice, honesty and fair play, we can have a tremendous influence on other countries with which we will be in contact in the years ahead.  We cannot say that we cannot afford good and just laws.  They do not require strong financial resources. This is one way in which we can help to influence many other countries.</P>
    <P>We often find it necessary to condemn repression and victimisation of one kind or another in other countries. How can we do that with confidence if we have passed on to our own Statute Book a section such as section 4 and if the Government have resisted all attempts to amend it even in the mildest form.  If that became known <Col N="2781" /> generally, the respect and esteem which the Irish people enjoy in many countries would be lowered and indeed would be lost.  It is one thing we can afford to do: it will not affect our balance of payments or cause a Budget deficit but it will influence many people and many countries.  Even at this late stage I appeal again to the Minister to have another look at this Bill and to try to reconcile if he can the provisions contained therein with the terms of the 1916 Proclamation or the First Dáil.</P>
    <P>I should like to know how the provisions contained in this Bill, and particularly this section, fit in with the programme laid down by the First Dáil.  They are contrary to that programme and to everything our predecessors in this House sought to obtain.  I cannot find any precedent for these provisions&mdash;the provisions themselves are setting a precedent.  For the sake of the patriots who were responsible for the establishment of this House and for giving us a free Government we should show our respect for their memory in a manner of which they would be proud&mdash;not in the way outlined in this Bill.  I doubt if they ever thought the assembly they set up would one day put legislation of this nature on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Many people have expressed very strong opinions on this section and I understand it is proposed to make an approach to the President not to sign the Bill.  I have been a Member of this House for ten years and I cannot recall an action such as this in that time, nor do I know of an occasion when the President was asked not to sign a Bill.</P>
    <P>I have yet to meet the &ldquo;average man&rdquo; mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary who considers that this Bill or this section is necessary.  The defence used by most of the speakers opposite in regard to this section has been in connection with squatting in local authority houses.  It has been pointed out by many speakers that there are provisions already in the 1970 Housing Act to deal with this matter.  That Act was passed more than 12 months ago and it would be interesting to know how many prosecutions the local authorities have found necessary to <Col N="2782" /> bring in this regard.  I doubt if there has been one case in the past year. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government is present in the House and I would ask him if he knows of even one such case.</P>

      <P>No, I am reffering to prosecutions under a section of the Housing Act, 1970.  The section was passed to deal with squatting in local authority houses.  All the speakers on the Government side have quoted this type of squatting as their defence of this Bill but they must be unaware of the terms of the Housing Act, 1970.  I would not accuse them of telling untruths&mdash;therefore, we must put it down to ignorance of the provisions of the Act.  We are told that all legislation introduced in this House is fully discussed and agreed upon by the Fianna Fáil Party but yet we see some of the Fianna Fáil Members speaking in this House, apparently ignorant of the provisions of an Act passed last year.</P>
      <P>The section I have been referring to is subsection (7) of section 62 of the Housing Act, 1966, as amended by section 13 (2) of the Housing Act, 1970.  This section was introduced to deal with this awful problem with regard to local authority housing as described by Government speakers.

No matter what arguments are advanced by the other side we just do not know what type of Government we will have in the years ahead.  We would hope that it would be much better and much more enlightened than the present Government, but provisions like this can be very dangerous when they are written into the Statute Book.  I do not know whether or not this is relevant, but this morning I was looking at a newspaper and I saw there a picture of the man on trial in the Sudan for his alleged part in a conspiracy there.  The President of the Sudan was showing him a paper on which were written the names of certain people and it was alleged that the defendant had written the names down.  This appeared to me to be the only proof that these people had against this defendant.  I think that defendant was hanged this morning. I am not suggesting that would be the evolution here, but it proves the point.</P>

      <P>A number of names written on a piece of paper was sufficient to hang this man.  It was sufficient to have him executed.  As I say, this is setting a precedent.  We can condemn that type of justice, if you like, but the retort could very easily be: &ldquo;You have something on your Statute Book which gives you the power to convict people of serious offences simply by producing something they wrote and interpreting it in a way to suit yourself.&rdquo;  This is what this section is all about.  The Government can interpret statements as encouraging or advocating offences under section 2 and section 3 of this Bill. <Col N="2784" /> According to today's paper, names written on a piece of paper were obviously interpreted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>This precedent now being created in this section will not, of course, be used only against the news media.  It will also be used against all forms of organisation and association. The right to associate and the right to use strength of numbers to get a point of view across is one that was dearly fought for and dearly won.  The right of association, the right to come together to express a view or make a point, is the only way in which many people can have their views expressed. Most people cannot afford to buy space in a newspaper to publish their views.  They cannot afford to print handbills or other hand-outs.  The only way they can express their views and their opinions is by forming associations. Under this section these organisations and associations will be subject to serious limitations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not yet seen any evidence to prove that newspapers or journalists acted irresponsibly.  There are so many laws editors have to watch and so many provisions in our legislation of which they must take cognisance that it must be a nightmare for them when it comes to giving the paper the final OK.  By and large, they do their work <Col N="2785" /> very conscientiously.  If anything slips through, if any inconvenience is caused or any harm done to an individual or group, they are very quick to correct it and apologise.</P>
    <P>Listening to some of the speakers on the Government benches one would think we were dealing with a crowd of irresponsible journalists and irresponsible editors who printed anything and everything, who advocated and encouraged all kinds of criminal activity and all kinds of offences and, because of that, this House has to go on meeting into the month of August in order to curb these activities.  Of course that is not the case.  It never was the case and I believe it never will be the case.</P>
    <P>This amendment is so important and the precedent established in the section is so important that I think the Taoiseach himself, as head of the Government, should come in here and explain to us if he has information which justifies this section.  It is incumbent on him to come in here and tell us why his Government and his Minister for Justice are pressing the provisions in this section.  This is not an idle demand.  It is a fair demand.  This Bill has taken up more of the time of this House than any other Bill.  It has taken up more time than any other measure that we have had for many years.  Because of that and because of the fears and reservations expressed, not alone here but by every newspaper, national and local, and many organisations, it is about time that the Taoiseach himself came in to explain and try to justify this section which nobody has yet justified.  I hope he will avail of the opportunity.</P>
    <P>It is hard to reconcile the urgency the Government now attach to this Bill with their attitude towards it for the past 12 months.  I believe the Minister for Justice deliberately held over the Bill with the consent of the Government, that there was a conspiracy, as it were, to let the Bill lie low during the session and bring in the final Stages of it in the last few weeks of the session in the hope that it would be rushed through.  The Government were fully aware of the repressive nature of the Bill and of the fact that it would curtail the freedom of the Press, and <Col N="2786" /> create many bad legal precedents and because of this they decided on this way of getting it through.</P>

      <P>I was trying to find that date.  The Second Stage was taken on 27th January, and we are now here in July discussing a short Bill of only ten sections.  There were not many amendments on the Committee Stage and not very many on the Report Stage. The point the Parliamentary Secretary has helped me in making is that the Government deliberately dragged feet on this measure not because they did not want it passed but because they wanted it passed in a way that would not be noticed by too many Deputies and in such a way that, perhaps, the news media would not discover its various provisions.  That is perhaps why it was allowed to lie dormant.  The Second Stage was taken in January, even though the Bill's provisions were known last July or possibly earlier. They played the game, as it were, in such a way that the Bill would have to be rushed through in the last few weeks of the session.</P>

      <P>That is all I wish to say on this amendment.  There are further amendments to come on section 4 and we intend to devote as much energy and emphasis to the other amendments as we have to this amendment because at this stage it must be obvious to the Government that they should put this Bill into cold storage and it might happen, as in the case of other Bills, that they will forget to bring it out.  This Government must <Col N="2789" /> hold a record for legislation passed through this House that subsequently proved to be unconstitutional.  When legislation is declared to be unconstitutional the Government's defence is that the legislation had been rushed through for one reason or another, and therefore, they could not be blamed for having overlooked something.  I do not think the Government should try to break their own record of having unconstitutional legislation passed by the House.  They should not endeavour to surpass their own record in that regard.</P>
      <P>I would appeal once again, as I have done on the other amendments, that the Government should change their attitude on this amendment and adopt a reasonable and sensible approach.</P>

      <P>As I come from a rural area, I should say a few words on this amendment.  First of all, I should like to say that all Members of this House are tired after a tough, hard year of parliamentary work and now we have reached the 28th July and the business of the House still goes on. That is something which very seldom happens.  It is very unfair to people who have given good service, who have worked hard on behalf of their constituents. Many Deputies come from rural areas.  There are many Deputies who are not professional people and who have to look after their farms down the country and have many commitments, particularly at this time of the year.  Here we are, having to take part in this discussion on this Bill.  This is brought about by the fact that the Government did not deal with this matter at an earlier stage.  It is a pity that people should have to be here at this time.  We are all very disappointed. However, I say that we will stay here, we will continue to come here, while this Bill is before the House and when the time comes to vote on it we will be here to vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The time of this House could be much more usefully employed than in discussing this Bill. We have listened to a debate that has lasted for months.  Every weekend when Deputies received the Order Paper for the following week, the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill was bound to be down for discussion.  Here we are today just the same as we were when it began.</P>
      <P>As representing the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, I can say that the people there consider that we would be much more usefully employed in discussing and airing the grievances of our constituents instead of talking about squatting, fish-ins, land agitation and all the problems involved in this debate. There are many more important problems that could be discussed here. There are many matters that might usefully be brought to the notice of the Government but for the fact that the debate on this Bill has been so prolonged and tedious.</P>
      <P>We have heard quite an amount of talk about this Bill.  I wonder what would have happened to the farmers if this Bill had been passed before they went out in protest against the treatment that was being meted out to them.  I wonder would they have been free to call on the various local authorities and make their protest. Would they have been free to bring to the notice of the Department that they were being treated unjustly?  Would they have succeeded in getting about £2 million in agricultural grants if this Bill had been in operation at that time?  I doubt it very much.  They would have been prosecuted, first of all, for any such demonstration and the Press certainly would not and could not have given any publicity to an organisation of that sort.  That is where the Press comes in.  That is where the Bill would be detrimental to the running of the country, to the working of the Press and the working of organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about our Macra na Feirme organisations who have to go out and <Col N="2791" /> protest?  What about our Beet Growers Association who have been forced to go out and protest against the treatment being meted out to them in regard to prices and in many other ways?  What about the Creamery Milk Suppliers Association who have only recently been on strike?  All those people could be prosecuted.  If one of them was prosecuted nobody in the next village to where he lived would know what had happened because the Press could not publish it.  If they did they would be brought to court.  None of us would know what was happening in the parishes adjacent to where we live.  That would be very strange to the people of this country who are so well informed through the Press, the radio and television.  Take for instance the people down the country who listen every night to &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo;. In the most remote parts of the country they can tell you what happens in the Dáil and in the Seanad.  Those are things which have us here tonight and we will stay here until a vote is taken and until this amendment on section 4 is debated to the full.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to say that during my time in public life I have always felt that the Press were very fair to the people when they went out to report on happenings throughout the country.  I wonder what would happen in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim if the <i>Sligo Champion</i> and the <i>Leitrim Observer</i> were not free to publish what they think should be published. I would like to know how the people of that constituency would get the news if the pressmen were not free to give the news in their own way.  I have always found that they travel at great inconvenience to themselves and in all types of weather to report cases and I have never heard the people complain about the treatment they receive from the Press.  Many times a person would be more than grateful to the Press because he might have said something at a meeting which he was sorry about afterwards but the next <Col N="2792" /> day he would say: &ldquo;Thanks to the pressmen; they used their discretion, instead of publishing what I said.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Government need have no fear of the Press going out to publish articles in relation to this Bill.  The Press will do their duty, they will give the people the true picture.  It would be too bad that any pressman after travelling a journey of 40 miles and more to cover some case should be afraid coming back if he had something with him which would involve him in a legal case.  We have Deputies here who were made Ministers shortly after they were elected.  They have been a long time in office and they have reached the stage when power can go to their heads.  This is what has happened in regard to this Bill.  The Minister is trying to push it through so that he can muzzle the Press and deny the people the information they are entitled to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a long debate and I think the length of it indicates the significance of what is encompassed by the amendment.  It would be no harm at this point to recap on the section as originally drafted and how we would hope it would read by the addition of this amendment.  The section provides in subsection (1):</P>
      <P>A person who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence under section 2 or 3 of this Act shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>The actual forcible occupants are dealt with in sections 2 and 3, and this section as far as we can gather is designed to get at the backroom subversives, to use the term used opposite. However, in its design it is unfortunately drawn too widely and it can involve innocent people.  In particular it can get at innocent journalists doing their job of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw attention to the unusual wording of this subsection.  It makes a person who encourages or advocates certain things guilty of a criminal offence.  The Minister's excuse for using these words is that they are merely the old offence of incitement in modern terms.  I submit <Col N="2793" /> that these words &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; and &ldquo;advocate&rdquo; have been chosen very deliberately.  Parliamentary documents are not drafted off the top of somebody's head.  They are drafted with full consciousness of what the words contained in them mean or what the words in them can mean.  I have not the slightest doubt that instead of relying on the existing offence of incitement, there is a clear intention in this section to create a totally new offence, the offence of encouraging or advocating.</P>
    <P>They are two common words of everyday usage and as such are capable of an immense variety of meaning, each one of which as the section stands drafted could involve the person charged with the commission of a criminal offence.  There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that as drafted this section would effectively gag the Press and radio and television commentators from exercising their rights of commenting on matters of great social importance.</P>
    <P>Once the section can have that effect it behoves this House as the guardian of the rights of all the persons making up our society, to examine with the utmost care and to decide very carefully whether this House wants such a section to become part of its statute law.  In making that examination this House was quite entitled to consider the section in the context of our society and in particular in the context of a democracy because that is the political society which is contained in this State&mdash;a representative democracy.</P>
    <P>The difficulties of ensuring that a democracy will always be a real democracy were adequately demonstrated during the debate.  Deputy Browne articulated very eloquently and intelligently what to my mind is a built-in dilemma within the democratic ideal in that a democracy contains within itself the seeds of its own destruction.  By reason of being free and by reason of freedom being the hallmark of democracy, if that freedom should be abused then that freedom which the democracy supports and sustains could possibly become warped and could possibly destroy that democracy, and the delimma of the people <Col N="2794" /> charged with preserving that democracy, essentially Parliament in the first instance, but happily the judiciary as well, is to see that the delimma remains balanced so that our society never gets caught on either of its horns.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in the course of the debate that at times in the past there have been tendencies away from the essential qualities of a democracy &mdash;that all the parties in this House have suffered from those tendencies.  I think that is true in relation to the party opposite.  The point was made that because of their origin they have never really become immersed in the true spirit of democracy and that that occasionally breaks out in a manifestation such as is displayed in this subsection.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made in relation to this party because of a movement of the thirties.  One can only judge that movement now; a person of my age can judge it only from what I hear of it and read of it.  Those who want to condemn it do so in outright terms as being fascist in its development and tendencies.  On the other hand, there are those who lived through it and who knew it who hold that it served a very great need.  That movement expressed in physical terms the dilemma of a democracy to which I have referred&mdash;how far you can go one side or the other and how is the balance to be kept.</P>
    <P>As far as I can gather, the condemnation of that movement has come mainly from a narrow viewpoint&mdash; narrow in the sense that it is nearly invariably metropolitan, and narrow in the sense that because it is metropolitan it has not got the perspective necessary to judge a movement which grew out of an involved time and out of very honourable motives.  Indeed in years to come it may be said that the efforts of the trade unions in regard to the visit of the Springboks could also have been a movement with vast overtones&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because it sought in its own way to deflect persons over whom it had certain powers from exercising <Col N="2795" /> their privileges in a way that movement did not like.  History will be the judge.  We who lived through it are not prepared to condemn it, but in 40 years time, looking back on it in the same way as looking back on the so-called Blueshirt movement, there may be a different perspective.</P>
      <P>We can see from these examples that the idea of democracy is an involved one.  It is an idea that has within itself these contradictions.  Because it has within itself these contradictions, we here in this Parliament must be constantly on the alert to remind ourselves of the nature of the thing, and when we see something which might adversely affect us, as we see it in this section, it is our solemn duty to protest and that is what we on this side of the House have been doing in connection with this amendment.  We have been registering our protest at what we feel has within it something inimical to the idea of democracy as we know it.</P>
      <P>The party opposite is not prepared to see it in that light.  They are not prepared to see it as a threat to the Press, and, consequently, because it is a threat to the Press, as a threat to one of the institutions which is most powerful in preserving democracy.  We see it in that light and for that reason this amendment is being supported at length in the hope that the spirit behind it and all that it entails will come out and in the coming out be recognised and accepted.  It would appear in so far as this House is concerned that that hope in relation to our friends on the opposite side will not be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had some defences of the section as drafted from the opposite side.  The main burden of the defence of the section must naturally rest with the Minister, and it is enlightening to examine the defences which he puts forward to his section as drafted. Before I deal with those defences I should just like to remind you again of this section and the amendment. The section states that a person who encourages or advocates forcible entry or occupation commits an offence.  The amendment seeks to change that so <Col N="2796" /> that a person who is a newspaper reporter or a television or a radio commentator or journalist cannot be found guilty of that offence.</P>
    <P>The first point in the Minister's defence is that the offence related by this section is, in effect, the offence of incitement, which is an offence of long standing.  The Minister is saying that all that the section does is set out the existing offence of incitement in modern terms.  I would take issue with the Minister there on two scores.  If this is merely the offence of incitement or if this is merely the offence that the Minister wanted to see, there is no need for this subsection; the offence of incitement is an offence already well known, clearly defined and easily recognisable by the courts.  If it is people that incite crime the Minister wants to pursue, I submit to him that this section is unnecessary.  He recognises the force of that argument by saying that it is merely incitement in modern dress.  Again, I would take issue with him and submit that his section, as drafted, creates an entirely new offence, the offence of encouraging or advocating.  This is a matter which will be debated at length very shortly when the next amendment is moved.  It is dishonest for the Minister to pretend that this is the old offence of incitement dressed in modern language. It is a totally new offence and I submit that the Minister knows this well.</P>
    <P>The Minister also makes the point in his reply to our case that the Opposition are frightening the Press, that they have stampeded the Press into imagining dreadful consequences for themselves, and that this attitude on the part of the Press is quite unnecessary. I think the Minister is doing the intelligence of the Press less than justice to put forward such an argument.  To suggest that merely because the Opposition put forward an amendment on the grounds that the section sought to be amended could muzzle the Press, the Press accepted that willy nilly and panicked, is a naïve argument by the Minister and I do not think it can hold.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that the Press would not commit an offence if they approved of, for example, the <Col N="2797" /> movement to protect Georgian buildings by squatting in them.  He said the only way that one can commit the offence of incitement or an offence under section 4, which is precisely the same thing, but which I submit is totally different, is by encouraging or advocating the commission of an indictable crime, and to suggest that saying one favours the preservation of Georgian buildings and that one is against them being knocked down would be a crime is wrong.  It is quite clear from the speech made by Deputy FitzGerald that the Press could not help committing a crime if this Bill had been on the Statute Book at the time of the Hume Street occupation.  There is not the slightest doubt that the persons who protected those buildings were in forcible occupation and were encouraged in their forcible occupation by the Press.</P>
    <P>If this section had been law at that time, every newspaper that wrote an editorial or article in favour of those students or published a picture or a cartoon to help their cause would have been guilty of serious offences under this measure.  It is dishonest for the Minister to say that those newspapers would not have been committing an offence.  Quite clearly they would. Once that is clear this amendment should be accepted without question. The Minister's argument is invalid and does not carry any weight whatever.</P>
    <P>The Minister says, too, that a number of conditions have to be complied with before these offences can be committed, that is, the offences of forcible occupation and forcible entry.  To say that vague or general encouragement or protest movements or even squatting <i>simpliciter</i> constitute a crime is at variance with the facts.  I take issue with the Minister on that statement.  He has no authority for it.  There is no logic in it.  His sentiments are inexplicable because I would give him the credit of not wanting the Press to be guilty of the crime of encouraging squatting <i>simpliciter</i>.  I cannot really give him credit because the Minister must know that an encouragement of what he calls squatting <i>simpliciter</i> has <Col N="2798" /> to be caught by this section as drafted. I fail to see what sort of a situation could be covered by the term &ldquo;squatting <i>simpliciter</i>&rdquo;.  One can envisage an unopposed entry so that the squatting might not be forcible and, consequently, might not be an offence.  As soon as those persons lock a door or bar a window behind them they are in forcible occupation.  It is utterly unrealistic to talk of squatting <i>simpliciter.</i> Once a person other than the owner as defined by this section enters a premises he can hardly fail to avoid committing an offence.  It follows that any encouragement or advocacy in connection therewith must also be an offence. It is absurd on the part of the Minister to suggest that squatting <i>simpliciter</i> and encouragement will not be an offence.  Such a situation in realistic terms cannot arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister and other speakers on the benches opposite made great play of the fact that the amendment exempts newspaper journalists and radio and television journalists, and asks what is the logic of exempting journalists in television with an audience of many hundreds of thousands at their command, while the street-corner orator with a small audience would be guilty of an offence for saying precisely the same things.  That is agreed if the offence is one of encitement. The Minister based his question on his proposition that the offence created here is one of incitement.  I would again submit to the Minister that there is a new offence here, which <i>prima facie</i> derogates from the right to comment, and that is the logic on which I would rely for distinguishing the street-corner orator from the newspaper or radio or television journalist. In terms of right to comment, which is the most important?&mdash;the person on the street corner with his limited audience or the influential newspaper or television station?  There is, of course, no comparison.  This gets back to the whole root of our objection to this section.  As drafted it inhibits free comment by Press and television.  It is unfair and unrealistic of the Minister to equate a street-corner orator with the responsible journalist and to use that as an argument against the differential <Col N="2799" /> which is implicit in this amendment but which is unavoidable and which I am prepared to stand over.</P>
    <P>The amendment would allow a pamphleteer to escape and it is suggested that it is not logical that he should escape.  I would remind those who made this point that the most famous document in our history was a pamphlet&mdash;the Proclamation of 1916. I certainly would make no apology if pamphleteers and writers of broadsheets were protected by my amendment. A point remarkably unsympathetic to newspapers was made.  It was said that in the period 1916 to 1921 the newspapers were inimical to the cause of freedom.  I would answer that by asking &ldquo;Do we now punish them in 1971 by allowing a law to slip through which would have the effect of inhibiting their comment on matters of social importance?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the speakers on behalf of the Government was Deputy O'Kennedy, who commenced his speech and I presume his defence, by dealing at fair length with the previous amendment on which Fine Gael abstained.  I can see no logic in that, except, perhaps, that it showed a dearth of ideas.  Time had to be filled somehow.  The Parliamentary Secretary criticised the contribution of Deputy Cruise-O'Brien and his only reference to the amendment came at column 1791 of the Official Report of the 16th July when he stated that we were being asked to distinguish between verbal incitement and written incitement.  Again, this is a fallacious point because it is based on the fallacy that what this section contains is the offence of incitement.  I have already demonstrated that this is not true.  The point consequently has no validity. The amendment distinguishes between verbal and written encouragement or advocacy because the whole point of the amendment is to preserve the right to comment which might involve within its terms encouragement or advocacy.</P>
    <P>One can easily imagine a cartoon, indeed there are causes enough for it around the city today, designed to highlight the spending of scarce capital. It could show, for example, a mother and children in destitute circumstances, <Col N="2800" /> watching perhaps the erection of an office block or a luxury hotel. There might be a caption on it to indicate their frame of mind, wondering whether they would or would not enter.  As drafted that cartoon could be an offence under this section.</P>
    <P>I defy the Minister and anyone on that side of the House to say that that is not the true position under this section. If all this section sets out to do is to ensure that the offence of incitement applies to the substance of offences under sections 2 and 3 it is quite a simple thing for the Minister to have used the word &ldquo;incite&rdquo; instead of the words &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; or &ldquo;advocate&rdquo;, but this is something which we will have to debate in more detail on the next amendment.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that Deputy Fitzpatrick put the papers above Parliament. As he has not the right to speak again I would like to put the record straight by referring to column 1737 of the Official Report of 15th July, 1971, where he said:</P>
    <P>I believe that the free Press of a country is a greater bulwark against the infringement of the constitutional rights and the ordinary rights and privileges of the citizens of a country than Parliament itself.  It is possible to have a position in Parliament, as we have at the moment, where the Government have an absolute majority and are united superficially and numerically at any rate and as long as they are they can steamroll their will through this House.</P>
    <P>That is a very far cry from saying he is putting the papers above Parliament. He is saying that in our present political circumstances our newspapers are a greater guarantee of a person's freedom than Parliament, and regrettably this is so.</P>
    <P>Parliament should be the guarantee of our freedom in the sense that it should never pass a law which might inhibit that freedom because Parliament in theory is representative of the people and it is illogical for the people to want to inhibit their own freedom but unfortunately the party system has intervened.  I concede we must have the party system if we are <Col N="2801" /> not to break up into groups with vested interests or caucuses or cliques. I would submit the party system is being abused in this country at the moment because there is what I would term a mechanical majority for whatever proposition the Executive chooses to put before Parliament. That is the situation we have at the moment and so long as we have that situation we must look to the Press as being a greater guarantee of our freedom than this Parliament.  It is a regrettable situation but that is the realism of the situation at the moment.  As it is the situation, we on this side of the House become apprehensive and nervous, if not downright fearful of any piece of legislation which might inhibit the first guarantor of our freedom&mdash;the Press.</P>
    <P>The proposition was put from the other side, and this is indicative of the collective personality of the other side in relation to this idea of Press freedom, that there are many reasons why there should be some slight limitation in the scope in regard to the sources of information.  This was in the context that the real guardians and the real authority over the Press, radio and television are the readers and the listening and watching public, but if they are not, there should be a limitation by whom, to what <Col N="2802" /> extent, for how long and in what regard?  This is the danger that I see here in this section as drafted.  It shows a frame of mind careless of or unappreciative of the nature of our society and on how essentially fragile a thing freedom can be.</P>
    <P>This carelessness or deliberate antipathy&mdash;there is both within the opposite benches&mdash;has an unfortunate tradition within that party.  It is something that we on this side of the House have to be constantly on the alert for and constantly guarding against.  When we see a piece of legislation like this it is our duty to protest. Our protests may fall on deaf ears, our protests may be shrugged aside with illogical arguments, our protests may be put aside by personal attacks on the protesters, we will always be disappointed but never surprised because the personality of the founder is still stamped on that party opposite and I quote from the Official Report, Volume 26, column 671, where Uachtarán na hÉireann said:</P>
    <P>We know quite well that the newspapers constitute the great bulk of the reading of our people at the present day, and that public taste has largely been depraved as a result of that.</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 34, to delete &ldquo;encourages or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I hope, Sir, before I sit down to convince the House and the Minister that bad and all as this section would be with these words omitted it would be intolerable with these words in it.  I propose to explain to the House the effect of section 4 in relation to sections 2 and 3.  On a number of occasions since this debate began the Minister, for want of a relevant argument, thought it necessary to refer to the Second Reading of the Prisons Bill on the 26th May, 1970 and to a contribution made by me on that Bill as spokesman for this party.  The Minister's copy of the Official Report of 26th May, 1970, has become somewhat soiled because he has handed it around to several Members on the back benches to read and discuss in the House.  I wish to put on record now once more my contribution as quoted by the Minister.  At column 110, Volume 247, of the Official Report of 26th May, 1970, I stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have very unsettled conditions, restless conditions; the nation is perturbed by crime of all descriptions, ranging from armed bank robberies resulting in the death of police officers, to what might be regarded as something less, in the form of sit-in protests, fish-in protests, protests of one sort or another.  I do not intend to dwell on this at any length but I think the toleration of the taking over of public or private buildings, whether as sit-ins under the auspices of cultural or architectural <Col N="2805" /> activities or sit-ins in protest against lack of housing or fish-ins as a national protest is nothing short of tolerating anarchy and can lead only to total disrespect for the law and to the common commission of more serious acts of violence.  It is bound to generate disrespect for the law and for public and private property.  I hope that the Minister, in entering his office, will tackle these problems as they should be tackled because they have been overlooked and tolerated for too long.</P>
    <P>I wish to state that I stand over every sentence in that statement.  If the Minister's fine-comb brigade had gone through Parliamentary questions around that time they would have found interjections from me would bear out what I said then.  The Minister would not find it necessary to go back to the discussion on the Prisons Bill, 1970, to discover my sentiments on this matter.  He could have found them in the Second Reading debate of the Bill now under discussion when I said that my party accepted in principle sections 2 and 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister or his researchers to find any contribution of mine in the Official Reports which invited the Minister to muzzle the Press, invited him to create the offence of guilt by association, or approved of the far-fetched and dangerous definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; as defined in section 1.  I defy the Minister or anyone on his behalf to point out to me where at any time I even hinted the Press should be muzzled, that there should be guilt by association or that &ldquo;owner&rdquo; should mean an absentee landlord who was never entitled to occupation of the property. That is what section 4 is about. The fact that the Minister had to resort to quoting from a debate on the Prisons Bill for an argument shows how he lacks an argument to justify some of the preposterous proposals in this Bill.  The most preposterous section in the Bill is section 4.  We have always believed in an orderly society but this Bill has gone too far.</P>

For that reason the Minister should listen to me and other speakers on this side of the House who tell him he has gone much too far, has gone unnecessarily and dangerously too far, in the Bill he has introduced, particularly in section 4.

Section 4 of the Bill, as at present drafted, seeks to make it an offence to encourage or advocate the commission of an offence under section 2 or section 3 of this Bill.  Section 2, as we know, is the section which makes it an offence for a person to forcibly enter land or a vehicle and section 3 is the section which makes it an offence for a person to remain in forcible occupation of land or a vehicle.  As I have said, section 4 makes it an offence to encourage any of these offences under subsection (1).  Subsection (2) of section 4 says:</P>
      <P>Where a statement in contravention of subsection (1) of this section is made by or on behalf of a group of persons, every person who is a member of the group and who consented to the making of the statement shall be guilty of an offence under that subsection.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yes, and I must show how the section as a whole is very dangerous unless my amendment is accepted and that will be the whole basis of my argument. Now it has been stated from the Government benches by various speakers at different times that section 4 does not refer to the news media and that it does not refer to television or radio. The Minister said that.  Some other speakers behind the Minister also said it.  I was surprised when I heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education repeating it.  Of <Col N="2808" /> course, this section applies to the news media and it does mean that, by taking a particular stand on a particular topic which might be agitating the public mind, the national or provincial newspapers could be guilty, indeed, would be guilty, of the offence of encouraging a crime under section 2 or section 3. I do not think the Minister can seriously deny that.  When he quoted my prisons speech, and when I asked him did I invite him to muzzle the Press, he replied: &ldquo;There is not one word about the Press in section 4.&rdquo; I defy the Minister, when he intervenes in this debate, if he does intervene, to argue that section 4 is not a net which catches the Press, which catches the radio and which catches television. Surely to goodness, it might be argued that there is no more powerful way of encouraging somebody to do something than by conducting a campaign in a newspaper.  Thanks be to goodness, we have been blessed in this country with a responsible Press, both national and provincial, which has behaved magnificently all down the years and which has risen to the occasion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I will.  And then he goes on to trot out some of the misrepresentations he made here to the effect that we were creating a new offence in our amendment No. 7 when, in fact and in truth, we were excluding the mass media from the clause in the Minister's section 4.  There is no doubt, as the Minister well knows, that section 4 is a section calculated to intimidate the Press, to threaten the Press and to make the Press be careful lest they should be guilty of the offence of encouraging crime of one sort or another.</P>
      <P>Mark you, I have no personal animosity towards the Minister, none whatever, and I have never said anything personal to him or against him since he came into this House but, if I were a newspaper editor, he is not the type of man I should like to have in a position to muzzle me, or in a position to tell me what to write or what not to write, and I do not think that can be regarded as a personal statement. I think the Minister demonstrated clearly and very forcefully in this House on 13th July, when speaking to his elder and respected colleague, Deputy de Valera, that he is not the type of man who should be put in a position to check the Press.  That is not too strong a word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, during this debate, we attempted to delete section 4 entirely from this Bill.  On the Committee Stage we put down an amendment.  We opposed the section.  We voted against it.  We did not think this is the type of section that should be in any legislation passed by a democratic assembly <Col N="2810" /> in the year 1971; but, despite our best efforts, the Minister, by his majority, successfully resisted our efforts to delete section 4.  On Committee Stage of this Bill such were our views about section 4 that we did not seek to amend it.  I do not think it can properly be amended.  The only way to deal with it is to cut it out and remove it from the Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We did not succeed.  We put that to a vote.  Such are the rules of procedure that we cannot again oppose it <i>in toto</i> on the Report Stage; it would not be in order, the matter having being decided on Committee Stage. Therefore, we did the next best thing. In amendment No. 7 we attempted to exclude the Press, radio and television from the offence of encouraging the commission of a crime.  We hope to do that again in amendments Nos. 9 and 10.  I cannot honestly believe that the Minister will get responsible members of his party to make a reasoned argument here against amendments Nos. 9 and 10 or vote against them, but if I were to discuss these amendments now I should be out of order because they have not been reached.  We must lose no opportunity of ensuring that this objectionable section 4 will be amended if it must remain in the Bill.  We want to ensure that the rights of the Press, among other rights, are protected. There are many other rights involved and I shall deal with them in detail later.  There are the rights of Deputies in this House, the rights of local representatives on county councils and corporations and local authorities that we are told so much about.  But we want to protect the rights of the Press to report and comment on matters of public importance.</P>
      <P>Again, the Minister has successfully resisted our efforts to amend the Bill on Report Stage.  This amendment proposes to delete two words, &ldquo;encourages or&rdquo;.  At present subsection (1) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who encourages or advocates the commission of an <Col N="2811" /> offence under section 2 or 3 of this Act shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>I clearly understand what the word &ldquo;advocate&rdquo; means; it means to call upon somebody to do something, to call on somebody to take forcible possession of, or sit in.  I do not know what the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; means. It is a vague word that can mean anything&mdash;to hearten, to inspirit, to comfort, vague things like that.  I was at a considerable loss to know where this word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; came from. I am sufficiently experienced in the law&mdash;in a general sort of way I hasten to add&mdash;and in Parliamentary activities in a general sort of way to know that people who are drafting things look for precedents.  The Minister knows that in a solicitor's office, if somebody is drafting an agreement which he did not come across before, he will say: &ldquo;Would my uncle or my grandfather or somebody ever have had anything like this?&rdquo; And he will look up old cases.  If he cannot find what he wants he will go to an encyclopedia of precedents where he will find something that will help.  I imagine Parliamentary draftsmen work on some similar basis having been instructed, of course, by the Government on the type of legislation they are expected to draft and on the type of sections they are to put into that legislation.</P>
    <P>I did some considerable research on this matter and if I had the Minister's facilities I should probably have done much more.  I went through the Acts since the foundation of the State and the only Act I found that contained the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; was the Offences Against the State Act, 1939. That leads me to believe that this Bill is patterned on that Act.  This Bill is introduced to deal with a nuisance, an objectionable nuisance, I agree, but a nuisance.  It is not a Bill introduced to deal with any extremely serious offences.  I find that the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; appears in section 6 (2) of the Offences Against the State Act which prohibits the usurpation of the functions of Government. It appears in section 7 (2) of the same Act which deals with obstruction of <Col N="2812" /> Government.  It appears in section 8 (2) of the same Act which deals with the obstruction of the President and it appears in section 9 (2) of the same Act which deals with interference with military or other employees of the State.</P>
    <P>It appears in all those sections of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, which was passed by the Oireachtas at a time of world upheaval when the second World War was either on or imminent.  I respectfully suggest that it is a classic example of the Minister and the Government proposing to put on the Statute Book what is in effect a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</P>
    <P>This word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; appears in another Act, in section 2 (1) of the Treason Act, 1939, which deals with the crime of treason and provides a penalty of £500, which was a great deal of money then, or, at the discretion of the court, sentence of penal servitude for a term not exceeding 20 years, a fairly lengthy period of time.  That in my opinion is where this word &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; comes in.  It may appear in other Acts of Parliament and if it does I am sure we will have reference to them by the Minister when he intervenes.  It certainly appears in the ones I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>It is dangerous word.  We understand what the word &ldquo;advocate&rdquo; means.  To advocate is to call on a person to do something, to say that it is right to do something, to demand that something should be done or to speak in favour of something that is being done.  One could encourage a legal squat or sit-in, forcible entry or forcible occupation in a variety of ways.  The Minister has said it has always been an offence to incite a person to commit a crime.  We agree with that but I would like the Minister and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party to consider this in a calm and collected way and try to forget that because a measure has been introduced into this House the Government's prestige is at stake and it cannot be amended substantially on principle.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, his party and the Government to consider that we are creating here a new offence or at least that we are writing into the statute law of this country in a clear and unambiguous manner the offences <Col N="2813" /> of forcible entry and forcible occupation. I do not disagree with the creation of those offences, as I have said as early as the 26th May, 1970, but we are now creating for the first time these offences.  The Minister will not get away with saying that these offences have been there at common law.  He will not even get away with saying that my esteemed colleague, Deputy Thomas F. O'Higgins, has stated they were there all the time at common law because the Minister has said that the Attorney General has said that he could not prosecute under those offences at common law and the courts would not convict anyone.  Therefore, I think the Minister and myself are <i>ad idem</i> in saying that we are now for the first time creating in an unambiguous clearly cut and defined way the offences of forcible entry and forcible occupation.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that I do not quarrel with the creation of those offences but we must remember that the offences of forcible entry and forcible occupation, which are popularly known as squatting, first emerged in recent years to draw public attention to national and social problems&mdash;the failure of the Government to deal with the housing problem, which is a national disgrace, the monopolising of the fishing waters of this country by foreign interests and the destruction of buildings of an architectural value in this city and throughout the country. These are some of the problems which have been highlighted with what will be offences under this Bill.  These are some of the topics that have been highlighted by what will be illegal squatting if this Bill goes through.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that the problems of the housing of our people, monopolising of the fishing waters of this country, the destruction of beautiful Georgian buildings in this city and buildings of architectural value throughout the country were not highlighted for the first time by these activities which the Minister is to declare illegal.  The national and provincial newspapers of this country have campaigned for years for better housing for the people.  They have campaigned for years, both in editorial comment and other comments, <Col N="2814" /> which the Minister resorts to now and again, for better housing for the people, the protection of buildings of architectural value and for the liberty of Irishmen to fish in Irish waters without the permission of foreign landlords.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the matters that have been agitating the minds of Irish people for years and some of the causes that have been championed by the newspapers of this country for years.  Are these newspapers to cry a halt to their campaign for better housing, fair play for fishing and for the preservation and protection of buildings of beauty just because somebody chooses to indulge in illegal activities to further the same campaign?  That is what we are doing here.  The newspapers have been reasonable in their campaign for years, but because somebody decides to indulge in illegal activities in furtherance of the same objectives the newspapers are being muzzled.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have made the case that the newspapers have been campaigning for those matters in a reasonable way for years.  Let us take the case of the Hume Street housing and let us assume that this Bill had been law. If the <i>Irish Independent,</i> the <i>Irish Press</i> or the <i>Irish Times</i> during the currency of the Hume Street protest had said: &ldquo;We have been calling for years for the preservation of these buildings.  We protested against the destruction of Fitzwilliam Street and the replacement of the buildings there by the ESB monstrosity but the Government did not listen to us.  Now look what has happened&rdquo;, would that not be encouraging a continuance of the Hume Street sit-in and would those newspapers not be guilty of an offence under this Bill?  I ask the Minister to reply to that in a reasoned way and I will not accept an argument from Deputy Davern&mdash;I do not think it is fair for the Minister to put in Deputy Davern&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Stick in &ldquo;inciting&rdquo; and leave out &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;.  That will meet some of my objections.  It has been difficult to get the Minister to agree to anything. Of course if I say anything in favour of the newspapers it will be said that I am looking for advertising space, but I will not follow the Minister's headline when he wrote a letter to the <i>Irish Times</i> the other day.  I will not write and tell them off if they do not publish me.  We have a responsible national Press and a responsible provincial Press.  I suppose there is no more responsible provincial newspaper and one with such a large circulation as the <i>Anglo Celt,</i> affectionately known as &ldquo;The Celt&rdquo; and published in Cavan for many years.  We are very fortunate that it is the only local newspaper coming into practically every house in Cavan.  If this section goes through, that paper will be told to catch itself on, to be careful to desist from ventilating problems that need ventilation.</P>
      <P>I have dealt at some length with the Georgian houses, with the housing problems and with the fishing disgrace, because they are things about which protests in the form of occupation of premises or land have taken place.  But it does not stop there.  I said on another amendment that the national newspapers and the provincial Press wield a bigger influence in changing Government opinion than does this Parliament and, like Deputy Cooney, I regret to have to say that is so.  We have had examples of it in the past 12 months. We had the proposal of the Government to cut off unemployment assistance for single men, urban and rural, of any age.</P>

I suggest there is no doubt in the world that following that campaign by the newspapers, in which Deputy Joe Lenehan and Deputy O'Connor and others joined, editors of newspapers could find themselves in prison.  I defy contradiction of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had here a threat of internment without trial.  Again the newspapers rose to the occasion and again I will not be misrepresented or told that we on these benches are demanding something impossible.  We are demanding the enforcement of existing law, of law available to the Minister.  We are demanding that the Garda Síochána be given free and unfettered rights to enforce the laws this Oireachtas has passed and which do not need any special resolution to bring them into force.  We believe that internment should not be enforced here until the existing law as it prevails has been enforced <Col N="2818" /> or has been seen to be unworkable.</P>
    <P>On that occasion the newspapers rose to the occasion.  When the Taoiseach in his usual waffling way, trying to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds, threatened internment, the newspapers rose magnificently to the occasion and the Taoiseach climbed down.

We know that Deputies can say what they like within the House and they are not amenable to any court in the country, civil or criminal, for it, and until the Constitution is changed that will be the law, but if a Member of this House elected by the people were to go outside and make a speech denouncing some social injustice, and if somebody, as a result of that speech, felt so strongly that he committed the offence of forcible occupation in my opinion <Col N="2819" /> that Deputy would leave himself open to the offence of encouraging, and he would be guilty of an offence for which he could be imprisoned.</P>
      <P>That is my honest belief.  The Fianna Fáil-controlled national newspaper, the <i>Irish Press,</i> believes that there is, at least, a substantial doubt about it.  I believe that that is beyond doubt and that a Deputy would be guilty of an offence and could be imprisoned.  Deputy de Valera controls the <i>Irish Press</i> and he at least believes that this point is open to argument.  He says that it should be put beyond argument.  Does any Member of the Fianna Fáil Party disagree with that as a reasonable proposition?</P>
      <P>There has been, since 1898, in this country a body of dedicated public representatives who work in the public interest without reward and who do not enjoy parliamentary immunity which Article 15 of the Constitution grants to us.  I speak of the members of the Dublin Corporation&mdash;God be good to them&mdash;the members of Cork Corporation, the county councils, the urban councils and even the town commissioners, the committees of agriculture and the vocational educational committees, all of which from time to time have considered it their duty to express their views on matters of public importance.  Their rights as legislators and creative beings have been whittled away down through the years by successive Acts passed by Fianna Fáil Governments.  It would be very difficult to know what the purpose of their existence would be if they were not allowed to talk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 of this Bill means that if a committee of agriculture, indignant at the purchasing of land in their locality by foreign speculators, were to have an animated discussion at a meeting and to say that they objected violently to the intrusion of foreign speculators while their neighbours were left with 15 or 16 acres of land, and if, as a result of a good speech properly reported in a local paper, somebody decided to stage a sit-in or forcibly enter some foreigner's farm or some farm in the course of being sold to a foreigner every member of that committee <Col N="2820" /> of agriculture would be guilty of an offence of encouraging and could be locked up in Mountjoy and would not have the protection of Article 15 of the Constitution.  Is that an unreasonable argument?  Is that an unreasonable proposition to make?  I equally believe that if a member of a housing authority were to say at a meeting it was outrageous that buildings should be converted into offices in a town where human beings were living in rat-infested hovels, that could be judged as encouraging people to take possession of a building that was proposed to be used as an office and they could be charged with an offence under this measure.</P>
    <P>I am not a scholar in English literature and I am glad we have such scholars in the House who will be able to analyse the meaning of the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;, but if it means anything in ordinary men's language&mdash;and it is ordinary men's language which will be applied in the courts because the parliamentary draftsman, acting on the instructions of the Minister for Justice, did not think it worth while to define the word in the Bill&mdash;surely it means creating a frame of mind where some people think they should do a certain thing.  Is that not a reasonable interpretation to put on it?  If a speech such as I have outlined were made at a county council meeting or such body and if possession of a proposed office block were subsequently taken and forcibly held, every member of the county council or the urban council or anyone who made a speech would be guilty of an offence, and if the law were carried out they should all be prosecuted and convicted.  The same would apply to anyone who is a member of a local authority and who feels very strongly about the fact that some fisheries are owned by foreign interests.</P>
    <P>If he were to conduct a campaign from meeting to meeting&mdash;and, indeed, outside of meetings in his capacity as a public representative&mdash;if he were to stand up outside the chapel gate on Sunday and say that these were natural assets in this country, that they were amenities that belonged to the people, that they were created by God and that they should be available to the <Col N="2821" /> people; and if as a result of that somebody said: &ldquo;There is a lot in what Councillor So-and-So said.  We will take possession of this.  We will go in and stay there and take the consequences&rdquo; and a member of the Garda Síochána asked him to account for his activities he would have to explain: &ldquo;I was at the chapel gate on Sunday and I was listening to Councillor So-and-So and I believed every word he said.&rdquo;  Would Councillor So-and-So not be charged with this vague offence of encouraging the commission of a crime?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Far be it from me to mention that man's name in this House.  It is all right for Deputy Barry.  I think a measure like this that will affect the lives of the people all over this country should be debated in a cool atmosphere and that every Member of the House, including the Members of the Fianna Fáil Party, should understand what they are being asked to vote for.  Indeed, the Members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and their supporters throughout the country are more to be pitied than laughed at during the past 12 months because they have had members of their own party speaking to them on questions of national importance in different tongues, and I am sure they find it extremely difficult to know where they are going or who to believe or what party policy is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that a general discussion on Fianna Fáil policy or the ructions within the Fianna Fáil Party would be out of order and I am not going to pursue it, but I feel bound to make some reference to the plight in which the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party must find themselves in this House. A senior member of the Government, the Minister for Finance, Deputy George Colley, went to talk in the town of Thurles to a Fianna Fáil assembly and he thought it necessary to make reference to the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation <Col N="2822" /> Bill.  It would be difficult to see how any senior member of the Government could go to any Fianna Fáil function and get away without mentioning it.  I am sure that if he did not decide he was going to catch one of these nettles the Taoiseach talks about, he would have been asked to do so before he left.  According to a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Saturday, 24th July last, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, said:</P>
    <P>The Forcible Entry Bill threatened no one but those who despise democracy, said the Minister for Finance, Mr. Colley, in Thurles last night.  The Bill was an attempt to uphold democracy by backing up law and order, he told a Fianna Fáil meeting.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>It is characteristic of our organisation that we have the courage to do what needs to be done.  Some of our political opponents whine about law and order and then scream like scalded cats when they get it.  That has been our experience with the Forcible Entry Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill, according to the Minister for Finance, affects nobody except those who attack democracy.  It offends nobody only those who despise democracy.  I can imagine some Fianna Fáil stalwarts in my constituency reading this and saying: &ldquo;Is Deputy Fitzpatrick not a terrible bowsie taking up the time of Dáil Éireann opposing section 4 of a Bill that has been brought in by Deputy Paddy Smith to uphold democracy in this country and offends nobody only fellows who want to destroy democracy?&rdquo; I would not blame him.  Would he not be expected to believe Deputy George Colley, the Minister for Finance, one of the challengers for the leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party, a decent man.  Behold the plight of the constituent who read that in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 24th July and who got the Fianna Fáil gospel of 27th July, three days later, in a leading article published with the approval of the son of the founder of the party who, he believes, saved Ireland.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I want to put this on the record because it is good:</P>
      <P>Very few pieces of draft legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I thought at first it was &ldquo;daft&rdquo; legislation, but it is &ldquo;draft&rdquo; legislation.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;have ever attracted such attention as the Forcible Entry Bill which today will apparently begin its final trundle through the Dáil.</P>
      <P>From being a proposal to deal with the circumstances created by the activities of certain persons who used the housing situation, to stage &ldquo;squats&rdquo; to further their own political ends, a situation has been allowed to develop, over the retention of a few words in section 4 of the Bill, into a massive debate on the freedom of the Press with the Government cast in the role of bogeyman seeking to undermine one of the bastions of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This should never have been allowed to happen, but it has and it is sobering to think of all the Dáil time and energy that has been devoted, not to discussing how the <Col N="2824" /> root cause of the matter, our housing problem, could be eradicated, but, when it comes down to it, nothing more than whose interpretation of the relevant section, concerning press comment, is correct, the Opposition's, or the Minister's.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Minister's interpretation is correct and that the law would be interpreted intelligently and without prejudice to responsible press coverage or comment.  But on the other hand, the future might also show that the contrary would be the case and that the law would in effect be inimical to the freedom of the Press.  This, of course, would be intolerable and when a doubt of this magnitude is raised, the sensible thing to do is to leave out the cause of the doubt.</P>
    <P>Without going into legal niceties, it should have been possible before now to devise some formula of words whereby fair comment and reportage, be it pictorial or otherwise, on a matter of public interest would not be inhibited.  Some amendments of this nature have been proposed and at the beginning of this, apparently final, passage of the Bill through the Dáil, these or some variant of them, should be put into effect.</P>
    <P>We have some enormous problems confronting us, the deteriorating situation in the North is but one. Having the Dáil's time taken up with one easily alterable section of a Bill, whose retention is being fought for and against with the ferocity of a rear guard action in the field, will not help us to deal with these problems. Let us now have that suitable alteration, and let us get on with the Nation's business.</P>

We have many examples of Ministers in this House working themselves into a white fury over the mass media.</P>
      <P>We had the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme on moneylending which if it erred at all erred in a matter of degree because it wanted to show in a theoretical manner an abuse that was in this city.  Anybody who has appeared in a play in a parochial hall knows that if one puts something on a stage at ordinary life size it will then appear much less and what had to be done was to project it to the people.  A former Minister for Justice came in here and behaved in a way which in my opinion showed that in his thinking if he could give these fellows who had put on that programme the cat o' nine tails it would not be too severe for them.  If he had had this measure at his disposal, what would he have done?  That is the situation in the light of which we must consider this word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said <i>ad nauseam</i> that it has always been a crime to incite a person to commit a crime.  I have dealt with that and I do not want to labour it again.  This is a new crime the essence of which is dealing with public opinion and something that is agitating public opinion.  Deputy Carter is here.  I hope I am not a man for saying things behind people's backs.  I listened to Deputy Carter speaking on this Bill and I get the impression that he believes that the Press can go and have gone too far, even in advertisements, sexy advertisements and so on.  He thought it should be necessary to tell them where to get off. That is what this section is all about but I do not believe that the Press of the country have reached the stage where they should be told where to get off or where they should be fettered or muzzled.  I intervened in Deputy Carter's speech because I took that to be the trend of what he was saying.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Maybe Deputy Donegan has an excuse for shooting the tinkers.  I suggest to Deputy Carter that in any of the circumstances I have mentioned if any Member of this House were to make a speech of the nature I have mentioned, he could, under section 4 of this Bill, be charged with incitement, <Col N="2831" /> with advocating and certainly with encouraging the commission of these crimes.  That is what I am apprehensive of.  In dealing with a contribution of mine on the definition of ownership, the Minister for Justice was kind enough to say that he had given it great thought because he accepted that I was gravely concerned with the matter. I am speaking about section 4 in the same frame of mind in which I spoke on that occasion which was on the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I must say that the Minister for Justice has made it impossible for Deputies to go along with him in the general principle of this Bill which is supposed to protect the occupier of property because first, it does not give immunity to the occupier of property and, secondly, it has this notorious section taken practically <i>in toto</i> from the Offences Against the State Act of 1939 and the Treason Act of the same year which seeks to restrict Press comment on matters of public interest.  It seeks to create the offence of guilt by association and to make it an offence for a person to be a member of a group if any member of that group commits an offence in violation of this section, unless that member gives a satisfactory explanation to the court; no matter what explanation he gives to the court if the court is satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances, it may accept the fact that he was a member of the group, or the association, as a fact that he consented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are my reasons for urging that this amendment is necessary.  I shall find it necessary later on to urge that amendments Nos. 9 and 10 are equally necessary and I think that this House would be guilty of a terrible dereliction of duty in letting this Bill on to the Statute Book as it is at present. We may be accused of making lengthy speeches, of making irrelevant speeches, but when we find members of the Government going into the country and making speeches such as that which the Minister for Finance made in Thurles, then the necessity can be seen for prolonging this debate and ensuring that at least the record is there <Col N="2832" /> to show that we appreciate what is at stake here and that we have done everything we can to prevent this section remaining in the Bill.  We are doing no more than our duty and we will continue to do it.</P>

      <P>We in the Labour Party have great pleasure in supporting this amendment.  It seems to us that this is possibly the key amendment on the key word of this Bill.  This, in general, is a most objectionable Bill.  Section 4 is the most objectionable section and the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; with all it implies is the most objectionable word in this objectionable section of an objectionable Bill.  We think this amendment is of the highest importance.  It is the critical amendment, perhaps, of all the amendments tabled to Section 4.  We have been led by words pronounced by the Minister here today to entertain some hope that the Government may at last be coming to their senses and that this whole section will be withdrawn.</P>

As it happens I had tried to deal with this question earlier in this debate.  If I may refer the House to the Official Report for Friday, 16th July, last, Volume 255, column 1755.</P>

None of us, and I am sure that this applies to the Fine Gael Deputies, too, wishes to protract unnecessary debate.  That <Col N="2833" /> is not what we are doing here.  We are in earnest, we are fighting an objectionable section of an objectionable Bill.  The question has been raised, and I think this was a legitimate question for the Minister to raise: &ldquo;What would you do if I dropped section 4?&rdquo; In advance of his having raised that I referred to this possibility at the column reference I have just given.  I referred to members of the Government who, I believed, disapproved and still do disapprove in their hearts of this iniquitous, unnecessary section of this unnecessary Bill.</P>

      <P>I said to those members of the Government whom I believe to be alive to the real dangers in this Bill that these are not only dangers to the public but they are dangers of a kind which affect this <Col N="2834" /> Government much more directly.  They are not worried about dangers to the public.  There are dangers to this Government in this Bill.  These are not what we are worried about but they must be worried as they see the Press they are getting and they are increasingly bound to get on this matter so I appealed to them in the public interest, not in a specific Opposition interest, but in the public interest to drop this section.  I went on to say:</P>
      <P>I do not say that if they drop this section or if they accept this and the following amendments we shall drop our opposition to this Bill, we will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>I have quoted my earlier remarks to the effect that we would not drop our opposition to this Bill even if this section were dropped because we object to the whole Bill and we have said so.  However, I went on:</P>
      <P>We in the Labour Party will vote as we are committed to vote against this Bill.</P>
      <P>I would draw the attention, if I may, of members of the Government, of this House, perhaps of the Press, to this passage not because anything that I said in an earlier speech was particularly important but because it becomes particularly pertinent at this time, this very critical moment when we want to know are they going to come to their senses and drop this section or are they not.  That is the only question we are concerned with now and everybody in this House, on Opposition and Government benches alike, will, I think, breathe a most hearty sigh of relief if they drop it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I went on:</P>
      <P>I would say that if section 4 is dropped now or if the amendments to it are fully accepted there would not be very much purchase for further argument against this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is misprinted, I am afraid, in this <Col N="2835" /> copy of this issue of the Official Report as &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; but what I said was:</P>
    <P>there would not be much purchase for further argument against this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would repeat these words.  There would not be much purchase for further argument against this Bill and I hope that members of the Government Party will get that message.</P>
    <P>The debate would instantly and automatically become much shorter if this section were dropped not as a result of any bargain, corrupt or incorrupt, with the Minister but because this is the section that is most objectionable. This is the section on which we must press amendments and on which we must talk about amendments at very considerable length.  On this key amendment we propose to continue the debate at very considerable length because the words involved&mdash; encourage, advocate and incite&mdash;are key words and their implications must be explored at great length if the section is intended to stand.</P>
    <P>I have said that if section 4 is dropped&mdash;and the Minister did suggest the possibility that on certain conditions this might be done&mdash;we would still have to vote against the Bill.  However, the debate would not be anything as protracted as it threatens to be.  At column 1755, Volume 255 of the Official Report dated 16th May, 1971, I stated:</P>
    <P>I would say that if section 4 is dropped now or if the amendments to it are fully accepted there would not be very much purchase for further argument against this Bill.  We could not go on arguing forever about the difference between a £5 fine and a £50 fine.  The difference is £45 and everybody knows it, there is not a great deal more to be said about that; but there is a great deal more and a great deal that ought to be said about section 4 and about these amendments and we are determined to say these things.</P>
    <P>We shall say these things however long it takes us.  We do not want to say them at length&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we will not have quite as much in the way of dangerous consequences from this section as would have been the case had it been allowed to pass with only a token debate.  The fact that the opposition to this pernicious section has been sustained and effective, has been carried on jointly and in harmony by the two Opposition parties and has received the overwhelming support of the Press, is in itself a guarantee that this will not be tried again in a hurry.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 11.30 a.m. on Thursday, 29th July, 1971.</P>
