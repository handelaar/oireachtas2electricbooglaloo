    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1971, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few remaining points to make on the Minister's introductory speech.  I propose to conclude my comments at 11 a.m.  There are three aspects I should like to cover, namely, land policy and the question of land succession generally, the advisory services of the Department and the educational and research services available to farmers.</P>
      <P>It is time we abolished the Land Commission as such and set up a parallel body comparable with the Industrial Development Authority.  I have no particular name to suggest but the title &ldquo;Rural Development Authority&rdquo; has been suggested.  This new body should be established with responsibility for the general operation and implementation of land policy. We consider that a corporation of this nature, which would be of a statutory character comparable with the IDA, would be more effective in ensuring that the land resources of the nation are properly worked&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion put forward by the Deputy would require legislation and, therefore, it is not in order to discuss this particular point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That may well be but I consider it is rather preposterous to discuss the Supplementary Estimate <Col N="1641" /> on Agriculture and, at the same time, be precluded from talking about land policy which is an integral part of the role of agriculture in our economy: However, I will pass on but I would make the point I proposed last evening that the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries should be integrated and that there should be set up a rural development authority to supervise land policy generally.</P>
      <P>If we had such an approach involving the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries a more appropriate restructuring of land holdings would evolve and the money available to agriculture, both current and capital, would be spent more effectively.  It is true to say that farmers are very much dependent on the general activities of the Land Commission in order to obtain viable holdings.  There is a need for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to examine the extent to which existing provisions whether legislative or otherwise, enable farmers to negotiate the purchase of land which is not being worked or is being neglected due to lack of ability or interest on the part of the owners. Until we get to grips with this aspect of land policy, we are wasting our time hoping for an overall growth in the agricultural sector.  We have not been able to completely convince the Fianna Fáil Party, particularly the Fianna Fáil Deputies with an interest in agriculture. Within that party there is the constant preoccupation with the over-simplification of classifying land mainly on the basis of acreage or valuation.  Until such time as the assessment of farm holdings is based on the marketing and production potential of farms, the soil resources of farms, the skills of farmers and the capital investment in farms, we cannot have a reasonable land policy.  Due to decades of neglect, bad policy and non-policy on the part of the Government, the land transfer succession problem is now a major one.  The number of single farmers who are beyond marriage age is above the level which is either socially or economically acceptable in any rural community.</P>

      <P>That does not <Col N="1642" /> arise on this Estimate.  It would be a matter for the Department of Lands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would you advise me how one can talk about agriculture unless one talks about farmers and the social problems affecting farmers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for another Minister and another Estimate, that is, the Department of Lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying, with profound respect, that it is quite within the rights of the Members of this House to suggest that the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries should be amalgamated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not in order either.  What is before us is the Estimate for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I shall finish that section by making one comment, namely, that the policy of the Labour Party is directed towards a restructuring of the system&mdash;I think I am in order in saying that in relation to Lands and Agriculture&mdash;the creation of a social and legal framework which will assist the transfer of land to young farmers while respecting the dignity and the full legal rights of any farmer affected by that kind of policy.  The proportion of farmers in this country who are over 65 years of age is three times the ratio in Britain and three times the ratio in Denmark.  This is a very serious social problem.  Fewer than half the number of Irish farmers are married men under 65 years of age.  The Fianna Fáil Party will be preoccupied over the next weekend with the question of family farms and so on, but more than half the number of Irish farms are not family farms in the normal sense.  There is an urgent need for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to examine this problem in depth in consultation with the Department of Lands, and for far greater debate on the subject in this House to ensure a proper solution to this problem of land holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intended referring to the question of the purchase of thousands of acres of prime Irish land by foreign speculators, either companies or other purchasers, <Col N="1643" /> but as this seems to be more appropriate to the Department of Lands, my remaining remarks are in relation to the advisory services.  Insufficient recognition has been given, either through this Estimate or by the Department, to the fact that we have an agricultural advisory service which plays an extremely important role in the improvement of the standards of performance in Irish agriculture.  This service is staffed by dedicated officers who are, by and large, underpaid, underequipped and very badly organised for their major task of advising the farmers.  There is need for more contact on a regional basis between the Agricultural Research Institute, the various local authorities, the other services of the Department, and the advisers themselves. There is also far greater need for specialisation.  Any adviser who has to work on a day-to-day basis with an individual farmer, in this age of complex farm technology, cannot be expected, even with periodical refresher training and so on, to be fully conversant with all the aspects of farming science and technology.  There is therefore a need for considerable specialisation within the advisory service.  Certain grants being made available by the Department of Agriculture should be given only on receipt of reports from the advisory service.  This would give an added shot in the arm to the work being done by the agricultural advisers and give them greater influence and standing within the communty.</P>
    <P>I strongly suggest to the Minister that the Agricultural Research Institute, while it certainly should continue its wide range of research and development projects, should be given greater statutory independence.  It should be formally recognised as the prime body having full authority in relation to research work on agricultural policies. This is a need which does not seem to be evident to the Department.</P>
    <P>I believe that the development of a healthy and economically viable rural community depends on ensuring that the educational facilities available to the rural population must be equal to if not greater in quality than those available to people in the cities and <Col N="1644" /> towns.  They must be geared to the needs of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I am very perturbed that the long history of Irish education has been urban-biased, unfortunately.  I do not think that is to the credit of Irish educationalists that we have failed to produce a more balanced picture and a more balanced educational system, bearing in mind our agricultural needs. The general level of Irish education has yet to promote a more definite and positive interest in rural activities and in basic agricultural principles. This applies particularly in the field of post-primary education, which is urban-orientated, and orientated towards the professions and the arts and is certainly not geared towards agricultural needs.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of the Labour Party to provide for the agricultural community a comprehensive educational system right up to the age of 16 years and from 16 to 18 years we want specialisation with one of the streams towards agriculture.  There is no formal recognition of the role of agriculture within our normal educational system. This is not to the credit of the Government, or the educational planners and educationalists.  The primary school curriculum has a dramatic long-term effect on agriculture.  The curriculum should be much more wideranging and much more helpful to agriculture by the provision of science and manual craft subjects.</P>
    <P>The agricultural colleges should be expanded and, if necessary, new ones should be constructed to provide adequate accommodation for agricultural students.  There is a serious need for a further re-examination by the Department of the educational services which are the direct responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and there should be much greater liaison between that Department and the Department of Education. It is dreadful that our Government system is structured towards giving every Minister individual responsibility with no liaison and no intermeshing of activities.  One has only to look at the adult educational facilities available to Irish farmers to <Col N="1645" /> realise the lack of library facilities, for example, and to appreciate the problem.</P>
    <P>These are my views.  We have had a singularly unfortunate problem with regard to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries over the past 12 months getting to grips with agricultural policy. I think the Minister would be the first to admit this.  He has been in a very invidious and very embarrassing position at times.  The agricultural community must have considerable qualms as to what may be expected from the Minister in the future in relation to the various approaches they have made over the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>In many respects the Minister has been the victim of his own misfortune. There is a contrast between the leadership of and the sympathy and understanding and regard for the President of the NFA and successive Ministers. One thinks of the names of the Ministers and one thinks of the name of Mr. Maher of the NFA.  When one talks to farmers one realises that there is a divergence of interest even, and of respect.  This is not healthy so far as Dáil Éireann is concerned, and it is not desirable so far as the promotion of agricultural policy is concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister more deeply involved in the Common Market negotiations.  I do not think they can be left as the preserve of the blasé approach of the Minister for External Affairs, or to the views of the economists, the very limited number of highly dedicated and competent economists within the Department. This is a very understaffed section of the Department and the Government and the Department of Finance adopt a very miserly attitude towards that section.  I should like to see the senior officers, the Minister and the various economists in the Department playing a much more definite role in the EEC negotiations and in the national debate on the negotiations.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party recognise that, irrespective of the outcome of the current negotiations, in the event of Britain joining the EEC, whether the Irish people like it or not, and whether the Labour Party like it or <Col N="1646" /> not, a need will arise for a basic formal relationship between this country and the Community.  In that setting we want to see all members of the Cabinet very deeply involved in these negotiations.  I wish the Minister well in 1971.  I appreciate his difficulties and assure him that the Labour Party will be constructive in our comments on future Estimates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that I am mainly concerned about the problems of the hard-pressed city housewife but it is not on that basis alone that I want to put forward my views.  I am concerned also about the question of incomes, not only farm incomes but also the incomes of industrial workers and their capacity to meet their commitments. This party are committed to increasing and improving farming incomes and much has been done in the past towards that end.  I have no objection to the incomes of farmers being increased and I believe that their incomes can be increased by a more realistic assessment and more positive action by themselves rather than by more comprehensive Government support. Possibly they do need support and I would suggest that the housewives, particularly the Dublin housewives, and the farmers could get together and make conditions better for both of them.  In between the housewife and the farmer there are a number of middle men or fiddle men who are absorbing a vast amount of the profits. The farmer who tills the land, sows the <Col N="1647" /> seed and reaps the harvest is entitled to a fair return but, on the other hand, the housewife should get farm produce at a reasonable price.  This is not the case at present.  There could be an improvement in the position by more positive action on the part of the farmers in eliminating some of the middle men or the fiddle men who exist at present.  With Government support much could be done to relieve the situation and bring about a better deal for the city housewife and for the farmer who should get more for his produce.</P>
      <P>A farmer gets £18 a ton for potatoes while the city housewife pays, possibly, £50 a ton at the supermarket. There is something wrong when that can happen.  This applies not only to potatoes but to the other farm products as well.  Where garden peas are concerned every yard from the pod to the plate means an additional burden on the city housewife.  Somebody in between is reaping a rich reward.  It is time the farmers assessed the situation in a realistic way and ensured that there were better market facilities available so as to give the people who are paying the subsidies by taxation in the cities a better deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here in the city rings exist between the farmer and the housewife and a serious situation has developed.  Possibly in other cities and large towns, too, rings exist which push up the prices of farm produce.  I hope the Minister will take note of the price structure here in the city and the prices the farmers are getting and see if any action can be taken so that farmers and housewives get a better deal.  Must one pay a 50, 100 or 200 per cent increase in cost for the little plastic bags in which farm products are sold in the supermarket?  The housewives of this city and other cities are hard pressed. A better deal can only be got for the housewife and the farmer by a more realistic assessment on the part of the farming community.  The housewife is tied to the city.  She can do little.  Better market procedures are necessary.  I do not know how exactly the situation can be rectified but I have a fair idea. Common sense is a big factor in this, to <Col N="1648" /> eliminate those people they know are raking it in, people who have no interest in the land, no interest in the housewife, but are sitting in plush offices in this city and other cities counting the coppers and the pounds as they roll in. They never put a spade into the ground and they are not concerned about the price of foodstuffs because they are well able to pay for them.  The housewives in my constituency&mdash;in Drimnagh, Ballyfermot and other areas&mdash; could tell the Minister a thing or two about the price of farm produce.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that some other structure is made available for the marketing of farm produce.  The Minister might possibly open up the question of market gardening on a much wider scale in the counties adjacent to the city.  This is an area where a positive plan could be put into action.  Possibly the Government might assist in the development of this.  I am sure that adjacent to other cities, too, there are areas where the development could take place.  If we cannot get farm produce from the counties that are far away at a lower price it is time we looked at the situation.</P>
    <P>The housewife pays ninepence a pint for milk; the farmer gets threepence. The same applies to meat.  The Minister is aware of the price of meat in this and other cities.  Around the country, meat prices are 50 per cent lower in some cases than in this city.  The housewives of this city have been held up to ransom for long enough.  It is time they got a fair crack of the whip. A head of cabbage can cost 2s and a turnip 1s 6d in this city at times.  This situation merits comprehensive consideration. It is difficult for the housewife who reads that butter is sold to foreign countries at a shilling a pound to understand why she must pay 5s 6d. I know there are many factors involved but we have many people who could benefit from cheap butter.  It might not be a bad idea if, in addition to the facilities that have already been granted to old age pensioners, some of this cheap butter went their way.  This is a very needy and deserving section of our people and they could do with butter at a cheap rate.</P>
    <P>In relation to cheese production, in <Col N="1649" /> city restaurants, city hotels, hotels throughout the country and, indeed, here in the Dáil restaurant, one gets a cheeseboard and one must pay 2s 6d for about threepence worth of cheese. This is an effort by people in hotels and restaurants to ensure that nobody eats cheese.  We should be encouraging the consumption of cheese and a bigger effort should be made to ensure that when there is a surplus of milk, butter and the other commodities available &mdash;I am not very well versed in how and when they are available&mdash;the people of this country will be able to avail of better foodstuffs at a more realistic price.  When one goes into a hotel one is offered threepence worth of cheese for 2s 6d on a cheeseboard which displays foreign brands but few of our own brands.  I do not know what has happened about cheese production. Many of our people are not cheese-conscious because of lack of information. In many establishments people are discouraged from eating cheese by the high prices charged.</P>
    <P>The production of baby foods is important.  I have been told that a Dublin city hospital, because of an offer of a three-months supply of a particular brand of baby food manufactured outside the country, have adopted this particular brand of food for the children and recommended to the mothers that they should use it for their children.  We can manufacture baby foods as efficiently as anyone else.  It is a pity that we have institutions adopting this policy because of the gimmicks and pressure of salesmen and because of the concessions they offer.  We are reaching a serious situation when we disregard our own valuable foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>New thinking should be brought to bear on our surpluses.  I do not know whether the distilleries or breweries were ever asked to do research into the use of milk as a base for high-prestige stout or other products.  This has been done in other countries in different ways.  It is not beyond the capacity of the people in the research departments to come up with something that is palatable to the Irish people and to foreigners coming here. Is it necessary to use water in the production <Col N="1650" /> of all items?  Can we produce a high-prestige product in our breweries and distilleries using some of the farm produce which is available?  We see others using eggs and cream in their products.  All outlets should be explored in order to see whether surplus farm products can be used.</P>
    <P>I do not like to see the city housewife used as the pawn of farming politics.  The city housewife is caught up in farm politics because industrial workers are being laid off following a policy decision of a farming organisation. It is a serious thing for the farm organisation to hurt the workers of this city.  People in assembly plants have been thrown out of work.  Such people assemble farm machinery which is not being purchased at the moment.  This is a stupid campaign which affects the Dublin worker and the farmers themselves. This is deplorable.  It is time all sides came together in the national interest to ensure that we go ahead and get the best that is available for our country.  A situation is being reached where an ice-cream man will look for a subsidy if the summer is cold, and the umbrella manufacturer will expect a subsidy if the winter is dry.  A farmer might get a better income if he examined the problems I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would define the terms &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; and &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; for me.  These terms have not been clearly defined for the urban people up to now.  The urban people pay the farmers' subsidies.  One wishes to ensure that whatever subsidies are paid by way of taxes are utilised to the best advantage.  If the farmers are not getting a fair deal, and the Minister says so, we would be prepared to meet that situation.  I do not know whether subsidies should be given to the small and medium farmer rather than to the big farmer.  I know that £100 million per annum is paid in the subsidisation of agriculture.  This is a vast sum and some of this money is coming out of my pocket.  Is this money being properly spent?  Is it being diverted to the right sections of the community? We must ensure that those in greatest need are getting their fair share of this money.  Are the subsidies going to <Col N="1651" /> farmers who are small farmers, to farmers who are tenants, to farmers who are landowners or to farmers who are merely city gentlemen?  The city gentleman does not deserve farming subsidies.  It does not make much difference to the taxpayer, but from the economic point of view it matters very much.  We must get a comprehensive view of farm subsidies.  I do not know where most of them are going.  I probably should know more. I should like to hear more about this for my own education and for the information of the people who are paying the subsidies.  The people of this country will not begrudge increases where they are necessary.  The widespread unemployment as a result of the decision of a farming organisation not to purchase machinery is causing concern.  This decision has thrown employees out of work.  In many cases such employees are the sons and daughters of farmers.  It also has a bad effect on transport companies and machinery supply companies.  This could rebound on the people who are applying these pressures at the moment.</P>
    <P>Much money has been spent on the lime subsidy.  Does the decision by a farm organisation not to buy lime mean that they do not require the money for the lime subsidy?  I would like to see the city housewife getting the benefit of such money as may be saved on lime subsidies.  In the view of some of the people who are concerned, this money is not required.  They have made a decision about the utilisation of ground limestone.  This is a serious matter which is causing concern to people who never thought about it in the past.  It affects a family in a serious manner when a son or daughter comes in saying he or she has received protective notice and is likely to be laid off at some future date.  The position then becomes very serious.</P>
    <P>I might say in relation to the farm supply companies that in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i> I read a statement about the difficulties and dangers for people who over the years have been supplying farm equipment, some of them supplying it on very extended <Col N="1652" /> credit.  This has put some of the farmers in the position in which they are today.  This is a poor return for the kindness and generosity of these people who have been supplying equipment.  I hope somebody will give us an explanation why this type of nonsense is allowed.  It can only hurt the farmers themselves and the housewives.</P>
    <P>In relation to car tax, if I do not tax my car I will be in trouble.  There should not be selective justice in relation to people who break the law whether it is in relation to taxing cars or otherwise.  We in this city and the people in other cities and larger towns have always had to pay the piper and, as I said, there should not be selective justice.  I understand that many of the people who are suggesting that the law be broken covered themselves in many ways before making these suggestions. According to other reports the wives of the farmers are engaging in a campaign for the non-purchase of domestic equipment.  This, again, can only hit the city housewife whose husband, son or daughter may be laid off as a result of such stupid action.  The workers in this city may well react against this nonsense.  If the ports are closed or if people will not supply spares or do repairs to the machinery which these people have, then a different situation will arise.  The whole position will lead to a standstill at an early date.  If technicians servicing ESB installations, or maintaining water supplies or other services, react against people who are depriving their sons or daughters from employment a different situation will arise.</P>
    <P>We are all in this together and we must ensure that we go a road which is in the national interest.  This campaign is directed only against themselves.  It can only have the effect of worsening the efficiency of the farming community.  It must also affect our entry into the EEC.  It is lowering the capacity of the farmers to prepare themselves for entry at this vital time. They are just cutting their own throats and that is the way many people, even in the farming community, view it.  It seems that there is a scheme in the minds of some people by which when we enter the EEC the small and <Col N="1653" /> medium sized farmer, who is now tied up in this serious situation and who must have greater mechanisation to meet the changes, and greater fertility of the land, will not be in a position to develop a viable unit and he will be swallowed up by the very people who are now telling him not to use the services which are available to him. The farming bodies should come together, if necessary with the industrial workers or with the housewives of this city, and hammer out a solution which would be of benefit to everybody. There is plenty in it for all of us if we get around a table and examine the position in relation to both our problems.  There is the middle man who has swallowed up so much of what is available, so much of the housewives' money, and who has got more out of it than the farmer who produces.  I would ask the Minister to provide some type of marketing procedure which will assist housewives and ensure that they get farm produce at a reasonable rate.  The price the farmer receives is low in comparison with what is paid.  Indeed, in some cases the farming organisations have made an effort in this direction but the effort has not been great enough and it has not been in relation to the city housewife.  The consumers are all important when it comes to the produce or the finished article.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that in the city we get a fair crack of the whip and that housewives in areas like Ballyfermot, Coolock, and Ballymun will be in a position to meet the demands made on them.  This can be done by devising a system by which the &ldquo;middlers&rdquo; and the &ldquo;fiddlers&rdquo; can be cut out, the people who are stacking up the pound notes in their plush offices.</P>

      <P>The importance of this Estimate cannot be overstressed when one considers the percentage of workers involved in the industry as well as in the ancillary services, such as in the food processing business, the fertiliser industry, the co-ops and the professional services.  For that reason it is vital that confidence in the industry be maintained.  When one looks around the agricultural scene today one sees among the people who make their livelihood from the land a lack of confidence <Col N="1654" /> and a loss of hope instead of the confidence that there should really be in the industry.</P>
      <P>There are two reasons for this lack of confidence.  One is the ever widening gap between the incomes of the agricultural community and other sectors of the economy.  The action suggested by the farming bodies stems from the fact that over recent years militant action has in many respects secured a greater share of the national cake for various sectors than reasoned action.  Family farm incomes have increased by 45 per cent since 1941.  In relation to 1953 prices this represented, in terms of real money, an increase of 34 per cent, with increased production of close on 20 per cent.  This certainly is not in keeping with the increases given to other sectors.  A second reason for dissatisfaction among the farming community is that they feel the Government have been more ready to agree to demands made on them by other sectors than to the demands of those engaged in agriculture.  The recent increase of 1d per pint granted to milk suppliers by the Minister for Industry and Commerce was almost as much in one go as the producers received over the past 8 years.  I am sure that on many occasions the various farming organisations have placed before the Minister figures to justify the action they are now taking and not alone that but to justify an increase in the price of the commodities they produce. It is proper that some of these figures should be put on the records of the House, irrespective of how often they have been brought to the notice of the Minister and his officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wages have increased by more than 150 per cent in the period from 1960 to 1970.  The cost of national health stamps has increased by more than 200 per cent in the same period.  Super-potash and nitrogen have increased by 50 per cent.  Ten years ago it took 400 barrels of barley to purchase a tractor; today it takes 600 barrels and, in the meantime, the cost of producing barley has increased.  Ten years ago it took two gallons of milk to buy a gallon of petrol; today it takes three gallons. Many farmers are working on overdraft accommodation and interest charges <Col N="1655" /> during the ten-year period have increased from 6 per cent to 9½ per cent. These are just a few of the reasons for the situation that exists in the agricultural community today.</P>
    <P>I say this, not as one who believes in militant action of any kind.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with the statements made by Deputy Dowling and I believe any action by any section of the community which drives it into conflict with another section is not in the interest of the group concerned, nor is it in the national interest.  At the same time, the Minister and the Government should leave no stone unturned in order to bring the present unhappy situation to an end.</P>
    <P>At present it appears there is a need for the immediate reorganisation of the agricultural services.  In a report published some time ago it was pointed out that the public services are finding it difficult to compete for the best brains and talents available in the country.  Many people who formerly would have entered the public services are being lost to other groups, such as co-operatives, marketing groups, voluntary organisations, the Agricultural Institute and various others.  It is admitted that it is difficult to stop this brain drain but it is suggested that a national service, controlled by an autonomous body representative of the Department and interested bodies including farming organisations, should be set up.  This body should embrace all branches of the advisory services and the Department of Agriculture grants services.  It would ensure greater interchangeability of staff, eliminate duplication and would ensure that the advisers would be better equipped to provide improved services for farmers and more promotional opportunities for the people employed in the service.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk in the last 12 months in regard to the consequences of our entry into the EEC.  It is reasonable to say that agriculture will benefit, particularly so far as beef and mutton are concerned.  The aim should be to ensure that as many of our farmers as possible will benefit from the increased prices.</P>
    <P>If one looks at what has happened <Col N="1656" /> in the last five years in the sheep industry, it will be noticed that while the Government may have set targets in their Second Programme for Economic Expansion, so far as sheep numbers were concerned no steps were taken to ensure that the targets set were attained.  At the beginning of the Second Programme the number of sheep in the country was five million. The projected figure for the end of the programme was seven million but the actual figure at the end of the five years was less than four million.  This indicates that no effort was made by the Government to provide the necessary corrective measures to stop this decline.  It must not be forgotten that this decline occurred in an industry that offers tremendous scope and opportunities in Common Market conditions.</P>
    <P>A few years ago the Minister's predecessor, in reply to a Parliamentary Question, indicated that it was the opinion at that time that the subsidy for carcase lamb, grants for fencing and the mountain lamb subsidy scheme would ensure an increase in the sheep population.  However, the results proved otherwise.  Perhaps the Minister is now hoping that the hogget ewe subsidy scheme may help to arrest the decline that is taking place in the industry but the Department should check constantly the trend so far as numbers are concerned so that other action can be taken if the present measures are not sufficient.  It will probably be contended by the Minister that one of the reasons for the decline was the high price for sheep but the fact that sheep were a reasonable price should have alerted the Department to the problem.</P>
    <P>In the reply given by the Minister at that time he also referred to grants for fencing.  It must be admitted by the Department that so far as hill fencing is concerned the scheme has not been a success.  There are probably many reasons for this but it is mainly due to the fact that the price of stakes and wiring has increased; in addition, many of these hill farmers were not accustomed to fencing and they do not own the hills on which they graze their sheep.  If any progress is to be made the grant for fencing must be increased <Col N="1657" /> substantially.  If we are serious about increasing the numbers of sheep there must also be a scheme of grants for lowland fencing as well as for hill fencing.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is worthy of the attention of the Department is the introduction of a special grant for the top dressing, manuring and liming of hill farms.  This should be granted to farmers without having to carry out the work in accordance with the conditions laid down by the Land Project Office. Worthwhile improvements could be made if the conditions were relaxed for hilly and mountainous areas.</P>
    <P>It is also essential that the Department should introduce some kind of support scheme for store lambs in order to avoid the fluctuation in prices that occurs from year to year.  In my own constituency we have an example of what can be done to increase sheep numbers by co-operation between the farmers, the County Committee of Agriculture and the Department of Agriculture.  In that constituency the Minister's predecessor agreed that one of the members of the advisory staff would be appointed and would be available on a full-time basis to sheep farmers.  In view of the potential that exists within the sheep industry, this is a development that is worthy of extension to other counties.</P>
    <P>The Minister said here before Christmas that there is evidence to suggest that the period of decline in sheep numbers is now ended.  I am sure we would like to know what concrete evidence he has to substantiate that claim.  If that is the position we would all welcome it from the point of view of the extra money it will mean to people engaged in the industry, and the part it can play in regard to the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the future treatment of the warble fly will have to be on a voluntary basis.  He and his Department must be aware that 95 per cent co-operation is not sufficient in dealing with this problem, that the only way to eliminate warble fly infestation is to have 100 per cent co-operation from the Department, the farming community and the farming organisations and to bring the farming <Col N="1658" /> community the many benefits of such co-operation.</P>
    <P>While it is agreed that the whole basis of our livestock industry must be a prosperous dairying industry, greater advances could be made in connection with the beef incentive bonus scheme. The provision for 1970-71 is £2,400,000 as against a total Exchequer support for milk and milk products of £30,000,000.  The value of exports is £30,000,000; it was £28,500,000 in 1969 when the value of beef exports alone was close on £90,000,000.  The regulations governing the incentive bonus scheme are too stringent.  Farmers who avail of this scheme should not have to undergo two inspections of cows and calves in a year.  Grants should be paid on every calf once the calf is available for inspection in June.  There are many Hereford heifers, in particular, sold in the early part of the summer at 2½ years old which could have produced calves the previous March.  These heifers could have been fattened and disposed of by June.  This would lead to a rapid increase in calf numbers with no increase in milk.  Findings from the Agricultural Institute indicate that cow heifer beef, particularly 2½ year old, is equal in quality to heifer beef.  The Minister may feel that the introduction of a new scheme or the relaxation of the present scheme to improve the situation mentioned might be very costly, but an increase of over 250,000 in calf numbers would have a desirable effect right through the economy.</P>
    <P>Much has been said for and against membership of the EEC and about the prospects for our farmers, small and large.  On the whole, it is possibly fair to say that whatever difficulties face us within the EEC they are far less than those that would have to be contended with if we did not gain admittance and if Britain goes in.  On the other hand, the Department should be examining the situation as to what would happen if Britain decided not to go in.  We should just not make a decision offhand to follow Britain if she decides not to accept the terms of membership, particularly when one recalls the amount we import from some of the continental countries in comparison with the amount we export to them.  We must also take into account the rumoured <Col N="1659" /> agricultural policy of the present Conservative Government.</P>
    <P>It does appear that if we gain admittance to the EEC the early days of membership will probably be the best so far as the farming community are concerned.  As Deputy Keating has pointed out on a number of occasions, the larger the number in industrial employment becomes and the smaller the number on the land becomes, the greater the pressures will be for a cheap food market, even within the EEC.  There are so many sides to the story that it is imperative that the Minister, and the Government, should study every viewpoint put forward, examine the position and not wait until we are faced with having to make an instant decision in the matter.  This is not the time to dismiss ideas or suggestions, no matter where they come from.  If ever there was a time for an open mind on various aspects of our economic life it is now.</P>
    <P>Also in the context of EEC membership, we have been talking about off-farm employment for our small farmers for so long, but I am sure we all hope to see action on the various reports on regional development that have been presented, particularly over the last five years.  There is no use in promising factories to areas if action is not taken to get them there.  Many of us in our constituencies have examples of what industrial development can do to improve the lot of the small farmer. The real complaint is that those examples are not numerous enough. In agriculture, as in other walks of life, increased education facilities are a &ldquo;must&rdquo;.  In both the Second and Third Programmes for Economic Expansion promises were made that agricultural centres would be set up to provide training for farmers' sons who could not avail of formal agricultural education.  At the moment we are only scratching the surface of this problem. Greater facilities should be provided for boys and girls who are prepared to avail of formal education; increased grants and longer terms at residential schools should be provided.</P>
    <P>While the availability of money is naturally the determining factor governing many worthwhile projects, there are <Col N="1660" /> two organisations which, having regard to the importance of their work, are really working on a shoe-string, the Agricultural Institute and the Meat Marketing Board.  More research centres are urgently needed; more demonstration farms are required around the country.  These would readily bring home to farmers the effectiveness of modern techniques and the increased output that can be obtained from the proper use of phosphates, potash and nitrogen.  A subsidy should be paid on nitrogenous fertilisers, as on phosphates and potash.  While TV advertising is doing a great deal to get the message across, a subsidy on the use of nitrogenous fertiliser would be much more effective.</P>
    <P>The Meat Marketing Board have been operating on a sum in the region of £150,000 while the value of exports of beef and mutton are over £110 million.  Surely the Minister cannot justify an expenditure on promotional activities of £150,000 for one industry valued at £110 million?</P>
    <P>The number of agricultural advisory staff is not nearly sufficient to bring about the increased production that could be attained.  At the moment the ratio is about one instructor per 800 farmers which allows an average of no more than one visit per farmer per year.  What happens in most cases is that the farmer who could get along reasonably well without an instructor, is the farmer who usually seeks his advice most frequently.  At the same time the excellent work done must be mentioned.  Many advisers offer their services even without being asked. Means of reducing as much as possible the frequent changes in personnel is another matter that should exercise the mind of the Department.  The advisory service can flourish only where an excellent relationship exists between the adviser and the farmer based on years of contact and mutual confidence.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I should like to mention.  It has been established that when Bord na Móna bogs are finished as far as turf production is concerned, they are very suitable for horticultural purposes.  Yet, thousands of acres continue to lie idle.  I should <Col N="1661" /> like to hear from the Minister whether the Department have any plans in mind for the use of this land.  There are many small farmers living adjacent to these cutaway bogs who, if given proper technical advice and assistance, could make good use of it, particularly as we are so close to the market in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Another matter is the question of the availability of credit for the acquisition of land by young men who have no money buy who have enthusiasm and ambition and technical know-how.  The economic policy being followed by the Government at present, under which there are blanket credit restrictions, is not in the best interests of the economy.  It leads to a situation where people with money, and people with capital, and foreigners also, can buy land while young people who would make excellent farmers, if money were made available to them, are not in a position to compete for these farms.  I am sure every Deputy knows of instances where young men &mdash;particularly over the past 12 months &mdash;were unable to secure the necessary credit to set themselves up in the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The Government should take an overall look at this matter.  The question of blanket restriction of credit, irrespective of the merits of the various cases put forward, should be examined. The Government should make credit available to young farmers of proven worth who are anxious to expand and extend.  I do not think any party expect the Government or the Minister to solve the personal problems of everybody, but, at the same time, we think it is the duty of the Government to create the conditions that are necessary to provide prosperity for all sectors of the community.  Nowhere is the participation of the Government more urgently required than in relation to the farming community at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been going on for some time.  Those of us who come from country areas will appreciate the scope and the scale of the various schemes operated by the Minister's Department.  It can be said that in this debate a good deal of <Col N="1662" /> knocking was indulged in, but I was glad to hear Deputy Timmins breaking away from that trend.  I was glad to hear him on the various points he raised in dealing with our efforts at production, especially with regard to sheep and lamb schemes and matters of that kind.</P>
      <P>One of the aspects of the Department's activities with which we should be preoccupied at present, in view of our declared intention to participate in the European Community, is education and training for our youth.  It is regrettable that of the 4,000 boys&mdash;or perhaps 4,500; I am speaking from memory on this point&mdash;who enter agriculture each year as potential farmers, only about 550 students complete the course leading to a degree in a residential college.  I am not sure if the figure is even as high as that.  No doubt, there are a number of other students who attend agricultural education and training classes at night in their spare time.  While we may be highly preoccupied with other sides of the programme, we should take a look at this whole matter of education and training to try to find out what is preventing our youth from playing a greater role in the main arm of our economy.</P>
      <P>We should provide better accommodation for winter farm schemes. This is being pursued by the Department and by the Minister to a limited extent.  We have to have regard to the limitations imposed by the amount of money available.  We should make better provision for accommodation for winter classes for teenagers and adults and fully-fledged farmers.  We should see to it, to use the common jargon, that more farmers are involved in this desirable activity.  One is struck by the amount of time that is lost, if I may put it that way, in amusement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to develop this point.  If one contrasts this desire for amusement, to be away from home at night, with the sense of purpose on the part of some youths and their desire to attend a local agricultural science class, for example, one finds that amusement wins out.  Those of us who have a responsibility in politics and who are on local committees of agriculture and <Col N="1663" /> members of local authorities should try to turn this trend in a more useful direction and see to it that we encourage the youth in the very desirable direction of agricultural education and training.  We should make provision at committee level, in consultation with the Department, to provide better accommodation both for winter schools and for agricultural colleges.  There are a number of colleges which need drastic reconstruction and in some cases replacement and while there is no use talking in terms of high expenditure we should do a little every year in this direction.  We are doing a little, we should do somewhat more, and in this way try to get a better sense of purpose into our young farmers and convince them that there is a future on the land if it is worked properly, that there is a future in training and in technology on the land and in processing and so on.  We should try to kill once and for all this inferiority complex which starts when a pupil leaves the post-primary school and goes to an agricultural college, spends perhaps a year or two there and then leaves.  This is bad especially in the case of those pupils who could and should go right through the whole course.</P>
    <P>This applies even more to young girls.  I am always appalled at the number of girls who turn away from rural domestic economy as a science.  It is an uphill fight, from my observations, and I keep as close to the scene as I can, to prevail on girls to undergo this course.  I often wonder why youngsters who have had a reasonably good start at primary school and who then perhaps have had post-primary education should have such a dislike of rural domestic economy.  We should upgrade this course leading to a degree and give more encouragement and publicity to it.  We should also encourage the committees of agriculture to provide more scholarships for this course and we should perhaps devote funds to an advertising campaign to show the openings available and to encourage youngsters to undergo a course in rural domestic economy.</P>
    <P>I referred to the plan to replace and renew some of our agricultural colleges. <Col N="1664" /> In the last year or two I have not had much information on this matter, but I hope we will pursue this plan.  We may not be able to achieve anything very spectacular in a short period but we should do something in this direction every year.</P>
    <P>We have had various debates here in the last few months and indeed we had one on our prospects in the EEC. While I am on the subject of agricultural training and education, I must say I was glad to read last week of a booklet which has been published on the prospects of the Irish farmer in the EEC.  I do not want to labour this point or to indulge in &ldquo;over-kill&rdquo; as many speakers do.  I am pro-EEC and I am glad that the members of the Irish Council of the European Movement, a number of well-known personalities, advocates of better methods in agriculture, have come together and published a series of articles on our European prospects.  I would encourage my colleagues to buy the booklet because it makes very interesting reading. Its title is: &ldquo;Implications for Irish Agriculture of Common Market Membership&rdquo;. It is interesting to dwell on some of the points made in the summary though I always regret that, in this House and outside, when some fresh subject is mentioned and before people have assimilated the full implications of the subject, there is an attempt by those for or against to indulge in what I would call &ldquo;over-kill&rdquo;. This is a very bad idea.  We should be more mature and agree to differ and try to debate it fully.  Those of us who indulge in this activity are showing a very bad example to our young people, our post-primary school-leavers, whom we expect to debate this, whom we expect to assimilate and to be able to take the best out of the points made in whatever speech may be under study.  The same thing happens here when we come to discuss agriculture.  We raise the tempo to a high pitch and those of us who take up an entrenched position sometimes try to kill a point which might be of some benefit in the scheme as a whole. I was glad that this publication was released.  It will help the farming community to see the panorama in greater <Col N="1665" /> perspective and to judge the work of the Common Market system and its alternatives.  From my brief reading of the booklet I feel that the alternative to entry into the EEC is very dark indeed.  In unison with Britain we know that we are rather limited on this front. If Britain joins the EEC this would be a &ldquo;must&rdquo; for us.  We would have to join.  There is not much difference of opinion about this.</P>
    <P>The booklet mentioned the beef exports, for example.  We are all familiar with this subject and we know that we can produce prime beef.  We can sell our beef at a good profit.  The point is that if we were in the Common Market in 1969 our beef exports would have earned roughly £50 million more.  Some people may say that that might have been for a short term, but we are not able to gauge at this stage what the length of that term might be.  There are some anti-Common Marketeers who say that is taking the short-term view.</P>
    <P>It was also calculated in the booklet that lamb exports would bring in an increase of roughly £2 million which would result from higher prices in the EEC.  We must realise the fact that we devote £45 million by way of Exchequer support to maintain prices for Irish farm produce.  No matter how the advocates of more for agriculture may argue, the figure is there and the money has been spent.  We must gain by this.  The point is carried further by saying that if we entered the EEC, while we would have to contribute to a common fund possibly in aid of support prices, the amount we would be able to earn and the amount of profit on our exports in such a system would more than outweigh whatever grant we might have to make to the common fund.  The £45 million in terms of subsidy is made available from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It is also calculated that EEC prices here would increase our farm income by anything up to £100 million.  We can hope that this would be so.  Rural Deputies can see the effect that this would have on our towns.  We should not have an inferiority complex about all this.  We may be a small country in European terms but some of our goods will sell against all competitors.  We <Col N="1666" /> need not decry the efforts of the Minister or his Department.  The ramifications of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are equal to the ramifications of any three or four other Departments. If one looks at the Book of Estimates or at any condensed summary of the activities of the Department one is immediately struck by the work which is carried on by the Department and which has been accomplished in the years past.  We should be able to benefit from this work.  The groundwork has been done.  It is our own fault as a community if we are not able to see where our best interests lie.</P>
    <P>There is one area in agriculture which has never been fully worked and this is co-operation.  Let no one tell me that the Irish farmer is in favour of co-operation. If he was he would go all out for it.  Our organisations are not talking enough about co-operation.  It is all right to talk about the national cake and the size of the slice one would like from it.  We should be bending our efforts towards making a larger cake and sharing it better.  Farmers are sensible men and it is regrettable that they should start a campaign which might lead to making the national cake considerably smaller in the years ahead and might retard the economy for years to come.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister saying that he will meet the various organisations shortly.  I hope they will be able to come to a sensible arrangement so that something harmful will not be done in order to benefit one section of the community.  This applies outside the farming community, because it was not the farming community who started this agitation.  We have had agitation on the industrial side and on the professional side.  At this stage could one appeal to the various pressure groups and interests to come together in the interests of the common good to realise that the cake is getting smaller instead of larger because of the way in which we have been working?  Unless the prospect improves for 1971-72 then we will be in a difficult position in facing the European market.  We have the leadership, the expertise, and a certain amount of technical knowledge by <Col N="1667" /> which we can propel ourselves into the European market, but this cannot be done overnight.  I would ask the Minister to appeal to the farming organisations to look at the other side and perhaps settle for a more modest demand than otherwise they might make.</P>
    <P>I have never found farmers to be unrealistic.  They live very near to nature and have a deep appreciation of human problems.  They are prepared always to see the other man's point of view.  This is not always the case, even in professional circles.  You will get a man in a rural area who was never at a university but who could apply better philosophy or better psychology than the professional man to certain facets of life.</P>
    <P>The Minister would certainly have the goodwill of the House in whatever efforts he makes to meet the farming community.  Sometimes in this House we are inclined to over-kill an issue but this is no time for over-killing any aspect of the agricultural problem nor is it a time for creating further disturbances. We have had enough disturbances on the industrial side last year and the year before and we do not want disturbances to stretch to the rural areas with the result of putting all sides at loggerheads, retarding not merely domestic activity but our efforts to export and to develop better relationships and interfering with our negotiations for entry into the EEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipBurton" hpid="Mr. Burton Mr. Burton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position we find in agriculture today is a sad reflection on the Government's policy not alone this year or last year but over the years.  That policy is being reflected in our economy, not alone with regard to the farmers but in other sectors.  The mis-statement of the year was made yesterday by the Minister when he said he had no dispute with the farmers. Unless he is like the ostrich, with his head in the sand, he must know the true position which obtains in agriculture. There is none so blind as he who does not want to see and I am afraid the Minister does not want to see the true situation.  He is aware that the present situation has given rise to the <Col N="1668" /> farmers' current campaign.  The farmers are being forced to protest and the protest is a symptom of unbalanced government over the years.  As Deputy Carter said, this has not been initiated by the farmers because they have not received a very good example from trade, from industry, the professions and others.  Undeniably, the inflationary period in which we are living affects the farmers as well as other people and they are entitled to look after their interests.</P>
      <P>Last September the Minister said that farm incomes would rise by about 6 per cent to 7 per cent in 1970.  But all other incomes have gone up by a much greater percentage.  This is a frank admission by the Government. There is a big gap between farmers' incomes and others.  That gap continues to widen and farmers are getting a smaller portion than they are entitled to.  It is no wonder that they are forced to take action to focus attention on their plight.  They have been forced into this campaign for which they have no love.  They regret having to do it. The situation has forced some 130,000 members of the NFA and some 70,000 of the ICMSA to take part in this campaign.  Last year the farmers were &ldquo;conned&rdquo; into believing that their position was going to be greatly improved. After the longest and most comprehensive round of pre-Budget talks, the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries announced that he was submitting a claim for an increase of £14 million in relation to agriculture.  At that time the Minister said that the Government expected that industrial earnings would rise by 13 per cent. Since it was Government policy to maintain a reasonable relationship between agricultural incomes and the incomes of other sections of the community a figure of £14 million extra was needed.  However, the Minister stressed that this figure would not narrow the gap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After many arguments with the agricultural community, the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries finally met the 11 organisations.  He listened to their legitimate grievances and it was established that to bring the income of farmers into line with other <Col N="1669" /> sectors it would be necessary to provide an extra £14 million.  That was in 1970 but the position has deteriorated since then.  A year ago the farming community thought that at last their hard work and industry were gaining appreciation for the first time.  The farming organisations left the discussions with the Minister quite happy that they were no longer considered second-class citizens in this country and confident that a fair deal would be given to them.  Unfortunately that feeling of confidence was short-lived.</P>
    <P>A sum of £5 million was provided in the Budget and before the farmers had time to protest or make a further claim the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was removed from his post. We had the Government crisis in May which prevented the farmers and all other people from submitting their claims.  The Government were engaged with their own internal problems and wrangles and consequently the position worsened.  We had galloping inflation which still exists today.</P>
    <P>If a sum of £14 million was considered necessary in 1970, it is obvious that much more is required today. While there has been criticism of the action of the farmers, to my mind it is timely.  We know it is geared towards the preparation of pre-Budget submissions to the Minister for Finance and it behoves the farming community to get in now in order to obtain a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>I shall not dwell extensively on the matter of our entry into the EEC except to say that there are doubts expressed on this matter due to lack of communication between our negotiators and the people of the country.  The Government should make every effort to ensure that everyone is aware of what is happening and in this regard full use should be made of all communications media.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that it is difficult to estimate the individual farm income because it depends on the line of production being followed and many other factors.  The Department estimated the average farm income in 1970 at approximately £915 per year.  This was <Col N="1670" /> a rough guess worked out on the basis of so many million pounds as against a few hundred thousand farmers.  A survey was carried out by the Agricultural Institute which, when brought up to date, gives a figure of approximately £875 per year.  Of course, farmers could dispute these figures because they are only guesses; there are more than 300,000 holdings in the country, each of which does not constitute a farm. However, whether the amount is £875 or £915 it is inadequate when compared with the income of professional or industrial workers.  The gap is widening and farmers' incomes are diminishing.</P>
    <P>Representing a traditional dairy area I am keenly interested in the plight of the milk producers.  They are undoubtedly the hardest working section of the community.  They have no five-day week; it is Monday to Sunday or Sunday to Monday.  It is a demanding life and they are badly paid for the hard work they do.</P>
    <P>The average price paid by creameries in 1970 ranged from 1s 11d to 2s 4d per gallon.  This brings home the fact that creameries have not rationalised and that the system in general has not improved.  One will find the 1s 11d is paid by the small creameries most of which are owned and run by the Dairy Disposal Board.  They are the worst payers in the business.  As a semi-State service they should be giving good example but unfortunately they are not.  There have been complaints over many years on this matter. The 2s 4d was paid by creameries who had improved their methods and who had an opportunity of selling their diversified produce.  Deputy Dowling, a little while ago, was defending and looking after the interests of the Dublin housewife.  He cannot be blamed for that; he lives in Dublin.  He said it was hard to understand how the farmers were getting so little for their milk when it was costing so much to the Dublin housewife.  He was quite sure that the farmer had a grievance, and that is a big concession coming from a Dublin Deputy.</P>
    <P>Milk supplied to creameries over the years had been increasing up to quite recently because farmers were given incentives <Col N="1671" /> to improve their herds, to improve their layout generally, and they put a lot of capital into doing so. Despite all that, the quantity of milk delivered to creameries is reducing.  In 1969, 540,000 gallons were delivered; in 1970 it was under 520,000 gallons; and in 1971 the estimated supply will be under 500,000 gallons.  This is due, naturally, to people getting out of milk production because they cannot get a living in it.  It is mishandling by the Government that is causing this unfortunate situation.  There was an article in the <i>Evening Herald</i> last night under the heading: &ldquo;Brainwashed on Butter&rdquo;.  I quote:</P>
    <P>How are the non-agriculturally-minded public, at least the non-dairying-industry public to comprehend the current reasoning that there may be the possibility of butter rationing?  Year after year the statistics and information on this aspect of the agricultural industry have shown, we have been told, a dangerous tendency to over-production.  We have come to believe we have been producing too much milk, consequently too much butter, cheese etc. and that there will be a glut and we will not be able to get rid of our surplus dairy produce.</P>
    <P>That is far from happening now.  We have no surplus of dairy produce.  We have no butter in cold storage and we are not sending it to eastern countries at a price which would relate to about 3d a gallon here.  I must refer again to Deputy Dowling's very good comment on the butter situation.  He suggested that instead of sending it out to foreign countries, practically giving it away&mdash;I do not believe it was paying for the freight charges&mdash;and sending it over to Britain under the quota system to be eaten at 1s 6d a pound, provision should be made for making it available at home at a cheaper price.  He suggested old age pensioners, but I thought it would have been a very fine gesture on the part of the Government to provide people in county homes and mental hospitals with cheaper butter. This would have a favourable effect on our economy and butter would not have to be provided for these institutions <Col N="1672" /> out of taxation.  Let me continue with the quotation from the <i>Evening Herald:</i></P>
    <P>... and also that on joining the Six the days of the traditional Irish small farmers were numbered.  Current figures now show the amount of milk delivered to creameries as being 12 million gallons under last year's total and there is a danger we might not be able to fulfil our commitments to foreign markets.  If this should prove correct there is reason to suspect some serious bungling somewhere. Have Irish farmers been so brainwashed about over-producing of milk that many of them have diversified into other aspects of agriculture? This must be the conclusion to be drawn from this week's butter scare, the complete reversal of last year's policy.</P>
    <P>That is quite right.  That is what has happened, but I see here a denial of that this morning under the heading: &ldquo;No Milk or Butter Rationing&rdquo;.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Reports that there was a prospect of butter and milk rationing in order to meet export requirements were denied yesterday by both the Department of Agriculture and Bord Bainne.  The Department in a statement said it would appear that there was some misunderstanding about milk production trends in 1970.  In fact total estimated milk production in 1970 was greater than in 1969.</P>
    <P>That is far from the truth.  If anybody would go to the bother of looking up the returns he would see that that information is not correct.  It could be a juggling of words.  The Government may have estimated how many cows are producing how many calves, but what we are interested in is milk supplied to creameries for butter and cheese production.  That statement is not correct and I have no hesitation in taking the Department to task for it.</P>
    <P>Further down there is a statement from Bord Bainne:</P>
    <P>Even if there were to be a further reduction in the quantity of milk received by creameries&mdash;which should not be assumed&mdash;the diversion to the British market of some <Col N="1673" /> of the supplies of butter and other milk products sent in previous years to the highly unprofitable overseas markets would ensure that any possible British requirements could be fully met.</P>
    <P>There will be no question of rationing butter on the home market in order to fill export orders, Mr. Joseph McGough, general manager of Bord Bainne, said.</P>
    <P>Mr. McGough said that the normal procedure followed by the Board in marketing plans is to provide first for the home market and then for the export market.  If there is any fall in milk intake it will inevitably mean a reduction in the production of dairy products.</P>
    <P>Mr. McGough said that they had forecast an output of 550 million gallons of milk last year&mdash;30 million gallons more than the previous year. But instead of an increase there had been a drop of 40 million gallons.</P>
    <P>How does that relate to the Department's statement that there was an increase in 1970 despite the dry year? They should get their facts right.  That is in their own article under the same heading.</P>
    <P>The true position is that the farmers are being frightened out of milk production and that is no wonder considering the way they are being treated. Our butter stocks are gone and, in the long run, we may not be able to supply our quota to Britain.</P>
    <P>Bord Bainne are purchasing skim milk powder from New Zealand and Amsterdam to supply their plant in the Philippines, at enhanced prices of course.  Do people realise the significance of that?  I believe the price per ton is very high.  When we had large supplies of milk due to over-production, it was very hard to dispose of it and the price was something like £40 a ton.  That is subject to correction. Something like £100 has been added to that, I believe, but again I am subject to correction.  My information is not quite clear.  That should bring it home very forcibly to the Minister that he should have another look at the unfortunate situation of the milk producers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1674" /> He should now heed the demands of the dairy farming organisations for a substantial increase in the price of milk.  I am sure that the downward trend in milk production could be stopped and we could have the upward trend that we now require.  The Minister should also do away with the price system.  I have some reservations about this.  This system penalises efficiency. In all probability we would have better quality if we had another system of payment.  It is necessary to give a big injection of money to the dairy farmers.</P>
    <P>We are probably going into the Common Market and we should be gearing ourselves towards high quality products, efficiency in processing and the highest marketing capacity of the producer. The co-operatives are very important. This was referred to by Deputy Carter.  They are doing a fine job where they are recognised.  I saw some advice given yesterday:</P>
    <P>Many of the problems at present affecting agriculture would be considerably lessened if the Government would give encouragement and support to the Agricultural Co-operative Movement, says Mr. Bill Carroll, President of the IAOS.  He told delegates to Co-operative Societies regional conference in Thurles.</P>
    <P>That is good advice and I hope it will be noted.  To take our place within the Common Market it is necessary to reorganise our dairy set-up from farm to market.  This is the aim of the Community countries but we are going in the other direction.  The Government have introduced their price system which has debarred the efficient farmer from the incentives which should be his.  Encouragement and advice should be given to co-operative societies and the Dairy Disposal Board to rationalise the collection and processing of milk so that the farmer will get a good price.  He does not get that now.</P>
    <P>Training in the marketing of dairy produce should be subsidised by the Department so that we will be ready to take our place within the Community. We will have to sell our produce in competition with other countries which have efficient marketing organisations. When we become a full member <Col N="1675" /> some creameries will be paying over 1s a gallon less than others. Seemingly this is already happening within the Six, due to the efficiency of one creamery over others.  That should not be allowed to happen here.  Now is the time to prepare so that all our farmers will get the maximum price for their produce.</P>
    <P>In this serious situation the Government will have to find a better answer for the farmers than they have given so far.  When the farmers are looking for anything the reply generally is that there is nothing in the kitty, but there is always something for all other sections.  Like Mother Hubbard whose cupboard was bare when she went to get her poor doggy a bone, that is the answer that is given in relation to agriculture at the moment.  That will not be accepted in future because it is very far from being correct.  Farmers would prefer to direct all their attention and energy to preparing for the challenge of the Common Market. They would prefer to be improving their position rather than campaigning as they are forced to do.  This is precious time.  Time is short and it is up to everybody to make the best use of it. The Government, even at this late stage, must accept that it is vitally important that farm incomes should be kept abreast of national trends.  Let the Government meet the farmers' organisations at the conference table before further time is wasted and irreparable harm done to our general economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the Minister but I have been sitting here for three or four days and I should like to make a few points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the honour to represent a constituency in which there are the <Col N="1676" /> very best farmers in Europe.  I have been listening to people crying here that the Government are not doing anything for the farmers.  In my constituency the farmers are able to do a good deal for themselves and are not always depending on the Government and crying that the Government are not doing this or that for them.  They have initiative enough to do something for themselves.</P>
    <P>I come from old farming stock. There were no subsidies in my young days and my grandfather and my father carried on.  Today the trend is to blame the Government for everything. I would like to see the people who are blaming the Government and the leaders of various farming organisations trying to do something for themselves and taking an example from the people of my constituency who had the initiative to start out at a time when there were no grants or loans.</P>
    <P>While the last speaker is an honourable, decent man, he reminded me of the banshee of old with his cry that the Government were doing nothing for the farmers.  In the constituency which I have represented for nearly 27 years or in the area from which I came I never knew a farmer who was not able of his own initiative to do something for himself and his family.  There was a feeling in Ireland when I was young that if there was a good harvest none of the family would die of hunger.  That was the outlook then.  Today we give over £100 million to the agricultural community. There is about £45 million paid out in subsidies, directly or indirectly. We have all the advisory services possible for farmers today.  As a member of the County Dublin Committee of Agriculture I want to say that we have the best advisory service possible.  We have tried to do everything possible to improve the conditions of farmers but I would like to see more advisory inspectors because some of them in my constituency are very overworked. They are dedicated men and they are anxious to see farming improved even further in the county.  I admit that we are near a good market but our people have initiative and are contributing to the welfare of our country.  I want to pay a tribute to these farmers whom I <Col N="1677" /> have had the honour to represent for many years.</P>
    <P>I do not usually transgress the laws of courtesy by interfering with the Minister when he is called upon to speak but having been here for so long I had to take the opportunity.  Dairy farmers in County Dublin are gradually going out of business.  The reason is that although the dairy farmer in County Dublin is not paying the ordinary worker the average wage laid down by the agricultural wages board but a good deal more, he cannot get men to work because we are so near the city and the county and city are becoming more and more industrialised. Hence a number of dairy farmers are going out of business.  This is a big problem for the liquid milk suppliers and one they asked me to raise on their behalf when they were with me the other night.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond spoke of what he would do if he were Minister for Agriculture or if his party were in power. Listening to him one would imagine that nothing was ever done for the farmers of Ireland.  I had great sympathy with him.  He made his point as well as he could but he knew nothing of what he was talking about.  The advisory services under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, and the county committees of agriculture, have been in existence for years and great advances have been made.  The institute in County Dublin dealing with horticulture and the Agricultural Institute have been doing a good job.  They have encouraged more and more people to go to the agricultural colleges.  The County Dublin Committee of Agriculture operates scholarship schemes.  We find it very difficult sometimes to fill vacancies.  The horticultural college in Kinsealy is doing a very good job in regard to tomato and vegetable growing and disease control.  When I was first elected to represent County Dublin there were only a few tomato houses there.  Today there are acres of tomatoes. We have our problems too.  We must compete with the Dutch and we want to ensure that we will be able to do that.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister for his generous grants to the horticultural community for glasshouses.  There are <Col N="1678" /> hundreds of acres of glass in County Dublin.  Twenty-seven years ago I suppose there would have been two or three acres of glass in the same area. There is a problem for people going in for heated houses.  I have a letter here from Hayestown, Rush, County Dublin:</P>
    <P>Please be informed that we wish to protest at the present trend of the increase in heavy oil prices for agricultural use.</P>
    <P>The letter goes on to say that during the last six months the price of heavy oil has increased by 16½ per cent approximately.  The actual increase was 25 per cent.  At the present time oil companies are talking about further increases in price.  I make this point to show that my constituents are concerned about the increased costs because they want to sell at a competitive price.  If the increase is justified, it should be on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  I will give this letter to the Minister.  Increased oil costs have contributed to increases in the cost of heating glasshouses. Without the grants from the Department it would be impossible for the farmers to heat the houses.  More and more tomatoes are grown in the country each year.  Much has been said about the co-operative movement.  We have a certain amount of co-operation with the North Dublin Growers but we had co-operative societies in County Dublin before now and many individuals exported vegetables to Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Manchester.  These people contributed a great deal to our economy without any help.  People nowadays should be more independent.  The idea of blaming the Government is ridiculous. There is only so much of the national cake to go around.</P>
    <P>Many sectors of our people need help.  All go-ahead farmers prosper.  I remember the time when bonhams were sold for 7s or 8s, and eggs for 6d a score.  A hen was sold for 2s 6d and a chicken for 1s.  There were no subsidies. The Agricultural Credit Corporation was not in existence.  I was reared between Newport and Westport. Every farm in that area had pigs, fowl, chickens and butter.  Each farmer grew his own vegetables.  The people <Col N="1679" /> lived from their own resources.  In Westport today the people are getting their vegetables from Dublin and blaming the Government.  They are not able to live on their own resources now.  Those responsible for the farmers' organisations should advise the farmers to be more self-sufficient.</P>
    <P>There are many uneconomic holdings in the country.  More should be done for the people living on such holdings.  Long ago there was co-operation among the farmers.  At haymaking time or during the threshing the neighbours all helped.  In times of illness there was co-operation.  In my own constituency I have seen small farmers buying expensive machinery costing £500 or more and leaving it idle half the time.  This is uneconomic. The agricultural advisers, if they had not got such big areas, could advise the farmers on co-operation.  We are going into the EEC.  We want to see our country survive and our people succeed. When one section of our people goes down, we all go down.  A society is as strong as its weakest link.  The more production we have the better because the consumer has a better chance of getting his food at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been subjected to painful pin-pricks.  It is time someone spoke out.  Is protest our only action nowadays?  Can we not discuss the possibility of helping ourselves without blaming others?  I came from the land and I had a hard life in my younger days.  The people were proud and hardworking. Great advances have been made under the various Governments and people should know better than to say that the Government are not giving them enough.  The Government have been responsible for land drainage schemes, the arterial drainage scheme, which the present Minister dealt with in the Office of Public Works, and the soil testing scheme, <i>et cetera</i>.  If St. Peter came down, he could not help the farmers unless they were prepared to help themselves.</P>
    <P>Why do the farming organisations not try to get more foreign markets for their products?  Life on a small farm is a struggle for existence.  A <Col N="1680" /> small farmer should have a part-time job.  There are too many uneconomic holdings in Ireland, but these could be saved by the co-operative movement. Our cattle trade has been affected over the years.  The same thing applies to our sheep trade.  To deal again with Government policy generally on agriculture 77 per cent of the farms are derated.  What more can we do?  We have to depend on the nation's resources to make this contribution and if through the nation's resources we could do more we would.  We have a national problem of too many small or uneconomic holdings.  The Minister cannot work miracles.  National and local organisations should try, as my friends in County Dublin have done, to solve their problems in their own way.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about wheat, barley and potatoes.  During the war we had to grow wheat because we had only our own resources to depend on.  The farmers and the people did not let us down nor will they ever let us down.  I am delighted to see that the Labour Party have been converted to the idea that we are going into the Common Market.  There was a feeling that we should build a wall around ourselves and keep everyone out.  We have various parties outside, the intelligentsia, who do not want us to join the Common Market.  Would these people ask themselves do they want to sabotage our economy by building a wall so that nobody can come in or go out, so that we would be like monks living on an island and would have to lower our standards of living.  The day has gone when you could adopt that kind of policy.  President Wilson introduced that policy in the USA but he realised years afterwards that the evil men do lives after them while the good is oftimes buried with their bones. The Americans got a rude awakening when Pearl Harbour was attacked and they found that they had to ally themselves with the free nations of the world.</P>
    <P>Some people advocate that we should isolate ourselves.  Do they ever think or are they nationals at all?  There is no such thing in the Common Market as interference with our national ideals or of compromising our national outlook. <Col N="1681" /> You can co-operate with your neighbour and still retain your individuality. I was a representative to the Council of Europe for a few years and I did not find that the French had turned into Germans or Italians.  They were still completely French.  The Germans and Italians also retained their individuality.  People should be asking more questions about the Common Market and I should like to see the various organisations who can afford it, visiting Brussels in order to know more about the Common Market.  I am not saying that the Common Market is Heaven on earth but if all the other countries go into it we cannot stand aside.  I have sufficient confidence in our farmers, in the agricultural community generally and in our horticulturalists to know that they will stand up to any competition.  The country survived even after the Famine.  We have often asked: how did our forefathers exist under such privations?  A proud tradition has been handed down to us.  I do not want to hear any more banshees saying that we are not doing this or that.</P>
    <P>It is easy enough to blame everybody. If the Minister could give £100 million more to agriculture he would do it but we can only go as far as our resources allow and we have to be concerned with the wellbeing of every section.  We have to ensure that nobody will be hungry or in want.</P>
    <P>I am sorry, a Cheann Comhairle, if I was somewhat heated with you today and I wish to take this opportunity of apologising but I was here for three days.  I am a westerner.  I have said I am sorry and please accept my apologies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be said that Irish agriculture is in the doldrums. We have no grand plan for the future despite the fact that in a few years we may be in the EEC.  What we want today is a grand plan or programme for the future so that the farmers and the nation will get the full benefit if and when we enter the EEC.  Instead of co-operation and co-ordinated effort between the Minister, the Government and the farmers and their organisations we have the Government and the Minister&mdash;as <Col N="1682" /> we had them in 1966 and 1967&mdash;at loggerheads with the farmers. Yesterday Deputy O'Sullivan asked a question of the Minister and in reply the Minister would not admit that there was a dispute between the farmers and the Government.  As I said before, words seem to have lost their meaning.  It would be much better for the Government and the Minister to face reality, to face up to the fact that when the farmers should be adopting modern methods, becoming more efficient and co-operating in every way with the Government to get the best out of the land, there is a protracted dispute and again the Minister and the Government are standing idly by.</P>
      <P>God knows we have enough trouble in the North with different sections fighting between themselves and we do not want that here; we should try to give an example.  Unfortunately in the last few years we have been at the top of the ladder as far as strikes are concerned. While I admit that people are entitled to go on strike it is the duty of the Government before any strike takes place to do their best to bring the sections together and sit down around the table, as the Government and the farmers will have to do some time, I hope in the near future, and iron out their problems.</P>
      <P>Can we not do this now for the farmers?  Can the Minister not be man enough to say to those people: &ldquo;Come in and meet me.  I know you have your problems but as far as I am concerned I am prepared to do what I can to iron them out&rdquo;?  Deputy Burke was blaming the farmers and he asked if they could not do something for themselves. The farmers have done a lot for themselves over the years since the NFA, Macra na Feirme and other organisations were formed in trying to educate farmers to avail of new techniques, to adopt progressive ideas and they have done a great deal for the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke criticised the Labour Party for building a wall around Ireland and for cutting ourselves off, like a dead branch from a tree.  Surely the Deputy must know that this is exactly what Fianna Fáil did in the past.  It was they who told us that our <Col N="1683" /> best market was gone and good riddance. Mr. Frank Aiken said that if every ship on the sea was sent to the bottom and that if a wall was built around Ireland we could do very well without England or the rest of the world.  Fianna Fáil preached and practised the isolationist policy that Deputy Burke is now criticising and their policy practically beggared the farmers and other sections of the community also.</P>
    <P>We have selective justice in this country.  I remember in 1966 when there was an NFA dispute the farmers marched from Donegal and Cork to Dublin.  Farmers do not leave their homes and families and trudge many miles unless they have good reason. They sat outside Government Buildings for 21 days while the Minister and the Government refused to meet them. The Government tried to divide them and thought that in this way they could conquer them, and any time there was a chance of settlement fuel was thrown on the fire by an arrogant Minister for Agriculture who was then in power.</P>
    <P>I remember when there was a rates campaign and the present Taoiseach went on television.  He said that they would break the farmers' organisations and that they would not allow the organisations to disrupt the law and authority of the country.  When the farmers paraded outside Leinster House they were arrested and lodged in Mountjoy Prison.  At that time the Government used a bulldozer to crack a nut.  I know many decent, hardworking farmers&mdash;among them the Minister's brother&mdash;and it was a disgrace that during that campaign television and radio were informed at six o'clock in the morning that the full powers of the State, including the Garda and the Army, were brought in to demand rates from these people. There was no necessity for this display of strength.</P>
    <P>It might be a good thing if the Taoiseach would now make the same kind of speech about the anarchists we have in this country who are now getting away with murder and robbery without any action being taken against them.  The farmers cannot be blamed <Col N="1684" /> if they are annoyed because when they paraded in a peaceful fashion outside Leinster House they were arrested.  At least 20 or 30 other parades and public meetings have been held without hindrance but this was denied to the farmers.  They were kept within half-a-mile of the gates of Leinster House and were obliged to conduct their meeting at the bottom of Merrion Square.  Last week I saw a lorry which was used for a meeting parked in an area where there was a double yellow line.  I am not objecting to those people being allowed to hold meetings but, equally, the farmers should not have been arrested when they came on a peaceful demonstration.  The Government are afraid to deny the right to hold a public meeting to other groups because they know they will lose votes.  Last week the students sent a deputation to the Minister and he had the television cameras on the spot in order to get publicity.  This kind of selective justice is wrong.</P>
    <P>I do not like farmers' strikes.  The farmers have more to lose than anyone else.  If the law is broken and if there is a further drift towards anarchy the farmers, being property owners, will have to pay for any damage and losses that may occur.  While I am a member of the NFA, I have always advised them to act as peacefully as possible.  I believe that is their idea and intention at the present time.</P>
    <P>In Fine Gael we believe in co-operation, co-ordination and dialogue.  This is what we should have at the present time but, unfortunately, this is not the case.  The war has gone on for too long and the Government are to blame.  I remember the Taoiseach speaking a year ago about wiping the slate clean. That is what we want and we should like to see those ideas translated into definite action.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries should meet the farmers and make their contribution towards wiping the slate clean.  The sooner this impasse is ended the better.</P>
    <P>There is little use in holding out an olive branch in one hand and a cudgel in the other&mdash;this has happened too often in the past.  It is just as well to tell the Minister and the Government <Col N="1685" /> that they will not trample on the organised farmers.  The farmers are entitled to organise and it is fair to say that they now speak with a reasonably unified voice.  The farmers are entitled to a fair crack of the whip but they are not getting it today.</P>
    <P>If this war between the farmers and the Minister continues many innocent people may suffer.  I have here an article taken from the <i>Longford Leader</i> of 13th February, 1971.  It is headed &ldquo;Non-purchase campaign: appeal for full support&rdquo;.  It lists agricultural machinery and new self-propelled and power-driven machines which the farmers are asked not to purchase.  It includes new cars, tractors, lorries, new bulk tanks, new combine harvesters, new potato harvesters, new power saws, new bulldozers and diggers, new milking machines and coolers.  Under the heading of &ldquo;New Equipment&rdquo; there is also listed: new tedder and all haymaking equipment, new ridgers, corn drills and sowing equipment, new sprayers and balers, new muck spreaders, new fertiliser and lime spreaders, new car and tractor trailers and horse boxes, new loaders and scrapers, new grain and milk bulk tanks, new cattle crushes, new mowers, new shearers, new grain dryers, new feeding troughs and feeding racks, new gates, new feed mixers and grain and milk equipment.  They have also been told not to buy fertilisers or lime.</P>
    <P>We realise that it would be bad for the country if this should continue and it behoves the Minister and the Government not to deny that there is a dispute.  They should face up to their responsibilities.  They should meet those people and as quickly as possible resolve the dispute.  I shall give figures later to prove that the farmers have a just case because of the increased costs of production, rates, taxes, <i>et cetera</i> while the price of their produce has not increased at the same rate.  It can be truthfully said that the failure of Fianna Fáil to introduce a long-term plan for Irish agriculture has, more than any other factor, been responsible for our failure to deal adequately with the nation's chronic social and economic problems and in particular to arrest the social and economic disintegration <Col N="1686" /> of large parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The Government have no policy on agriculture.  They have no printed programme or guidelines for the future. As in other matters concerning this Government, it is merely political expediency, doing what they think will get them the most votes at a particular time and paying little heed to what is best for agriculture or for the economy as a whole.  Until the last seven or eight years agricultural produce constituted the majority of our exports, and our land and our climate were our principal natural resources.  In recent years the development of industries capable of exporting has reduced our dependence on agriculture.  At the same time agriculture plays a most important part in the viability of our economy. Prosperity cannot be assured without a comprehensive and dynamic long-term programme of agricultural development.  The sooner the Government sit down with organisations like the NFA, Macra na Feirme and plan the guidelines and the targets for the future, the better for the farmers and for the whole country.</P>
    <P>We know also, and we hear a great deal about it on television, that over the years large sums of money have been spent by the Government in an effort to improve the farmer's income or at least to prevent it from deteriorating too much in relation to that of other sectors of the community. However, support to agriculture has been essentially of a short-term kind&mdash; farm subsidies of various sorts designed to deal with the present social demands rather than to form part of a long-term plan to improve the competitiveness of agricultural production and the capacity of the farmer to face up to the more competitive period we are going through at present and which undoubtedly lies ahead.</P>
    <P>We all welcome the State aids to agriculture but what the majority of farmers want is not doles or sops but fair and just prices so that they and their wives and families can live in frugal comfort.  In an undeveloped country like ours where there is so much drainage work and land improvement work to be done, instead of paying doles and sops work could and should be provided <Col N="1687" /> in rural areas.  Instead of giving the farmer a dole of £4 and £5 a week. which I claim can in many cases be degrading to the people that receive it, it would be much better to provide three or four days work or a week's work, if possible, at a good wage, on drainage or forestry.  That, plus his small farm, would bring him in a reasonable return.  More than anything else it would help to increase production and to bring more land into use. Since the land project was introduced I think 1,200,000 acres of land, scrubland covered with rocks, which could not be tilled for the want of proper drainage, has been made arable.  That could be of vital importance to this country in the future.</P>
    <P>When it is said that £100 million is given to the farmers in relation to agriculture, it should be pointed out to urban dwellers that out of that £100 million come the salaries of the Minister and officials of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the committees of agriculture, the salaries of the professors in the agricultural institutes and universities, the subsidies on lime, much of which goes to CIE.  Even the Botanic Gardens and the Zoo expenses are paid out of that; and the subsidy to small farmers under £20 valuation.  Figures were published recently from the Agricultural Institute which showed that farmers of around £30 poor law valuation are earning only something like £300 per year. Even the city people will have to admit that any small farmer under £20 valuation is entitled to derating.</P>
    <P>The subsidy for the export of butter to Britain also comes out of this £100 million.  It has been argued&mdash;and I think the suggestion has been made by Fianna Fáil Deputies&mdash;that butter should be given to our people at reduced rates.  That is another problem. However, out of this £100 million come also the salaries of the inspectors operating the subsidy for beef production, the salaries of creamery managers and others engaged in the creamery industry.</P>
    <P>All these items come out of that £100 million, and I doubt very much if £40 million of it goes into the <Col N="1688" /> pockets of the farmers.  It is wrong to have this argument going on between the urban dwellers and the agricultural organisations.  Someone should find out and tell the people of this country how much is going on all the items I have mentioned and how much is going into the farmers' pockets.  I think less than half, and I think nearer to one-third of it finds its way into the farmers' pockets.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Burke state here that in the last analysis the standard of living of everybody in this country depends on agriculture.  We all admit that Ireland is an agricultural country with 12 million acres of fertile arable soil and about 2.8 million people.  We have very little underground wealth such as coal, steel, ore or anything like that, although some has been found now, thank God.  The standard of living of the vast majority of the people, whether they live in the city, the town, or the country, depends on what the farmer and his worker can get from the land and export profitably.  We need the money from abroad to buy the raw materials to help to keep the wheels of industry turning.</P>
    <P>We all welcome new industries. Great credit is due to the late Deputy Sweetman and the late Deputy Norton for bringing foreign industrialists here. I heard Deputy Burke speaking a few minutes ago about people building a wall all around Ireland.  Up to 1956, Fianna Fáil had built a wall around Ireland.  Our people were being exported.  They were going to Birmingham and London and other places to work in industries.  Full credit is due to the Government who came to the conclusion that, instead of having our people working abroad, it was better to scrap the Act that had made us a little island and allowed nobody in from abroad to start industries here. They decided to give incentives and to invite people from abroad with the technical know-how and the money to set up industries here.  Within three months of the passing of a new Act&mdash; and it was vigorously opposed by the present Government&mdash;the Whitegate Oil Refinery came in here with £12 million, and hundreds of industrialists came since.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1689" /> We all welcome those industries but, due to the fact that we have to purchase the raw materials abroad&mdash;and those industries certainly give valuable employment&mdash;out of every £50 million worth of goods that we export, we are lucky if we make £2 million profit for the economy.  We are all satisfied with that because it gives employment to our own people.  If we increase agricultural production next year or the year after, or even immediately, by £50 million, we will have perhaps £46 million or £47 million net profit coming back into the Exchequer to the distributed in the economy.  It may cost an extra £1 million for fertilisers or some new machinery, but we still have the land and the people on it.  Therefore, if we can increase our agricultural production by £50 million we have another £46 million or £47 million net coming into the country.  Therefore, our aim and our object should be to make ourselves as efficient as possible and to give the maximum help to agriculture to increase production.  When we have baked a bigger national cake we should give all sections, including the farmers, a fair and just share.  The farmers are not getting that at present.</P>
    <P>The farmers represent roughly 30 to 32 per cent of the people of this country.  It cannot be denied that they are responsible directly or indirectly for 65 per cent&mdash;and some say 70 per cent&mdash;of our exports; last year they got 16.1 per cent of the national income. Does anybody blame the farmers for being at war with the Government? They have been in many wars.  I heard Deputy Burke mention the economic war when pigs, he said, were selling at 7s 6d and hens at 1s.  We know who was responsible for that, but let us keep away from the past.  The farmers have been in many wars, national, social and economic and they played their part but their income is dropping. In 1968, their percentage of the national income was 17.4.  I asked the Taoiseach a question yesterday and he referred me to an answer to a similar question on 23rd July, 1970.  On that date I asked the Taoiseach to state:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The percentage domestic incomes in the following categories for the <Col N="1690" /> years 1967, 1968, 1969 and May or June, 1970 (or the latest available date): (a) farmers' incomes, (b) other domestic incomes and (c) industrial profits; and the number of people covered in each category.&rdquo;  Under the heading wages and salary, they get 62.7 per cent.  The exact number engaged in agriculture and fishing is 286,136 people.  They got 16.1 per cent of the national income.  Therefore, we have one-third of the people getting one-sixth of the national income.  These are the Government's figures and they cannot be denied.  These are the people who work hard.  For them there is no five-day week.  They have to work seven days in the week.  They have to work Saturdays and Sundays.  On Sunday mornings and Sunday evenings they have to milk the cows.  Many of their sons and daughters are not inclined to do that now.</P>
    <P>Let us take another sector of the people.  &ldquo;Others&rdquo; include people in industries, solicitors and so on.  There are 77,858 of them and they get 21.2 per cent of the national income. Remember the figure: 286,000 people get 16 per cent and 77,000 people get 21 per cent.  Fianna Fáil often speak about cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  Will they admit now that the farmers have not been cherished equally?  Deputy Burke asked why do the farmers go on the roads and why do they strike.  Will he not admit that when other sections of the community took similar action their incomes were immediately increased and, indeed, increased to a very high level?</P>
    <P>It will also be admitted that one of the things galling the farmers is that the gap between their wages and those of other sections of the community has widened to over £8 10s per week.  We got that recently in answer to a question that was asked in the House.  In 1948, the average income per head of those engaged in agriculture was £3 3s; in industry it was £4 0s 9d, a difference of roughly 17s.  In 1953, the average income of those engaged in agriculture was £5 4s; for those engaged in industry it was £5 9s 7d, a difference of only 5s 7d. In 1958, the average income per head <Col N="1691" /> of those engaged in agriculture was £5 10s; for those engaged in industry it was £6 15s, a difference of £1 5s.  In 1963, for those engaged in agriculture it was £7 7s; and for those engaged in industry it was £9 7s 4d, a difference of £2 4s.</P>
    <P>In 1966 those engaged in agriculture had £9 7s; those engaged in industry, £12 2s 9d, a difference of £3 5s 9d.  At present the gap has increased to £8 10s. Is it any wonder then, with that huge gap, that the farmers are dissatisfied?</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder they are demanding what they believe to be their right, a fair and reasonable return for their work?  The number of farmers in this State is dropping severely.  I asked the Taoiseach on 17th February, 1971, the total numbers of farmers in the State in 1956, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969 and 1970.  I was told:</P>
    <P>The estimated number of farmers in the State which are available for census of population years only were 235,331 in 1951; 210,331 in 1961 and 200,625 in 1966.  The last census of population was taken in 1966.</P>
    <P>Therefore, between 1951 and 1966 the number of farmers in this country declined by 34,706.  There is a very good reason for it.  The farmers today are being crushed with rising rates and taxes and overhead expenses and they are not getting a corresponding increase in their selling prices so that they and their families could live in frugal comfort.</P>
    <P>In the last few years there have been enormous increases given to the agriculture labourer.  He is entitled to them.  The agricultural labourers, along with the farmers, have worked hard down through the years, trudged together in the fields in hail, rain and snow for long hours.  Despite the increases that have been given, I asked the Taoiseach on 17th February, 1971, the total number of people employed on the land in 1956, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969 and 1970 and the reduction each year.  The Taoiseach replied that in 1956 there were 430,000 employed.  It had dropped in 1966 to 330,500 employed. There was a further reduction <Col N="1692" /> in the following year to 313,000.  We found ourselves with 303,000 in 1969 and in 1970&mdash;the figure is a preliminary estimate subject to revision&mdash;291,000. In 1968 there had been a drop of 9 per cent, in 1969 a drop of 10 per cent and this year it is estimated that there will be a drop of 12 per cent.  In the 15 years from 1956 to 1970 there has been a decrease from 430,000 to 291,000, a drop of 139,000.</P>
    <P>Ten or 12 years ago there was an allowance of £17 given by the Department of Agriculture to encourage farmers to employ workers.  While the pound has lost value, that £17 has not been increased for the last eight or ten years.  We appealed to the Minister to increase this allowance and this has been refused.  Instead of the doles and sops that are being given, it would be much better if the allowance could be increased and encouragement given to the farmers to employ more workers, because they need them.  There is no use in saying that farmers do not want extra labour.  The agricultural labourer is not getting nearly what he is entitled to, but unfortunately many small farmers are unable to pay that rate because many have not got it for themselves. The Government should come to the aid of those people and subsidise them so that they could keep more workers.  This would decrease emigration and it would also help to increase production and from the increased production every other sector of the people would benefit.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why those engaged on the land should continue to remain the unpaid drudges of our society.  There is no use talking about increased production unless the Government are prepared to help those engaged in increasing production.  To keep one's eye on production without thinking of the producers and those who work with them leads logically in the wrong direction.  In ancient and modern times very efficient jobs of production have been done with slave labour, but that day is gone.  Those working on the land are entitled to a fair deal.  The farmer is entitled to think of distributive justice and he is not getting it.  The day has passed when the man on the land can be expected <Col N="1693" /> to provide increased production, to provide luxuries for others and get nothing himself.  If one goes into the big hotels in the city or bars throughout the country one can see that others are having luxuries but the farmer or his son or his daughter have very little luxury.</P>
    <P>Those of us who were in places like Donegal and Wicklow found it depressing to go into farmers' houses and find nobody except people of 60, 65 and 70 years of age hobbling about on sticks.  They will tell you that their sons are not prepared to put up with what their fathers did and I do not blame them.  If there are three or four boys in a family and one or two go off to a city and get reasonably good jobs with a five-day week and come home on Friday night rattling money in their pockets and having a car, going off to socials and dances, the young lad at home on the land getting £1 or 30s from his father on Saturday night will not stay at home.  He cannot be blamed.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government faced up to that situation and did something about it.  Appeals to patriotism and sense of duty will fall on deaf ears unless those who make the appeals show real patriotism and even sacrifice.  If the farmers see selfishness, waste and inefficiency around them, it will be hard for them to have any respect for moral appeals directed towards them.  When he sees the squandermania involving £100,000 and much more of the taxpayers' money, he cannot be blamed.  It is little consolation to the farmer to be told that if the gap between his income and that of the city worker gets any greater, the Government may take action.  That is all he has been told in the past.  The gap is well over £8 10s a week now.</P>
    <P>The time has come for the Government to act if they are sincere.  Does the Minister believe that any section of Irish workers will stand idly by in the face of official indifference, falling incomes, rising costs, rising rates and official blunders?  At one time the farmers of the country were promised complete derating by the Government and by the Fianna Fáil Party.  The average rate at the time was 6s 6d in <Col N="1694" /> the £1.  The average rate in Ireland today is nearly 90s in the £1.  The Government have fooled the farmers down through the years.  Possibly some of them have deserved this.  They have been like the faithful collie dog which the Fianna Fáil Party can kick under the table and which comes back again wagging its tail.  There is an old saying that &ldquo;one can fool some of the people some of the time, but one cannot fool all the people all the time&rdquo;. I hope that the present Government will not be able to fool the farmers any longer.  If Irish farming is to be anything more than a hit-and-miss affair &mdash;and it should be an industry contributing manfully to the expansion of exports and to the whole economy&mdash; the principle of semi-parity with the urban and industrial incomes must be accepted.  The farmer's income should be brought up to that of the urban dweller.  As our principal producer the farmer is entitled to such income.</P>
    <P>I cannot blame the present Minister for the rows between the Minister and the farmers.  Deputy Blaney, a former Minister for Agriculture, made cold, calculating and deliberate efforts to start class-warfare between the farmers' organisations and between the urban and rural dwellers.  The idea was &ldquo;divide and conquer&rdquo;.  A firm foundation can be built on co-operation, discussion and consultation, and by sitting around a table ironing out the problems and finding out what we all have in common instead of bickering, fighting and wrangling as has happened in the past.  The farmers are disillusioned with the present situation.  The Minister stated that there was no row between himself and the farmers and this aggravated their frustration even more.  I would not blame them.  The farmers have been humiliated.</P>
    <P>The National Agricultural Council was set up a few years ago.  We pointed out that it would not be a success.  We would like to know when this body last met and what has happened.  Why is the Minister not trying to set up another body?  The different organisations representing the farmers&mdash; whether NFA, Macra na Feirme or other farmer groups&mdash;and the women's organisations connected with farming, <Col N="1695" /> should all have a say on this particular board.  The setting-up of this organisation was welcomed but the very day the NFA were to meet to nominate their representatives on the board, the Government arrested many of the farmers and lodged them in Mountjoy. That was the climate at that time.  This organisation was started three years ago.  Nothing has been done.  Why? Why were the Government not showing the hand of friendship to the farmers and assuring them that they knew and believed the farmers were entitled to organise just as other sections of the community do?</P>
    <P>The Government should have said that they were prepared to meet the farmers and to co-operate with them and to sit and discuss the problems and to give the farmers what they are entitled to, which is a fair share of the national income.  The Government should have had a programme for the future as a guideline so that the farmers would know where they were going.  Unfortunately, there are peaks and valleys in farming.  Every time the farmers increase their production the value of the produce falls.  Last year eggs were sold at 1s 3d a dozen.  This year eggs are scarce and they are selling at 6s or 7s a dozen.  The same problem exists for the farmer's wife who is trying to market her turkeys. If there is a plentiful supply, the price drops.  If there is a scarcity, she gets a reasonable return.  The farmer, when he increases production, gets lower prices. This is very discouraging and makes him chary of producing more than he believes he can sell.  This brake on Irish farming enterprises must be relaxed if the country is to get full benefit from its agricultural potential.  The potential is there.  Agricultural production should carry greater rewards.  Increased income is the real incentive. Everyone needs that.  If the farmer gets increases through greater production, he will increase his efforts and invest more in his land.  He may, perhaps, try to work harder to increase production, knowing that he will get extra income.</P>
    <P>Will our farmers go forward or drop back?  The Danes and the Scots are not wasting their time.  They are improving <Col N="1696" /> their bulls, fat cattle, milch cows, sheep and pigs.  We become too lackadaisical and we cannot afford that.</P>
    <P>An Foras Tionscail is doing good work.  It is to be congratulated.  It could do more valuable work, perhaps, in the years ahead by assessing the resources of our land, assessing the incomes of our farmers, in planning and developing programmes, introducing new techniques and helping farmers to prepare for the more competitive period which lies ahead.  The majority of our farmers are hard workers, but in order to face up to the competitive period ahead they will have to become more efficient.</P>
    <P>We have been told in the past that farmers are conservative and lacking initiative but that is not true of young farmers.  Macra na Feirme and the NFA have done good work in this regard and they are anxious that education be provided for young men. Something like 4,000 young men enter agriculture each year.  Many are anxious to be educated but there are only about 500 or 600 places in our agricultural schools and even of that number only about 150 to 200 go back to the land.  Many of them go into industry and more luck to them; the education they have got will help them.  There should, however, be greater facilities for agricultural education for our young people.  The Minister did mention that he intends to move in that direction.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer briefly to a speech made by the Minister to the executive committee of the General Council of Committees of Agriculture in Dublin, in which he referred to the reorganisation of our advisory service. I would ask him to hasten slowly in this regard.  He said that there had been very little change in its basic organisation since 1899.  That may be so.  He said also that the services were based on the county so that, in effect, you were organising 27 independent units and there was dual control of the service by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the county committees of agriculture.  He also stated that in his opinion the system did not meet either of those objectives <Col N="1697" /> and he had the impression that there was a general consensus in favour of a national, unified system.  He also said that he was aware of how opinions differed about how this unified system should be brought about.  I think the Minister is wrong.  It will be a retrograde step if he brings the control of the agricultural instructors and the advisory services under the control of the Department.</P>
    <P>Our farmers may have been conservative to a degree and it took a long number of years to educate them to avail of the facilities which were available to them, but perhaps there was a good reason.  For 700 years we had a foreign usurper and in the past the majority of officials were pro-British and the people would not co-operate with them.  When we got a native Government, many of our farmers and people were wary of any officials.  When I first went on a committee of agriculture a very small percentage of Westmeath farmers were prepared to avail of the excellent educational services available through our agricultural instructors and poultry instructresses.  I was often told by a farmer: &ldquo;I will put a graipe through one of them if he comes near the gate&rdquo;. That was the mentality, but the committees of agriculture have done excellent work since in overcoming that mentality.  Those committees consist of unpaid servants and they have done wonderful work down through the years for the farmers, in encouraging them and helping them to start classes and getting them to avail of the assistance that was available.</P>
    <P>It would be a bad thing if the Government infringed further on the rights and duties of these committees. It would be a good thing if there was less politics involved.  Farmers' organisations should be allowed to nominate members to the committees.  About four years ago, the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, introduced a Bill, which was passed, which gave local committees of agriculture authority to elect one-quarter of their members from outside county councillors or farmers' organisations.  When Deputy Blaney became Minister and had a row with the farmers' organisations, <Col N="1698" /> he bulldozed a Bill through this House which took away that right. That was a retrograde step.  If the Minister wants to improve the system he should not do it by taking away the existing rights of committees.  He could extend their rights and allow them to take in representatives of the various farming organisations.  If you have government from the top and if you have people coming down from Dublin dictating to the farmers they will resent it, but if you have the local committee co-operating with the farmers and co-ordinating their efforts, then there will be some advance.</P>
    <P>I want to give full credit to the chief agricultural officers, to the agricultural instructors, to the poultry instructresses and the home farm economic advisers the vast majority of whom are doing excellent work.  The Minister should be slow to take away this dual control because the local committees can get across to the farmers the type of information we all would like to get across to them.  It might be no harm to state at this stage that we believe agriculture is under-capitalised.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation have been doing reasonably good work in the last few years but if we are to prepare ourselves for entry into the EEC, then first of all the farmers' wives must have up-to-date houses and up-to-date kitchens, because if they do not have those, girls will not come to live in rural Ireland; they should have water and sewerage services and so on.  The farmers should have up-to-date outoffices and the most efficient ways of feeding their cattle, sheep and pigs. They should also have the most up-to-date farmyards.  Farmers who have visited Denmark, Britain or other places return saying: &ldquo;Oh, you should see the farmyards they have abroad&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>All this costs money and if the farmers are to adopt efficient methods and modern buildings, then they will need extra capital.  In the past, our farmers were wary about going to the banks and, indeed, it might be no harm to say that there is a type of credit squeeze on farmers today. It should be remembered that if a farmer did run an overdraft to £500 or £600, he has land, he has good <Col N="1699" /> security, but if the bank manager says to him, &ldquo;I want that money back inside one month&rdquo;, he could cripple that unfortunate farmer.  I have seen bank managers in County Westmeath crippling farmers because they demanded that overdrafts be reduced within a very short time.  If the banks could go on strike and remain out for eight or nine months, they should give the farmers a reasonable time to reduce their overdrafts.</P>

    <P>NOTE: The increase in the waiting lists from 1965 to 1970, despite the increase in accommodation provided in the meantime, is due to the greater willingness of parents of handicapped children to send them to institutions for training.</P>
    <P>In reply to previous Parliamentary Questions, I gave particulars of the steps which are being taken to provide <Col N="1705" /> additional residential places for the mentally handicapped.  Briefly, the position is that since 1965 over 1,000 places have been provided and there are at present schemes in course of construction or in planning which will provide a further 1,500 places.  These schemes include about 1,000 places for adults, but the provision of these adult places will, in many cases, result in the release of accommodation for children.  The programme when completed will meet the targets set by the Commission of Inquiry on Mental Handicap for residential accommodation for severely and moderately handicapped children and adults.</P>
    <P>In addition, the numbers of mentally handicapped persons attending services on a day basis has increased fourfold since 1965.  I am confident that with the completion of the programme for residential places and the further development of services on a day basis, the problem of the waiting period for residential centre will no longer be a significant one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that most of these special centres to which he has referred are under the control of voluntary organisations and that the Minister has not power to direct the admission of patients?  Will the Minister not agree that this curtails somewhat the power of the Department of Health when the centres are under the control of voluntary organisations?  Would the Minister not agree that it would be essential for the Department to take a more positive interest in this matter?  Further, is the Minister in a position to state in regard to Question No. 3 if the number of patients awaiting admission is on an upward or downward trend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had better read the reply to the question about the numbers.  In some cases the numbers have increased slightly because more persons have been brought to the notice of the Department owing to the growing knowledge of what can be done for handicapped children. Secondly, I see no reason to do more than remain in close contact with the organisations, most of whom are religious orders, in organising these places.  We have a national mental <Col N="1706" /> handicap association which I hope will give me advice about the extent to which there should be more co-ordination in the sharing of facilities.  Perhaps in course of time certain institutions might be asked to deal with a particular class of patient.  However, in view of the magnificent work of the religious orders and the fact that they are accepting vacancies as quickly as they can, I would not dream of putting them under any further direction than they are at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the religious orders are doing an excellent job and I should like to compliment them.  The Minister stated that the numbers awaiting admission are on the increase.  Would the Minister not agree because of the long delay and the fact that these children are suffering quite severely that more attention should be given to this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing all I can to arrange for these places.  When the Deputy sees the reply and bears in mind the fact that since 1968 some 102 children in Laois and Offaly have been placed in residential centres, and when he sees the number that are awaiting entry, he will find the position in his county is not unreasonable.  There are other counties with a more severe problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurke" hpid="Mrs. Burke Mrs. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the serious lack of institutional care available for mentally handicapped children in County Roscommon; and what plans his Department has for dealing with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that there is at present a shortage of places at special residential centres for mentally handicapped children in need of such care and I have already outlined the steps which are being taken to provide additional places.  Pending the provision of the extra places which are being planned on a countrywide basis, I have approved of a proposal to provide a small temporary unit at St. Patrick's, Castlerea, for the care of severely handicapped children.  A similar temporary unit has already been provided at St. Brigid's Hospital, <Col N="1707" /> Ballinasloe, and patients are being admitted to that unit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The present holder of the office of Chief Medical Officer, Dublin Health Authority, is resigning on 28th February, 1971.  Pending the dissolution of Dublin Health Authority on 31st March, 1971, the existing post is not being filled.  However, arrangements which the Eastern Health Board will make for the carrying out of the functions now discharged by the Chief Medical Officer are being discussed with the interested parties and decisions on this matter should be taken shortly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what is being discussed in relation to the Chief Medical Officer and the programme manager for community services and in relation also to the sanitary duties of the retiring Chief Medical Officer.  There must be a discussion with the authority concerned as to how these duties should be divided up and these negotiations are taking place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should <Col N="1708" /> communicate with the Dublin Health Authority on this matter.  I have been informed, and I have no reason to believe that this is not the case, that the duties of the retiring Chief Medical Officer will be divided among officers in such a way that there will be a proper carrying on of the work pending decisions on how these posts should be allotted and what should be the powers and responsibilities of the programme manager for community services and the officers under him.  How these should be co-ordinated with the work that has to be done in relation to the inspection of housing, sanitation, planning and control of pollution will also be considered.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will consider setting up a committee consisting of representatives of his Department, CIE and the councils of the city and county of Dublin to examine the feasibility of reopening the Harcourt Street railway line; and if he will examine the possibility of setting aside annually a part of the revenue from the road tax now spent on roads for the purpose of financing the reconstruction of the line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to set up a committee on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>A study is at present in progress under the aegis of An Foras Forbartha to examine in depth the transportation position, present and prospective, in South Dublin.  The study includes within its scope traffic and transport in all its aspects and will, no doubt, cover any possible utilisation of the former Harcourt Street railway line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the latter connection, however, I <Col N="1712" /> would refer the Deputy to my reply to a previous question on 25th November, 1970 when I stated that I was advised by CIE that, apart from the physical and engineering problems involved, the information available regarding potential traffic from the areas formally served by the line showed that reopening would have little or no effect on the relief of traffic congestion.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the question, I presume that the revenue referred to by the Deputy is the proceeds of the increases in motor tax rates on private cars and motor cycles imposed under the Finance Act, 1966 and the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1970. Under existing law the disposition of this revenue is a matter for the Minister for Finance in the first instance.</P>

Might I also assure the Minister that I am willing to wait for a week until after the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis if he will promise to announce its opening at that time?</P>

Certainly if what the Deputy suggests fits into that, well and good, but let us have it analysed in a scientific manner first.</P>

      <P>Because of the closure of the Suez Canal, a temporary surcharge of 2d per gallon was imposed on all petroleum products in July, 1967.  This surcharge was subsequently reduced and eventually removed from all petroleum products except petrol. In the case of petrol it was not removed because equivalent extra costs were incurred on the devaluation of sterling in November, 1967.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the company that to-date 88 workers have become redundant at Clara.  In addition, 24 younger workers left to seek alternative employment.</P>
      <P>In reply to previous questions on 16th December, 1970, I outlined the measures that were being taken to provide new employment in the area.  Since then, the Industrial Development Authority have completed negotiations for the establishment of a new industry at Clara.  This is expected to go into production at the end of June next and will provide employment for about 80 workers, mostly men, at full production. In addition, the IDA are negotiating with other promoters for the establishment of industries at Clara. I am not at liberty at this stage to give details regarding these proposals.</P>
      <P>I understand that officers of the Department of Labour, Manpower Training Service and AnCO visited Clara and advised the workers of vacant jobs in other parts of the country and of the retraining facilities available.  A small number of the workers have already been placed in other jobs or have been offered retraining. The process of endeavouring to place or retrain the workers who are prepared to move from Clara is continuing. In addition, AnCO will be prepared, if necessary, to provide <i>ad hoc</i> training in Clara for any new industry, depending on the requirements.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that workers in the firm concerned are at present on short time; and I am informed that their average weekly income has been reduced by about a third.  This situation has arisen from a world-wide recession in the woollen and worsted sector of the textile industry which has, in turn, affected adversely the export and home markets of the firm in question. I am informed that employment, even at a reduced rate, has been maintained at the plant only because of the management's efforts to lessen the adverse effect on the workers of this recession period.  My Department has had the situation under regular review with a view to assisting the firm in any way possible and is in constant touch with the management.  Córas Tráchtála is also in touch with the firm to see how their wide range of services could help in procuring export markets.  As this is the only firm of its kind in County Offaly, I am not clear what the Deputy means by similar firms throughout the county.  All industries, however, have available to them the services of Córas Tráchtála to assist them in developing their export markets.</P>

      <P>I assume that the point of the question is that a statutory requirement in the granting of naturalisation is that the Minister must be satisfied that the applicant is of good character whereas, before his arrival here, this applicant had come into conflict in a serious way with the law of his own country.  However, the Departmental records indicate that the man concerned was presumed by the then Minister to have acted from political motives as a Flemish nationalist and on that basis was allowed to settle here and was subsequently naturalised.</P>

While he remains an Irish citizen it would not be open to me to deport him but the facts which the Deputy points out with regard to this man's previous record were known, at the time he was naturalised, to the then Minister, the late Deputy Everett, and the fact that he had been condemned to death for his activities was taken into account by Deputy Everett in coming to a decision to naturalise him.  I understand that these matters were also known to a previous Minister for Justice in 1948 when that Minister decided to give the man political asylum at the time.</P>

      <P>The man made a false declaration in Holland on his own admission.  In his own statement that was made by him here after his entry into the country he admitted that he came in on a Dutch passport in the name of Franciscus Josef Faes having secured that passport from the Dutch authorities on false identity papers in Holland after he had escaped from prison in Belgium in 1948.  I am looking into the question of whether or not some of the declarations he made in the application for naturalisation were false and I would then, if satisfied on that, consider the question of the revocation or otherwise of his naturalisation.  The Deputy will appreciate that unless I revoked his naturalisation it would not be open to me to deport him.</P>

    <P>Following failure to obtain spare parts, the replacement of the cooker in the sergeants' mess by an Irish-manufactured solid fuel cooker was approved in 1969.  This cooker could not, however, be obtained as its manufacture had ceased.  The general question of replacement of all old solid fuel cookers throughout the Army had then to be considered and the economics of changing over to gas or electricity examined. It has recently been decided to switch to gas and it is expected that the cooker in the sergeants' mess will be replaced by a gas cooker in the near future.

      <P>Copies of the White Paper on Local Government Reorganisation were posted by the Government Information Bureau to the provincial newspapers on the evening of Friday, 5th February, 1971, with an embargo on publication before 11th February.  Copies were issued by the bureau to the daily newspapers on the morning of Tuesday 9th February, 1971, with a similar embargo.  Copies of the White Paper were sent by post on the evening of Wednesday, February 10th, 1971, to members of the Dáil with city addresses and to members of the Seanad.  Copies for other Deputies were left to be collected by them with their post at Leinster House on the morning of Thursday, 11th February.  Copies of the White Paper were posted to local authorities and other interested bodies on the evening of Wednesday, 10th February.</P>
      <P>I might add that it is standard practice, and has been requested by the news media, for the Government Information Bureau, following prior consultation with the Department concerned, to issue, whenever possible, to the media, in advance of publication, documents which, because of their length and complexity, require time for detailed study.  When this is done, an embargo on publication is requested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister stated, the White Paper dealt with very complex and involved issues which involved study, but is he aware that interested parties, Members of this House and chairmen of local authorities, were asked to comment on the White Paper in a matter of an hour or two after the Minister's Department had delivered copies of it by post?  Would he not consider it somewhat unfair that the news media, as far as provincial papers were concerned, would have a week, and as far as daily papers were concerned two or three days, in which to ask people to comment publicly on the paper although they would not have had sufficient opportunity to study it?</P>

      <P>If such a thing happened, and I know it did in one case, we consider that a breach of the embargo. We asked the Government Information Bureau to get in touch with one newspaper which did it and to let them know that we considered it a breach and asked them not to do it again.  It was unfair.  The other thing is purely a matter for the newspapers on which to make their own decision as to what type of publicity they wish to give a White Paper.  If the newspapers were looking for comments from people who had only read it, or who were only in receipt of it for an hour, it would be rather foolish of them to expect people to be able to give an enlightened and knowledgeable comment at that stage. I should like to stress to Deputies, and to local authorities, that the contents of this White Paper are of such importance to the public generally that it is rather foolish to rush in with comments at an early stage.

Over <Col N="1741" /> 6,400 people benefited from the rates waiver schemes last year.

      <P>The restrictions on the development of the systems in question have been relaxed, not removed. The limit of 500 is intended to keep multi-channel systems on a local basis.  If they were permitted on an unrestricted basis, they would quickly offset the legitimate advantage of better quality reception offered by our national service and seriously affect its revenue earning capacity.  For these reasons I cannot consider favourably the request in the last part of the question.</P>

I do not believe if the foreign stations were more readily available that people would switch over exclusively to them.  I think we have enough home-produced programmes that are more interesting.  However, with regard to the masts we have clear evidence that several parts of the countryside are disfigured by aerials and the situation would be equally as bad if masts were involved.  I presume this is the reason it was limited to 500?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Estimate for Agriculture and Fisheries, under the heading of B1&mdash;University Colleges (a)&mdash;there is a decrease of £269,000.  In 1969-70 the figure was £1,022,984 and this year it has been reduced to £753,984.  Many of us regard this as a retrograde step.  With the possibility of our entry into the EEC educational research and advisory services should get more assistance. No matter how much farmers may object regarding increases in rates and taxation, I do not think they would have objected to an increase in this case.  Research is essential so that we can find out, for example, what kind of beef is required on the Continent or whether the small, lean, meat-carrying sheep is given preference instead of the over-fat sheep.  Our young people need to be educated regarding research and I am surprised that a reduction was made in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In B 2&mdash;Veterinary Colleges&mdash;there is a decrease of £8,900 but I am glad to see that in subhead B 5&mdash;An Foras Talúntais&mdash;Grant-in-Aid for General Purposes (b) there has been an increase of £104,000.  This group are doing valuable work and much credit is due <Col N="1750" /> to them.  It might be a good idea if the agricultural instructors paid more visits to such organisations, kept in contact with them and acted as a link with the ordinary farmer.  In this way the benefit of the knowledge gained from scientific experiments could be passed on to the individual farmer.  Symposia or visits should be arranged by the Department so that their instructors could keep up to date and pass on the knowledge they have gained to the farmers.  More could be done in this direction; it would be money and time well spent.</P>
    <P>In subhead B 7&mdash;Research and Testing&mdash;there is a reduction of £17,303. There may be a reason for this but I must confess I was surprised to see this reduction.  Money spent on research and testing is well spent.  I do not believe we have done as much as we could in this area.  There are people who argue that we should import more cattle.  Recently we brought in the French Charollais and we have our own shorthorn, Aberdeen Angus and Hereford breeds.  The farmers are good judges regarding the type of cattle that thrives in certain areas of the country.  In the west the farmer is inclined to the Aberdeen Angus because it is a hardy animal.  However, an all-out effort should be made by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the research centres to obtain different breeds, to cross them and find out what type thrives best, what was the best conversion rate and, above all, what meat sells best either in the British market or in the European market.  Housewives throughout the world are getting choosey.  Doctors claim that too much fat leads to heart disease.  Someone told me that there are more men than women dieting nowadays.  Women diet for one particular reason, I suppose, to look slimmer; the men are inclined to diet to prevent them getting heart disease.</P>
    <P>The research department should work to the maximum at crossing the different breeds of cattle, the Charollais with the whiteheads, Aberdeen Angus and so on and find out what type of cattle thrive the best in a particular area.  The farmers of the Midlands believe that the whitehead, the Hereford, <Col N="1751" /> thrives the best.  They will give £5 or £10 more for a whitehead bull than for any other calf.  From a short-term point of view I think they are right if they want to sell at a price between £50 and £60, but for the farmer who is keeping it to grow into a 12 cwt or 14 cwt beast, I doubt if it is correct.  If farmers start experimenting it might take years to find out.  The Department, through An Foras Talúntais and the other organisations concerned, should concentrate on this type of research.</P>
    <P>Under Scholarships and Training including Grant-in-Aid, there is a provision of £64,548.  I spoke earlier on that and I think the Minister also said he intended to provide a certain number of places.  Something like 4,000 young people go into agriculture each year.  We have educational facilities in agriculture for only something like 500 to 600, but of this 500 or 600 who go to an agricultural school, only about one quarter of them return to farming. They enter some other branch of industry. In any case the education stands to them.</P>
    <P>Under the Improvement of Livestock, I am glad to see there is an increase of £23,341 for some of the things I mentioned earlier on.  We are all glad to see that under the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme there is a reduction.  The Department, under the different Ministers, have co-operated with farmers down through the years and it is gratifying that the amount allocated can be reduced by £1,500,000.  It is only right to give credit where credit is due.  Excellent work has been done by the veterinary surgeons, with very few exceptions. The Department caught on to some of them and struck them off the books, which they were quite right to do. However, 99 per cent of them did their work diligently and intelligently. I see an ex-Minister for Agriculture here, Deputy Haughey, and I give him credit for his contribution; during his reign the Department were concentrating on bovine TB eradication.  Anyway good work has been done by the Department, by the veterinary surgeons and by the local veterinary officers in the different counties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1752" /> There is an increase of £1,848,000 under the Brucellosis Eradication Scheme.  That is also money well spent.  I do not know whether it is the fault of the Department&mdash;may be it was lack of staff or lack of finance &mdash;but it is a pity they cannot concentrate on more counties than they are dealing with at the present time.  There are four or five counties free of the disease in the North-West.  There are four or five counties across from Westmeath, Meath, Louth and so on. These counties are participating in the scheme at the present time.</P>
    <P>However, I wish to indicate a shortcoming in the scheme and to give the example of two farmers in my county. Both of them had 50 to 60 cows.  One farmer was building up his herd.  He went to Trim and bought a cow which was riddled with the disease and infected his whole herd.  Another farmer close by was in the same position with his herd.  He was a conscientious man and questioned the Department's inspectors as to what he should do.  The inspector said: &ldquo;The only thing you can do, if you are not going to be robbed, is to advertise them for sale on the public market.&rdquo;  The farmer said: &ldquo;No.  I have a conscience.  This will ruin me but if I do what you suggest I could ruin and rob 50 or 60 other farmers.&rdquo;  He sent the cows away to a meat factory and got an average of £43.  The first farmer, who was a cleverer and slicker man, called a public auction.  Farmers came from Cork and Kerry, from all over the country, and he got from £70 to £120 for cows that were contaminated with brucellosis and they spread this disease to perhaps 50 or 60 farms where they had not the disease before.</P>
    <P>The Department's answer will be: &ldquo;We have not the staff or the money.&rdquo; I still think that where there is a herd like that in any county, whether it is inside or outside the scheme, the same rules and regulations should apply and the farmer should be allowed to avail of the compensation and to clear his farm off immediately instead of calling a public auction resulting in the contamination of perhaps 50 herds from different parts of the country.  The Minister himself is a progressive farmer and should try to meet this situation. <Col N="1753" /> Apart from that, full credit is due to everybody concerned with the scheme. I had my own herd tested a fortnight ago and I got word today to be at, home at half past nine in the morning. One cow has gone down and been taken away.  It does show the speed with which the staff work.  They are doing excellent work but, as I say, it is being nullified when a man with a herd which is badly infected with the disease can put it up for sale.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of General Disease Control, there is a reduction of £14,000.  I wonder whether the Warble Fly Scheme comes under that heading. While I have praised the Department in the last ten or 15 minutes I think they have slipped up badly in this regard.  I am not certain whether it was the fault of the Department, of the Minister or the advice they got from the National Agricultural Council at the time.  I had arguments here with Deputy Blaney over it.  I do not want to blame anyone personally.  I do not know myself which of the three is responsible but three or four years ago, if my memory serves me right&mdash;the officials would have the figures&mdash;the disease was down to less than 4 per cent; it was almost eradicated.  Two years ago it was back to 16 or 17 per cent and about a year ago the disease had reached the proportions of around 30 or 40 per cent again.  Here was money well spent a few years ago.</P>
    <P>They refused to continue the scheme for one further year despite the advice of the NFA and all farming organisations. I think the National Agricultural Council made a recommendation at that time to that effect.  At any rate the scheme was halted and that was a serious and a grievous mistake and the farmers are paying for it now.</P>
    <P>It is unfair that this year the farmers are being charged the full cost of the scheme.  Resolutions were passed by the different Committees of Agriculture about this and the Department were asked to bear their fair share.  They refused to do so.  That is wrong and the Minister should reconsider his decision.  We are told on various occasions that we lose from £5 million to £10 million worth of cattle each year through disease.  I do not know the <Col N="1754" /> exact figure.  We provide a free doctor service for certain sections of the people.  In many cases a beast dies because the farmer, and especially the small farmer, has not got the £2 or £3 to pay to the veterinary surgeon.  He waits and waits to see will the beast improve and he does not call in the vet until is it too late.  I wonder could the Department or the Minister devise a scheme whereby farmers under a certain valuation could get a free veterinary service.  This would pay the nation in the long run.</P>
    <P>With regard to the eradication of the warble fly, it was said a few years ago that this would improve the quality of the hides and the leather.  Unfortunately, while the hides were improved and the people who were buying them&mdash;I do not know whether they have a monopoly&mdash;got hides which were much more valuable, the increase in price was not passed on to the farmers and they are wondering why, and who has got the benefit of it.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of lime and fertilisers, there is an increase of £189,500. We on this side of the House welcome that.  I am glad to see that Fianna Fáil are converted to and are preaching the policy that we preached for many years.  I am glad that Fianna Fáil Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries and Deputies now admit that our national prosperity depends, to a large extent, on our exports of livestock. They have emerged as enthusiastic advocates of the improvement of our grassland to secure an increase in our exports.  We heartily congratulate them on that conversion to the Fine Gael policy which we preached in the past. It might be no harm to suggest that an apology is due&mdash;we will hardly get it &mdash;to those who were maligned on this side of the House for so long for preaching such a policy, a policy they have now adopted.</P>
    <P>I remember the Fianna Fáil campaign and I remember the vilification of Mr. Dillon.  I think it is fresh in the public memory.  We cannot forget the description of &ldquo;Minister for Grass&rdquo; which was applied to Mr. Paddy Hogan and to Mr. Dillon, and the abuse and scorn poured on those people because they recognised the <Col N="1755" /> potential we had in grass, in beef, sheep, pigs and output from the land of Ireland.  It has taken Fianna Fáil a long time to waken up to the fundamental fact of our economic life and, in the meantime, perhaps, the country has paid dearly for their ignorance and misjudgment.  It is better late than never, but it is a pity that they did not think differently in the past.</P>
    <P>The economy of the country suffered from their ignorance.  They did not believe in improving the grassland of Ireland.  They did not believe in the bullock, the heifer, the sheep, the pig, and they did not believe that we should produce anything to be exported to Britain.  They have now been converted &mdash;and the Free Trade Area Agreement proves it&mdash;and they realise that this is our most important market.  Perhaps our negotiators went too far in that Agreement and in their new found enthusiasm gave away more than they should.  That can be discussed on some other Estimate.  I may not be allowed to discuss it today.</P>
    <P>Beef and cattle incentives under Subhead D.4 have been increased.  This is money well spent.  I should like to appeal to the Minister about this.  The first two cows do not count.  That is unfortunate.  If a man has 400 heifers he gets a grant for 398 but a small farmer with four gets a grant for two only.  If he has six he gets a grant for four.  I will admit that the idea may be that people who are not getting their living solely from farming should not get the grant.  Under the Land Reclamation Scheme and, I think, the farm building scheme a farmer must be earning his living mainly from farming before he will get the grant.  Why not change this scheme to provide that a farmer earning his living mainly, or exclusively, if you like, from farming with four cows will be entitled to this grant.  At the moment it is unfair to the small farmer and I would ask the Minister to reconsider his decision in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to see that in 1960 our cattle output was worth £55 million. It increased to £58.7 million in 1962, to £70 million in 1964 but there was a drop in 1965 to £64.1 million. <Col N="1756" /> In 1966, it went up to £69.1 million, in 1967, to £88.7 million, in 1968, to £98 million and, in 1969, according to the figures I got from the Taoiseach yesterday, it reached a record sum of £104 million.</P>
    <P>Gross agricultural output has also increased from £193 million in 1960 to £318 million in 1969, according to figures supplied to me yesterday.  It cannot be denied that the farmers and all concerned are pulling their weight and they are to be congratulated on that improvement.  No doubt the community will benefit from the vast increase in our exports of cattle.</P>
    <P>I am surprised to see that there is a reduction of £198,000 under the heading Land Project.  In 1969-70, £3,854,000 was spent under the Land Project Scheme.  For 1970-71, the figure is £3,656,000, a reduction of £198,000. Why?  This was money well spent.  I quoted the figure earlier on.  I think 1,200,000 acres of land were reclaimed since this scheme was first introduced in 1949, I think, in my home town of Mullingar.  Mr. Dillon, the Minister at that time, made the announcement.</P>
    <P>The scheme was attacked and maligned for many years afterwards, but it was a good scheme.  The 1,200,000 acres put into production is helping the farmers, their families and the whole nation.  I am surprised that it has been reduced this year, because I know that in my county there is a long waiting list.  Up to last year there was an almost two year waiting period. That has been reduced, but it is still at least five or six months.  I am surprised to see a reduction under this subhead.  I would ask the Minister to have it examined, because he must agree that we have much wet land, land which is not properly drained and where there are huge hedges, boulders and rocks.  Under this scheme that land can be cleared and made fertile.  It can be ploughed, harrowed and sown and produce crops and help to produce cattle, sheep and pigs.</P>
    <P>Under the beef cattle incentive scheme, there is an increase.  This is money well spent and we can congratulate the Department on that.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of Mountain Sheep, in 1965 we had 5,013,700 sheep <Col N="1757" /> in this country.  The number now is down to 3,975,400, a reduction of over 1,000,000 sheep.  It is wrong to see a reduction here, because on the mountains, which are mainly owned by small farmers, there should be an increase in the number of sheep.  There should be further incentives given to those people to produce those mountainy sheep, because many farmers in the midlands and other places buy them and put them out to the Suffolk rams and they produce a very nice tidy lamb, a lamb that is much sought after for the French market whenever it is open and for our factories.</P>
    <P>Farmers who put out these ewes with a Border Leicester ram or a Scotch ram or any of the white-faced rams and produce a cross-bred ewe, a hardy type of ewe which, when crossed with a Suffolk ram or any of the black-faced rams, produces excellent meat, the type of meat the English, French and German housewives want.  From the information we have, it seems they do not look for the over fat one, they look for the nice, tidy, lean one produced very often from the mountain ewe.</P>
    <P>The producers of wool are getting a very raw deal.  In 1957 they were getting 21.9 new pence per lb. for their wool.  I addressed a question to the Taoiseach yesterday, 17th February, 1971.  I asked the Taoiseach the price of wool for each year since 1956 and the production of wool each year since 1956.  In 1957 it was 21.9 pence.  In 1964 it was 21.1 pence.  In 1970 it was 11.4 pence, little more than half, and when one takes into consideration that the value of the pound has dropped by more than half, the farmer now is only getting a quarter of the price he was getting in 1957.  What exactly the Department can do about that it is hard to know.  There are different types of synthetics.  We have not got, perhaps, the demand for wool, but any housewife knows that anything she has to buy which is produced from Irish wool will cost three, four or five times what she paid for it in 1957.  Why is it that while the consumer is paying through the nose for those products, nobody can see to it that the farmer gets a fair and just price?  If 21.9 pence was looked upon as reasonable in 1957 and, indeed, in <Col N="1758" /> 1956 it was 18.9 pence, surely nobody can say that the farmer is getting justice at the moment?  In 1967 it was worse. It was 10.4 pence.</P>
    <P>Those are questions which are troubling the farmers of Ireland.  Many of the sheep are produced in the West of Ireland.  Different Ministers seem to be very concerned at times about the West and the Taoiseach in Castlebar not too long ago promised wonderful things for the West.  Here is an area where something could be done for the struggling sheep farmer, in the West.</P>
    <P>In regard to dairy produce, including Grants-in-Aid, there has been a reduction this year.  In my county, they tell me they are getting 3d. a gallon less for milk than they were getting two or three years ago.  I have been shown documentary proof of this. Yet we are told milk prices have been increased.  I cannot understand it, but my own neighbours have shown me their figures.  The Department of Agriculture is slipping up in that they have no grand plan or design.  They have no proper programme.  Every farmer was told to get into dairying.  They did so and then two years ago there was a surplus and they were encouraged to get out of it.  Recently we had a demand for butter from Britain and we had not got the butter to export to them.  The ICMSA have been at war with the Minister over the past few months. Those people have a good case.</P>
    <P>Dairying is of importance to the whole farming community, and of national importance, because those people produce calves that are fed in the midlands and in the rest of the country, and they produce the milk for butter and cheese.  From what we are told, unless the Government come immediately to the aid of the dairying industry, there will be a crisis there. People will go out of milk production. It is very hard to get a farmer, his wife, his son or daughter, to milk cows every day of the week, morning and night, or to get the workers to do it, and they cannot be blamed.  If other people have a five day, 40-hour week, there is no reason why these people should not feel that they are entitled to it too, and should not be expected to stay at home and slave.  The Minister <Col N="1759" /> should immediately get in touch with Mr. O'Keeffe, President of the ICMSA, with Mr. Maher, President of the NFA, bring them before him and tell them that this Government are interested in the future of agriculture in this country, and in preparing the farmers of Ireland to be in a position to accept the challenge of the decade which lies ahead and to be prepared for entry into the EEC.  It is time for the Minister as a farmer, who has worked on the land, to call the people together.  If other Ministers will not allow the Minister enough money it is time for him, to stand up and say: &ldquo;I want to represent those people.  I want to see our primary producers and those who have kept the nation going and have worked hard for years getting more.&rdquo;  It is time for the Minister to say that he is not prepared to see this difference of £8 10s per week between the income of urban workers and that of farmers.  It is time for the Minister to go into the Cabinet and assert himself and tell the other Ministers that we must sit down and iron out the problems before the war between the Minister and the farmers escalates further.  The fewer people we see on the streets protesting the better for the country.  The fewer strikes there are the better for us all.  The time has come for the Minister to say to the Taoiseach: &ldquo;Do not stand idly by any longer.  It is our duty to come to the rescue of the farmers.&rdquo;  It is time the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries invited these people into his office and to examine the problems.</P>
    <P>There is a glorious future ahead for the farmers of this country and for our people if the problems which exist today are settled, and if all unite.  The standard of living of all sections can be improved.  If this wrangling is continued, the country will disintegrate and much of the blame will be laid on the Minister's shoulders and on the Government. Now is the time when the farmers should buy new tractors.  They should be using fertilisers and lime on their land.  I am a member of the NFA and I do not want to be called a scab. We should have freedom in this country to join an organisation, or not, but those who join organisations should <Col N="1760" /> obey the rules and regulations.  The vast majority of the farmers are obeying the rules.  There is only a month or two left for ploughing, harrowing and sowing.  If the farmers are not called together our nation will suffer.  I hope that the Minister faces up to this problem immediately.</P>
    <P>I refer now to the amounts spent by the committees of agriculture.  I hope the Minister does not interfere with these committees which have done valuable work.  They are the connecting link between the Department and the farmers.  They are the unpaid servants who come together often.  If the Minister wishes to make any change, it might be a good thing to banish politics from these committees of agriculture. Everyone interested should do that. The intention, when the Bill was introduced, was that the farmers' organisations should nominate different people to the committees of agriculture.  The local farmer bodies, and the peoples' representatives should co-operate, and co-ordinate their work and efforts in the interests of the community as a whole.  The committees of agriculture have done valuable work.  It would be a bad day for the country if they were under the control of the Department in Dublin.  People in the country resent any interference from the city.  It is different when members of the committee are neighbours of their own. The members of committees of agriculture have encouraged the farmers to avail of scientific and technical knowledge and the educational facilities available from and through the agricultural instructors.  The local representatives of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour have done wonderful work in helping to organise classes.  Their members have approached the parish priest to have announcements read out about lectures and classes in the local halls. It would be a retrograde step to break that link.</P>
    <P>The committees of agriculture should not be subject to too much authority from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The policy should be to hasten slowly in that direction.  In 1968 the amount spent was £1,363,199; in 1970 the figure was £1,825,923.  In 1968 the amount paid <Col N="1761" /> by the State was £795,182, while in 1970 the sum paid was £999,465. Despite the fact that expenditure increased by over £500,000 the State's portion increased only by £200,000.  It is unfair that more of this money should not be coming from the State.</P>
    <P>I asked a question about the number of agricultural instructors.  I thought there had been a greater increase in the number of such instructors employed in the last few years. The number employed in 1968 was 330.  In 1969 the number employed was 338.  In 1970 there were 384 agricultural instructors.  The Minister and the Department should try to increase the number of such instructors because they are doing an excellent job.  They are needed.  The vast majority of the farmers are prepared to co-operate with these men.  These men help the farmers of the country to become interested in educating themselves to adopt the most up-to-date methods and techniques and to become more efficient. Money spent on this is giving employment to our own young men at home in Ireland.  Many of them are farmers' sons.  We never object to increasing money for agriculture, if it is properly spent.  In the past, if a family were well-off and if they had three or four sons with, perhaps, two of them with good brains, they would educate the intelligent ones and make solicitors, doctors or civil servants of them but the dud would be left on the land.</P>
    <P>That is what happened on a farm in the past.  But that day has gone and if a farmer is to hold his own he must be progressive, he must have the technical knowledge and he must be as up to date as any manager in any industry. Therefore, it is a pity to learn that we have not many more agricultural instructors and that the increase has been so small over the past few years.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also concentrate on another matter.  In the majority of committees, and as a member of a county committee of agriculture I am perhaps myself to blame as much as others, we see far too many temporary instructors and not enough permanent men.  We should appeal to committees to keep temporary men for only two <Col N="1762" /> or three years before making them permanent. When you have a man employed for two or three years in an area he gets to know that area but then he applies for a permanent position and we find then that a man from Westmeath may be shifted to Leitrim, Sligo, or somewhere else.  Could they not hold more interviews at the same time?  Let the committees put up as many appointments as possible.  Where you have a good man who knows the farmers in an area, knows the type of land, the type of agriculture the farmers are engaged in&mdash;and it will take him two or three years to get to know all that, to know that a farmer should have on his land, if it is hilly land, low land, sandy land, gravelly land, loamy land or heavy land&mdash;and he goes for an interview you may find he is sent from Westmeath to Leitrim or Galway.  But there is as much difference between the land in these places as there is between chalk and cheese. Perhaps the Department could divide the country into regions and if an agricultural instructor had been in a dairying area for two or three years then if he had to go somewhere else send him to another dairying area; if he had been in a tillage area like Louth and if he had to be changed, then send him to Carlow or some other tillage county.</P>
    <P>The changes that are being made at present are detrimental to all concerned. A man who may have been engaged in dairying is sent to parts of Westmeath where there is nothing but bullocks and sheep.  He is thrown back a couple of years and he has to start all over again.  The knowledge he has learned in the previous years is of no use to him.  I would ask the Department to see if anything could be done in that regard.</P>
    <P>The figure for horticultural employees in 1968 was 78 and it has only increased by four.  There is a first class market on our doorstep for horticultural exports, for such things as soft fruits and mushrooms.  I wonder why a greater effort has not been made to increase our exports in such fruits as raspberries, strawberries and apples as well as mushrooms and various types of vegetables.  Enough has not been <Col N="1763" /> done in this direction.  In regard to poultry and home farm management I was surprised to see that in 1968 we had 94 people in the service and in 1970 there was a reduction to 89.  Those of us with experience of agriculture have to admit that the vast majority of these people do very excellent work. I admit that in regard to poultry they have not got the same amount of work to do now as they had, because many small farmers are going out of poultry and large combines have entered into the business.  The farm home management section have been doing an excellent job and they have done much for the housewife to lighten drudgery in the kitchen, by helping them instal labour saving devices.  Few city people realise that only a small percentage of the farms have those amenities.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about marketing.  The marketing system here has been antediluvian as regards agricultural produce.  I will agree that in recent years the problem has been tackled with varying effectiveness. As far as Bord Bainne are concerned they made a most impressive effort and it has been made possible to sell steadily increasing quantities of dairy products at prices which are comparable to those received by our competitors.  Since their establishment they have vastly improved the marketing of our dairy produce but in regard to other products the Department are too conservative and lacking in initiative. They are to a certain extent to blame for not doing as much as they should have done in various other quarters.</P>
    <P>In our embassies abroad we are too inclined to ape big nations like America, Britain and Canada.  We have our diplomats who attend functions with their top hats, starched shirts and long coats.  They have a few drinks with the boys and meet the people.  But that is not good enough.  What we want in those embassies are aggressive young agricultural salesmen to go to those functions and to preach that we have the best beef, mutton, bacon, eggs, cheese, tomatoes, small fruits, vegetables and various other things&mdash; that we have as good as can be got <Col N="1764" /> in any other nation.  Regularly at chambers of commerce meetings we hear people saying that various Government sections could not get a market for them abroad but that they themselves were able to go out and get the markets.  It was never as important as it is now to get markets because since the Free Trade Agreement, while we have increased our agricultural exports to Britain, we are now buying £30 million to £40 million more from Britain than she is buying from us.  The only worthwhile way in which we can improve and increase our exports and increase them immediately, is from the land.</P>
    <P>If you export £50 million worth extra of beef, mutton, cheese or other agricultural produce over the next year or so there would be a net profit of £45 million or £46 million.  We have the land and we have the people working on it; we might have to buy a couple of million pounds worth extra of artificial manures to increase the output by another £50 million.  Therefore it is of the utmost importance to have those marketing people, aggressive young salesmen, trained in all the arts of salesmanship.  Remember that they can be so trained because many of us know what a good salesman can do if he comes to you when you are going somewhere in a hurry; if he has a good flow of language then before you know it you are signing your name and after that you find yourself paying a bill of £30, £40 or £50.  It shows what good salesmanship can do and we should have those aggressive young salesmen in our embassies.</P>
    <P>When the markets are obtained it is possible to come back to the farmers, confident in the knowledge that they will not let the country down.  The farmers have always been in the front line in time of emergency and have never failed to respond to the call of duty.  During the last war they had to provide the food for our people. The only unfortunate part was that our Government then stood idly by and allowed our produce to be shipped over to feed Britain.  Our cattle were sold at 40s-45s a cwt.  and sheep were sold at £3 or £4.</P>
    <P>We were told in the past by the <Col N="1765" /> patriots in the Fianna Fáil Party that England's difficulty was Ireland's opportunity. England was in difficulty during the last war and Ireland had her opportunity.  Yet, we fed John Bull and the British Army with cheap food. The Department of Agriculture should have been on their toes and should have demanded from the British Government a fair price for our produce. We remember that the people in Britain were rationed to two ozs. of meat per week; we had the land and the potential but we did not get the direction and there was no lead from the Government at that time to increase our agricultural produce.  It was in 1948 when a trade agreement was concluded&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>We are still supplying Britain with cheap food and nobody can deny that.  It is a well-known fact&mdash;which Britain admits&mdash;that if we enter the EEC our food prices will be increased by 50 per cent.  Fine Gael's policy today is what it always has been&mdash;the maximum number of farmers living on the land and earning as good a living as the other sectors of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A clear statement of long-term policy in regard to agriculture is needed urgently.  Failure by successive Fianna Fáil Governments to formulate a long-term plan has, more than any other factor, been responsible for our failure to deal adequately with the nation's ills.  The Fianna Fáil Government have no agricultural policy, except day-to-day <Col N="1766" /> political expedience.  Their constant thought and pre-occupation is how to get votes; they do not think of the farming community or the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>The decade ahead could well be a decade of challenge and the next few years could be very significant for the Irish farmer.  Political decisions taken this year may settle our fate and the character of the nation, and this applies especially to farmers.  We know that the decision of Belgium, France, Holland, West Germany, Italy and Luxembourg&mdash;with a total population of 180 million&mdash;to come together was an event of great significance affecting not only future economic and political development in their own countries but also their trade and relations with other countries.  If we gain admission to the EEC the farmers will have access to a market of 250 million people.  I was rather annoyed to see that there was less money for research in the Estimates for 1970.  When we enter the EEC we cannot afford slackness or lack of enterprise, there can be no easy-going ways or shilly-shallying methods adopted.  Unfilled orders, irregular supplies and haphazard deliveries, which were a feature of the past, will not be good enough.</P>
    <P>What is happening in regard to our butter market in Britain illustrates my point.  After building up a market, where the British people want more butter, our dairies cannot supply them. Therefore, it is essential that we have this planning in the future.  Irish farmers must remember that sentiment will not play a part in future transactions, any more than outdated measures.  It is up to our farmers to adopt the most up-to-date and progressive methods and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has a duty to encourage them in this regard.  The vast majority of our farmers have come to the conclusion that it is to our advantage to enter the EEC&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Deputy wishes to discuss it in the wider implications, the Chair suggests that it would be better to wait for the EEC debate in relation to agriculture.</P>

The Second Programme for Economic Expansion&mdash; and even the Third Programme because there is money here to put that programme into operation&mdash;envisaged that 70,000 will have left the land between 1969 and 1972, and the people are leaving the land.  It might be no harm to point out that one million have left the land.  The cream of our youth have had to emigrate.  However, as you will not allow me to discuss the Mansholt Plan or any of these things I had better move on to other matters.</P>

      <P>I agree, but many farmers and the farmers' organisations are very perturbed at the recent decision of the British Government to expand their own agricultural production. This is an alarming threat to the future of our country.  If this were implemented in full it could have a disastrous long-term effect on our agricultural exports.  We export nearly 638,000 stores to Britain and, as has often been pointed out in the past, the prosperity of our people depends on these exports, on what our farmers and labourers can get from the land of Ireland and export profitably abroad.</P>
      <P>Britain has her own problem for a number of years and the idea is to protect her own financial resources. Nobody can blame Britain for that. The proposals that are being considered by the present Conservative Government are designed specifically to reduce her trade imbalance and reduce the need for importing food.  This policy has already been implemented in regard to eggs and poultry.  Britain is producing her own eggs and poultry and does not need any from us.  Mr. Callaghan, the former Home Secretary, was here recently and made a very alarming statement.  I suppose I will be allowed to mention the term &ldquo;EEC&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The statement was only a passing reference.  He said; &ldquo;Your real problems will come if Britain does not get into the EEC, because in Britain today the housewife is getting cheap food from all over the world.  The British Government are not going to continue to subsidise this food.  They will allow food prices to rise and perhaps they will have to impose import duties on your cattle and sheep.&rdquo;  This is what the Conservative Government said before the general election.  They are now nearly a year elected and the danger we are facing is that Britain instead of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy inform the Chair how the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries could be responsible for this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, Sir.  The farmers of Ireland live on the difference between their costs of production&mdash; which include their taxes, rates and overhead expenses, in which the Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries have a big hand&mdash;and what they are able to get for their produce when they export it. If these costs keep increasing and the cost of what they have to sell abroad increases then their margin of profit increases, and they can survive and survive easily.  However, if their costs increase, as the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is allowing them to increase, their rates and taxes, their costs for meal, feedingstuffs for pigs, poultry and cattle, their costs for lime and fertilisers, and if the British Government impose tariffs and reduce the price of what the farmer sells, then their margin of profit diminishes and they can no longer survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important, therefore, that our Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and our Minister should be alert and should investigate the alternatives, find out if it is the intention of the British Government to pursue this policy.  Remember that last year before the British general election the Conservative Party said they were not satisfied with the free trade agreement with this country in so far as it concerned agriculture, that one of the first <Col N="1771" /> things they would do when they were elected was to review that agreement.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what action has been taken by the Department? Has the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries been in touch with the British Government?  Will they be allowed to spring this on us?  Britain has the idea she can import food from the ends of the earth.  It is no longer necessary to have a large acreage of land to produce meat.  A man can build on an acre a huge shed to hold 1,000 cattle.  He can buy the grassmeal, oil cake or whatever else he needs to feed the cattle.  Many farmers in Britain are doing that.</P>
    <P>What is our Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries doing to meet this situation? Does the Minister think that will happen?  If it does happen, has he any plans?  The Minister has a big say in the farmers' costs.  If their costs are reduced, if the taxes on oil and petrol and everything else are not passed on to them, then they could take a lower price for their produce. But, with ever-increasing costs they cannot take a lower price.  It is of immense importance that the Government should do something about this. They should remember that in Britain, agriculture is subsidised by a very prosperous manufacturing industry. Well over 90 per cent of the wealth of Britain comes from industry.  Here the proportion is very different.  I think the figure is that 7 per cent of the British people are farmers.  Perhaps it is less.</P>
    <P>Ireland has no such wealth of industry capable of bearing the taxation to subsidise our agriculture.  Indeed, it is clear that the predominantly agricultural countries are bound to lose out in the farm subsidy game.  This should be pointed out to the Paul Singer who appeared on the Late Late Show&mdash;he had a little smig and he reminded me of Paul Singer&mdash;and talked about the hundred million pounds the farmers were getting, what the hell was happening to it and where was it going.  Remember that in subsidising agriculture we are feeding the dog on his own tail because the <Col N="1772" /> majority of the wealth comes from the land.  A large proportion of taxation is the farmers' own money.  I dealt with that matter earlier.  I should like the Minister to tell us are the farmers getting into their pockets even £40 million of this money which they are supposed to be getting.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the money that is being devoted towards encouraging the production of beef.  I hope the Minister will try to ensure that under the scheme account is taken of the first two cows in the case of the small farmer who is earning his living solely from the land.  It is very unfair at the moment.  A man with 500 cows can get a grant for 498.</P>
    <P>There is a great opportunity for expansion in the sheep industry.  The Department are to be congratulated on the schemes already in existence but some new scheme should be devised to encourage sheep production.  At the moment there is an alarming drop of over one million sheep.  There is a subsidy scheme at the moment of 30s. a head.  I think it is 10s.  for lambs in the west.  It may be £1.  That scheme was introduced four or five years ago and it should be increased now.  It is not doing the work it was intended to do, because the sheep population is still decreasing.  The Minister and his officials should put their heads together and draw up some scheme that would increase the sheep population.</P>
    <P>For many years the small farmers depended on pig production.  I often said they depended on it to pay the rates and to meet their overheads.  As far as the small farmer is concerned, unfortunately, poultry production is a dying art.  There does not seem to be any future for him in poultry production. The big combines have taken over. Due to the increase in the price of meals over the past few years it is very doubtful if there is a future for the pig producer.  The margin is so small that you would need to keep 500, 600 or 1,000 pigs for it to be worth your while.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ask himself what will be left for the small farmer to engage in: what can he turn his hand to?  For a long number of years <Col N="1773" /> the emphasis was on tillage.  The acreage under tillage has been drastically reduced.  From 1954 up to a few years ago it was reduced by half.  For wheat, the tillage farmer is getting only 12s. to 14s. per barrel more than he got in 1954, 17 long years ago.  The value of the £ is only half what it was then but he has not been compensated for that.  A man said to me recently that at one time the price of a barrel of oats was 36s. and an agricultural labourer's wage was 12s.  One barrel of oats would pay the wage of an agricultural labourer for three weeks. Now it would take seven barrels of oats to pay an agricultural worker's wage for one week.  Deputy Timmins told the House the number of barrels of wheat it would take to buy a tractor some years ago and the number it would take today.  It would take twice the number today.</P>
    <P>So far as the farmers are concerned, things are moving in the wrong direction. The Minister was in the NFA and he knows the worries and problems of the farmers.  When he was appointed I did not think he would stand idly by.  I should like him to be given a reasonable chance, so we will wait until after the next Budget to see what he does.  Lord Melbourne said about a Prime Minister who was not inclined to do anything that when he had problems <Col N="1774" /> his idea was to ponder, pause, prepare, postpone and end by leaving things alone and, in fact, earn the people's pay by doing nothing every day.  That is how the Fianna Fail Government have fooled the NFA.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable to see all this strife. God knows it is bad enough to see it in the north.  Let us set an example to our brothers in the north and let us try here to build a firm foundation of co-operation and co-ordination.  You cannot build a firm foundation on hatred, prejudice and strife, and you cannot build a firm foundation if the principal producers are out walking the streets, or blocking bridges, or not purchasing fertilisers, manures or anything else.  You cannot build a firm foundation on strife, animosity, hatred or violence.  The danger of all this violence erupting and escalating is too great for us to take any chances.  Therefore, it behoves the Minister and the Government and all of us concerned, no matter on what side of the House we may be, to do our part to bring all together.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the ESB that work under the rural electrification post development scheme is in progress at present in the Liscarton and Dunderry rural areas in County Meath.  It is hoped to have work completed in these two areas before the end of March.</P>

The board hope to carry out work in the order given but, because the level of demand in each area will not be known until construction work is about to begin, it is not possible at this stage to say when any particular area will be reached.  However, it is expected that work will be completed in all these areas by the end of March, 1972.</P>
