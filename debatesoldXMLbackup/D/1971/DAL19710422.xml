    <Title>Unemployment Assistance (Employment Period) (No. 2) Order, 1971: Motion to Annul.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I move motion No. 3:</P>
      <P>That Regulations I, II and III set out at paragraph 3 of the Unemployment Assistance (Employment Period) (No. 2) Order, 1971 (S.I. No. 142 of 1971) be and are hereby annulled.</P>
      <P>The shock announcement, or should one say the disclosure, that the Employment Period Order was made was typical of Government blundering.  As yet, we have not had any good reason from the Minister for Social Welfare, from his Department or from the Government Information Bureau why the order was made on 1st April.  The House will recall that another Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, scrapped entirely the Employment Period Order for 1967 in his Budget proposals.  It is significant that the present Minister for Social Welfare was dealing with social welfare at that time.  I do not know whether there was pressure by the present Minister for Finance on the Minister for Social Welfare to agree to the reintroduction of this Employment Period Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the injustice of this order was recognised by practically every section of the community, except I suppose that small clique who believe that people should not be paid unemployment assistance in the circumstances. There was an immediate reaction by the trade union movement particularly and the press, representing I assume <Col N="361" /> the viewpoint of all sections of the community.  There was this outcry but during a period of 24 or 36 hours no reason was given by the Government Information Bureau to the press and the other news media and there was no information from the Minister or his Department.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat cynical that the order was made on April fools' day because it appears to me to be an attempt to make fools of unfortunate people who now have no means whatever. It is typical of the blundering of the Department that the news was made known not by any public pronouncement; as far as we are aware it was made known as a result of a leak in Limerick city.  This was discovered by Deputy Coughlan who immediately got in touch with the Department of Social Welfare and complained about the matter.  During all this time for some reason or another the Minister made no statement whatsoever.  The first statement we had, so far as I know was in an interview during or after the news on radio on 9th of this month. In that interview the Minister said that the part of the order that applied to urban areas was being withdrawn and that the part of the order which related to rural areas was being retained.</P>
    <P>There are quite a few questions for the Minister to answer on this matter. I cannot find, as yet, a real definition of an urban area.  So far as I know, for the purposes of the Social Welfare and Social Assistance Acts, an urban area is an area with a population of 7,000 or more.  I do not know if this is correct but this would mean that towns like Gorey and Enniscorthy, to mention two in my own constituency&mdash;other Deputies can mention other areas with a population of less than 7,000&mdash;if they are to come under the amended employment period order, will suffer hardship.  In his contribution to this debate the Minister must give us clarification on that part of the order and define what is meant by an urban area.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a lot of explaining and clearing up to do because he said that the order was wrongly drafted. Who drafted the order wrongly?  Is this intended as a slight on some member of the Civil Service in the Department <Col N="362" /> of Social Welfare?  I believe this was an absolute try on and, if there had not been this outcry in the Press and from the community as a whole, the Minister and the Government would have gone ahead with it.  If that is not so, it appears that the Minister did not read the order.  If he did not read the order before he signed it, I do not believe he is worthy to hold the office of Minister for Social Welfare.  I do not believe it is good enough to blame an officer of his Department, by inference or innuendo, for not having put a proper draft before him. Usually Ministers in this House defend rather than condemn officers of their own Departments, but the Minister is now casting some suspicion&mdash;or to use a well-known phrase there is now a shadow of suspicion&mdash;on some civil servant or civil servants in the Department of Social Welfare.  This is scandalous behaviour.  It looks like a rebuke to some un-named civil servant.</P>
    <P>Ex-Deputy Kevin Boland, ex-Minister for Local Government, ex-Minister for Social Welfare and ex- a few other things, knows the mind of his former colleagues in the Government and he described the first attempt to introduce the Employment Period Order as a try on, as I did, and indeed it was. He is fairly experienced and expert in the art of government and the art of politics and he described this as government by kite flying.  He knows his colleagues.  We have many examples of kite flyers in the Fianna Fáil front benches and some of the ex-Ministers, including ex-Deputy Kevin Boland, were expert at government by kite flying.  There is no doubt in my mind, and there is no doubt in the mind of ex-Deputy Boland, that if they could have got away with it they would have done it.</P>
    <P>We suspect two motives in relation to the first Employment Period Order, first, that there is pressure by the Minister for Finance on the Minister for Social Welfare to save £1.35 million as was said yesterday&mdash;we do not know whether these figures are right or wrong&mdash;or secondly to give a false picture of the unemployment figure in this part of the country.  If it was to save £1.35 million, or £1.6 million as <Col N="363" /> the Minister for Finance said, it is a mean type of economising on the poorest section of the community.  The Minister will have to be more explicit in his contribution this morning about the amount of money involved and the number of people involved.  I do not know if he was fully briefed yesterday in his reply to the question asked by a Member of this party but there is room for further clarification.</P>
    <P>We were told yesterday by the Minister that the amended Order, that is the Order relating to those who live in the non-urban areas, will mean a saving to the Exchequer of £1.2 million and that it will affect 13,000 people. These figures must also be reconciled because there appears to be a contradiction between them and the figures given by the Minister in reply to supplementary questions yesterday.  In that reply the Minister said £1.35 million would be saved but in the Book of Estimates it appears that a saving of £1.6 million was anticipated.</P>
    <P>I said that the second possible motive was to give a false picture of the unemployment figures.  At present we have the unenviable record of having the highest unemployment rate in Western Europe.  This is not a good image for the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his negotiations on our application for membership of the EEC. The Minister is proposing to cut off 13,000 people from the unemployment figure in a situation where we had 70,126 people unemployed on 8th April and 25,713 of them on unemployment assistance.  This is the highest figure for this part of the year for very many years.  The motive may have been to impress the EEC countries in our negotiations for membership.  In the third quarter of 1969, unemployment was at the figure of 6.5 per cent and that had risen to 7.8 per cent in the third quarter of 1970.  I cannot be contradicted when I say we have the highest unemployment rate in Western Europe and the idea may have been to try to change that picture.</P>
    <P>The Government are cutting people off from unemployment assistance at a time when we have redundancies all over the country and closures of factories <Col N="364" /> in many parts of the country due again, may I say, to the ineptitude and blundering of the Government and the bad agreement they made six years ago with the British, the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  That disastrous agreement has been responsible for an increase in unemployment, for redundancies and for closures of factories.</P>
    <P>The Minister must tell us this morning what is to happen to these people. They will have no employment and no source of income whatsoever.  The Minister acts in a dual capacity in this House.  He is also Minister for Labour and, as Minister for Labour, has a responsibility to provide work not only for these 13,000 people but for the 70,126 people unemployed at present.  The assumption by the Minister, by the members of the Government and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party appears to be that there is work.  There was a rather cynical and uninformed comment by the Minister for Social Welfare who is also Minister for Labour at an annual dinner of the Fianna Fáil Party at Kilnaleck, County Cavan.  I wish to quote from the <i>Irish Times</i> where he is reported within the last week or ten days as having said at that dinner:</P>
    <P>The problem of the dole was a major one and had to be tackled. While an ideal solution might not be readily forthcoming it should not be impossible to devise a scheme to ensure that the millions of pounds now being paid out in dole would be devoted to productive purposes.</P>
    <P>He talks about millions being paid out to those who are in receipt of the dole. There are not millions being paid out and this is a filthy innuendo to people who would like to believe that there are workers who are getting money for nothing and that millions are being spent on those who have to line up at the employment exchanges in order to seek work and to qualify for a few pounds per year.  We do not treat our unemployed as generously as that paragraph in the Minister's speech would suggest.  I quote further:</P>
    <P>Mr. Brennan said he hoped that by devoting this money&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="365" /> These millions</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;to productive purposes it would be possible to give to the persons receiving this money an opportunity to rid themselves of the stigma attached to the present system.</P>
    <P>The Minister should first have had his scheme for using these millions to give employment rather than cut them off and say that we will have some sort of solution afterwards.  He is reported as saying in the same speech:</P>
    <P>The Government was fully alive to the hardship this order might cause and in consequence had made an extra £500,000 available for local improvement schemes to be spent in the west.</P>
    <P>How much extra employment would that give?  Perhaps the Minister would tell us when he intervenes in this debate.  Of course he ignores entirely the rest of the country.  An unemployed man who does not qualify for assistance in Cork is just as hungry as an unemployed man who has no assistance in Galway, Donegal, Louth, Meath, Limerick or any other county. Therefore if the Minister is thinking of introducing some alternative scheme or if he is thinking of providing employment for people, he should think not of one part of the country but of the whole of the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
    <P>I recall that in the Dáil recently, in reply to a question, the Minister told Deputy Tully that workers were being brought back from Britain for retraining and implied&mdash;maybe said directly in the same reply&mdash;that workers who are signing on at our employment exchanges are unemployable.  The Minister has a duty to the House and to the country to explain what he meant when he replied to Deputy Tully in those terms.</P>
    <P>What is to happen to these people? Where do they get money on which to live?  Who will give them money for food, clothes and rent?  Where will the single man in a cottage on his own get money for his smoke, for a bottle of stout?  Or are there some people in the front benches or the back benches of the Government party who believe they are not entitled to food or to money <Col N="366" /> for rent, that they are not entitled to a smoke or to a bottle of stout?  I am sure most members of the Fianna Fáil Party, as have other parties, as have my own party, have had dozens of these people coming to them, as I have had over the last week, asking what will happen to them, where will they get money.  Are they being starved out of this country so that they will emigrate to Britain?</P>
    <P>What about the single man who lives on his own and whose parents have died?  What is he to do?  He has no dependants.  He will not get unemployment assistance and he certainly will not get home assistance. What about the single man such as approached me over the week-end?  He lives with his widowed sister who gets £4 10s per week.  Are the two of them expected to live on £4 10s per week or has the Minister a job to offer them down in County Wexford?  What about the single man who is living with his widowed mother?  Would she be regarded as a dependant or must the two of them live on the widow's pension which the mother receives?</P>
    <P>It is no reply to say the local authority has a responsibility for those people who have no income and who are not entitled to any payments from the Department of Social Welfare by way of welfare benefits or assistance.  In many counties the aim&mdash;and it would appear to be succeeding&mdash;seems to be to reduce home assistance.  Many local authorities have struck their rate. There is no provision for extra home assistance and there is no indication that a special rate will be struck so that these thousands of people who now have no money will be provided for.  Will this employment period order continue next year?  If it does the public assistance authorities will have to increase the rate in order to provide for people who have no means. I can say this as far as members of the Labour Party who are on local authorities are concerned in any case; I do not know what the attitude of other parties in the Dáil will be.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether on next Tuesday the Minister for Finance will, as I suggested in a recent speech, introduce particularly for these people a <Col N="367" /> form of national assistance such as is operated in Britain at the present time. If that is not done it will mean starvation or emigration for those people who have been cut off from unemployment assistance.  Would the Minister or someone else in the Fianna Fáil Party give us an indication as to where these people will get employment from 14th April, 1971, to 16th November, 1971? The Minister may say: &ldquo;The employment period order was there when you were Minister for Social Welfare.&rdquo; There may have been some justification for it at that time.  There may have been some justification for it years ago but the justification for it went when the ex-Minister for Finance scrapped the order in his Budget speech of 1967. Some years ago, as Deputy Tully reminded me, when there was the spring planting, when there was the summer haymaking and the autumn harvesting, there was employment for some people in rural Ireland.  There was a prospect then of getting some insurance stamps. There may have been some justification when there were many more employed at road work by the various county councils than there are today; when there was more forestry work and when there were more employed with Bord na Móna.  We recognise, as it appears the Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Government in 1967 recognised, that the rapid growth of the use of farm machinery, the rapid growth of road making machinery and the rapid use of machinery in turf production have all minimised and reduced greatly the prospects of employment in rural Ireland.  What are these people expected to do?  They are expected to do what a lot of big farmers would wish them to do and that is to stand around at the cross roads and wait until they are beckoned and told that there is available a half-day's work or maybe two or three day's work.  They are expected to be available all day until such time as some of these big farmers hire them for a few hours.  There is no continuous work in rural Ireland for these people from the 16th April to the 16th November.  The Minister must readily admit that there is still an average of <Col N="368" /> 9,000 or 10,000 people leaving Ireland every year as there have been for a number of years past.  These people leave because there is no work for them here.  Yet, we have the Minister suggesting and implying that there may be work for them.  Because so many people have not been able to obtain work, they have had to have recourse to unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we in the trade union movement and in the Labour Party were satisfied when that part of the order which applied to the urban areas was to be scrapped.  I want to tell the Minister that so far as we are concerned we are opposed to this amended order in the same way as we were opposed to the first disastrous order made on the 1st April.  We were outraged when, by way of leak, we heard this news and we are still outraged with the amended order.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the members of Fianna Fáil, and particularly those who live in rural areas, to speak up now and let the Minister for Social Welfare know what are their views.  I appeal to them to ask the Minister what is to happen to these 13,000 people who will not now have any income.  Are they to starve or to emigrate?</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed that the first order was a mistake, I suggest that he should be big enough to say now that the second order was a mistake also. We do not believe that the first order was a mistake; rather, we believe it was a kite-flying effort, a try-on.  It was provided for in the Book of Estimates but the Government yielded to public pressure and indignation in respect of those in the urban areas.  We ask that the same be done in respect of those in rural areas.  In my view and in the view of my colleagues, this order, if allowed stand, will cause misery to thousands of our people who so badly need more help and not more hardship</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion proposed by Deputy Corish.  It is a peculiar exercise after more than fifty years of self-Government that Dáil Éireann is discussing motions Nos. 3, 4 and 5 on the Order Paper.  It would be a more pleasant task to stand up <Col N="369" /> here and propose motion No. 5, if there was justification for it, rather than to propose motion No. 3.  We must examine why it was necessary for the Labour Party to put down motion No. 3.  This task is not a pleasant one for us.  Down through the years our objective has been to have employment for all our people.  That is still our aim and if it had been achieved there would be no need whatever for a motion dealing with unemployment assistance for any of our people.</P>
      <P>With a population of about 2.9 million this objective should not be difficult to achieve.  It would have been achieved if the right people had been in power but, unfortunately, Fianna Fáil have been in office for 33 out of 39 years since 1932.  It is strange indeed that, despite all their talk at cumann meetings and elsewhere, there is still the necessity for unemployment assistance in this country.</P>
      <P>In Western European countries, such as Holland, Belgium, France and Germany, which suffered the devastations of war there is no unemployment assistance simply because there is no need for it.  These countries are fortunate in having capable men to lead them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Year after year I have been agitating for the provision of employment for all our people.  We do not like the idea of any person having to go to an employment exchange for unemployment assistance.  I have stressed here time and again that it should be within the competence of an inter-Departmental committee to devise a system whereby continuous employment would be available for all our people and, particularly for those in the rural areas. There is a crying need for improvement in many spheres&mdash;in land reclamation, road making, house building, water and sewerage schemes, forestry work and so on&mdash;all of which would provide more employment.  It would be a great advantage if, instead of money being paid out by way of unemployment assistance, it was channelled into a fund for prospective employment for the relatively small numbers who require employment.  Out of a population of 2.9 million people, <Col N="370" /> 70,000 is a reasonably sizeable figure. Let us assume that a percentage of those are unemployable.  I do not know the percentage.  I want to be quite factual about this.  I have said that time and again both to the present Minister and to previous Ministers but nothing has happened.</P>
    <P>It is cruel to find that in south west Cork and in many other parts of the country forestry workers who have had excellent continuous service for up to 14 years are told that they are no longer wanted, that there is no money to pay them and they must go to the employment exchange.  As well as that, productive schemes are being held up. There is no need to remind the House at length about the nature of those hold-ups.  The matter is raised here day in and day out at Question Time. Housing and water and sewerage schemes which would give good employment are held up because there is no money and instead workers who could be engaged on that work are forced to go to the employment exchange.</P>
    <P>We know what the employment exchange is; it is not a building in which employment is provided but rather from which money is paid out to keep people on the move.  That is distasteful to almost everybody.  The Minister, Deputy Brennan, has been in charge of this Department for a number of years and why has he done nothing about it? I have no hesitation in saying that he has done a hell of a bad job as Minister not only in this sphere but in every other sphere.  I cannot say much for his Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Geoghegan, either, who should have some knowledge of rural Ireland.  It is all very fine to appoint a Minister for Social Welfare and a Parliamentary Secretary and supply them with cars and drivers and with secretaries galore but what have they to show?  If you had brought in any two men that you would pick up in the street, at the time the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary were appointed, social welfare would be as far ahead as it is today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Geoghegan and the Minister were appointed I congratulated them but in my view they have been found wanting. We have to be factual here.  This is not a mutual admiration society.  I would praise any man who was entitled to it but neither the Minister nor the Parliamentary Secretary is entitled to praise.  Did the Minister ever think of having consultations with local authorities? Did he ever ask them if they had room for additional employees, men who are on the lists in the various exchanges, or where local authorities were laying off men, as is happening, did he inquire if Local Government, the Forestry Division or the Office of Public Works would have employment for them and keep them away from the exchanges?</P>
      <P>I do not think he has done that.  He is just sitting up there forgetting about everything else except social welfare allowances, forgetting about the vital problem, the provision of work for these people.  Neither do I know what the team he has over there beside him are doing about this.  So far as I know they have shown very little imagination in recent years in this Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is no need to go into the bungling nature of the announcement, or who was responsible, or how it came about, and how the mistake was made about urban and rural.  Were they engaged in doing as they are doing all the time, that is, <Col N="372" /> shady work, as Mr. Kevin Boland asked at Rathcoole?  He is a man who was associated with the party for thirteen years or more as a Minister and he gave us some of the inside secrets which I am sure are factual. The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary should be cleared out of the Department and somebody who would have a look at some of the boys should be put in and pack a few of them off too.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it has something to do with the motion.  I am surprised at you, Mr. Chairman.  We know that the Government are going around collecting and borrowing money.  Paul Singer is only trotting after them, or he was when he was operating, in borrowing money.  We are trying to get money at home with interest rates as high as 9¾ per cent; we are trying to get money abroad, and at the same time we have State-sponsored bodies like the ESB trying to borrow money abroad.  Due to the Government's inefficiency money is scarce.  Possibly trimmings are justifiable but of all groups on which to start the trimming operation they take the people in receipt of unemployment assistance to whom work has been denied and who from April to November will be deprived of this miserable pittance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish asked what is to become of them.  Will they be sent to the assistance officer?  In my part of the country, and I am sure in other parts too, there is no employment available.  Public works are closing down and the employment content is <Col N="373" /> being reduced.  Why should the man who is in receipt of not more than £3.30 per week become the Minister's target for saving money?  Imagine the allowance to a man receiving unemployment assistance&mdash;£3.30.  In some cases he is a small farmer with possibly a cow or two and the amount is reduced and in many cases it would be about £2, which would possibly be a fair average.  Why did Fianna Fáil select those people to trim to the tune of almost £1.6 million?  If steps had been taken by the Government to ensure employment for these men it would be something to support the annulment of this Order but no such steps have been taken and, with the exception of the relatively small increase in local improvements schemes grants, no provision of any kind is made.  The money for local improvement schemes will not help unemployment assistance recipients because these schemes are now carried out by the County Councils by the regular staff.  There will be no extra employment under that heading for the recipient of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>We all know that in lean periods for Fianna Fáil, when they wanted to get additional support which would probably make the difference between victory and defeat, they used unemployment assistance to buy votes. That was in the early days when people scarcely knew about this kind of assistance and were not expecting it but were expecting employment, even though it might be only three days a week.  At that time, not too far back, people did not expect money for nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an accepted fact that the Government used this means.  I suppose with the present situation we shall soon hear about it from some ex-member of the Government: the <Col N="374" /> secrets are coming out now.  We must thank Mr. Boland for some of them; I hope he will continue disclosing them and that he will write a book shortly.</P>
      <P>I do not like this type of system. There is an obligation on whatever Government is in power to ensure that employment is available for all who are willing and able to work.  That has been achieved in several West European countries smaller than ours and with greater density of population. I cannot see, with all the money supposed to be around, all the taxation being collected, why Irish Governments, through the years, have been incapable of devising a system to give employment to all able-bodied people.</P>
      <P>As a representative of a constituency where, due to circumstances beyond their control, particularly in the peninsular areas and the islands and even in the towns because all West Cork towns are non-urban so far as this Order is concerned, I ask the Minister to withdraw this Order and agree to the motion put down by Deputy Corish.  I do not know what the single men in, say, Berehaven Peninsula will do.  To a large extent West Cork has been denuded of population by emigration and almost daily we have representations for jobs, even of a casual nature, from people receiving benefits, not only unemployment assistance but unemployment benefit.  I am sure my colleagues can say the same.  West Cork people do not like going to exchanges; they would prefer work and wages at the end of the week.  That work has not been provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have the evidence of the inefficiency of the Department of Social Welfare.  I should like the Minister to give us some inside information because we cannot understand how it is that after the blow-up&mdash;that may not be the best term but it is appropriate for the announcement in question&mdash;the Minister said: &ldquo;We made a mistake so far as urban workers are concerned; we will give it to them.  They must buy food and so on but the rural workers are out.  Forget about them.&rdquo;  What is the idea?  One might conclude that possibly the Government hope that by the annulment of this Order many who, up to the early part of this month, were <Col N="375" /> receiving unemployment assistance, will be forced to emigrate.  Is that a reasonable conclusion?  Is it that the Minister and the Government would like to get rid of a number of Irishmen to make room, possibly, for the influx of Germans and others who will be taking over here, on present indications, in the not too distant future?</P>
    <P>I shall be asked by my constituents what they will get instead of this unemployment assistance.  I will be asked if County Councils, the Forestry Department or any other employment departments will have work for my constituents, but my answer must be &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I will then be asked what they are to do.  Are they to go cap in hand to the local assistance officer?  Imagine that happening in 1971 when sizeable wage increases are the order of the day and some people are getting away with what to my mind, they should not be getting away with?  In most cases the people affected are making genuine attempts to find work, certainly as far as the men and women of West Cork are concerned this is true.  What is going to happen to them?  If they go along to the Cork Health Authority to look for help there is none forthcoming. Has the Government sent out orders to the Health Boards telling them to be difficult about making payments to disabled persons and others who receive payments from these Boards?</P>
    <P>It would be a fine morning's work if the Minister was able to stand up and tell the House that some of his officials have devised a system whereby unemployment assistance would disappear, as it has in most Western European countries.  Such a measure would be welcomed by everybody and especially those in receipt of it at the present time.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of motion I should like to be seconding and that is the kind of motion the people would like to hear about, but Fianna Fáil have not been judging the Irish pulse so well of late.  When they announced this trimming down to a section of our people who find it most difficult to fight back because of lack of organisation, <Col N="376" /> there was uproar from many sections of the community and I was pleased to hear that uproar.  I want to congratulate the national press for standing behind these people.  They condemned the Government Order as did other bodies and in my view they did a good job of work in so doing, because these people needed someone to stand behind them.  The Minister seems to be under the impression that everyone is against the person who is out of work and has to sign for unemployment assistance and simply wants to run him out of the country.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy representing a constituency where unemployment is rampant I would ask the Minister to withdraw the order until such time as adequate steps have been taken to provide employment for these people.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer the House to Motion No. 4 on today's Order Paper in my name, as Fine Gael spokesman for social welfare matters, which reads:</P>
      <P>&mdash;That all the Regulations contained in paragraph 3 of the Unemployment Assistance (Employment Period) (No. 2) Order, 1971 be and are hereby annulled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 20th June next I shall have been a Member of this House for 18 years and I never thought I would see the day when I would have to stand up in this House and tell any Minister for Social Welfare in any Government that he was kicking the most defenceless section of our community, but that is what we are doing on 22nd April, 1971.  People of all races, and particularly the Irish, will never forgive anyone for kicking a man when he is down.  That is exactly what we are doing in Dáil Éireann this morning.  As Deputy Foley knows, if a person kicks a man when he is down on the playing field he is promply and immediately sent to the sideline.  In the political field several governments have been sent into the wilderness for kicking a man when he is down.  Most people are now saying that this Government and this Minister for Social Welfare should be promptly sent into the wilderness. I believe I am expressing the wish of the people when I say to the Government <Col N="377" /> that it is time they handed over to a party who would handle the situation in a reasonable, honest and decent manner.</P>
    <P>We are being asked in this perfectly simple Order to grant absolution to three cardinal, social and political sins, committed with full knowledge and grievous intent.  I want to spell out the three sins committed by Fianna Fáil and by the present Minister for Social Welfare.  The first cardinal Fianna Fáil sin was committed by Deputy Haughey, who has just left the House, and his erstwhile colleagues in June, 1967, when, just before a local election, they extended the dole payments to rural Ireland on an all-the-year-round basis in a vain effort to win the votes of the electorate.  The buying of the votes of the downtrodden, depressed people of rural Ireland with the taxpayers' rather than the party's money was a cheap form of political trickery which has gone on ever since Fianna Fáil introduced the dole many years ago.</P>
    <P>The second cardinal sin committed by Fianna Fáil was committed by the present Minister for Social Welfare and his Cabinet colleagues, and I include them all, because it is obvious to everyone that this decision was a Government one, taken deliberately, clearly and plainly&mdash;and I shall refer later to their blaming the civil service, for whom I have the greatest sympathy&mdash; because they found themselves in the throes of economic trouble, self-inflicted by their mishandling of the nation's affairs.  The miserable pittance that they had granted those people was to be taken off them in order to try and balance a budget.  Is it not a complete condemnation of the Fianna Fáil Party that, having done absolutely nothing to provide employment for these people, they should take from them the money with which they bought their votes by intimidation and bullying?  The Fianna Fáil Party and the Minister for Social Welfare stand condemned for their despicable treatment of that unfortunate section of our people.</P>
    <P>The third card in the Fianna Fáil hand is the sending in here this morning of the Minister for Social Welfare. The Minister is, as everyone knows and accepts, a decent man.  This is the <Col N="378" /> man Fianna Fáil send in here miserably and carefully to retract the earlier decision because of pressure from public opinion.  Here I should like to join with Deputy Murphy in commending all organs of the press for their stand for the downtrodden.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that it should be Deputy Brennan, the Minister for Social Welfare, who is sent in here to try to reduce the pressure of public opinion, to stand over a decision that I personally believe he did not want to make.  Worse than that, he comes in here to defend allegedly a nameless civil servant.  I want to put on record now on behalf of the Fine Gael Party our confirmed belief that the country is blessed with a great Civil Service organisation.  It is unfortunate that it is becoming a growing practice here, and outside, for Ministers of State to make speeches and then put the blame for wrong decisions on our civil servants.  Speaking as an ex-civil servant, I want to say that it is time this kind of thing stopped in Irish politics and Irish government.  If you want to have the confidence of civil servants, in heaven's name do not shelter behind them or blame them for your mistakes.</P>
      <P>Can anyone now accept that this was a civil servant's mistake?  The order was quite clear.  Among other things, the effect of the order was to exclude men who had no dependants from unemployment assistance during the period from 14th April, 1971, to 16th November, 1971.  Can anyone really believe that the Irish people are so gullible that they will believe that this was a civil servant's mistake?  The Minister signed the order knowing full well that it was a Cabinet decision to revoke the dole in both urban and rural areas.  It is time we were honest with ourselves and stopped sheltering under the umbrella of a civil servant's mistake.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister for Social Welfare reads the <i>Irish Independent.</i> Perhaps he does not.  Like a lot of us he may not have the time, but I imagine the first paper he reads is the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>

      <P>If he does not read the <i>Irish Independent</i> perhaps I should not waste time quoting from it, but there is a bannerline which reads: &ldquo;Boland Slams Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  Now, Mr. Kevin Boland, whatever one may say about him, had a reputation here of being straight.  He certainly proved he had principles of a sort, principles which are sadly lacking in this country today and noticeably lacking in Government circles.  He was obviously talking with some experience of this Fianna Fáil Government and he was quite right, of course, in describing it as &ldquo;Government by kite-flying&rdquo;.  I am quoting from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 17th April.  Mr. Boland said:</P>
      <P>Not only had objectives been abandoned, but it was clear that the new technique, developed by the May, 1970, Government, had prevented Fianna Fáil from turning a full circle in regard to social policy....</P>
      <P>The new technique is not to take decisions based on &ldquo;well-known&rdquo; Fianna Fáil policy but to take... decisions, to send up a kite on anything from prices and incomes to contraception and divorce, to haul it down and either scuttle it or trim it to accommodate the adverse winds experienced.</P>
      <P>The explanation that the original Employment Period Order was a mistake is not credible.  It was a clear and blatant try-on.  Knowing the established calibre of the present Government there was, of course, no doubt that there would be a scurried retreat from the position of toughness originally taken up.  The ominous thing, in so far as this party is concerned, is that a Fianna Fáil Government could even have contemplated a retrogression in the field of social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party and the Cumann na nGaedheal Party have over the years had to suffer the taunts and jibes of the Fianna Fáil Party because of a decision by a Minister in years gone by, in different times and a different era, to withdraw some social welfare benefit <Col N="380" /> from a section of our people. Thanks be to God, on 22nd April, 1971, the deathknell was sounded for these taunts and jibes: never again can they be thrown at this side of the House by the people presently sitting over there.</P>

      <P>The taking of this miserable pittance from these unfortunate people, a few pounds a week, was an attempt by the Government, as Deputy Corish said, to falsify, first of all, the unemployment figures.  They must be getting embarrassing when they are up to the 70,000 mark.  Of course, the idea was to take the cost of this off the Exchequer and pass it on to the local ratepayers.  Why, otherwise, would the Minister and the Government come out openly and admit that they are so bankrupt of policy and of money that this was what they had to do?  I noticed Deputy Foley sitting behind the Minister and, if I read the signs aright, his intention is to speak when I sit down.  I shall not keep him waiting too long and I forecast that what he will say will be something like all the things I would like to say if time permitted.  They will come better from a member of the Fianna Fáil Party advising a Fianna Fáil Minister. A Fine Gael Deputy might, perhaps, be accused of trying to make political capital out of the despicable treatment meted out to these unfortunate people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government have completely lost the confidence of the Irish people. As one Corkman to another, I want to tell the Taoiseach now&mdash;he is not here but I hope he will hear what I say&mdash;that he is completely out of touch with the mood of the people.  The constituency I represent is fairly far flung and, since this order was made, I have travelled around it a good bit.  I have had the unsolicited views of the people, and not only the people who would have been affected by this order.  I would say to him quite deliberately that people have lost confidence in the Government.  They have accepted that the Taoiseach and three or four Ministers are trying to carry the burden of running the country in most difficult times.  Those who take part in public <Col N="381" /> life or even those who read the daily papers know that this cannot be done.</P>
    <P>The daily revelations are becoming more serious.  The newspapers contain stories that Members on all sides of the House do not wish to read.  At a stage when we are discussing entry into the Common Market, when there is much trouble in the six north-eastern counties of our country, and when there are events such as the blowing up of boats in Baltimore, it behoves all of us to act in a responsible way.  When we take from the mouths of people the food they need to sustain them we are helping to drive them to the streets and to do and say the things we all deplore.</P>
    <P>My heart grieves when I think of the town of Fermoy, to which I hope to return this evening.  There I shall meet people, many of whom have been on the dole for 20 or 25 years.  Here we are talking not only of the unemployed but of the unemployable and this is what the Minister for Social Welfare seems to forget completely.  Many of the people in Fermoy who live outside the urban boundary will be obliged to come to me and ask for a note for the home assistance officer.  In this matter we must talk about facts and this is what will happen.  I challenge any Deputy not to feel sympathetic towards those unfortunate people.  We should all be ashamed of being part of a set-up that compels people to come to their public representatives and ask for a note to take to their home assistance officers.  Members of this House must have a sense of responsibility.  I shall give Deputy Foley a few minutes to convince the Minister that what the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party are saying is also what most of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers and supporters are saying, namely, that this Government should have the courage to resign.</P>
    <P>Many adjectives have been used to describe the first order that was annulled by the Minister and the second order which the Labour Party have proposed be annulled&mdash;which proposal we support.  The order has been described as mean, callous, unprecedented, ignominious, deplorable, incredible, distastetful, disgraceful, sorry, deceitful, irresponsible, astounding, <Col N="382" /> unjust, cowardly, outrageous, stupid and retrograde.  All those adjectives do not fully describe this very cowardly manoeuvre.  Before this debate concludes at 1.30 p.m.  I hope the Minister will have the guts to get up and tell us that, having revoked the first order, he has now decided that the second order be annulled.</P>
    <P>When I say &ldquo;the public&rdquo; I mean those people who must find and pay the money in order to ensure that the unfortunate are not deprived of all means.  There are many decent people in Fianna Fáil.  I am sure the Minister for Social Welfare was caught up in this.  If the Minister wants to save money and if the Minister for Finance comes here next Tuesday and tells us that in response to public demand this second order is annulled, Fine Gael will be very pleased to tell the Minister that we will get the money in another way in order to ensure that those unfortunate people who are in dire straits get the few pounds to keep body and soul together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister speaks I should like to say a few words. This is the first occasion I have had to come into this House and presume to defend an action of which I am utterly and completely ashamed.  It is not consistent with Fianna Fáil social welfare policy that at this stage we should try to deprive the less well-off brethren in our community of the small remuneration to which at least 95 per cent of the people concerned are legally entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should go into the pros and cons of this matter very carefully.  According to the Minister this matter came to light because of a leak from a local employment exchange.  It appears to me that it is just as well that it came to light in that way because after two days the Government Information Bureau announced there had been a mistake.  The very least anyone can ask is whether this mistake was really made and would it have been rectified were it not for the fact that there was a leak. I do not want to appear unreasonable but I am bound to say it is very difficult to see how a mistake was made. If a mistake was made surely the <Col N="383" /> Minister could tell us now who was responsible and what individuals were involved?  Was the Department of Social Welfare involved or was it the Department of Finance?  Was it the transmission of a decision made by the Government, through the Secretary to the Government?  He is a man who has never made a mistake so far as the Government are concerned and, in my opinion, he is a man who is not capable of making a mistake of this magnitude. These are questions I should like to have answered.  I find it very difficult to believe that the mistake was made in the Department of Social Welfare.  So far as I have been able to find out from my inquiries, it is a long time since we on this side of the House introduced An Employment Period Order to cover the whole country. Deputy Haughey, in 1966 or 1967&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;said that he was abolishing the Employment Period Order completely.  If civil servants were asked to make An Employment Period Order to cover the whole country, it would be natural to expect that each and every one of them would have made inquiries as to whether this was not a change from the common procedure of making the order for the rural areas.  If they did not do this, surely some of them would have had the common sense to ask the Minister what was the change of heart, and how did it come about.  That did not happen.  Therefore there is only one explanation which comes to my mind, that is, that this was a specific order given by the Government to make An Employment Period Order for the whole country and that no mistake whatever was involved.  I feel that a mistake such as this is not sidestepped. It cannot be dealt with in the way in which it has been dealt with.</P>

      <P>Why should we in this day and age pick on the weakest sector of our community to try to save £1.5 million?  Why should we do this by putting the onus on this sector of the community? The onus rightly belongs on this side of the House to provide employment where necessary for these people who seek social welfare assistance. It is absolutely ridiculous to try to scrounge £1.5 million from such a large expenditure and to cause hardship to these unfortunate people in doing so.  Innocent people are being asked to suffer here because we have not been capable of producing a watertight social welfare code.  We have looked long and hard for many years at a social welfare code which was being abused, not so much in the rural areas but in the city of Dublin and in other cities.</P>
      <P>The unemployment benefit section of the social welfare code is scandalously abused in the city of Dublin.  I have made personal and private reports to the Department of Social Welfare about these abuses, none of which has been dealt with satisfactorily.  None of the guilty parties has been dealt with to my satisfaction.  They should have been deprived of social welfare benefits and they should have been made to pay back every cent of the money they got illegally, thereby placing a burden not only on the Government but on the taxpayers and the ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> We can all see these abuses for ourselves. If Deputies go down to the Dublin jetty they will see the country trucks coming in from Sligo or Leitrim or any part of the country.  Those trucks must be loaded on the Dublin docks and they cannot be loaded unless the drivers have a helper.  Where do they get the helpers?  They get them outside the jetty gates.  These individuals knock off at about 10.30 a.m. on Tuesday or Thursday morning for about two hours to sign up for the dole.  They get £2 a ton for loading the lorries and they can do that two or three times a day.  Connors pub is full of these type of people who can draw the dole because we will not make an honest endeavour here to provide a consolidated social welfare code under which they could be prevented from abusing it.</P>
    <P>I am saying this against my own people but, if a principle is involved, personalities should not come into it and, so far as I am concerned, a very valid principle is involved here.  I am sure these abuses occur in other places as well as Dublin city but I am familiar with abuses in the city.  They should not be overlooked.  The investigating squad about which we hear so much, and which investigate other matters which are not relevant to this debate, should be used to seek out these individuals and make sure they are brought to justice.  They brought other individuals to justice who were not as guilty of receiving the taxpayers' money in an illegal way as these individuals are.</P>
    <P>The same thing can be seen in the Dublin markets.  I frequented the Dublin markets for eight or nine years before I came into this House.  I was a farmer in County Dublin and I still am.  The position was not as bad then, but times have changed radically since. Individuals there utilised the system which I have just explained to get money and then they went off to sign up for the dole.  If these were just isolated cases I would say there are bound to be abuses of any scheme. There are abuses of our agricultural schemes and there are abuses of our other social welfare schemes.  We are a group of people thinking up schemes for the whole country but the minds <Col N="386" /> of the many are greater than the minds of the few.  Therefore abuses and dodges will be thought up.  If we make no effort to do anything about it then the fault does not lie with the people who abuse the scheme but with the people who institute the scheme and maintain it without doing something about it.  Therefore I feel that, so far as this Act is concerned, if we are taking away something without having something positive to put in its place, we are failing miserably in our duty and we are not conforming to the characteristic performance on which Fianna Fáil have been commended down through the years in helping social welfare recipients in every way.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about that haven the Dublin docks.  There are good people down there.  I am not criticising every individual there.  It is only natural that it is an area where all this carry-on takes place.  Any day of the week you can get ten or 20 social welfare stamps for a paltry sum.  These stamps enable people to carry on drawing the dole for a longer period than that for which they are entitled to draw it.  All these abuses have been reported.  The people who are responsible for carrying out these investigations do not seem to bother about it.  If they do not bother about it why should I bother making these complaints repeatedly to the Department?  If the Department are not prepared to accept that these things are happening, then they are far behind the times and are not doing the job they were put there to do.</P>
    <P>It has been announced that £500,000 will be made available for employment in the rural areas.  It is ridiculous to suggest that £500,000 will compensate these people for the dole they are losing.  I think it was said here earlier on that if the local authorities are tarmacadaming a road in the rural areas and there is a laneway being done under the rural improvements scheme, they will not go to the local exchange for people to do this work when the machine is there to do it.  It is wrong to give the impression that employment will be given to people in the rural areas.  It is bad enough to take the dole from them but it is worse to mislead them into believing they will get employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> This is my own personal view.  Someone has to say it because what is being done is not consistent with the Fianna Fáil policy of which we have been so proud that we have ridiculed the Opposition for their performance over many years.  If we were responsible for taking money from the old age pensioners we would be subjected to a considerable amount of ridicule.  In this connection we are more liable to ridicule because we are not reducing the amount of money being given but taking the whole lot away.</P>
    <P>There are many innocent people involved in this.  A big percentage of them are unemployable; some of them are in rural areas where employment is practically nil.  We have up-to-date machinery now for doing the work. There is no such thing as a busy period when additional hands are taken on. We have a rush period on the land; we have to beat the weather, but the machinery takes the place of the workers who used to be employed. Therefore, the supposed availability of rural employment does not carry any weight with me.  If I were a western Deputy I would feel so peeved about this that I would not be able to stand on a platform again and criticise the social welfare policies of any other party.  Another objection I have is to the manner in which this was implemented, by saying: &ldquo;In a fortnight's time you will get nothing.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>While I do not agree with the implementation of this order it would be less objectionable if a reasonable explanation was given for it and if people were told: &ldquo;We intend to stop the social welfare unemployment benefit on such a date and in its place we shall introduce an additional scheme.&rdquo;  If that were done I for one would applaud the proposal because I am not one who would plead for unemployment benefit for anyone who is capable of working.  Nobody knows better than I do the abuses that occur. It is only natural.  I live in an area which is close to the city and there are people there who are working and drawing social welfare benefit.  Let no one say here that the workers of this <Col N="388" /> country are so law abiding that they would not attempt to do that.  There are people in every sphere of life who will do things which are no credit to them.  Everyone will condemn this but no one, and particularly the Department of Social Welfare, will make an honest endeavour to stamp it out once and for all.</P>
      <P>There are two people living side by side in my constituency.  They drink in the same pub together; of course, they will not do that any more because in a fortnight's time one of them will have his unemployment benefit stopped and the other will not.  Why?  Because the city boundary comes between them. Naturally one will ask the other: &ldquo;Why are you getting unemployment benefit while I am not?  I do not see any reason for this.  The £1,500,000 should be used to clean up in the social welfare system the abuses which have been haunting us for years. If it is not cleaned up, then not only will the rural benefit have been taken away but the urban benefit will be taken away as well.  I was one of those who used very strong arguments in favour of our social welfare benefits at the last election.  I did everything I could to hammer the Opposition about the tenpence a year and about the paltry sums they gave to social welfare recipients during their period in office. That was a different era.  It was a time, I suppose, in which it was difficult to get money.  It was a time when £1,500,000 was a great deal of money. Today it does not mean so much out of an expenditure of £500 million.  It is time we all asked: what are we doing to these unfortunate people who depend on this dole?  To deprive them of it seems to be a way of saying: &ldquo;You had better emigrate.&rdquo; If they cannot get social welfare assistance from now on some of them will not have the price of emigration; some of them will come into the cities where they may hope to work for a while to get the money.  However, we are all complaining about the rates.  This is one way of putting up the rates so that at every county council and corporation meeting there will be bitter complaints.</P>

That is the crunch.  We have heard so many times in the past from Fianna Fáil, the right versus the left, the left versus the right but this is a golden opportunity for the rank and file of Fianna Fáil to stand up to the autocrats who have now taken over their party and to vote against this motion so that the dole may be restored to those who are now being deprived of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> The timing of this announcement was very bad.  It was made at a time when the Dáil was in recess.  The order was the cause of despair and anger all over the country, in the cities and towns as well as in the rural areas.  However, when the pressure was put on by those in the urban areas, their voices were heard immediately and we were told that the order was all a mistake. The Government could foresee the demonstrations outside this House, outside the Custom House and outside the Department of Social Welfare but, of course, it would take much longer for the people in rural areas to become organised.  As I see it, it was because of the pressure that was put on in the cities and towns that the Minister backtracked.</P>
    <P>How are these unfortunate people to live now?  The county councils may say to some of them that they are young and healthy and should be able to work and, consequently, they will not be given home assistance but what is to happen to them if they cannot get work?  Deputy Corish rightly pointed out a number of cases and I would like to reiterate some of those now.</P>
    <P>What about the single man who lives alone?  From where will he get help?  What about the single man who looks after his aged parents?  What about the unmarried man who lives with a married brother and who, because he was getting a few shillings at the weekend, had some degree of independence in so far as he was able to go out with the lads on a Friday night or to go to a football match on a Sunday?  Must that brother turn now to his married brother and ask for a pound or two?  He will have no alternative but to emigrate.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the lads from then on.  I would ask the Minister to take all these things into consideration.  The few pounds gave an air of pride and independence to these people.  I admire Deputy Foley for what was a lengthy contribution.  He said that social welfare was one of the platforms of Fianna Fáil.  During the last general election campaign I was a victim of that propaganda.  We all received copies of the pamphlet which read &ldquo;For your future vote Fianna Fáil. Let us back Jack Lynch.&rdquo;  Then there was the one circulated in south Kerry from Seven Oaks, Killorglin, which was sent out by Deputy O'Connor, who today is conspicuous by his absence.  He did say that certain aspects of the Fine Gael policy had emerged as a result of a meeting held in Killarney, presided over by the late Deputy Sweetman, may the Lord have mercy on him, and he said that their public relations officer handed in a statement to the <i>Kerryman</i> which quoted Councillor Michael Begley as saying that if he were elected the first thing he would do would be to do away with the small farmers' dole and all home assistance payments.  Here we had it in black and white that the people were threatened <Col N="393" /> and abused and they were codded. They were told that if they voted Fine Gael they would lose the dole.  The people have now seen who are the real culprits and who are the people who are going to lose the dole.</P>
      <P>I cannot take seriously the statement that so much money will be given to the western counties for rural improvement schemes and that this will provide the badly-needed employment to give the few people deprived of the dole the few shillings that will give them independence.  It is well known that when these schemes will be operated the names of these people will no longer be on the lists at the labour exchanges.  How then can they qualify for work?  It will be the married people who are getting the high dole who will get the work.  The Minister should make a clear statement here about how he is going to work this, how these people whose names are not on the lists can be provided with work.  As I said, the married people will get first preference and the others will be left out.  If Deputy Foley and his colleagues from the western counties exert enough pressure between now and 1.30 I am sure the Minister will reverse his order, which is damnable as far as rural Ireland is concerned.</P>

      <P>Subsection (3) of section 4 of the 1933 Unemployment Assistance Act empowers the Minister for Social Welfare to make an Employment Period Order.  The duration of that order precludes persons who are otherwise qualified from continuing to draw unemployment assistance, commonly known as the dole.  These orders were a common feature of the unemployment assistance scheme from the year it was introduced, 1933, by Fianna Fáil down to 1967.  The orders varied from one year to another; they mostly followed the same pattern in their last years and there were two orders, one cutting off persons with valuations over £4 from March to October and another cutting off persons in other categories from June to October. Sometimes they varied.  During the war years there was an order made which cut off all persons for a period.  In the first year of the war there was an extended order and in the second year virtually everybody was cut off, but at all times it did not refer to the 16 particular urbans as set out in the regulations. None of them, no matter how they varied, at any time referred to these urbans.  These 16 urbans have been excluded and I never knew why. Possibly it is because they make a contribution to the funds from rates. In 1967 when I was Minister for Social Welfare the Government decided not to introduce these Employment Period Orders and the then Minister for Finance in his Budget speech pointed out that it would enable small farmers to continue to work their holdings more enthusiastically because we had introduced the new means test whereby the disincentive to farming might be removed because the assessment of means was based on valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say before I move on to the more important part that we got no kudos for that.  We were accused, as <Col N="395" /> we have been accused here today, of doing it to collect votes.  You cannot win on this.  You are ruining somebody's life and depriving him when you make the order; you are doing it to collect votes when you do not make it.  I think the public will understand the meaning of that.  Deputy Corish like many Fianna Fáil Ministers as well signed one of those orders when there were 85,286 people on the unemployment register.</P>

I am not making any complaint, but I like to be consistent. Let me say that among many other things in the consideration of the whole social welfare structure this is only one aspect of the social welfare code.  When the Government decided that the order would be reintroduced this year naturally they had grave concern about the types of people it would affect. Any Government would have.  Remember, it was not done lightly or without consideration.  They decided that persons with dependants should not be included and that was a very generous gesture in bringing in the order, to exclude the really tough cases who perhaps would suffer more hardship than others, the persons with dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to be clear here without equivocating about what happened in regard to the first order and the second order.  It was the intention of all members of the Government that the order would apply as before to what are designated the rural areas and anything that happened was a misunderstanding in communications between Finance and my Department.  There was no bungling, as some people said, about the order produced by my Department <Col N="396" /> and I never used that word.  I never used the word &ldquo;mistake&rdquo;.  The first order very definitely applied to all persons without dependants and my Department were not to blame in making that order and I want to say that plainly here.  I want to say that to people who may have accused me otherwise.  If anything happened that might have prevented the order being examined, it was released by a leak from an unemployment exchange&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think nobody seriously pursued that argument today because it is laid down in the Act that the order must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and there is a statutory period inside which anybody can move to have it annulled. That is what we are now debating.  The allegation that this was done when the Dáil was not sitting cannot be substantiated. As soon as I discovered that the first order extended to people that it was not intended by the Government decision should be included and which was rightly interpreted by my Department as being included, I made a new order.  That is the one we are now discussing.</P>

      <P>It was signed on the 1st April to come into effect on the 14th.  I think it was on Thursday.  It was a simple matter of misunderstanding between the Department of Finance and the interpretation of the Government's decision in the order.  It is the <Col N="397" /> simplest thing in the world; to err is human.  There was only one definite thing in the order as compared with previously.  Many of these orders in the past have differed in the period covered and the type of people included but they never extended to the 60 &ldquo;urbans&rdquo; who contribute to the scheme.</P>

      <P>The same consideration would apply.  The order was made and everybody who could get on the band wagon to make capital out of it, did so.  Everybody's heart bled for a section of the people about whom nobody thought before.  I know what is involved better than most Deputies.  If this has done nothing else it has made many people express themselves, people who never before had a kind word to say about our extension of the <Col N="398" /> dole over the summer months.  This has evoked a new attitude and has got people to say things they have not said before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the reception given to this extension in the past.  I now want to say something about the category affected because I think that is the all important thing. Every effort was made to ensure that the people to whom the order would apply this year would be those who would suffer least hardship.  Those with dependants were deliberately excluded.  Deputy Foley has talked about the prevalence of abuses in regard to unemployment assistance. We must accept it is not possible to eliminate abuses completely in any social welfare code but one must do one's best in that regard.  In order to qualify for what is commonly known as the dole, one must be capable of, available for, genuinely seeking and unable to find suitable employment.  If I get one complaint more than another from Deputies it is that our investigation officers are much too strict in the enforcement of the regulations.  If the regulations were rigidly enforced in strict accordance with law most of these people would be deprived of the dole in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Murphy always makes a case about providing work in lieu of the money paid out in unemployment assistance.  In January, 1969, I produced a memorandum on this subject proposing to make it necessary for each recipient of unemployment assistance to do a unit of work commensurate with the amount he was drawing each week.  I had this examined by different Departments.  I proposed that a pool of work be made up from bog roads, accommodation and tourist roads, side paths, parks, community centres, swimming pools, drainage, landing places on inshore fisheries and along the coasts and one thousand and one necessary things requiring money.  We are paying £9 million in dole.  I thought it was possible to devise a scheme which would <Col N="399" /> marry the two problems.  I found it very difficult to get a suitable scheme but none of the problems put up to me by the Departments was the cause of my not pursuing it further at the time. I went out of Social Welfare shortly afterwards.</P>
    <P>I did find that no matter how near perfection the scheme could be&mdash;and it is now under examination&mdash;it would not ensure that the money would go into the pockets of those already receiving it.  That applies also to the £500,000 which we are providing for the West of Ireland for necessary jobs. At least it will enrich the countryside by doing work for which money is required.  It will also give employment, but there is no guarantee that the money will go into the pockets of even a small percentage of those being deprived of unemployment assistance.</P>

This was brought in by Fianna Fáil with very little praise from the other side of the House except allegations like the ones made by Deputy Barry today who cried for the people left in destitution and at the same time said we only did it for vote-catching in the first instance.  That is the tone of his approach to this serious problem.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The matter we are dealing with today arises out of an order which the Minister for Social Welfare made on 1st April.  That order contains approximately 200 words and the effective part of it reads:</P>
      <P>The period commencing on the 14th day of April, 1971, and ending on the 16th day of November, 1971, shall be an employment period in respect of the following class of persons, namely, every man who has no dependants.</P>
      <P>Surely that is quite clear?  It is unambiguous. There is nothing cloudy about it.  That was announced on the radio on 6th April, on the midday news.  It was repeated on the television news on the 6th April, on the evening radio news on 6th April, on the late night news on both radio and television and it was repeated the following day on the early morning news at 7.30 a.m., at 8 a.m. and at 9 o'clock. On the morning of the 7th every newspaper in the country carried a leading article condemning the proposal.  As one who has on occasion criticised the newspapers, I want to say now that they behaved magnificently on this occasion.  No Minister and no Government could withstand the barrage of editorial comment.  It was not until midday on the 7th, at least 24 hours after the announcement was made, that the Minister came on the news between 1.30 and two o'clock, over the telephone, to say that it was a mistake. He had discovered then that it was a mistake.  I join with Deputy Des Foley who, in a way not permitted sometimes by Parliament, called his own Minister a liar in this House this morning; he said he did not accept that this was a mistake.</P>

He has not told us that.  It contains 200 words of clear, unambiguous matter making it plain to everybody that it applied to every man in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much for that.  The Minister says now that he is not blaming any civil servant.  Of course he blamed the civil servants on the 6th, 7th and 8th of this month because he is reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 8th April as saying the cutting off of the dole from all unemployed single men without dependants was a mistake.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Brennan, claimed yesterday that an error had been made in drafting the circular reintroducing <Col N="407" /> the Unemployment Period Order.  The Minister did not contradict that.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I want to know where we stand with the Minister.  We are reaching the stage at which, as some newspaper said, it is difficult to believe anything that comes from a Minister.  This order, which is the first of 1967, comes before this House and the country at different times.  Many things have happened since 1966.  The Taoiseach, Ministers and Members of this House have got substantial increases in salaries since 1966 and, according to rumour, they are prepared to take a further increase now.  The whole pattern of agricultural life has changed.  There was a time when there was employment in rural Ireland in the summer.  The probability is that there is now more employment in the towns.</P>
      <P>This order comes before the House at a time when unemployment has soared over the 70,000 mark.  Factories are closing down and the cost of living has increased.  Above all, the order is before us at a time when the Government are not attending to the business of the country.  It is a time of wrangling within the Government.  They have muddled through one political crisis after another, culminating today with one of their own Deputies saying in this House that he is ashamed to be a member of his party because they are not carrying out the policy of the party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us ask ourselves to what type of person does this order apply.  It applies to a body of people who, through no fault of their own, are unemployable. Already I have received letters on this matter.  I had a letter from a daughter who told me her father was 69 years; she wondered how he was going to live <Col N="408" /> during the next year until he qualifies for the old age pension.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that he knows more about this order than anybody else.  Any Deputy who is attending to his constituency work knows that many of the people to whom this order will apply are elderly; they are not able to work, they cannot emigrate and many of them have a background that does not suit them for employment. Many of them have not married, perhaps for reasons of health or some other matter.  I do not want to spell this out but the Minister knows that many of these people who will be cut off are not quite the same as the rest of the community.  If the Minister has a scheme for these people why did he not tell us about it at the time he announced this order?  There is nothing more pathetic than an elderly person who has to live on the charity of relatives for a number of years.  His parents have died and quite often he must live with a married brother or sister who does not really want him.  The few shillings which he received each week gave him some kind of self-respect. The Government have now deprived him of this.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government was at a convention in Cavan on the Sunday before the news broke.  He could not tell the convention the amount of the grant for the local improvements scheme; he said it was under consideration and would be announced in connection with the Budget proposals.  However, within a couple of days of this scandal being made known, the Minister for Local Government announced that the local improvements scheme grant would be increased from £500,000 to £1 million.  He gave the impression that the extra £500,000 would make up to the people who were hit by this order but I knew, as did everybody else, that this was not so.  The people who get work on local improvement schemes are those who live on the lanes on which work is being carried out; they are the people who pay the local contribution. It was a deception on the part of the Minister and I am glad that the Minister for Social Welfare today has admitted that this £500,000 <Col N="409" /> will not be of benefit to the people who are hit by the order.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a vague general statement that the people on whose behalf I am speaking, those who are not able to work and who cannot emigrate, will be catered for in some undefined scheme which he has not announced.  If this is so, it is being done under pressure from this side of the House and under pressure from the national newspapers, who behaved magnificently.  This was not thought of on 1st April, or even on the 8th April.  It was only thought of at the long Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting yesterday when the Taoiseach and the Minister were nearly gutted.</P>
    <P>I hope the scheme the Minister is introducing will not leave the unfortunate people to the tender mercies of home assistance officers.  They are, under direction from the Government, operating a ruthless type of investigation of these people.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I know a man in my constituency who was for months the subject of an argument between the Department of Social Welfare and the county council. The latter said the man was fit to work and that he should go and get the dole.  The Department of Social Welfare said he was not fit to work and should get a disabled person's allowance. Only one point was accepted about this man, namely, that society owed him money, that society owed him something to keep body and soul together.  The wrangling went on for months and the man got nothing. Finally, I am glad to say, he got £2 per week disabled person's allowance from the Cavan County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister to ensure that if a scheme is introduced it will be operated in a humane manner.  Society owes something to these unfortunate people who cannot provide for themselves, those who are unable to work or who, through no fault of their own, cannot get work.  When we speak about the tens of thousands of people who are leaving agriculture, those who <Col N="410" /> are leaving rural Ireland and of the people who are living alone or with relatives, surely the Minister is not serious when he says that they can find work in their own areas?  This is impossible in an age when machinery has taken over both in county council work and in agriculture.</P>
    <P>This was a deliberate proposal by the Minister to put the Employment Period Order into force in respect of all people.  It was a deliberate proposal put by him to the Cabinet, accepted by the Cabinet and an order was drawn up by his Department.  If this is not the case, how can the Minister for Social Welfare explain his signature to this 200 word document?</P>

      <P>We have here today another example of something which the Government have adopted over the past 12 months, that is, Government by retreat.  They started off with the <Col N="411" /> Succession Bill.  They introduced it and after it had gone three-quarters of the way through the House, they withdrew it and introduced one which was acceptable.  They came along with the Prices and Incomes Bill last year and, after standing firm and saying: &ldquo;Thus far shalt thou go and no further&rdquo;, they retreated bit by bit until we had something which was acceptable to the country.  Having said that every man in the country in receipt of unemployment assistance is cut off with effect from 14th April, the Minister said first that people living in the 16 towns, I assume with a population of over 7,000, were excepted, and then today he said that they were only codding us and them and that everyone would get it.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister realise the effect of his decision, or should I say the decision of the Minister for Finance, because it is quite clear from the debate here today, and particularly from what the Minister said himself, that he did not know one darn thing about it until the Minister for Finance made the order?  He said he did not make the order.  Therefore the Minister for Finance must have made it and that the Minister for Finance intended to include everybody is obvious from the figures in the Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>There was a boy at school with me years ago who used to tell lies.  The teacher used to say to him that a lie has no legs and eventually the whole story collapses.  I am not saying the Minister told lies deliberately.  What actually happened in this case is quite plain.  After the decision was taken the Minister was told this was going to be done.  He was probably as horrified as we were when he discovered what had happened.  He has been backpedalling since and he is now in this House, which is only right, with his back against the wall.  He is saying the only thing that can be said, that is that we will not let them die of hunger and that we will in fact introduce something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said a few things which must be corrected despite the shortness of the time at my disposal. He said that when the idea of the <Col N="412" /> abolition of employment period orders was introduced nobody welcomed it. When Deputy Haughey, then Minister for Finance, introduced this idea it was significant that he said:</P>
    <P>To improve the incomes of those living on very small holdings has been a matter of special concern to the Government.  The Minister for Social Welfare has been authorised to make changes in the present assistance schemes which will increase their cash incomes significantly.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that this was something which would relieve the problems of those people.  That quotation is taken from column 1269, volume 227 of the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance now wants to change that.  In effect he is saying that we are now going to reduce their standard of living; we are now going to take that improvement from them; we are now putting them in a much worse position.  If his predecessor claimed credit for that on the one hand, the Department must accept the debit side on the other hand.  In fact, consciously and deliberately the Government decided to reduce the standard of living of a large section of the people.  The Minister said that nobody complimented the previous Minister or himself when this was introduced.  As reported at column 1501, volume 227 of the Official Report, speaking in the Budget debate I said:</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on changing the system under which certain periods were known as employment periods.  I could never understand why a man with a valuation of £4 or over in the country who was on unemployment assistance, or the dole, as we call it, was expected to be able to live for a considerable period of the year on that small portion of land.  What was he supposed to do?  Was he supposed to grow a certain type of grass which would remain green all the year round and which he could go out and eat during the period of the year when he was getting no income?  Worse still, was the case of the unfortunate rural labourer, who, during the second employment <Col N="413" /> period, was deemed to be in employment, even though he was not able to get enough to eat, had no job and was kept alive by a few shillings which he got through the local home assistance officer until he was lucky enough to go back on the dole again.</P>
    <P>That statement was made by me and, if the Minister claims that that was not agreeing with and complimenting him on the action he took, I do not know what he thinks it was.</P>
    <P>The Minister now says: &ldquo;We will not let them starve.  There are a certain number of them who possibly are not fit for work.&rdquo;  God knows and we know that.  The Minister said today that he knows more about social welfare than anybody else in this House.  I challenge that statement.  I have made a special study of social welfare and so have my colleagues, and we could run rings around him when it comes to the question of dealing with social welfare and matters affecting his Department.  I suggested in 1967&mdash;I suggested it last year and I will suggest it again this year if it is not done, but I know it will be done&mdash;as reported at column 1502 of the same volume of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>When introducing his Budget, the Minister might have considered the system whereby those who were ill and had for one reason or another less than 156 stamps and therefore were not entitled to draw sickness benefit for more than 12 months might be covered by some type of disability assistance.</P>
    <P>Might I suggest that, from what the Minister told us today, he is now accepting that advice.  In fact, he is getting authorisation to introduce a system whereby those who can no longer draw disability benefit and who are unable to work will be able to draw disability assistance under any name he likes to put on it.  If he announces it, or if it is introduced in the Budget, we will welcome it because it will be a step forward.</P>
    <P>Do not forget that between the time when these men were knocked off and now there has been hunger and want in this country.  These unfortunate <Col N="414" /> people thought they could depend on the Government to keep them alive at least.  I had a letter from an unfortunate odd-job man who was never able to get more than 12 or 14 stamps in any year.  He would draw unemployment benefit and then he would go on to unemployment assistance.  He worked off and on but, when he was working, no one would stamp his card because unfortunately the rule still exists in the country that no stamp goes on the card of the man who does a job to oblige a neighbour and gets paid for it.  That is the excuse.  This man is now almost 70 years of age. When he was younger his parents lived with him.  His sister stayed at home to look after the parents.  Now he has a niece who is deaf and dumb.</P>
    <P>He was getting £3 6s per week dole to keep himself, his sister and his niece.  The Minister for Social Welfare has now knocked off his dole.  I contacted the Department and said that this was a hard case.  I asked was there anything that they could do for these dependants and a gentleman who, no doubt, had a good breakfast and was looking forward to a good lunch said: &ldquo;Oh, they are not dependants.  They may be depending on him but they are not dependants.&rdquo;  These are the type of people we are talking about, these and the unfortunate man living on his own who has nothing except what he gets from the Department of Social Welfare by way of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>It amused me to listen to some people here who do not seem to know yet the difference between unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  I have heard people call unemployment benefit the dole.  In fact, unemployment benefit is not the dole.  For the benefit of those who still do not know what it means, the dole is unemployment assistance.  The dole is the least amount that can be given and the people drawing the dole, as everybody admits, are the unfortunates of this country, the people who cannot get a job.  Someone said we were encouraging them to emigrate.</P>

      <P>Where the devil would they go?  When they got the last £3 6s they were told that was the last they would get until 17th November next. How far would they go with that in their pockets?  They do not even get a chance to emigrate.  This is one of those instances where the Government were having it both ways.  We must remember the number of people who have been made redundant in factories. Deputy Corish mentioned the people who were not employed this year, or last year, or the year before, because of the rundown in the ordinary working of Bord na Móna.  A number of people in forestry are also being laid off this year.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Minister for Finance seem to have completely missed the fact that when there is a hope of a job and four or five men are looking for it, it is the fit man who will get it, not the man who has been on the dole for many years.  People have been put out of jobs deliberately in the forestry division.  The Government refused to meet their commitments when the last wage increase was granted and, when the local authorities put up the extra money for increased wages, the State refused to meet them and in many counties unemployment was the result.  Then they say there is work in the country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish was perfectly correct when he said that with the introduction of mechanisation in agriculture, long before 1967 indeed, the need for extra men for sowing and haymaking and at harvest time had disappeared completely.  I agreed with many of the things said by Deputy Foley, and particularly when he confirmed that this is so.  However, I want to say this for the benefit of Deputy Foley and anybody else who likes to hear it: I would hate to see any of my own colleagues on any side of this House turning themselves into informers for the Department of Social Welfare.  If Deputy Foley feels that his conscience will allow him to have inquiries made into money being spent which he says should not be given to somebody, I do not know what is to happen, but I do know unfortunate people who are entitled to money and who are not getting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> I know of one particular case of a man working for years on top of years who became ill and drew sickness benefit.  His own doctor said he was not fit for work.  The social welfare doctor said he was or, as they so politely put it, that he was &ldquo;not unfit for work&rdquo;.  He was knocked off the register.  He drew unemployment benefit as long as he could and then went back on sickness benefit.  Again he was knocked off by a referee who said he was not unfit for work.  Eventually as his stamps were out, he finished up on the dole.  This man wrote to me last week: &ldquo;What do I do now?  Where do I live?  I cannot pay for my house.  I cannot pay for food.  I cannot emigrate because I am over 60 years of age.  What do I do?&rdquo;  I asked the local authority could they help him and they said: &ldquo;We will give him £2 a week.&rdquo;  Would the Minister like to say what a man would do with £2 a week at the present time?  The amount which they were getting was almost exactly the amount a Member of this House gets for staying overnight in Dublin.  Then the Minister says: &ldquo;We must cut down on this.  These people are getting too much.  They do not want to work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not remember that some months ago in this House I asked him why he would not train some of the 60,000, as it then was, who were on the unemployment register for jobs for which he said he was bringing people home from England?  Does he not remember saying most of them were unemployable? Does he believe that people who were unemployable then can get nonexistent jobs now?  Does he expect them to go into the back of a hedge and live like a hedgehog, curl up and sleep until the next money comes along from the State, small as it is?</P>
    <P>I know my time is running out and I do not want to detain the House. However, I am very glad of one thing, that the weight of public opinion was responsible for the decision being reversed; that friends in the press, on television and on the radio, the ordinary people of this country, in Fine Gael, in the Labour Party and in the back benches of Fianna Fáil were the people who made this change take <Col N="417" /> place.  They put the gun to the Minister's head and I take pleasure in saying we are glad we put the gun to the Minister's head.  But before this week is out I want a definite statement from him as to when and from where these people will get this money.  There is no provision for this in the Book of Estimates. Where will it come from?  I do not want any backsliding when this debate is over.  Government Ministers have been very cute in talking themselves <Col N="418" /> out of awkward corners over the last 12 months.  This may seem to them to be a very simple one.  This is an issue which will be remembered in this country for many years, because it is a clear case in which the ordinary people have shown the Government, who have no care for them, they just cannot get away with a racket like this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the Draft of the Order entitled Social Welfare (Remuneration Limit for Insured Persons) Order, 1971.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to raise the remuneration limit for social insurance which applies to non-manual workers and as required by statute the draft of a Government order giving effect to this proposal has been laid before each House.  The existing limit of £1,200 has been in operation since 6th September, 1965.  The new limit contained in the order is £1,600 and it is proposed to give effect to this from the 3rd May, 1971.</P>
      <P>Since the first scheme of social insurance was introduced in this country in 1912, there has been such a remuneration limit for compulsory insurance in operation but only in relation to persons employed otherwise than by way of manual labour.  The insurance position of workers employed by way of manual labour is not affected by their remuneration and they are compulsorily insured regardless of their earnings. The limit which was fixed at £600 in 1953 at the time of the introduction of the original social welfare system now in operation has since been raised twice, in 1958 to £800 and, as I have said, in 1965 to £1,200.</P>
      <P>If the order receives the required approval of both Houses, I intend to make regulations providing for the granting of credited contributions to persons who are brought back into compulsory insurance by the raising of the limit to £1,600, and who might otherwise, in some cases, not be qualified for certain benefits such as unemployment benefit and disability benefit. I recommend the motion for the approval of Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I readily admit that the Minister has gone some of the way to help in regard to this Order but I want to say, as I expressed the view when the order was made last week, that the raising of the limit from £1,200 to £1,600 is not sufficient if we take the comparative values of money on the 6th September, 1965, and the 22nd April, 1971.  The figure which I mentioned, of £2,000, would be much nearer the target and go much further in giving justice all round.  The Minister mentioned the figure of £600 in 1953 but even taking comparative values I still believe that my figure of £2,000 would be much nearer the mark.  We in Fine Gael have always expressed the view that we should have wage related contributions and benefits.  I hope that at some future date some Minister for Social Welfare, whether he is from the Fianna Fáil side of the House or this side of the House, will introduce legislation which will be accepted by all as being nearer to justice in all cases.  I suggest that the Minister study the Fine Gael policy in this regard, a copy of which I will send him if he has not got one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>While this is an improvement it is not what the Government should have done and from remarks made by the Minister earlier I think he would be the first to admit that they <Col N="421" /> have not gone far enough.  There should be no limit and I see no reason why there should be.  If the Minister feels that a limit is necessary so that it can be done on a graduated basis he could at the very least have gone to £2,000.  Why he stopped at £1,600 beats me.  The trade unions and the labour movement for years have been looking for wage-related benefits and this was a golden opportunity on which to introduce it.  Perhaps this was something which the Minister wanted to do quickly and felt that he should wait until later on to do the whole job.  If that is so I should like him to say so and we would be prepared to accept that from him.  Not alone this Minister but previous Ministers for Social Welfare have been talking for years, or making noises, about wage-related insurance benefit and there is no reason why something should not be done about it.  It is not as simple as it looks because you have a number of people who are not insured at present because they are over £1,200.  The Minister makes a statement which he should clarify.  He says:</P>
      <P>If the order receives the required approval of both Houses, I intend to make regulations providing for the granting of credited contributions to persons who are brought back into compulsory insurance by the raising of the limit to £1,600, and who might otherwise, in some cases, not be qualified for certain benefits such as unemployment benefit and disability benefit.</P>
      <P>How far is the Minister prepared to go back?  Will he go back to previous insurance?  This is a very big question and if he is going to link benefits then let us hear that that is being done. When something is left up in the air eventually when it sees the light of day it very often turns out to be entirely different from what we expetced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the costings to the Department I am sure the officials have been working on this for some time.  I feel that the costings would show that it would be quite easy and profitable to remove the limit because most of those in the higher income bracket who would then be paying social welfare insurance would not be drawing unemployment <Col N="422" /> benefit.  They are not the people who are out of jobs.  The trouble here is that out of the 70,000 odd people unemployed the vast majority are people who had from £25 down as far as unemployment benefit is concerned; and as far as sickness benefit is concerned I am sure it could be arranged that the firm paying the wages could stamp the cards.  If the Minister felt that this was the way to deal with this so that there would not be a double payment, many of those places which pay full salaries, again in the higher bracket, would not come on the fund at all.  The Minister should look into the problem and get his officials working on this matter of having the limit removed and have wage related benefits and payments within the next 12 months.  I see no reason why this should not be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should be thoroughly ashamed to come into this House in 1971 with a proposal to carry on the disgraceful system of limiting insurance to any ceiling when as far back as 1969, with a great display of progression and great applause for themselves, the Government announced in their now want-to-be-forgotten Third Programme for Economic Expansion, and their first programme for social development, that they had approved proposals of the Minister for Social Welfare for the preparation of legislation to provide for a scheme of pay related unemployment disability benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 250-odd pages of the programme reference is made again and again to the need to bring more and more people within insurance. Three years ago we were told the Minister for Social Welfare was arranging for a detailed examination because the Government's White Paper pointed out that the existing social insurance does not cover non-manual workers earning over £1,200 a year. Neither does it cover self-employed persons, including farmers, who cannot, therefore, avail of such social insurance schemes to provide against sickness, old age or for survivor pensions.  In 1969 the Government regarded as an urgent priority the <Col N="423" /> extension of existing social insurance schemes to bring in these people, but there is no extension now.  The Minister knows that all he is doing is going some of the way towards the 1965 figures.  I have been unable to trace the answer to a Dáil question which the Minister gave me some months ago. Perhaps he would give the information in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is 30,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was 24,000 or 25,000 at that time.  With respect, the Minister should have given that figure in his opening statement.  This practice by the Minister and his colleagues of giving utterly inadequate opening statements on vital matters of this kind should cease.  Clearly the most important figure for the Dáil is the number of people who are being affected by this.  The 30,000 people to whom the Minister refers are those people who, because of the Minister's tardiness and the Government's delay, have gone out of compulsory insurance over the past six years.  We are now in a position in which over one-fifth of the workers are not socially insured.  It is proposed to remedy that to some extent by this proposal but even within the lifetime of the existing national wage agreement many of the workers who have been brought back into compulsory insurance for their own benefit today will be outside it.  We know that the experience has been&mdash;and this is without regard to what Government held office&mdash;that the Oireachtas has delayed, time and time again, in making the necessary amendments.  Once artificial ceilings are fixed for anything, social insurances, taxation, penalties for offences or any other purpose there is always delay on the part of the Parliament in bringing those ceilings up to contemporary money values.  On that score, we believe the Government deserve to be very severely censured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened the Government's legislation?  What has happened the proposals that we were told two years ago in a most expensively produced public document had already, presumably, reached the draftsman office?  I do not want to go into the <Col N="424" /> multitudinous distractions and disruptions in attention to duty which we know are afflicting the present Government but it is indicative of the terrible collapse of concern on the part of the Government that such a vital matter has been so long delayed. Here we have this patchwork legislation once again being brought before the House.  I have no doubt that the Minister in replying will make the kind of specious promise which he and colleagues in the Government give, that it is now receiving active consideration and that we shall probably be soon considering proposals for the abolition of the ceiling on social insurance and he will probably capture the headlines with that statement in the same way as they captured them in 1969 and before that, but it is about as empty as the promises to do something about the ever spiralling demand on rates, particularly in relation to health services.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Barry has already pointed out, so far as Fine Gael are concerned there is no justification for having any limit and, as more and more of our people pass from being self-employed into the category of being employed by others it becomes easier to insure our population.  It is now acknowledged that it is much easier to have everyone within the insurance net.  In that situation we accept as some measure of improvement the Minister's proposal but we cannot allow the occasion to pass without protesting about the Government delay in giving effect to the overhaul so vitally required in our social insurance code.  If the Government do not do it there will be that kind of tragic situation of which we are all too well aware, such as has occurred in the past and is still occurring in which people drift away from insurance, even from making the voluntary contributions in relation to widows' and orphans' pensions and then with the inevitable experience of mankind in some cases, meet with terrible family tragedy.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of having social insurance is to organise our society to protect people against that kind of situation, against human frailty and the tragedies that arise out of forgetfulness, out of man's natural optimism <Col N="425" /> in thinking that tragedy will not come his way but is the experience of others. That can be avoided by having an adequate social insurance system.  It is not good enough today to be limiting this to what is estimated to be the equivalent of £1,200 six years ago.  The ceiling must be removed once and for all.  We regret the Minister had not some proposal of that kind today and if he had not, at least he could have gone to the figure of £2,000, which Deputy Barry mentioned.  That might have led us to a situation where in three years time we would not be in the state of distress in which we have been for the past four or five years when, instead of increasing the limit, we left the matter in abeyance.</P>
    <P>The Minister's excuse for this was that he was preparing more comprehensive proposals.  We now find the proposals are not before us.  We still have the old system and there is no political, economic or social indication that the Government will have any time in the foreseeable future for the necessary overhaul of our whole social outlook.  On that account, we accept the Minister's proposal with reluctance because it is not better and we hope this is the last time we shall try to patch the quilt and that it will not be too long before Dáil Éireann, with a different Government, is considering the sort of social revolution that is necessary if we are to have what we can well afford to have, a society in which all these calculable risks and inevitable experiences of mankind can be provided for.  We have all the necessary techniques and skills and it is high time that this was done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not think the decision of the Minister to raise the limit to £1,600 is good enough and we have just reason for saying so.  Already there are thousands of people who, over the years, have been deprived of social welfare benefits because at various times in their working lives they exceeded the limit and were forced to discontinue paying social welfare insurance. The other day I came across a case of a man who had been employed as a paperkeeper in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  He did an examination at one stage and went <Col N="426" /> over the maximum and was told he could not continue paying social welfare insurance.  After some years, the limit was increased and he was back on social welfare insurance.  This man retired in 1968 and he has spent three years writing to the Department trying to have his case examined sympathetically by the Minister.  He was deprived of contributory old age pension, not through any fault of his, but because on so many occasions in his working life he went over the maximum.  In years to come we shall see people deprived of normal contributory old age pensions because the Minister is setting a ceiling on the upper salary limit at which people must pay social welfare insurance contributions.  We have got to consider what will happen to those people outside the limit who will subsequently be deprived of contributory old age pensions.</P>
      <P>I have brought to the Minister's attention the case of a man working in CIE who was promoted, but as a result of his promotion he was brought outside the limit.  This means he is now getting less than his colleagues who were not promoted and remained inside the limit.  It is hard for a man who worked hard and got promotion to find himself at a disadvantage compared with his colleagues.  This is what happens when ceilings are fixed.</P>
      <P>There are too few people paying social welfare contributions.  The net should be spread right across the board and even people earning £3,000 should be included.  If they do not want to avail of social welfare benefits and prefer to pay for private medical services let them do so but everyone should pay social welfare contributions the same as they do in England.  They do not have to collect the benefits, but if we made them pay we would be able to provide more for the disabled, old age pensioners, widows and unemployed persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot expect to obtain more money if we do not enlarge the numbers paying.  A ceiling of £1,600 at today's rate of inflation is not sufficient. If we made everyone contribute the Minister would not have to go to the Minister for Finance demanding extra for those in need of it.  Although the Labour Party are accepting this <Col N="427" /> new limit we do not believe it is sufficient. The only answer to the problem is not to fix an upper limit and until that is done we shall never have a proper social welfare service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>All that is happening here is that people who were allowed to fall out of the scheme are being brought back in.  They fell out of the scheme because their wages had been increased to cope with increasing inflation even though their real standard of living has not risen.  We are not making any extension or improvement; we are merely retrieving the situation.</P>
      <P>Since 1966 30,000 people have gone out of the social insurance net because their wages have risen above the limit of £1,200 to compensate them for the increasing cost of living.  Within a few months some of the people we are now bringing back will go out again because their incomes will rise above the £1,600 limit.  The Government waited too long before increasing the limit. This is something which should be reviewed regularly.  I share the views of other Members of the House who think that £1,600 is inadequate; a figure of £2,000 would make a real extension to the scheme.  The Government took a long time to make this decision.  Early last session I had questions about it, and I am sure other Deputies had as well, because pressures were being brought on me to bring this forward. The Minister has shown a marked reluctance to take a decision on this question and I cannot understand why.  It was quite evident a decision was going to be taken, yet no actual decision was made.  I should like to know the reason for the delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been talk in the air about introducing a system of pay related unemployment and disability benefits with pay related contributions.  Mention was made of this in the Third Programme for Economic Expansion published in 1969 and at that time the Minister was asked by the Cabinet to prepare legislation to provide for a scheme of pay related unemployment and disability benefits.  How far have the Minister's preparations gone in this regard?  Why are we not at this stage having a fundamental reappraisal <Col N="428" /> of the whole situation instead of this palliative measure?  Deputy Geoghegan, the Parliamentary Secretary, got very good milage in the <i>Irish Press</i> when he adverted to the introduction of a pay related contributions and benefits. I should like to know why they are not appearing before the House today instead of this inadequate measure which will not mean a real increase in coverage.  It is really only patching up what inflation has done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my disappointment at the inadequate order which the Minister has brought before the House.  The provision does not mean any significant improvement in the general coverage of our social security system.  It means that some thousands are being brought back again into social insurance coverage. That can hardly be regarded as a major improvement.  In 1965, the limit was raised from £800 to £1,200.  Since then wages and salaries have rocketed.  In 1964, we had the ninth round of wage and salary increases, an increase of 12 per cent with a minimum of £50 per annum.  In 1966, we had the tenth round which averaged £50 per annum. In 1968, we had the eleventh round which averaged £75 per annum.  In 1969-70, we had the twelfth round; one could add £200 per annum generally for that increase.  The thirteenth round, 1971, gives an initial £100 per annum.  Since the date of the last adjustment there have been, at a conservative estimate, increases of the order of £500.  The figure therefore should have gone up to £1,700 in order to retain its current applicability.  This figure of £1,600 is quite out of balance. It is most inadequate and it will deprive many, many thousands of workers of coverage, assuming it will be some considerable time before the limit will be raised again.  Not only does it barely bring back into coverage those previously covered and now out of benefit but it fails to take cognisance of the increases in wages and salaries which might reasonably be anticipated in the first half of the 'Seventies.  This is a retrograde step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of departmental estimates there are some 5,000 wage and salary earners in the income <Col N="429" /> bracket £1,600 to £1,800 eligible for insurance. They are now out.  If one takes the modest salary of £1,800 to £2,000 another 4,000 wage and salary earners are excluded.  Between £2,000 and £2,500 there are another 5,000 who could be brought within the scope of social insurance.  On the basis of estimates from the Department of Social Welfare there are 14,000 persons between £1,600 and £2,500 a year who could have been brought within the scope of social insurance.  This large number of middle income group families will now be denied the benefit of compulsory insurance.  Admittedly, it is open to anybody to become a voluntary contributor.  When I went over the limit I became a voluntary contributor and, should I drop dead, my widow would get a contributory. pension.  I am covered for other benefits as well.  Unfortunately many people do not do this.  I think only 5,000, or thereabouts, have opted for voluntary insurance.</P>
    <P>This decision of the Government exposes the failure by the Government to introduce in the early 'Seventies the major transformation necessary in our social insurance system.  Deputy Bruton has quite rightly pointed out that we must bring into operation a wage and salary related system of contribution rates and of general benefits.  That is the only way we can get rid of this quite dreadful position.  I would urge the Minister to go with all haste to the Cabinet and there insist that all employees, irrespective of income, are brought within the scope of the social insurance compulsory system.  Unless we do that there is little hope for a radical reform of the system.  I am quite convinced that, despite the difficulties with regard to social insurance, the health services, housing grants and so on, both the Minister and the Minister for Health will be able to devise an adequate and effective integrated system.</P>
    <P>I have no option but to accept the order, and I accept it subject to these criticisms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am generally satisfied with the acceptance of this order.  I am not disappointed when Deputies say the <Col N="430" /> limit should have been higher.  I should have liked to have made it higher.  I hope to abolish the limit altogether. Deputies are not so naive that they do not know there are other things involved. One Deputy referred to the delay in making the change.  There was delay because other things are involved. Adjustment of the limit is always a problem.  One has to take into consideration income limits in relation to health benefits, scholarships under the Department of Education, and so on. These are all based on the social insurance limit.  No doubt the problem will be overcome.</P>
      <P>I want to thank the House for discussing this in such a responsible manner. A pay related scheme is making progress.  It is being drafted.  Every year when the Budget is introduced the Department of Social Welfare has to deal with a new set of changes.  Allowance must be made for this.  As I say, progress is being made in regard to a pay related scheme.  The scheme has been approved.  Indeed, it got my blessing when I was in the Department of Social Welfare on a previous occasion.  Progress will be as rapid as possible.  I hope that the progress will be as rapid as possible.  On a previous occasion when I mentioned the increase in this limit, I said that I hoped to abolish the limit completely.  We may have incorrect ideas about the number the abolition of the limit will bring in If we do not bring in local government employees and civil servants generally, the abolition of the limit will bring in 30,000 people fewer so that there are not many on the fringe now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will make a statement on the serious public criticisms made recently about the conditions of Our Lady's Hospital, Cork; if he is aware of the statements (details supplied) of the clinical director of psychiatry of the Eastern Health Board and of the chairman of the Psychiatrists Group of the IMA that this hospital is a human warehouse containing hundreds of forgotten souls in conditions which could be described as anti-therapeutic; and if he will state the number of patients in each ward, the number of professional staff employed and the current proposals, if any, to radically improve the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen Press reports of the statements made by the psychiatrist referred to.  I presume the other main criticism the Deputy has in mind was that made by the Reverend Director of the UCC Education Centre in Limerick.</P>
      <P>May I say that I deplore these sensational and grossly exaggerated statements which give a distorted picture of the situation, probably cause considerable distress and worry to the relatives and friends of patients in mental hospitals, discourage people from seeking early treatment and do nothing to advance the cause of psychiatry&mdash;on the contrary, bring psychiatry into disrepute.  In addition, they inhibit the recruitment of new staff and are demoralising to the existing staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary responsibility for conditions in Our Lady's Hospital now rests with the Southern Health Board &mdash;it rested with Cork Health Authority until the 1st instant.  The statement made, if they gave a fair picture of the position, would constitute a most serious reflection on these authorities and their staffs, on a most active local Mental Welfare Association and, of course, on me as Minister.  I presume however, that the Deputy has seen the statement made on 19th instant by the Chief Executive Officer of the Southern <Col N="432" /> Health Board, who was formerly Manager to Cork Health Authority. This statement puts the criticisms into reasonable perspective.</P>
    <P>The main attack made was on St. Kevin's Unit.  It was, of course, safe to criticise conditions in this unit as it had already been accepted by Cork Health Authority, long before these criticisms were made, that considerable improvements in this unit were necessary.  Final plans for these improvements were approved by me in May, 1970, and the present position is that tenders for work costing £200,000 have been accepted and the contractors are actually on the site.  No mention of these and other improvements was made in the criticisms.</P>
    <P>Apart from the reconstruction of St. Kevin's Unit a new admission and treatment unit was provided at Our Lady's Hospital in 1962.  St. Brigid's Unit was reconstructed in 1968 and a scheme costing £80,000 is nearing completion on St. Patrick's and St. Ita's buildings.</P>
    <P>In addition to these works an acute psychiatric treatment unit was opened at Skibbereen a few years back.  Use has been made of Sarsfield Court since 1969 and three units catering for about 100 patients are at present in use there. A new Chair of Psychiatry has been created in University College, Cork, and, pending the provision of the new professorial psychiatric unit, which is part of the plans for the new Regional Hospital in Cork, the new Professor, who will also hold the office of Clinical Director in the psychiatric services of the Southern Health Board, has been allocated a unit at Sarsfield Court. These developments are to permit the provision of more active treatments so that the numbers requiring long-term care will be considerably reduced.</P>
    <P>Details regarding the number of patients in each ward and regarding the professional staff employed at Our Lady's Hospital are in the form of a tabular statement which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the charge was that the conditions in this human warehouse were anti-therapeutic and that these conditions are found in many similar hospitals throughout <Col N="434" /> Ireland?  Is it not true that recommendations for the improvement of conditions in these hospitals were made as far back as 1966, that the staff-patient ratio in a number of these hospitals has not changed appreciably and that the paramedical staff essential for serious therapy in a hospital of this kind have not been recruited?  The morale of the nursing staff in this particular hospital in Cork is very low; and the Minister is aware of this fact because they have made it clear to him. It is a fact that these institutions are so organised that many people are living in what are, in effect, benevolent jails with indeterminate and sometimes life sentences, where no crime whatever has been committed.  In these circumstances, is the Minister and his Department not thoroughly ashamed of the fact that there are so many of these enormous institutions in which unfortunate people are held prisoner, frequently for life?</P>

      <Col N="437" /> The Deputy can take it that common access to our fishery waters is not acceptable to us because it is damaging. It is not acceptable to Norway or Britain and the three countries to date have had talks of a technical nature as to the effect on us, if the Communities enlarge, of this regulation. We are now seeking to have further discussions about it.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say why he thinks the time is not yet ripe?  Am I not right in thinking that we have now submitted our position on all other matters and are awaiting the Community's response to our proposals? Why is he holding back our proposals on this matter?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have to accept that there is a timing in negotiations.  We cannot have people reading in the papers what we are going to do.  If the Deputy will undertake to treat in confidence what I tell him, I will meet him privately and tell him, but I do not intend to have published everything we are going to do when we are in a very serious negotiating position.  This is not an academic exercise on which you give a lecture.  This is an actual negotiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I welcome the Minister's offer which I am happy to accept.  My point was not that we are not being told what the proposals are&mdash;that is a separate issue. I wanted to understand why the Minister felt that when we have put forward our proposals on other matters we should not yet do so on this.  There may well be good reasons for it and I should like to hear them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will remember that the opening of the negotiations with the applicants was made on the basis that the applicant countries would accept the Treaty of Rome and the decisions arising from it.  Without that there would not be any negotiations. After the negotiations commenced, this regulation was introduced as a decision arising out of the Treaty of Rome and as such would be regarded by the Community as something that is not <Col N="438" /> negotiable.  We see it differently for the reason that it came in after the negotiations had started and because of its effect.  I think the Deputy knows quite well that the applicant countries would have a much bigger share of fisheries in an enlarged Community than the others would have.  At least two of the other applicants see it the same way, so I regard this matter as separate.  By their judgment it is not negotiable.  By our judgment it is something with a very marked effect on an important part of our economy and a social effect on an important section of our community.  We should have discussions about it.  It is different from the others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussions and we intend to keep in contact but the negotiations are separate for separate treaties.  There will be multilateral discussions on certain points on which all are affected.  It is important that it should be well known that this regulation is unacceptable not only in Ireland but in Norway and in Britain as well.  There is a common position created by its existence.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this approach of ours is causing some concern?  It is, of course, true that this matter may not arise directly in the negotiations at this moment but the Minister is surely aware that one member of the Commission at a meeting in Dublin suggested the desirability of multilateral discussions on this matter and that an Irish initiative would be welcome.  Does the Minister not agree that there is some concern among these countries as to whether we are really interested in this aspect of the whole problem of making the Community democratic? Does he not feel that it would be useful at this stage for this House to know what the Government's views are?  Are they in favour of directly elected institutions and will they propose that at a later stage of these negotiations?</P>

I am arranging to have a note circulated to Members of the House setting forth these views as presented to the Communities.  The question of regional policy will be the subject of further discussions in the negotiations in the context of the Community proposals on economic and monetary union.

      <P>The Deputy should be aware that it is expected that each nation will develop its own regional policies and that the Community's interest is to co-ordinate and help those policies.  There is a draft, which I expect <Col N="442" /> will be adopted, from the Commission suggesting that there should be an inspection of these policies of member States and if they fit in largely with what the Community want they will be aided out of Community funds. We should be quite clear that we are going ahead with our own regional policies and can expect support from the Community in so far as they fit into the Community plan.  The Community regional policy has not been very far developed to date but it is moving faster now since the question of monetary union was raised and creates new problems.</P>

I will be giving the House full details of the company's position when the Bill is being given its Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I have seen the article to which the Deputy refers.  The principal point made in the article is that the reason for the slow rate of growth experienced in 1970 is the loss of competitiveness. This loss of competitiveness has in <Col N="449" /> large measure been caused by domestically generated cost increases of an inflationary nature which have had the added effect of stimulating imports. There is no evidence that the effect of the tariff reductions on the growth rate and the balance of payments has been other than marginal.</P>

      <P>I have gone into this so many times that I have it off almost by heart.  I explained on many occasions to the Deputy that when consideration was being given to a number of school areas in the country we found that there were certain general considerations as well as the particular considerations pertaining to the various districts in which the schools were situated and we felt that some of these general considerations could be overcome, because of the fact that all of the schools concerned were Catholic schools, through discussions with the Catholic hierarchy.  In relation to their not being sent to parent school organisations, apart from a small number of <i>ad hoc</i> committees, I do not know of any parent school organisations which are purely and formally representative.  This matter of parent teacher relations should be dealt with with very considerable care. There are very good relations building up at present between parents and teachers particularly in the post-primary schools, on an informal basis.  Quite recently I advocated that efforts should be made to build up a somewhat similar situation in regard to primary schools.</P>

      <P>What significance are we to attach to the order of priority shown by these dates of consulting first the hierarchy, then the managers, then the teachers and never the parents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place the question arose in relation to particular schools and I referred it to the Hierarchy because of that.  The fact was that, of course, the vocational school system would also be involved and I got in touch with the IVEA in relation to schools under their control.  I then felt that it was important that we should have discussions with the teachers who are teaching in these schools and, as I said, there were no formal parent school organisations which I knew of, but even if there were I would want to know how they come about, what, in fact, they represented, and so on.  Basically, it should be remembered that it is doubtful if a parent is entitled to speak for any child other than his own.  At the same time, I want again to stress that I am very strongly in favour of close liaison between the parents and the schools and as I say this is growing up in a very natural way throughout the country and we should leave it at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to assess the effect of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement on imports.  Goods directly affected by the agreement are those on which protection is being removed, and statistics of imports of those goods are not separately kept. An estimate has been made, however, of the imports of those goods since 1965-66.  It shows that imports from the United Kingdom rose in value terms from £95 million in 1965-66 to £171 million in 1969-70, an increase of 80 per cent; in the same period imports of goods of the same kind in value terms from other sources rose from £55 million to £131 million an increase of 138 per cent.  In the circumstances it is clear that the operation of the Free Trade Area Agreement is only one of the factors affecting imports from the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>I would like to impress upon the Minister that this village is a very isolated one and there are very, very few private telephones in the area.  It is very difficult for the local people to make telephone calls after six o'clock in the evening to contact a doctor or a veterinary surgeon. Would the Minister in the near future have a telephone kiosk erected there?</P>

      <P>The call office telephone in Brandon sub-office is available during normal office hours and available at all times in emergencies. It is used to a very slight extent.  For the Deputy's information, about two calls per day are made on average. Because it is in a tourist area we will probably have another look at the matter at the end of the tourist season.</P>
