      <P>Thanks for the help.  I knew the Deputy would be helpful.  Last night, after the Adjournment, I was asked to seek an assurance from the Minister that those men would be able to compete in Common Market conditions.  I hope the Minister will be able to give me that assurance. Last night I said that some of the best farmers in Europe are in County Dublin.  In County Dublin as well we have some of the smallest, most uneconomic holdings in Ireland, particularly in south County Dublin.  I know it is difficult for any Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, even if he were St. Peter himself, to look after every uneconomic holder in Ireland and to give him a decent standard of living.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There are numberous small holdings in places like Glencullen, Bohernabreena and elsewhere. The people there would not be able to carry on if they had not got sidelines, as many of them have.  We have dealt with the 12 western counties.  I came from one of them years ago on a single ticket and I was never able to afford <Col N="835" /> to get a ticket back.  I do not like the distinction sometimes made between small and middle-class farmers.  The distinction should be between the small farmers and the large farmers. Any Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has a big problem on his hands trying to help small farmers.  We all know how, when there were no children's allowances or widows' and orphans' pensions, or grants of any kind, those people made a living. Last night I paid a tribute to those small farmers who survived through co-operation.</P>
      <P>I heard people speaking about the old Congested District Board which operated especially in the 12 western counties where there were uneconomic holdings due to the fact that Cromwell and his associates drove all the people from the good land to the mountains and created small uneconomic holdings.  Some of them had to go to America, Australia, England and various other countries and sent home money to their families and friends.  That is how they survived in those days and they were a great race of people to survive.</P>
      <P>In my childhood days people lived off the land.  That has gone to a great degree.  A number of small farmers do not even keep a hen or a pig today. They do not rear pigs or keep fowl. Years ago every small farmer, every cottier and every labourer kept a few pigs.  I am sorry that that trend has gone because it was good for the country.  Today a number of small farmers do not even grow a head of cabbage.  Their fathers and grandfathers before them had very nice gardens of cabbage and vegetables of all kinds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that in every county a special committee should be set up under a chairman nominated by the Minister consisting of officers of the county committees of agriculture, county engineers and men of that type.  I remember older men than I speaking of the good work that was done by the old Congested District Board.  These committees should be co-ordinating committees under the auspices of the Minister and his <Col N="836" /> Department.  They should report each year on roads which need to be repaired and on small drains that need to be cleaned.  During the winter season uneconomic holders could work on these roads and rivers and drains. These jobs are very essential in rural Ireland and this work can only be carried out by a co-ordinated effort.</P>
    <P>I compliment the farming organisations on what they are trying to do for the farmers as a whole.  They are fighting for better conditions for farmers. The uneconomic holder cannot live on the land.  But for the fact that he gets social welfare benefits he would not be there at all.  That is not sufficient. Enough money is given for land reclamation to clean all the scrub land we have all over Ireland.  People have not the initiative to apply to have their land drained and cleaned of trees and furze.  The land reclamation scheme is a wonderful scheme and people should avail of it.  A number of small farmers have been doing this work themselves and then getting the money for it.  We have too much scrub land and there are many derelict holdings to be seen.</P>
    <P>I spent a week in Holland recently. There is no such thing as a wide headland in Holland and there is no such thing as any scrub land or furze or rocks.  The country is very level and it is tilled to the very roadside.  Holland has a population of over 30 million and it is approximately the size of Munster.  We are concerned about every section of our people irrespective of class or creed.  I would be glad, and so would the Minister, if we could put £500 million into agriculture to raise the standard of living of that section of our people.  It is bad to have one section almost on the breadline.</P>
    <P>On these committees which I suggest there should be clergymen of all denominations taking part in this great economic revival.  The Minister cannot work miracles.  The people will have to do something themselves.  I should like also to compliment Fr. McDyer.  He is trying to do a lot for his people.  He is trying to help them economically as well as spiritually.  He is trying to give them the economic uplift which they need so badly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> When these committees are appointed they should ask the Department for so much money to do so much work in their districts.  They should itemise the work as they go along and indicate to the Department which work is the more pressing.  The rural improvements schemes and the other small schemes have done a great deal of good.  Vegetables go down from Dublin to some towns in the West of Ireland.  In my childhood days the farmers supplied vegetables to their own districts.  It is a reflection on our country that they are not doing that today.  In this connection we must try to get our people back to where they were in their grandfathers' day.  They had initiative then and they did a lot for themselves.</P>
    <P>The grants given for reconstruction of outhouses and other similar work were a wonderful asset to our people.  Grants given for improving land, when they were availed of, were also a wonderful asset.  There should be a co-ordinating committee in each county consisting of priests, bishops and all laymen of goodwill.  Their aim should be to make their county one of the best in the Thirty-two Counties. I know it would take money to do that but it would be money well spent. We should also try to provide viable holdings of at least 50 acres.  Here and there individuals have made a living on very small holdings but they had the initiative to do the work which was essential.  The county committees of agriculture, the county councils, voluntary bodies, Macra na Feirme and all the farmers' organisations should consider my suggestion. So much money should be allocated to each county to be spent on priority schemes.</P>
    <P>The people who are on the dole could be given a good wage for doing work in the wintertime.  I was always interested in seeing that people were properly paid because, for one thing, production will be higher.  In that way we help the small farmers.  In the old days, on the uneconomic holdings, there was a great spirit of co-operation. It would be a good thing if nine or ten farmers would join together and help one another.  Such co-operation will be even more necessary if we <Col N="838" /> enter the EEC.  In relation to co-operative firms, there is at least one in North Dublin which is suffering from growing pains.  Strange to say, in the days of adversity people co-operated more than they do today.  I should like to see that co-operation being revived in each county rather than on a regional basis.  If each county were allowed so much money each year to do important work like drainage, roads and so on during the winter months, say, from October to February, we would be doing something worthwhile. It should be the responsibility of the local council, the county committees of agriculture, the priests and bishops and all others concerned to start this great revival that is so necessary for the wellbeing of our country.</P>
    <P>When I was chairman of the Dublin County Council we were, on a few occasions, confronted with the problem of about 400 families living off laneways which we could not take over because we were spending only a few thousand pounds on doing these laneways. I suggested to our council that, over a period of years, a sum of £100,000 should be raised to do the laneways on a priority basis.  We could not get the £100,000 at the time, but we decided to do the work out of revenue over a period of six or seven years, and the people are satisfied with the result.</P>
    <P>If one wants an example of co-operation one thinks of the wonderful job done by the people of Holland in reclaiming thousands and thousands of acres of land from the North Sea and developing it.  These people had a great struggle for existence and it is an inspiration to see how they survived. I should like to see our country solving its problems in the same spirit of co-operation.  When you visit another country on a delegation people say you have been on a holiday. Any time I have made visits to other countries it has been an education in itself to see how other people overcome their problems.  I know that a number of countries like Holland have mineral resources, but we ourselves have come a long way and have made the most of our resources.  There have been great developments in agriculture and in education, for instance, in the <Col N="839" /> training of our technical advisers and young farmers.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has a most responsible position because there are so many people depending on him. There are many people living on small farms who could be helped if they were given some part-time employment.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that eventually this country will be able to take its place in the EEC and compete with other countries.  It is ridiculous to see written on the walls in certain parts of this city and county the slogan &ldquo;No EEC&rdquo;.  The people responsible for that do not want any government in this country.  They are anarchists.  Anyone who wants this country to make progress should come before the public and try to be elected to this House.</P>
    <P>Last night I complimented the Minister on providing £105 million for the farmers in the Estimate this year.  The amount for poultry has increased considerably from £15 million to £17 million. They will tell you, in certain parts of the country, that the fox will not leave them with a hen.  In my young days we went after the fox to see that he did not take anything and that he would not be in the district at all, but today nobody is doing that.  In my constituency there are people with 10,000, 12,000 and 15,000 hens.  The number of small producers is declining. The same thing applies to pig producing, and this is a pity.  In regard to the beef incentive scheme, £4.8 million was given out to 51,000 landowners which shows they were taking advantage of it, helping the country as well as themselves.  Exports of slaughtered cattle rose to 576,000 compared with 530,000 in 1970, showing that we are progressing and that we had a very good year.  Agricultural output increased by 2.6 per cent; cattle increased by 176,000 over 1970.  Cattle exports in 1971 numbered 550,000 compared with 473,000 in the previous year.  All these things are good omens for the country and it is a great pleasure to read of them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has many up-to-date methods of marketing our exports.  I should like to hear those who are <Col N="840" /> criticising offer some advice as to how we could improve our marketing arrangements for agricultural products. They should advise Deputies of or send a memo to the Minister setting out their suggestions.  Constructive criticism is welcomed by every intelligent person; it is the lifeblood of any democratic society but nobody has a cure for all ills.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in the amount of money given for the farm buildings scheme and water supplies. The farm building scheme has been a great boon to farmers in all parts of the country.  Had I my way I should like to see piped water supplied to every farm in Ireland.  Unfortunately, we cannot provide it for all human beings yet.  Pure piped water is the best thing any cattle or any human beings could have.  I hate to see cattle drinking water from a stagnant stream or pond.  You cannot have healthy cattle if they have to drink dirty water. Many water schemes, some costing millions of pounds, have been promoted in County Dublin in the last few years.  Good water supplies are essential and will pay well in the long run by giving us healthy cattle which will in turn help our economy.  It is impossible for cattle to avoid murrain and other diseases if they have to drink contaminated water.  We depend very much on our cattle exports.</P>
    <P>The limestone, nitrogen phosphate and potash schemes have been a wonderful benefit and, by increasing production, they have helped the national economy.  They are costly, but I should like to see farmers avail themselves of them more and more.  If one side of our economy suffers economically the nation cannot do well.  Therefore, we must do all we can to raise the standard in every section.  We are all a family and, if one member is not doing well, the others are worried. That is how we must look upon every citizen of this State.  They may have different political views and may differ from us in other ways.  It is well we are not all the same; if we all thought on the same lines we could not be as progressive.  Opposition stimulates. I wish to stress these points strongly.</P>
    <P>We have a big population of sheep <Col N="841" /> and lambs in County Dublin.  While the Minister and the Department have helped a great deal in trying to get markets, and while the housewife is still paying as much for mutton, the price of sheep has fallen considerably. A number of my constituents are deeply concerned about this; they feel the situation should be better.  I do not know what the position will be when we go into the Common Market. When France bought our mutton it was a great help, and if they continued their custom we would not be in the present position.  However, they only buy when they need our mutton and lamb.  One cannot expect them to do otherwise.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about people leaving the land but that is happening in every country because people always want better conditions and wages.  Anybody who leaves a home where there is a poor living, especially on the land, will take the first job that offers and you can do nothing about it.  The same applies everywhere. Immediately after the war about three-fifths of the French population got a living from the land; today the figure is, I believe, less than 50 per cent. This shows the trend, The same applies to England and other countries. Modern machinery and methods have eliminated many farm workers.  Perhaps some day, if the Minister for Agriculture could strike oil, we could live on our mineral resources as eastern countries especially have done. If it had not been for their oil resources their standard of living in these countries would be very low. When you visit countries such as Iran you can see how the oil supplies have affected living standards.  I had the pleasure of visiting some of these countries some years ago.  However, these are things one can only wish for. We have come a long way in the past nine or ten years and, even if I repeat it for the tenth time, we have come a long way since we got our freedom in the Twenty-six Counties.  It was said by the then British Premier: &ldquo;We have given them the agricultural South; they will never be able to make it economic.&rdquo;  We had no subsidies and we got no money from any other <Col N="842" /> country.  We had to rely on our own resources and we had to carry on.</P>
    <P>It is hard to get markets abroad for creamery milk and powdered milk products and we have to pay heavy subsidies to help our people.  Over £30 million was spent on this.  I understand an increase has been announced in the price of milk and this is very welcome. Every year more and more of the dairy farmers in County Dublin are going into business.  Much of their land is being bought up because the city is creeping out further every year.</P>
    <P>The sheep subsidy is very much appreciated.  We find that the price of wool has gone down very much because of the many other synthetic products which are now on the market. However, that is part of modern society and we have got to change with it. Wool meant a good deal to our people years ago but now they are not getting so much for it.  The committee dealing with the production and sale of wool are doing a very good job under very adverse circumstances.  Even the great wool markets of Australia are suffering the same reaction as we are.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Pat Murphy referred to animal diseases last night.  He felt the bovine TB scheme was finished and that we were finished for all time with bovine disease.  We had the same position when we built sanatoria and we thought we were finished with TB but we found that that disease still returned.  We will find the same in regard to bovine TB and also in relation to brucellosis.  The Minister, in his speech, referred to the free areas of Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Sligo where testing is continuing. I have met people on holidays who said they got brucellosis from drinking milk and that they were treated in hospital for it.  I suppose years ago if people got this disease they did not know what it was.</P>
    <P>Liver fluke is another disease which causes a lot of damage.  Anything which can be done by our veterinary surgeons to help us get rid of this disease is very welcome.  The warble fly scheme is a scheme which should not have been shelved.  I visited a leather factory recently and saw hides which were not treated for warble fly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> The hides were covered with holes and this looked very bad.  Fowl pest is something which is very hard to control because we have wild birds coming in from other countries who will bring the disease in with them.  However, we must do our best to control this disease among our own fowl.</P>
    <P>Our wheat acreage has dropped from 234,000 acres in 1970 to 226,000 acres this year.  Feeding barley increased by almost 12 per cent this year and malting barley is up by 10 per cent this year.  These things will help our economy.  I welcome the glasshouse scheme because we have hundreds of acres under glass in County Dublin. I must say, in dealing with the Minister's Department, as far as the glasshouse scheme is concerned, the officials of the Department have been very helpful.  I have made representations to them for my constituents in County Dublin on many occasions.  Our advisory services are very helpful to tomato growers.  Modern standards of research are very helpful to all those people.  A sum of £50,000 is being provided for mushroom units.  There was a good export trade in mushrooms from County Dublin during the past year.  This crop is very subject to disease and there can be great losses in growing it.</P>
    <P>The small farm incentive bonus scheme is also very welcome to our farmers.  All those schemes encourage our small farmers to take pride in their work and try to do better in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;pollution&rdquo; seems to be in everybody's mind at the present time.  I believe the day is coming in County Dublin when the first thing we are told, if we want to start any scheme, is that we will pollute our waters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

      <P>Has the Minister for Agriculture any responsibility for this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but this has been referred to.  The Minister has a certain responsibility in this regard because if some farmers become a bit careless and use the river to get rid of bad crops it becomes polluted.  Some farmers get rid of farm manure and <Col N="844" /> rotten turnips in rivers flowing through their land so, in that way, pollution comes under the Minister's Department. I would like the Minister to consider anything he can do to prevent our farmers from polluting our rivers in that way.</P>
      <P>I have delayed the House considerably. This is a very important debate. We will discuss fisheries on a later occasion.  We have made great progress in this regard also.  A great deal has been done for the fishery industry of our country.  The Department of Agriculture is concerned with the lives of our people.  People in cities like Dublin are affected by agricultural policies.  Wonderful advances have been made with regard to milk production and other agricultural products consumed by human beings.  I hope that the advances with regard to cleanliness will continue.  We do not want to be regarded as the dirty Irish. We should be able to conduct our affairs as well as other countries can. Let us have the serenity to accept things which we cannot change and the courage to change things we can change, and the wisdom to know the difference between them.  I must congratulate the Minister and the Department on doing so well.  Every Minister for Agriculture we have had has done well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate deals with the activities of the Department of State which is closely connected with an aspect of our national life which can rightly be called the most important sector of our economy.  I do not propose to make a wideranging speech because my colleague, Deputy Creed, has done so in an effective and admirable way as befitting a man who has close associations with agriculture and who is a practical and successful farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy M P. Murphy commenting on the fact that it was difficult for Opposition Deputies to make a proper assessment of the performance of any Department, by reason of the fact that we have no research facilities, and the Minister's brief is only available when he stands up to speak.  Perhaps I might add my voice to the appeal for some new type <Col N="845" /> of facilities which would enable Opposition Deputies to carry out research into the various aspects of the Departments on which they are spokesmen.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate for the nation and particularly tragic for the farming community that at this moment of time when we are contemplating taking the most momentous step in our history&mdash;entry to the EEC&mdash;that we should have, not merely a bad Government, but a Government with the worst agricultural record of any government in Western Europe, particularly over the past one and a half decades.  When one looks at the history of the Fianna Fáil agricultural policy since 1957, at the First, Second and Third Programmes for Economic Expansion, and particularly at the disastrous results following the blundering ineffectiveness of the Fianna Fáil Government in relation to agricultural planning one feels disheartened. There is no doubt whatever that Irish agriculture would have that opportunity within the context of the European Economic Community, provided we had taken steps over the past decade to gear up our agricultural industry to its maximum potential in a way which would mean that we could grasp all the opportunities presenting themselves within that Community. Instead, we find that we are contemplating entry to EEC when the morale of the agricultural industry is at its lowest ebb for a long time.  Irish agriculture is suffering today from a series of blunders and of haphazard stop-gap measures dictated, in most cases, by the political expediency which has characterised Fianna Fáil agricultural policy, particularly in the last 15 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the urgency of adapting our processing and marketing organisations to enable us to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the Common Market.  It is a pity that this idea did not occur to the Fianna Fáil Government ten years ago and that the present Minister's predecessors did not realise that we had to adapt our processing and marketing organisations towards that end.  Now, at the 11th hour, in typical Fianna Fáil fashion, they have <Col N="846" /> realised that we are entering the EEC and, instead of having drawn up realistic plans over the last decade, we now find emergency action being taken by the Government.  The Fianna Fáil Government since 1957 have the worst record of any government in Western Europe in relation to agricultural planning and policy.  I do not believe in making sweeping statements in the House without having some evidence to substantiate the allegations I make.</P>
    <P>I propose to have a look at the dairy industry not merely because it is the most important industry in my constituency but also because it is the foundation and keystone of our whole agricultural industry.  It is an industry which makes a vital and important contribution to the whole agricultural and national economy, as well as contributing extensively to our total export business.  The dairy industry is the foundation of the cattle industry. Without it we cannot have cattle, and, if we have not cows, we cannot have calves.  What has been done by the Government to prepare the industry for entry to the EEC?  In the Second Programme for Economic Expansion we had an all-out effort to encourage farmers to engage in milk production. For a period of four or five years in the 1960s every effort was made and every inducement given to encourage farmers to keep more cows and to increase milk production.</P>
    <P>There was an outstanding response by the farmers to that appeal.  In order to increase their yield they went to the limit of their creditworthiness so that they could erect modern cow byres, install the most modern milking equipment and introduce the cow cubicle system.  They adopted new and more intensive grass land production methods.  All of this was done at considerable expense and, in 99 per cent of cases, the extensions and improvements were carried out on borrowed capital.  The farmers did all this because they took the Government's appeal to increase milk production at its face value and they assumed that they could bank on a guaranteed return for their efforts and expenditure and that there would be no sudden change of policy on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="847" /> During those four or five years our dairy farmers proved themselves to be as efficient and as modern as any farmers in western Europe.  Milk production soared but when the 530 million-gallon target was almost reached, the Government panicked and the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Blaney, announced that there was too much milk so there would have to be a cut-back in milk production. In other words, he was telling those farmers who had spent so much in modernising their farms that he was going to penalise them and, consequently, there was introduced the multi-tier payment system for milk delivered to creameries.  Indeed, I am proud of the fact that on the occasion on which that innovation was debated here, I said that such a system was the most retrograde step ever taken not merely by this Government but that it was without parallel in any country in western Europe.  At the time I said that if and when we entered the EEC, a multi-tier price system for milk would have to go and now the Minister has announced its abolition.</P>
    <P>What, then, has happened?  For the four or five years up to 1968-69 there was a mad rush on the part of the Government and on the part of the agricultural advisory service to persuade farmers to go into milk production. The result was so magnificent that the traditional 20-cow farmers geared themselves to carry up to 40 cows. Farmers tied financial millstones round their necks which will affect themselves and their families for many years to come.  After their efforts they were stabbed in the back by the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and there was a cut-back until the stage was reached where the bigger and more efficient farmers were to get prices for milk that were ridiculous and uneconomic.</P>
    <P>There was then a switch to beef and we saw the introduction of the beef incentive scheme.  At that time I recall saying here in the presence of the Minister that I would do everything in my power to persuade the dairy farmers in Limerick to remain in milk production and not to switch to beef.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="848" /> It was clear to me, then, as it is clear to the Minister now, that milk prices and prices for milk products would increase and that within the context of the EEC, the future for milk was very bright.  This has now come to pass.  The introduction of the multi-tier system did more to undermine the morale of the farmers and to shake their faith in any appeal made by the Government than has any step that has ever been taken by any Government in the history of the State.  Many dairy farmers suffered a drop of £1,000 per annum in their income.  Many of these were young and progressive farmers; they were men who wanted to have a stake in the future of agriculture. They had availed of the training and education provided by such voluntary organisations as Macra na Feirme. These were people who had the knowhow and the proper psychological outlook to enable them to derive the maximum from their land and they proved that.  Was it right to penalise them?  They have been subjected to the most outrageous injustice imaginable. The Department know only too well of the problems that were created by the multi-tier system.  If what the Minister is now proposing to do for the dairy industry in order to prepare it for EEC conditions had been done three or four years ago instead of the then Minister having introduced the multi-tier price system, I have no doubt that the dairying industry today would not merely be equipped to enter a European Economic Community but would be in a position, not merely to compete with the dairy industry in other countries of Europe, such as Denmark, but would beat them pricewise, qualitywise and quantitywise.</P>
    <P>The multi-tier system, which is now being abolished, is an outstanding monument to Fianna Fáil blundering, to Fianna Fáil stupidity, to Fianna Fáil lack of initiative.  It is the final proof that Fianna Fáil never had an agricultural policy in the past; they have none now, and they never will have one in the future.  What Irish agriculture needs today, and what it has needed in the past decade, is a Minister with the vision, the foresight, the initiative and the energy of a James <Col N="849" /> Dillon or a Paddy Hogan.  It is the tragedy of Irish agriculture that we have not had from Fianna Fáil this type of initiative, thinking or energy. We have had a series of stop-gap measures dictated by political expediency to suit a particular constituency at the time of a by-election or to suit a particular part of the country where the Fianna Fáil vote might be declining at the time of a general election.  I condemn, in the strongest words I can find, the scandalous neglect, the total lack of constructive thinking, the total lack of realistic planning, which has characterised the Fianna Fáil Government in relation to agriculture, and, particularly, in relation to the dairying industry since 1967.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries now talks about adapting our processing and marketing organisations to take full advantage of the opportunities in the Common Market. He talks about the rationalisation of the dairying industry and various other things.  Just as the Fianna Fáil Government stabbed the farmers of this country in the backs by introducing the multi-tier system, the question of rationalising the dairy industry, the question of amalgamation, has been with us for ten years now.  I recall, in 1962 or 1963, discussing this question here in this House.  In 1961 the Department of Agriculture set up a survey team to examine the dairy products industry.  The team was led by Mr. Byrne, if I remember correctly.  This team, consisting of three or four men, published an excellent report, making many recommendations in relation to the development of the dairying industry, discussing the question of rationalisation, of amalgamation and numerous other factors.  What did we find?  Having had that report the Government then commissioned a Doctor Knapp, one of the famous foreign consultants about whom we hear so much now.</P>
    <P>I suppose the next step in relation to amalgamation will be that the famous McKinseys will be brought in to do a survey of the dairying industry and to make recommendations regarding rationalisation.  Doctor Knapp came in here, a man with an international <Col N="850" /> reputation in the co-operative movement.  He spent one month here. He was never in Ireland before, I do not believe he has been here since and I do not want to see him in Ireland any more.  He drew up a plan and published another report.  That is the famous Knapp Report written after a one month tour of Ireland by an American.  He produced virtually nothing that the dairy survey team of the Department of Agriculture had not produced.  Then we had reports produced on both the departmental study and the Knapp Report by various organisations&mdash;excellent documents produced by the NFA, by the ICMSA, by the IAOS and by the Irish Creamery Managers' Association.</P>
    <P>Seven years ago we were in the position of knowing what rationalisation was necessary, how it could be proceeded with and what would be achieved by rationalisation.  Since then nothing has been done, because the Department of Agriculture could not make up its mind regarding rationalisation. The Department of Agriculture then set up a special departmental committee to examine all these reports, and I believe there has been a considerable amount of internal wrangling between the Department of Agriculture and other dairying interests.  The result is that we are very little further along the road, despite what the Minister has said, towards achieving the much needed rationalisation of the creamery industry than we were seven years ago. We have wasted seven years on futile surveys, on aimless discussion, on talking about the idea of rationalisation. Some experiments have been taking place of late.  These have been forced by circumstances, and are not the result of any effort of the Department of Agriculture.  They are not the result of any effort on the part of the Dairy Disposal Company or anybody else. These examples of rationalisation that have taken place and are now in the pipeline have been brought about by circumstances, mostly through pressure by the farming community.</P>
    <P>I pointed out here, on many occasions, that if the Department and the Minister and the Government were serious about the idea of rationalising <Col N="851" /> the creamery industry, the way to start was to put their own house in order first.  The place to start was with the Dairy Disposal Company's creameries. I have pointed out in many a debate here&mdash;I am blue in the face from saying it&mdash;that there is one outstanding example in my constituency, in the Knocklong group of creameries owned by the Dairy Disposal Company, where there is a central creamery and five or six auxiliaries.  Most of these little auxiliaries are totally uneconomic with an average of 40 to 50 suppliers. Here was a case which could have been made a pilot project in rationalisation. It was not done.  Now, as the result of long agitation, moves are afoot to have the Knocklong group of creameries acquired by Mitchelstown Co-operative Society Limited.  The reason why the farmers supplying the Dairy Disposal Company's Knocklong group of creameries wanted to go in with Mitchelstown was a very simple matter of economics.  In the one parish of Knocklong half of the farmers are supplying milk to the Dairy Disposal Company's creameries and the other half to the Mitchelstown Co-operative Society Limited.  For the past six, seven or ten years the farmers supplying the Mitchelstown Co-operative Society have been getting 6p per gallon more for their milk than their neighbours who are supplying the Dairy Disposal Company's Knocklong group.  It is an outrageous situation which reflects no credit on the Government or on the Department that there should be a difference of 6p a gallon in the price paid for milk to neighbouring farmers, all of whom have the same overheads, the same production costs, and so on, but because of an accident of geography the suppliers to the Knocklong group got 6p a gallon less than the suppliers to the Mitchelstown group.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record that the present Minister was the first of the recent Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries to see the light.  He gave the green light for the amalgamation of Knocklong and Mitchelstown.  I want to acknowledge his help in this matter and I would appeal to him to make it <Col N="852" /> absolutely sure that the merger will be signed, sealed and delivered as quickly as possible, certainly not later than the end of the year, so that the farmers in that area can look forward to receiving a realistic price for milk and will not suffer a loss of 6p per gallon.  That represents a colossal difference.  It amounts to £12 per cow per year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed spoke very well about the Dairy Disposal Company, particularly in relation to west Cork and west Clare.  The future of the Dairy Disposal Company cannot be considered in isolation from that of the creamery industry.  The Minister and the Department will now have to take firm steps to ensure that rationalisation proceeds on realistic lines and that it will not be haphazard.  There must be an overall plan of rationalisation for the creamery industry, a realistic, longterm plan, which will ensure that all units, whether co-operatively owned, privately owned or State-owned, in the case of the Dairy Disposal Company, will dovetail into that plan.  This is one of the biggest problems in the dairying industry.  I have given the extreme example where there is a difference of 6p per gallon in the price for milk in neighbouring creameries but throughout the dairying counties the situation is the same.  There are no two creameries paying the same price and this is a disincentive to milk production.</P>
    <P>Take a young man who is a progressive farmer, who increases his cow herd to the maximum that the farm will carry, who has modern equipment and suitable buildings and is delivering milk to a creamery which is paying a bad price.  That is the worst possible disincentive.  In one area that I visited I was appalled to find that there were no two creameries paying the same price.  In some cases there was a difference of 1p, 2p and up to 6p.  That has been going on for years.</P>
    <P>I understand that in the Common Market there will be a flat, basic, common price for milk.  This is a matter that concerns every dairy farmer.  The question that I have been asked most frequently in recent months is whether there will be a basic common price for milk in the Common Market.  I hope <Col N="853" /> the Minister will be able to throw some light on this matter.  If the price is x-shillings, certain creameries will be able to pay the price.  For instance, Mitchelstown Creameries will be able to pay.  What will happen to those creameries who at the moment are paying say, 4p or 6p a gallon less than is being paid by Mitchelstown Creameries? What do the Government propose to do?  Will they continue indefinitely to subsidise inefficient units? Will they subsidise the inefficient units for a certain period of time so as to enable them to become efficient or else get out of business?</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy that rationalisation of the creamery industry was not tackled seven or eight years ago. Rationalisation must proceed realistically within the context of an overall plan.  We have lost seven years during which this could have been carried out. Rationalisation could have been completed now, before entry to the Common Market.  We are entering the Common Market at the same time as we are confronted with the colossal task of rationalising the creamery industry.</P>
    <P>An effort was made by the IAOS to formulate a plan of amalgamation and rationalisation.  There was the famous 19-centre plan.  This was a great blunder, a great mistake.  There was an effort to sell this all-embracing rationalisation plan to the farmers and it failed because too much was attempted too quickly instead of proceeding at a steady pace and starting where there was a demand for rationalisation, with the Knocklong group, etc., and giving the farmers in the neighbouring areas the benefits of rationalisation.  If seven years ago we had started a gradual process we would by now have completed the programme of amalgamation.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest confidence in the ability of our producers to produce milk efficiently and up to the highest quality.  They will be able to hold their own and even do better than the dairy farmers in the most progressive countries in western Europe but they must be assured of the sincerity of the Government, of the Minister and the Department and of the reliability of <Col N="854" /> the advice given to them by the agricultural adviser and they must know that if they invest money in the development of their holdings there will be no sudden change in policy or in programme on the part of the Government such as happened in the case of the multi-tiered system.  I regret very much the wasted years of the past decade in relation to the dairying industry.  The way the Government have handled and approached the problem of the dairying industry is a national scandal and a national tragedy.  Worst of all, and I am sure this is without parallel in Western Europe, was the way in which the Government, three or four years ago, suddenly changed course and said that we must cut down on milk production: &ldquo;we will penalise the bigger milk producers and force them to go into beef production.&rdquo;  I welcome the change of heart now.  The multi-tiered system is going.  I regarded that system as a retrograde step.  It was a system which did more damage to the dairying industry than any other single step taken in the last 50 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about food processing and the urgency of adapting our processing and marketing organisation to take full advantage of the Common Market.  Nothing in the last 50 years more clearly exemplifies the stupidity of the Government's economic policy than the fact that we did not exploit the natural resources that we have.  We did not exploit the outstanding natural advantages we have for the production of food of all kinds. We have been singularly favoured by nature in that we possess two outstanding natural assets: we have a soil and climate comparable to and, in many cases, better than, those in other Western European countries for the production of grass and agricultural products.  Across a few miles of channel we have the greatest food-importing nation in the world.  Surely common sense should have dictated that our industrialisation should be geared to food processing and the production of top quality food of all kinds as a top priority.  Had we had a proper realisation, particularly on the part of Fianna Fáil Governments, which have been in <Col N="855" /> power for most of that period, we could and we should today be the foremost nation in Western Europe in food technology, in food processing and in food production.</P>
    <P>What do we find?  Were we the foremost nation, we could now look forward with equanimity to entry into the European Economic Community. What do we find?  We find the dairying industry in a mess; we find the bacon industry in a mess.  As far as food technology is concerned, we do not seem to know where we are going; we are going one way today and another way tomorrow. Now, on the eve of entry to the EEC we find the Government talking about the rationalisation of the creamery industry and of the bacon industry and the need for these to prepare themselves for entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>This Government, and their predecessors, should hang their heads in shame because of the way in which they neglected to develop the outstanding natural resources of our country and to exploit those natural resources to the full for the production of top quality agricultural produce.  This is something for which Ministers for Agriculture and the Department of Agriculture must take responsibility. We had an opportunity of supplying a substantial extra quantity of butter to the British market some time ago and we were unable to supply it.  I understand that, for years, we have not been able to fill our bacon quota on the British market.  Surely nothing more clearly proves the stupidity of Fianna Fáil policy in their whole approach to the problem of economic development than this miserable failure.  The First Programme for Economic Expansion, the Second Programme and the Third failed hopelessly because there was no adequate recognition given in those programmes to the important role agriculture plays, and should play, in the national economy.  The National Industrial and Economic Council was set up at the time of the Second Programme but agriculture had no representation on it.</P>
    <P>There are other ways in which Government agricultural policy has <Col N="856" /> fallen down.  If there is one subject that has been talked about more than any other by the experts, the pseudoexperts and everyone else it is the co-operative movement.  In the last 40 years we have heard more about this than about any other single thing in relation to agriculture.  What have the Government done?  What has been the history of the various Fianna Fáil Governments in relation to the practical application of co-operative principles and methods to agricultural production and marketing?  How do the efforts, of the Fianna Fáil Governments we have had, compare with the efforts of governments in Denmark and other countries which have made the maximum use of this outstanding method of agricultural production?</P>
    <P>Once again, we have the Minister for Agriculture talking about co-operation and group farming.  There has been an experiment in group farming carried out by the Irish Land Commission in Meath.  One would think this was a revolutionary idea. There is nothing new in this.  Group farming is not original.  It is certainly not a Fianna Fáil idea.  The idea of group farming was preached by Macra na Feirme and by the late Canon Hayes many, many years ago.  Group farming is a common practice on the Continent.  It is a common practice in developing countries.  In group farming, farmers come together and pool their resources for the purpose of large-scale production; ten small holders with 20 acres each will comprise a 200 acre holding; and, by working together and pooling their resources, these ten farmers can employ the most modern techniques and the most modern equipment economically.  This has been done.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands has talked about this great new experiment in County Meath.  It might be new so far as the Department of Lands is concerned, but it is not new so far as the agricultural industry is concerned.  Dr. Tom Walsh of the Agricultural Institute talked about such a scheme many years ago.  The late Canon Hayes was a great pioneer of this idea.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will endorse everything I say about the late <Col N="857" /> Canon Hayes and the tremendous work he did in rural Ireland.  He tried to encourage farmers to co-operate with one another and apply modern techniques so that they could obtain a decent standard of living.  He pointed out that they could not do this by each working his own holding but they could do it by co-operation.</P>
    <P>We talk about small farmers in the west and we talk about western development but the graph of the number of small farmers leaving the land goes up every year.  There were two alternatives: one was consolidation, which meant encouraging some farmers to leave the land thereby making bigger holdings for those who remain and the other was by co-operation and group-farming.  The Government's policy has been one of clearance and in the last ten years 14,000 have left the land every year.  I do not have figures of the numbers who have left the land during the past 20 or 30 years.</P>
    <P>The late Canon Hayes, who was the founder of Muintir na Tíre, had a great influence on my life and my outlook. I had the great privilege of working for Muintir na Tíre for a number of years before I became a member of this House.  The late Canon Hayes pointed out that the way to solve the small farming problem was by co-operation. The great modern architect of this idea is Father McDyer of Glencolumbcille. The experience of people such as Father McDyer, who have the foresight, vision and energy not merely to formulate, but to implement a scheme such as the Glencolumbcille scheme has been one of frustration.  Instead of being given the full blessing and co-operation of the Government and the Department of Agriculture they have met with obstacles, opposition and objections.  We can only keep the maximum number of viable family holdings by applying the principles of co-operation and community development to agricultural production.  While the initial experiment by the Land Commission in County Meath is a welcome development it is 30 years too late.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the advisory services which are a very important part of the agricultural industry.  On <Col N="858" /> the whole the advisory services have a good history and a good record but like many other sectors of agriculture they have suffered from the lack of a realistic policy on the part of the Government.  The present manner in which the agricultural advisory services are organised is not satisfactory.  There has been a good deal of discussion on the advisory services within the context of the reorganisation of local government &mdash; I am not going into that aspect of it.  I am concerned to see that the farmers get the best possible advisory service that can be provided.  The service should be organised in such a way that farmers will get the maximum benefit irrespective of how it is organised.</P>
    <P>I fear that we are going to have months and years of futile discussion as to who should control the advisory services.  I do not care and the majority of farmers do not care who controls the advisory services.  I do not care whether agricultural advisers are provided by local co-operative creameries, as they are in many cases, or whether they are provided by committees of agriculture.  All I want to ensure is that farmers in need of advice will get the best possible advice from agricultural advisers.  The present system is not satisfactory.  The services available, and the use being made of them by farmers, are not the best. Changes are necessary and it is up to the Minister to say how they can be made.</P>
    <P>The big problem, in my opinion, is that the men on the field have had no proper link-up or co-operation with the Agricultural Institute, the research departments of universities and the Department of Agriculture.  If the Agricultural Institute is to be of the maximum benefit to farmers the most effective lines of communication between the Agricultural Research Station and the farmer working on the land must be devised in order to ensure that the information is brought to the farmers' doorsteps as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The parish plan will, I believe, go down in history as one of the greatest experiments in the agricultural advisory service, not merely in this <Col N="859" /> country, but in Western Europe.  It was the brainchild of the late Canon Hayes, and it was implemented by a former Minister for Agriculture, my distinguished colleague, Mr. James Dillon.  I have already said that I fear time is going to be wasted on futile discussion as to who should control the advisory service and in the same way the parish plan was bedevilled from the outset with futile discussions as to who was going to control the parish advisers.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the parish plan was the outstanding social concept in Western Europe.  It was the first real attempt to bring the Department of Agriculture from Merrion Square to the farmer's doorstep.  From the point of view of the efficiency of an advisory service, nothing could be better than to have the agricultural adviser live in the rural parish where he works rather than in a town or city from which he would operate, rather like a veterinary surgeon.  The advisory service should not be confined merely to offering technical advice on matters relating to agriculture.  The agricultural adviser has an important role to play in the life of the rural community.</P>
    <P>The concept of the parish plan in the areas where it was introduced, and particularly in the parish of Bansha, was well in advance of anything Western Europe had to offer at the time.  When Fianna Fáil came back to power in 1957, unfortunately one of the first things they did was to scrap the parish plan.  This was a tragedy for Irish agriculture.  In whatever reorganisation is done in the advisory service we should get back to basic principles.  I hope the agricultural adviser will not be a person who goes out to take soil samples and sends his prescription to the farmer.  He should live in the rural community and assist in all aspects of development and parish life.  An adviser cannot gain acceptance by the local community unless he becomes part of that community, in the same way as the clergy and teachers live and work in the community. I am completely opposed to an agricultural adviser taking up residence in a town 15 miles away from the area <Col N="860" /> he serves, travelling to the area each morning but returning to the town every night and at weekends.  I do not care if there is an unpopular reaction among the advisory service staff with regard to my suggestion.  It is vital that the adviser should gain the confidence of the farmers and he must be on the spot all the time if he is to gain this confidence.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that we have not a specialist advisory service.  In 1960 I was involved for Muintir na Tíre in an experiment in group farming.  I found it was impossible to get specialist advice on this matter; no such advice was available from the Agricultural Institute, the Department of Agriculture or from the universities.  In these circumstances it is extremely difficult for a group of farmers to work together and pool their resources to best advantage.  No method of co-operating in this manner has yet been devised and I have attacked the Agricultural Institute for failing to do proper research in this matter.</P>
    <P>The lack of research done on this problem is a sad reflection on our agricultural policy.  It exposes the hypocrisy and cant we have had in regard to a co-operative movement.  In every county, in addition to the advisory service, there is need for a number of specialist people.  We need experts on co-operation and group farming, experts on animal diseases, on animal nutrition, on milk production and on many other items.  The worst feature of the advisory service is the abominable system of appointment.  After spending four years at university, the young graduate having spent another year at an agricultural college, in order to get his first appointment in the advisory service, must canvass the votes of members of committees of agriculture. I have condemned this system before and I repeat my condemnation of it now.  It is degrading, demoralising and it is 100 years out-of-date.</P>
    <P>Having secured the majority vote&mdash; often by political influence and perhaps without reference to the qualifications of the candidate &mdash; he is appointed on a temporary basis, on a six months renewable contract.  I have known cases where an agricultural adviser was for <Col N="861" /> ten years classified as a temporary instructor.  In such cases the adviser does not receive any increments and those years of temporary service do not count for pension purposes.  In fact, the adviser could be kicked out at the end of six months.  There was also the case of an adviser who took up a situation in a county; who spent a few years there and had become fully acquainted with the type of farming in the area, but, in order to get a permanent appointment, he might have to go from Limerick to Cavan, Mayo or Wexford. In the Limerick area there is mainly milk production and the experience gained by an adviser in that area is wasted when he has to go to Wexford where the system of farming is different.  In Limerick we were fortunate enough to have an adviser seconded from the Limerick Committee of Agriculture in the early days of our group experiment.  He spent four years in the area and worked very hard.  He did a considerable amount of research, and did much to get the experiment off the ground.  After four years he applied for a permanent appointment and, despite the fact that we pointed out to the Department of Agriculture that this was a pilot project of great national interest and value, the adviser had to go to another part of Ireland, where he is at present.</P>
    <P>This system of temporary appointment is disgraceful.  If an adviser is appointed, let him serve the usual Civil Service probationary period but let us do away with this system of transferring him from one part of the country to another.  Some agricultural experts may say this is good in that it gives the adviser experience of different systems of farming but I do not share that view.  The man who is born in the area, who is familiar with the type of farming carried out, can be of best use in that area when he becomes an agricultural adviser.</P>
    <P>I warn the Minister about this because I know that concern is being voiced by certain vested interests about the reconstruction of the advisory services.  The Minister will have to be ruthless about this.  I am not concerned about who controls the advisory services: I am concerned <Col N="862" /> only to see that the Irish farmers will get the advisory services which they want to enable them to make the maximum use of the manpower and expertise that are available.</P>
    <P>I will mention in passing the Agricultural Institute.  In the past I have been highly critical of the institute in the sense that I did not agree that certain highly scientific research projects undertaken by them could be of practical value to ordinary farmers.  I have been critical because the institute have not concentrated sufficiently on research into the social problems of Irish agriculture.  In the institute there is a rural economy division but I am not aware of any major contributions having been made by that division to rural development.</P>
    <P>On the whole, the Agricultural Institute have made an important contribution in relation to dairy research, of which I am very conscious.  The Dairy Research Institute in Fermoy have made an outstanding contribution to the development of modern dairying methods.  The work they have done can be seen particularly in my area in Limerick.</P>
    <P>However, I am not at all satisfied that other research stations operated by the Agricultural Institute have carried out lines of research which could benefit Irish farmers practically. Surely the whole aim of agricultural research and of the advisory services is to benefit the Irish farmers, not to provide academic pastimes or pursuits for the gentlemen engaged in that research. Agricultural research must be aimed primarily towards assisting the farmers.  I wish to pay a tribute to Dr. Tom Walsh and the Dairy Research Institute for their outstanding contribution but it should be possible to ensure that, throughout, agricultural research undertaken by the institute would be geared towards practical assistance for farmers in the field.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to agricultural credit and the Minister said that investment is necessary to gear up agriculture in the context of EEC entry.  If we are to gear our food processing industry particularly to EEC conditions a colossal injection of capital will be necessary and the Minister <Col N="863" /> and the Department will have to show leadership in this.  As far as credit is concerned in agriculture, the ACC, in so far as they find it possible to do so within their terms of reference, have been doing good work.  I may have been critical of all aspects of our agricultural policy but I must say that the ACC have been remarkable for their courtesy, for their consideration and for the humane manner in which they deal with farmers' difficulties. I am particularly pleased with the regionalisation of the ACC.  They have set up regional offices and this is an excellent idea which will be of great service to the farming community.  The ACC form one sector of the State agricultural services about which I have no criticism to offer.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I am not satisfied with the capitalisation of the ACC or with their terms of reference.  I do not agree these are anything like adequate to meet the needs of Irish agriculture in the immediate future.  As I have said, colossal capital investment will be necessary and the Government will have to take responsibility and show leadership to ensure that this capital, this finance, is available to gear agriculture properly for EEC entry.</P>
    <P>That is the gist of what I want to say.  There are other aspects of agriculture dealt with in the Minister's speech which one could speak about at length but I am sure my colleagues will be anxious to deal with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always with a feeling of trepidation that those of us who may be regarded as townsmen or urban dwellers dare to speak on a subject such as agriculture.  Nevertheless, since my election to the House in 1961, as part of my duties I have taken an active interest in this important Department and have spoken on the subject on occasions.</P>

    <P>I have read the Minister's speech carefully and I was particularly disappointed that he did not deal in greater detail with the repercussions which are bound to arise for our agricultural community in the context of our imminent entry to the Common Market.  In my opinion the Minister <Col N="864" /> deliberately evaded this vitally important matter.  One would have imagined that on the threshold of our entry to Europe the Minister would have spelled out in great detail the effects of entry on our agricultural community.  He evaded his responsibility in this matter, not giving us an idea of precisely which changes will have to be made in our various schemes and services. Instead, he spoke about the introduction of a White Paper on our terms of entry which we understand will be circulated early in the new year.</P>
    <P>This evasion is to be deplored because there is no doubt that membership of the Common Market will have serious consequences for various facets of our agricultural economy.  Even spokesmen for the various farming communities who a year or two ago were very enthusiastic about entry and about the possible benefits that would accrue to the agricultural community are now speaking in more cautious terms.</P>
    <P>The Common Market is no longer regarded as the great bonanza for the Irish farmers that we were led to believe it would be.  We are told there has been a great measure of agreement in the negotiations on most of the agricultural issues with the exception of the important matter of fisheries.  I would like to pay tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the stand he is taking in respect of safeguarding the lives of our fishermen and those who depend for their livelihood on the harvesting of fish from our seas.  It is gratifying to see a stand being taken on some issues, because, already, too much has been conceded, industrialwise, by reason of the indifferent approach by the Minister on so many other factors of our economy, especially in respect of industries, which are vulnerable to free trade.  It is a good thing to see a stand now being taken on this fundamental issue, and we wish the Minister success, at least, in maintaining the 12 mile limit which will adequately safeguard our fishermen in this regard.</P>
    <P>We are told that prices in applicant countries will be harmonised with the common price levels of the Community in the Six on six equal stages over the <Col N="865" /> transitional period.  I feel, if the Minister was to spell out clearly the repercussions that would arise, it would come as a very great shock to many Irish farmers.  Is it not true to say that free trade means in effect the free exchange of men, money and materials? In competing on that basis this will be an excruciating exercise for many small Irish farmers.  This free exchange of men, money and materials means that the laws we passed in this House in respect of preserving the land of Ireland for the people of Ireland no longer applies.  The Land Act will be as dead as a dodo.  Foreigners will be able to buy up large tracts of land without restriction, and this is bound to militate against the small farmers of this country, who will be unable to seek additional land to overcome serious congestion and economic privation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has carefully avoided any mention of the Mansholt Plan.  We all know that that plan constitutes a most serious threat to the small farmers of this country.  It rings the deathknell for them.  Mr. Mansholt has clearly stated the qualifications for viability in respect of farming in the Common Market and in Ireland, and from that, it is evident that many thousands of small farmers will be forced out of existence.  This is one of the great tragedies of entry into Europe for our agricultural community.  It is not good enough to say that this is the trend in Europe, this is what is happening in other countries throughout the world.</P>
    <P>We are in a peculiar position in this country.  We had a long tradition of fighting for the land of Ireland, a fight for the reconquest of Ireland against foreign domination and the confiscation of our land.  We hoped, when we secured the partial freedom we enjoy, that the ranches would be divided up and the land given back to Irish farmers.  An endeavour has been made along those lines but now a halt is being called.  There seems to be no further prospect for the small farmers in respect of obtaining more land.</P>
    <P>The great fight of the land war for the three &ldquo;Fs&rdquo;, free sale, free rent and fixity of tenure is no more.  In accordance <Col N="866" /> with the Mansholt Plan these people will be enticed to give up farming altogether.  They will be bought out, if they so desire, and larger holdings will be created.  We are moving back to the era of the rancher all over again.  This will accelerate the drive from the land which has been going on for a number of years at approximately 20,000 a year.  We applaud the voices which are raised against this.  I sincerely hope that the small farmers of Ireland will fight as tenaciously against Mansholt and others as they fought against the land barons of the past.  I extend to them, on behalf of this party, my hand and my heart in achieving victory over the struggle.</P>
    <P>We are told that farmers aged 55 to 65 years of age, who, of their own accord, decide to leave the land and make their farms available to those who are in a position to carry out a planned improvement programme, will receive an annual pension of about £250 or an equivalent lump sum allowance.  There are also provisions for the retraining of farmers for other activities and a scheme of educational grants for children of poorer farmers. It is fair to say that we already have legislation passed in this House providing for entitlement of pensions and lump sum payments to small elderly farmers if they decide to give up their land in order to create larger holdings.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that the scheme operated by the Department of Lands has been a dismal failure.  The number of aged farmers, who opted for this scheme of retirement on pension or lump sum has been pitifully small.  That being so, it seems that what Mansholt has in mind and the Minister refers to in the notes so kindly made available to us on various aspects of the Department, will not be any inducement to farmers to get out of the business.  I believe there are misgivings among the agricultural community about entering EEC.  The Minister has done nothing to allay fears and anxieties in that regard.  It is evident that foreign participation in any aspect of agricultural activity cannot be prevented by the Minister or the Government whether it is buying <Col N="867" /> land, to which I have already referred, or competition in the dairy industry on which Deputy O'Donnell spoke at length.</P>
    <P>Neither can foreign participation be prevented in respect of any products of the soil.  Meat processing factories giving valuable employment have, in many cases, already had setbacks and there is evidence of redundancy and a rush to merge.  Likewise, production and processing of vegetables can be threatened, and, in general, the production and processing of everything appertaining to agriculture could be seriously affected when we enter Europe.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that voices have been raised against acceptance of the Mansholt Plan.  The only alternative the Minister can suggest is the group idea, grouping of farmers together on a co-operative basis.  Other views have been put forward by Father McDyer and the Bishop of Kerry, Dr. Casey, and others who are alerting their people and organising them in a bold endeavour to hold on to their farms and make themselves as efficient as possible to meet what is to come.  I am pleased that this frontal attack on the small farmers is being met and I believe the Government could do much more to assist in that regard.  We have always contended that much of the assistance, and it is pretty lavish in certain instances, which the Government provide, in the main benefits the large farmer.  Clearly, the small farmer cannot avail of many State helps and aids because he does not have, in the initial stages, the capital required. While some Deputies were loud in praise of the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the manner in which they do business, I cannot concur.  There is a marked reluctance on the part of the ACC to assist the small farmer.  The tests applied are rigorous indeed. Advertising by the ACC that money is readily available seems to be unfair, and misrepresents the true position by holding out false hopes to farmers that money is there for the asking.  When one comes to seek a loan, one quickly gets the answer.  That is my experience of the ACC, that they tend to provide money for the larger farmer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> The whole emphasis nowadays, especially in the light of the Mansholt Plan, is that little or no help will in future be given to the small farmer. From now on a deliberate policy is being adopted even by our own Minister to pressurise the small farmer out of business.  That is evident in the abolition of the two-tier price system for milk, which was designed particularly to help small suppliers.  Again, we have evidence of Government policy deliberately discriminating against the small farmer.  It seems we are conforming to the Mansholt Plan and accepting its inevitability, and the Minister and the Department and other State bodies are applying pressures that will eventually put small farmers out of existence.  The repeated advertising of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, giving the impression that money is freely and readily available to all farmers of all types, is misleading in the extreme and has caused too much disappointment already to too many small farmers.  It is time for the Minister to cry halt to that farce.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for what is left to bolster up the small farmer.  I should like to see greater supports in respect of making money available, in respect of providing better housing accommodation, water supplies, sanitary services and greater supports for mountain sheep rearing, pig rearing, turkey rearing and glasshouse development. I would ask the Minister in particular to have regard to the intrinsic worth of increasing our stock of pigs.  More and more small farmers and cottiers and, indeed, some townspeople would be anxious and willing and ready to embark upon pig rearing if it could be made more profitable for them.  In the Ireland of unhappier days it was the pig who paid the rent.  Pig rearing is still a very important factor for small farmers and cottiers and many others.  If the Minister is sincere in wanting to have our production increased, I would ask him to consider providing a better deal for these smaller producers.</P>
    <P>I understand that at present a reorganisation of the agricultural committees is being considered.  I would be grateful to the Minister if he would <Col N="869" /> avail of the opportunity when he is replying to refer to this important matter which is the cause of anxiety and worry to very many people.  In the kind of restructuring which is likely to take place, it is feared that the agricultural committees as we know them will be abolished and something else constituted instead, perhaps regional boards something on the lines of the regional health boards which are in existence at present.</P>
    <P>I feel it my duty to reflect here the resentment felt by very many long-standing members of the agricultural committees who have worked tenaciously and dedicatedly on behalf of the farming community.  They feel it is very wrong, indeed, that the system they have known, and which has operated so well, should be disrupted or destroyed.  I would oppose the abolition of committees of this kind based at local level and serving relatively small communities as against regional bodies.  They know intimately the requirements of the farming folk in their areas and they reflect fully the wants and the needs and the aspirations of the farming community.</P>
    <P>They have been providing an excellent service and I would appeal to the Minister to be very slow to disrupt that service and to assist and stimulate still further the activities of our agricultural committees rather than abolish them and create larger boards. Those of us who have served on larger boards, such as the health boards, know that very quickly large bodies can become aloof and indifferent and, indeed, at times hostile to the needs of certain local communities far removed from them, people who are of little concern to them and from whom they do not derive their support or their votes.  There can be indifference of a very callous character in the creation of the large bodies to which I refer.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to the method of appointment of agricultural officers.  Very largely I share the views he expressed about the appointment of these officers on a temporary basis. Having granted them a job, and having allowed them to settle down and get to know the community and <Col N="870" /> provide a service, we compel them to sit for a competitive examination under the Appointments Board and then invariably they are transferred elsewhere. I am mindful in particular of a situation of this kind which has arisen in my own constituency.</P>
    <P>An agricultural officer was appointed on a part-time basis in the Ardfinnan district.  This man fell in love with the area and it can certainly be said that he fell in love with the people as well.  By reason of the outstanding service he provided for them at all levels he could be regarded as one of their greatest benefactors.  He was available on call to the people night and day.  He served farmers large and small without distinction.  He participated actively in the social life of the community.  He helped them in every way on the farm and in the home and in respect of recreational and sporting activities.  He was there on a temporary basis.</P>
    <P>The job was advertised on a permanent basis and he applied for it.  The people of that area hoped and genuinely prayed that this man would not be lost to them, that he would not be taken from them.  I should imagine that it is fair to say that the strongest possible representations were made for the retention of the services of this particularly dedicated man.  One can imagine the shock and dismay and disappointment experienced all over the Ardfinnan area when it transpired that this man did not get the job, the job that he had been performing so magnificently for so many years previously. Another had been appointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, of course, would have no responsibility in the making of that appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I am merely seeking to point out how one can destroy all the good work achieved by an officer of this kind by a radical change of this nature.  To conclude the story, very briefly he was appointed to another area, to Wicklow.  I feel that it is true to say that the people of the Ardfinnan district of Clonmel will never rest happy or feel consoled again until the services of this officer have <Col N="871" /> been restored to them.  There is obviously something fundamentally wrong with appointments when a man who has done his work so diligently and effectively is not appointed to that area.  It is a very serious blow to that community and one they will not easily get over.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred also to the rationalisation of the dairying industry, and he gives us much more information on the subject in the Main Activities of his Department.  We all appreciate the need to rationalise nowadays. However, I would appeal to the Minister, in the amalgamation of creameries that is envisaged, to have regard in particular to the human factors involved and strive to ensure as far as possible that there are no redundancies.  Too much has happened in this regard.  Too many mergers have taken place without regard to the effects on the local community.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred briefly to a creamery in an area converging on my electoral area, namely, the creamery of Knocklong which is on the borders of Tipperary.  I want to refer further to that catchment area also, Tipperary town.  The Minister will, no doubt, recollect that this area provides a superabundance of milk. There is excellent grassland there and many farmers are involved in milk production.  By reason of the large amount of milk available in the area a predecessor of the Minister, Deputy Charles Haughey, made a positive promise that a milk processing plant would be provided in Tipperary town. That was a number of years ago and despite adverting to the matter on many occasions in the House and despite deputations, protestations and representations, I am afraid that the much vaunted promise of a milk processing factory for Tipperary town has not been realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much political capital was made out of this proposal, and I am sure my colleague, Deputy Paddy Hogan, will agree with me that very many votes for the Government party were secured in our constituency and especially in the Tipperary area on the basis that this large plant was going to be provided. <Col N="872" /> We have had election addresses which contained this promise, and indeed, it has been reiterated by the Minister who is now in the House with us. Certainly there was no going back. That is five or six years ago now and we are still no nearer the processing plant for Tipperary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will tell us when an election is coming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt it will be resurrected before the referendum and certainly gullible people will fall for the promise.  I am asking the Minister to avail of an opportunity of telling the House whether this was simply a political fraud perpetrated on the people of Tipperary or whether there is any real prospect of this factory being erected there.  Was it merely a political gimmick, because that is what the people are beginning to believe? The situation in Tipperary town is such that the existing creamery there which is under the aegis of the Dairy Disposal Company has been for some time past in a rather insecure position. There have been redundancies and threats of redundancies.  Even in recent times there was a threat of the curtailment of an essential shift of workers which would have reduced the labour force by perhaps one-third.  I should like the Minister to have particular regard to the promise made to this area, to the superabundance of milk which is available, and the need to provide suitability of employment and, indeed, much more employment for that district.  Tipperary town has a very high incidence of emigration and unemployment. The Minister has a bounden duty to honour the promise made in providing for Tipperary town a milk processing plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important aspect of the Minister's speech and one which certainly will be greeted, in the main, with pleasure by the farming community is the proposal to increase the price of milk and skimmed milk by 2p per gallon.  This is welcome news for the farming community.  We on this side of the House support enthusiastically any proposal which will improve the prosperity and security of any section of our community, not least the farming <Col N="873" /> community whose livelihood is precarious, depending very largely on unstable markets and weather conditions.</P>
    <P>This is a pretty substantial increase in the price of milk.  It will, of course, profit the big supplier principally.  I have said already that there is evident discrimination against the small farmer in the abolition of the two-tier price for milk which heretofore operated.  That concession to the small farmer has been taken away and he is being put now on a par with the large farmer, and in the kind of battle that goes on between the pigmy and the giant, it is selfevident that it is the large farmer who will profit by this scheme.  While welcoming the increase in the price of milk to the farmers, for which they have been agitating for a long time, I wish to congratulate the NFA and the ICMSA for their consistent endeavours, many times in a militant fashion, to improve the lot of the farming community. These organisations have been dedicated to their members and have striven relentlessly to improve their lot. In the years to come it will be remembered that there were marches to the House to secure improvements.  Their statements were listened to and their demands were acted upon.  In the future when we have entered the Common Market we must remember that it is a very long march to Brussels.</P>
    <P>It would be unfair of us on the Labour benches not to take heed of the milk price increases and the consequential effects on the cost of living. It is regrettable that in increasing the price of milk the Minister should find it necessary to increase the price of butter by 2½ or 6d. a lb.  The price of butter has remained stable for some years past.  This news of an increase will be received with shock and dismay by the Irish housewives.  I agree with the advertisement issued by a State body which presents butter as &ldquo;the cream.&rdquo;  Nothing can replace butter.  It is part of our way of life.  There is no substitute for it.  This increase in the price of &ldquo;the cream of Irish life&rdquo; will turn it sour for many unfortunate people.  The Minister has helped to remove butter from many Irish tables.  I am not against the increase in the price <Col N="874" /> of milk, but it was the policy of a previous Government to cushion the impact of prices on essential foodstuffs. There was a policy of subsidisation of foodstuffs.  It is a pity that the Minister did not have recourse to something of this kind in this instance rather than increase the price of butter.</P>
    <P>The cost of living has risen steeply in recent times.  Our agricultural produce, vegetables of all kinds, meat, bread and now butter have risen in cost.  This increase comes at a time when there is a virtual standstill in wages and salaries.  It is difficult to understand the attitude of the Government in raising the price of butter by 6d per lb.  We cannot blame the workers or the unions who take cognisance of this act and who take suitable steps to maintain living standards for their people in the face of spiralling prices of this kind.  Food subsidies were an integral part of the policy of a previous Government.  When the Fianna Fáil Party came back in 1957 one of their first acts was to abolish food subsidies.  We cannot expect the Minister to cushion the impact on this occasion, but it is particularly galling to know that we are subsidising the foreigner to the extent of 1s 6d per lb. to enable him to eat our butter while we cannot do something about subsidising the price here and keep butter on our tables at home.</P>
    <P>It is ironical that our butter can be bought cheaper in Northern Ireland, Britain and elsewhere than here.  I appeal to the Minister, if it is not too late to do something about the subsidisation of our dairying industry of which butter is such an integral part. The Minister should find some way of avoiding the steep increase in the price of butter.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of the activities of the Department to which one could refer at length.  I do not propose to do so.  I have been impressed by the excellent work done by the land project section of the Department.  They have done much work in relation to drainage of land and the acquisition of additional land especially in congested areas.  I have no doubt that this good work will go on apace.  The farm building grants are most desirable.  The <Col N="875" /> small farm incentive scheme is an excellent one.  It is sometimes difficult to secure these grants.  The regulations are rigid.  Even when one complies with the regulations laid down there is often considerable delay before grants are paid.  This is not good enough.  At the present time there is a problem about the sheep-dipping regulations in my area.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that responsibility for sheep dipping facilities such as the provision of suitable tanks, whether fixed or mobile, would rest with the agricultural committees but, instead, the responsibility fell on the local county councils.  Because of this, and despite the best efforts of both bodies to provide advice and guidance and active participation, sheep dipping services are not satisfactory to the farming community.  This is particularly so in mountain areas.  I would ask the Minister to consider this problem with a view to providing more effective co-operation between the agricultural committees and the county councils in respect of the provision of proper sheep dipping facilities.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening remarks, it is with a certain amount of trepidation that a person from an urban area participates in a discussion on agriculture, but I do so, because of the importance of this industry.  It is an industry that is faced with great difficulties and dangers because of the changes that are taking place all around us, some of which we have no control over.  It would be remiss of me if I did not advert to my concern in respect of certain aspects of agriculture because many of my constituents derive their livelihood from farming.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that I would be converging on other Departments, in particular on the Department of Lands if I were to extend my views on these matters.  In this respect one cannot but wonder why, because of the close relationship between the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Department of Lands, there is not a merger of these two Departments.  If this were so, we would not have to transgress the rules of the House when speaking on matters that relate to both <Col N="876" /> Departments.  Furthermore, such mergers would ensure greater co-operation and understanding of the problems of the entire farming community.</P>
    <P>Anything that the Government do to improve the lot of farmers and, in particular, the weaker sections of the farming community, will have the support of this side of the House and I express the hope that, despite what is contained in the Mansholt Plan, the Government will not acquiesce in it but that they will fight tenaciously, together with the small farmers, their spokesmen and respective organisations, to maintain in Ireland the rightful place of the farmer.  With the support of the Government, that struggle can have a successful outcome.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his future undertakings.  I know that he has had a difficult time, and I hope that what has happened in respect of internal matters within the Cabinet has not affected adversely either the workings of his Department or the interests of the great number of people who are depending on his aid, his services and his administation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer specifically to items Nos. 3 and 4 on today's Order Paper.  These relate to two motions of annulment of two statutory instruments.  These are Statutory Instruments Nos. 36 and 37 of 1964.  One refers to the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930 (Exporters' Licences) Fees Regulations, 1964; and the other refers to the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935 (Part II) (No. 3) Regulations, 1964.  Both of these Orders increase the levy on slaughterings of animals, cattle, sheep and pigs, with a view to gaining increased revenue on behalf of the trade which was to be put towards the establishment and financing of a meat research institute.</P>
      <P>I understood that I was to be allotted one hour of Government time to have these motions discussed fully and voted on but, apparently, the Government decided to take them with the Estimate on Agriculture and Fisheries. However, the Fianna Fáil Chief Whip has assured me that the Minister will reply independently to these motions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> At the outset, I would like to refer to the background of these Orders. The problem of research in the meat trade arose first as a result of the publication in 1958 of the First Programme on Economic Expansion in which it was pointed out that the industry would benefit undoubtedly from research in respect of such matters as packaging, transport, <i>et cetera.</i>  Following the publication of that Programme representatives of the Department met representatives of the Bacon Curers Association, and of the Meat Exporters and Beef Canners Associations and discussed the problem.  These discussions went on over a period of time beginning in February, 1959.  At one point the Director of An Foras Talúntais, Dr. Walshe, was involved. There was agreement from the trade side that a research body was very desirable and whether this body would be within An Foras Talúntais or would be independent of it, became a matter for discussion within the trade. There was approval for State assistance to the project.  This approval was given in a letter from the Department to Mr. J.J. Bastow who was acting for the trade on the 28th December, 1962.  The letter indicated the amount the State would contribute to the project by way of grant and subvention.  The balance was to be put up by the trade.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the trade requested that a levy be introduced to supplement the existing levy because they considered this to be the best way of getting the contribution from the trade side.  The then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, regarded this as being the most acceptable way of financing the project.  The Minister laid before Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann drafts of regulations under both Acts&mdash; the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930 and the Agriculture Produce (Fresh Meath) (Amendment) Act, 1935, providing for this increase in levy.  In his speech on the draft regulations in Dáil Éireann on 11th December, 1963 he stated:</P>
    <P>No revenue will accrue to the State by reason of the increased fees proposed, and my Department will pay over to the trade's own meat Research Institute an amount equivalent <Col N="878" /> to the proceeds of the increases in the fees, plus the additional contribution being made by the State.</P>
    <P>He made a similar speech in Seanad Éireann on 18th December, 1963 again stating:</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that no extra revenue will accrue to the State from the proposed increases in the fees. </P>
    <P>These draft regulations were approved by Dáil Éireann on 11th December, 1963 and by Seanad Éireann on 18th December, 1963.  Both Orders were, in fact, made on 24th February, 1964 and in the intervening time there was a discussion on the trade side as to which would be the most acceptable way of establishing the institute, whether it should be attached to An Foras Talúntais or independent. That was the position at that time.  The Orders became effective though not laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they were made.  I shall refer to this later.  During the early years of the collection of the levy the amounts intended for the research institute, being part of the general levies, were placed in a suspense account.  However, since, in effect, there was no final decision on the establishment of the institute, the practice ceased and in effect the levies were silently diverted&mdash;the words used by the High Court Judge in his decision&mdash;to the general revenue of the State, apparently on the advice of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>The trade interests took the matter to court of law and it was decided in the judgment of the President of the High Court delivered on 30th July, 1970 in which he dealt with a number of matters.  One matter which he dealt with and on which he gave a direction was in relation to both Orders.  He pointed out that the actual Orders when made were not placed before the House of the Oireachtas in accordance with the relevant Acts as soon as may be after they were made.  It is interesting to note that though the Orders were made on 24th February, 1964 it took a High Court decision to have them placed before the Seanad <Col N="879" /> and the Dáil.  They were placed before the Dáil on 20th October, 1971 and before the Seanad on 27th October, 1971, nearly eight years after they were made.  I consider that this is a serious malpractice.  The Act of the Oireachtas specified that the Orders should be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they were made.  I assume those words mean &ldquo;without undue haste&rdquo; but I would consider a period of seven years and three months to be an insult to the Houses of the Oireachtas in this matter. It is only when such Orders are placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas that any motion for annulment can be put down.  I am not blaming the present Minister for this.  This goes back to 1964 but it is a serious malpractice and a serious insult to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I hope such a thing will not occur again.</P>
    <P>In relation to perhaps the most important issue&mdash;the actual collection of the levies and their use I wish to quote from the judgment of the President of the High Court delivered on 30th July, 1971.  He says at page 19 of his decision:</P>
    <P>The position taken up by the Minister may be strictly in accordance with the Statutes, that is to say, that the fees, collected from the traders concerned, are to be applied for the benefit of the Exchequer in such manner as the Minister for Finance may direct.  In other words, these fees may be treated as part of the general revenue of the State and applied for any purpose directed by the Minister for Finance, regardless of the purpose outlined to Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann when resolutions approving of the draft regulations were passed.</P>
    <P>He goes on to state:</P>
    <P>Reliance on this argument seems to me to be a gross breach of faith on the part of the Minister towards the trade interests at whose instance the regulations were made, and to the Houses of the Oireachtas who approved of the draft regulations on the basis of the Minister's statement in each House.  Nonetheless, it would seem that these fees, received for <Col N="880" /> a very special purpose have been applied to other purposes, after being, for a period, retained in a suspense account.</P>
    <P>he continues:</P>
    <P>A strange position arises in regard to these moneys.  They were, as I believed, impressed with a trust that they should be applied in a particular way, and were collected on the representation that they would be so applied.  Under the relevant legislation the approval of Seanad Éireann was required before the increased fees could be imposed.  One might think that it would be open to me at this stage to make a declaration that they are still held on the trust referred to, but it appears that they have been put into the general revenue of the State and dealt with each year under the Appropriation Act, so that by legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>These are the important words:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;they have silently been diverted from the purpose for which they were collected, and applied in other ways.</P>
    <P>These are the words of the High Court judge.  They point out very serious anomalies in relation to these increased levies, from two aspects.  The first and more serious aspect is in relation to the position in which both the Dáil and the Seanad find themselves as a result of this practice.  The fact is that on 11th December, 1963, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries came into the Dáil and, on 18th December of the same year, went into the Seanad, and gave assurances that no revenue would accrue to the State by reason of the increased fees proposed and he said that his Department would pay over to the State-owned meat research institute an amount equivalent to the proceeds of the increase in the fees plus the additional contribution made by the State.  It was on that assurance that the Houses of the Oireachtas accepted the levies.  It now transpires that the levies have been diverted&mdash; silently diverted, in the words of the High Court judge, to the general revenue of the State.</P>
    <P>It is only right and proper that the House should deplore such a practice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" /> The funds were initially kept in a suspense account but later they were silently diverted to the general revenue of the State, a practice which must be condemned by both Houses of the Oireachtas and which involves a high principle of conduct in relation to the State's activities in this matter.  There is a moral obligation on the Minister and on the Government to rectify and to resolve the situation by carrying out the original purpose for which the levies were intended.</P>
    <P>The second principle involved is in relation to the Minister and the trade interests concerned.  The Minister now stands in the position of being in gross breach of faith with the trade interests involved.  As it happens, it is the meat trade that is involved; it could be any other trade.  When an industry such as the meat trade, which is of vital importance to the economy, makes representations to the Minister in relation to such a necessary development as the establishment of a meat research institute and when there is agreement that such an institute should be established and that a levy be introduced to finance it, if at a later stage these moneys are diverted to other purposes, the Minister must stand in the position of being guilty of a gross breach of faith with the trade and it is up to the Minister to rectify the matter.  It can be rectified by the Minister deciding, with his advisers, to meet the trade interests around a table and agreeing either to suspend the increased levy or to take positive steps to ensure that the project is initiated and is completed successfully.</P>
    <P>There is, I understand, an appeal before the Supreme Court in relation to this decision of the High Court.  It is my information that the trade interests would prefer, not to proceed with that appeal, but to meet the Minister and to take steps to ensure that the institute is established in accordance with the original intention of the Government, as explained in the First Programme, and of the trade, who are more than interested in the project.</P>
    <P>When one considers our proposed entry into Europe and the developments which must come about in the meat trade, and the complex technical <Col N="882" /> problems that will arise in relation to various activities, there would appear to be no room for the Minister to be in gross breach of faith with the trade. There is no room for arguments or for court cases.  There is room only for solid, constructive purpose and this is what is being asked for by the trade interests.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt, from what I have said and from what the President of the High Court has said, that a gross injustice has been perpetrated on the trade and the onus for rectifying this gross injustice lies squarely on the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>It must be pointed out that in the recent judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <i>Byrne versus Ireland and the Attorney-General,</i> it was pointed out that failure to follow an obligation on the part of the State always leaves the citizen with a right of redress.  That is the position, as I understand it.  It cannot be disputed that a Minister is guilty of a grave breach of faith towards the meat trade interests at whose instance the regulations were made.  The Houses of the Oireachtas approved of draft regulations on the basis of the Minister's statement in each House and it should be sufficient for the court to indicate that the moneys were impressed with a trust and should not properly have been silently diverted from the purposes for which they were collected, to ensure that the Minister would not seek to shelter behind a technicality that the court felt it lacked jurisdiction to direct the equitable remedy.</P>
    <P>It must be obvious to the Minister, because of what the President of the High Court stated, that the Minister is morally responsible for the present situation and, therefore, morally bound to rectify it and it is in a spirit of compromise, of reconciliation and willingness on the part of the Minister to sit around the conference table that this problem will be resolved in the interests of everyone concerned.</P>
    <P>Concerning the motions of annulment before the House, at this point I wish to declare a personal interest in the matter.  I am a shareholder in a <Col N="883" /> small meat factory but there will necessarily be no gain to me arising out of these motions.  It is the express intention of the meat trade to have this institute established and to have proper facilities for research available to the meat trade.  Indeed, these levies will be a liability on the firm in which I have a shareholding.  I believe it is my duty to state my personal position in this matter.</P>
    <P>Once again, I appeal to the Minister to come to the conference table with the meat trade interests and take positive steps to ensure that a meat research institute is established.  I appeal to him, too, to clear his good name in the context of the judgment by the President of the High Court which I have quoted to the House. There must be harmonious relations between the Minister, his Department and the trading interests involved if we are to face the Common Market with any degree of confidence.  I think the Minister is honourable enough and intelligent enough to recognise that the present situation is an unfortunate one and to take the necessary steps to remedy it.</P>
    <P>I understand he will reply separately to my two motions.  If his reply is conciliatory I am prepared not to force the motions to a division.  If, however, he decides to continue collecting the revenue and apply it to general purposes, if he is not prepared to put the moneys collected into a suspense account to be applied later to the establishment and financing of a meat research institute, then I shall force the motions to a division.  I will do so with reluctance.  This is not a party political matter.  It is a matter of the good name of the Minister and the good name and integrity of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is a matter of the High Court decision by the President of that court.  I appeal once more to the Minister to have a reconciliation which will be acceptable to everyone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Speakers on both sides of the House have asked for extra incentives, more subsidisation, more bonuses and greater protection for beef, milk, pigs and poultry.  No speaker so <Col N="884" /> far in the debate has adverted to the horticultural industry and to the tillage industry.  I shall do my best now to remedy this deficiency in the debate so far.  There has been utter neglect by the Department of both the horticultural and tillage industries.  The Parliamentary Secretary is in the House; he was at a symposium recently in my constituency. He met many prominent producers, experts from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, from An Foras Talúntais and from the advisory services.  He did not come away from that meeting uniformed as to the state of the tomato industry, for one thing. Over the past four years incentives have been given to the industry.  A sum of roughly £450,000 a year has helped to increase the acreage under glass. This industry is very important in my constituency in places like Rush, Skerries, Balbriggan and all along the coast.  Obviously, the idea was to get producers to increase the acreage and also the productivity of the industry.</P>
      <P>However, the Department fell down badly on the job because they never at any time tried to find a market for this produce.  The record will show that exports have fallen.  Certainly they have not increased over the last year.  Unfortunately, the cost of production has increased and the rate of increase has had the result of making our producers uncompetitive.  They cannot compete on the British market because by the time tariffs and transport costs are paid he is back to square one as regards competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The person producing tomatoes for the home market is not being adequately paid.  Any producer who got ten shillings a chip for tomatoes this year did very well but out of that he was supposed to pay increases in the cost of oil, electricity, rates and labour yet no effort has been made by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to stabilise tomato prices.  When we enter the EEC we shall be entering a highly competitive market.  The Dutch Government are already exhorting their growers to be competitive in the EEC and as far as productivity is concerned they have already outstripped Irish growers.</P>
      <P>We must have compulsory grading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="885" /> I have asked the Minister questions about this and on this Estimate every year I ask for compulsory grading to be introduced but this still has not been done.  Compulsory grading is necessary for the protection of the home market and in order to meet competition from abroad.</P>
    <P>The Government through grants and incentives have given a tremendous amount of money to the tomato industry. If we are going to be able to compete in the EEC we must get down to the job of selling the tomatoes we produce.  It is easy to supply the home market.  In fact those who grew tomatoes before incentives and grants were offered by the Department could easily have supplied the home market. Irrespective of what the Minister has said, and he glossed over it very well during his speech, the tomato industry will not be able to meet competition in the EEC.</P>
    <P>The Dutch are giving incentives to their growers in the form of cheaper heating.  Even at this stage will the Minister, along with his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, devise a scheme for giving grants for the heating of glasshouses.  During the months of April and May glasshouses need to be heated at night.  Electricity costs 6p per unit; this is a fantastic charge.  If a subsidy on electricity were given it would help growers to increase productivity which is what the Department have been asking them to do for years.  Growers have increased productivity at their own expense and in fact they have done it to their detriment because they cannot sell their produce. The ESB have said that a scheme of cheaper electricity for growers is feasible, it is up to the Department to decide if they want to give such an incentive.  Now is the time to help growers when they are at the climax of their production instead of waiting until there is a falling off before giving any incentives.</P>
    <P>We introduced the grant system about four years ago and the maximum grant is £25,000 but delays in the payment of grants are as bad as ever. People who applied for a grant on 1st March, 1969, were not paid until March, 1970.  People generally want <Col N="886" /> grants for additional heating.  When they apply for a grant they will already have contracted somebody to do the work but on applying they receive a note from the Department saying their case is being investigated.  The fact is that their case is not investigated as the Department has no money to pay them anyway.  The proper thing to do would be to sanction the grant and say that payment will be made in the following year's Estimate.  Growers would accept this and go ahead with their alterations either with a loan from the bank if it is available or else by getting credit on the basis that the Department will pay them later.  At present people who go ahead with the work are told that because they went ahead without the sanction of the Department they will not qualify.  That attitude will have to be eradicated and the more realistic approach introduced.  Grants for glasshouses are to be phased out and I would suggest the Department concentrate on marketing, oil and heat which are the principal sources of complaint from the tomato industry.</P>
    <P>Progress in the agricultural industry, which has been made under extreme circumstances of rising costs, has been reasonably satisfactory.  The industry should be complimented on the way it has tried to keep pace with the rising costs which have come about within the last 12 months or two years.</P>
    <P>When I spoke on this Estimate last year about the potato industry I trod very carefully because of my position but my position has since changed radically.  I can say with a certain amount of assurity that the Department's approach to the potato industry is that they want growers to get out of potatoes altogether.  They have not shown any initiatives, they have not given any incentives and worse than that they had not tried to fix a minimum price and they have not even met the farmers to discuss what a rational price would be.  The Department seem prepared to allow day to day price fixing by certain sectors of the community. Farmers cannot get a fair share of the profits from potatoes because other sectors in the community want a larger profit.</P>
    <P>When the Estimate for this Department <Col N="887" /> was being discussed last year I advocated that we should have a minimum price for potatoes.  I agree that if there is a guaranteed price for potatoes many people will wish to produce more but the minimum price does not apply only to potatoes.  It applies to all goods.  Why must agriculture be treated differently from other industries?  The manufacturer knows the price he will obtain for a tin of peas or a tin of potatoes but the farmer who produces the potatoes does not know what price he will obtain.  The price depends on the whims of individuals, people who are prepared to take exorbitant profits and inflict high prices on the housewives.</P>
    <P>I do not object to the housewives who are at present rebelling against high prices but the fault does not lie with the farmers.  June is supposed to be a good month for potatoes; they are sold at £14 per ton.  At this time there are many potatoes on the market but they are being sold in the shops at 4s per stone.  Where is the 100 per cent profit going?  If it is in handling costs something is wrong, and it is not true to say that it is spent on storage costs because at that time of the year potatoes do not keep.</P>
    <P>The only way to correct this matter is to stabilise the price and to give farmers some incentive to grow potatoes.  Money has not been made in the production of potatoes this year and the person who made £6 per acre was lucky.  This was the average profit made from potatoes for the following reasons: fertilisers cost more; labour costs increased; farm machinery costs increased and the cost of potato seed also increased.  The farmer must take the price he is offered.</P>
    <P>The price varies according to the weather.  If it is raining in the peak period in June few people can dig and, therefore, the price is fairly good.  However, when we have sunshine there is a glut of potatoes on the market and the price declines sharply.  There was much talk last year because the acreage increased by about 1,000 acres but this year it decreased and I predict that the <Col N="888" /> position will have deteriorated to a greater extent next year.</P>
    <P>The housewives are forced to pay exorbitant prices for potatoes.  The potatoes are packaged in plastic packs but the housewives pay a considerable amount for the packaging.  The same thing applies to vegetables in general. However, the Government are very quick to tell the man who produces all these items what price he will obtain. Because he employs a few individuals there is a stabilised price for him.  It is good that people get employment but it is not fair that the people who produce these goods should be penalised.</P>
    <P>I have been interested for a considerable time in wheat and barley production, and I can speak with practical knowledge about wheat production. Any person who is naïve enough to tell the farmers that they made money this year out of wheat needs to have his head examined.  The wheat producers did not make any reasonable profit and I shall try to explain the reason.</P>
    <P>Farmers are penalised by way of levy for growing wheat and a lot of calculations come into this matter.  It may be said that the levy has a specific purpose, namely, it pays for the surplus of millable wheat.  I do not accept this argument.  If we did our job properly any additional surplus wheat could be utilised in animal feeding stuffs.  People may say that we use this surplus and that we do not throw it away but we use it with material which we import.  I would say much of this imported material is no better than dirt.  It is the worst type of feeding stuff and yet we are glad to import it while our own wheat is not used.  The argument may be put forward that our wheat has no protein value but I do not accept that.  We have given some kind of an undertaking to France, Russia and other countries whereby we import this material.  If one goes down to the Dublin Port Milling Company after they extract the flour from the wheat one can see that much of the material is simply shell.  We should realise that a better quality material is available here and not import from those countries.</P>
    <P>We import milo maize and other <Col N="889" /> items that are necessary to act as balancing agents.  It is acceptable to everyone to do this if it is a balancing meal and is high in protein but to import barley is ridiculous.  At the moment farmers are given a market price for this product at the beginning of the year but when the time comes for payment they are told that the money is needed for those people who did not produce quality meal.  Farmers are told that perhaps they will get a refund later in the year but there is no mention of the time that elapses before payment is made.  The Departments of Agriculture and Fisheries and Finance who get this revenue are using the farmers' money and the farmers must do without.  It is not so bad for the big farmer who will survive in any case. I am not making his case.  He has so many acres that if he only makes £2 an acre he will come out on top.  The small man with about 30 acres altogether and about seven or eight acres of wheat has about £100 stopped out of his cheque for levy.  That means £2 per week income which is a substantial reduction in his circumstances. By the grace of God he might get the money back at the end of January but during that period the Department use the money for their own advantage at the expense of the farmer who is caught no matter what he does.</P>
    <P>People in general talk of the great weather and how well off farmers are but wheat yields are down.  If one gets statistics from the Department or An Foras Tionscail, who compile their own statistics, you find that in general winter wheat yields were down last year because of mildew, the dry spell humid conditions and conditions which obtained from May to the end of July and eroded most of the wheat stem resulting in a loss in production.  These are all significant factors.</P>
    <P>We got five shillings more for barley, an increase which I welcomed last year and still welcome because I think it makes a pretty good price for barley and this has been reflected in the increased barley acreage this year, particularly feeding barley.  But we also had a 10 per cent increase in malting barley.  As soon as that increase was announced the scavengers, <Col N="890" /> mainly seed merchants, producers of fertilisers and sprays, seeing this increase of five shillings per barrel, said: &ldquo;This is our chance&rdquo;.  They jumped on the band wagon and they hit the farmer as hard as they could by increasing the price of fertilisers; seed went up by £1 5s per barrel and spray by four shillings.  The five shillings was immediately swallowed up but, in addition, farmers had extra light charges, extra rates and higher oil charges.  We can speak of rates in two ways.  We can talk of the big percentage of farmers who are working on reduced rates.  That is acceptable but such farmers must work on a smaller reduction now than previously because of the increase in the rate.  In general, the argument still holds that no matter what you give to agriculture, unless you control prices elsewhere, you are wasting your time because other sections of the community, like the vultures, are ready to gobble it up while the general public think that farmers are getting another increase.</P>
    <P>The milk producers got an increase which was more than merited.  Tillage and horticulture have remained static for want of someone to control prices. I do not know how we shall make out in the EEC particularly on the horticultural side because nobody has made any great endeavour to look after this sector.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, from whom I had a short memorandum some time ago referred to his negotiations on behalf of the horticultural sector.  This is not enough. I am convinced that only when we enter the EEC will the horticultural sector realise the loss of protection which we have been overlooking for the past four years or so since this proposition was initiated.  It will be too late then.  We cannot tell the people then that it is their job to produce. They have done their work and it is our job to protect them and if we cannot do so we fail miserably in our duty.</P>
    <P>To go back to wheat, I suggested last year that we should devise some new scheme instead of this impounding of a farmer's money by way of levy which we have practised for the past few years.  This, I think, is the most unfair system that could operate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> I suggested a system of growing wheat on a variety basis.  There are other methods but this would be the most flexible, in my opinion.  Under it the Department would allocate varieties which could be grown as millable varieties while you would also have a soft or secondary wheat which could be used for feeding.  A price of, say, £3 10s per barrel could be struck for that wheat, a little better than or even the same as the price for barley.  On that basis you could produce soft wheat with the assurance that you would get a certain price for it and you could produce it as a feeding wheat which means you could add to your production by additional fertilisers.  Various varieties have been tried and all of them are producing over two and a half tons per acre.  With this rate of production there is no doubt it would be economic and no doubt that we could utilise this type of feeding rather than importing the dirt I have mentioned. We import about £10 million worth of feeding stuff each year and of this about 70 per cent is the worst possible type of feeding, spreading disease and dirt such as wild oats.  We could save the economy £7 million or £8 million by producing the type of wheat I suggest.</P>
    <P>It is not as easy as it can be made to appear on paper but it deserves a trial and the Department should try to implement some system of this kind which would be better than the levy system.  That was imposed on a trial basis; it has not been successful but has been retained for want of a better system.  Surely we have enough men in the Department with sufficient knowledge and intelligence&mdash;I know they are there&mdash;to enable us with the co-operation of An Foras Tionscail to arrive at another system and get away from the levy which absorbs farmer's money each year for the four months from the end of September until the middle of January.</P>
    <P>There is another problem here and that is not knowing what the price for next year's crop will be.  I asked the Minister if it would not be possible to announce early in November what the price will be in the following year.  He <Col N="892" /> said this was not feasible because of arrangements with the Grain Board and the millers.  I do not know whether the millers or the Minister determines the price.  I know the millers have a big say in what the price will be but the farmers are entitled to know what they will get next year for their products. The price should be announced as early as possible rather than allowing it to go until Christmas, or afterwards, as is often the case.</P>
    <P>An interesting case comes to mind here.  The other night on television we saw a programme involving Messrs. Arthur Guinness.  I did not see it but I heard of it.  It seems from an agricultural point of view that they will phase themselves out of production in this country to the extent that we are gradually losing our export market. This must be considered with a certain amount of care.  I do not think that we really realise what the production of barley for Messrs.  Arthur Guinness means to the farmers.  If we did we would not allow this suggestion to go ahead without making some investigation about it.</P>
    <P>If they have been contemplating this since 1936, surely somebody must have known something about it.  If Messrs. Arthur Guinness were to pull out of this country there would be a considerable loss to the farmers.  Farmers have contracts for the production of barley. Unlike wheat production, from the point of view of the Department, they have contracts to grow barley.  It must be of a certain quality.  It must be of a certain variety.  It must be in good healthy condition.  They get a contract price which is guaranteed.  To the ordinary, rough, normal farmers about whom every one of us talks it means a lot to know that they have ten, 15 or 20 acres of barley, that they can assess how many barrels they will get, and that they will get £3 7s 6d for it.</P>
    <P>Instead of just watching this industry being phased out, the Government should try to see if they can do anything about it.  As was hinted on that programme it is possible that Messrs. Arthur Guinness might be ready for a takeover.  That may be necessary for the sake of the economy as a whole.  I am speaking for the agricultural <Col N="893" /> section, but also for other sections of the community there are grave reasons why we should have negotiations to see what we can do to save our export market and to save the production of barley at home.</P>
    <P>Varieties of corn have been experimented on over the past few years. Quern has been more or less pushed down our throats but there is no variety to follow quern.  This is the first year in which there was an indication that quern is running out, perhaps because the mother seed is not available, or perhaps because we have let it run out by way of increased production on one type of land.  Quern is no longer the really acceptable variety for which we have been looking.  We have accepted it for the past four, five or seven years. We are looking for varieties now which will produce more, which will have a higher protein value, and which will harvest a little earlier.  If we can get a variety which will harvest earlier, it can be used to a greater extent from the farmers' point of view as a crop which we can cut at the beginning of August.  We can till our land, put in a type of green turnip and then graze it from the end of September.  This helps the land and it also helps in the production of additional income for the farmer because he can also carry over stock until late November and December on this land.</P>
    <P>All these things have to be taken into consideration.  We badly need a new variety.  Experiments are being carried out on three new varieties at present in the Department but they will not be on sale this year.  There is a definite need for a new variety, a variety with an earlier ripening ability. We also need a change in the levy system.  We should stop punishing the farmers for doing what we asked them to do.  We are punishing them for growing wheat for which we allege they will get a price but in the end we do not give it to them.</P>
    <P>We should also do something about controlling the price of artificials. Every year the farmer has to suffer an increase in the price of artificials without any redress.  The only person he can go to is his own bank manager and, at the end of the year, he is <Col N="894" /> ashamed to go to him.  Every time there is an inkling of an increase for the farmer, every time there is even a murmur that there is to be an increase for the tillage section, the vultures are there ready to grab, and those vultures are fairly well fed as it is, without taking the slice of the national cake which they are prepared to take from the farmers and which they will take as long as we allow them to do so.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's responsibility to control prices to an extent that they can guarantee to the farmers that the supply and demand business &mdash; which is antiquated in most other countries &mdash; will not prevail any more in our markets.  If an ordinary individual went to the Dublin market and saw the system which operates he would think it was a Punch and Judy show.  There is no unity about what goes on there. Nobody seems to care where the load goes or who it goes to.  You have a tictac man.  You go to him.  He does the dealing for you.  You go out at the other end.  You are never happy but you just take what you get.  You go home and get to work again.  This system has been going on for years. Nobody bothered to do anything about it because the farmers sat down under it.  The tillage section of the community were the last to raise their voices about abuses.</P>
    <P>In my constituency the average farm would be about 30 to 35 acres.  Most of the farmers are family men.  What chance has a farmer with that acreage of buying a bit of land and adding it to his holding so that he can keep some of his sons at home?  He cannot do it on present-day prices and under the present system.  The developer has moved in rapidly on the outskirts of Dublin and made the price of land prohibitive.  If you want to buy land in present-day circumstances you have to put your head in a halter.  The ordinary farmer would love to buy land but he cannot do so.  He has no guarantee that his market will be there next year.  He can only say to himself: &ldquo;We will go on as we are.  We will divide whatever little profit we have and we will keep the son at home.&rdquo; The son gets tired of that and he gets on the Boeing and goes to America.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="895" /> The people are flying from the land in County Dublin because there is no stability.  The cost of production is too high.  We must also consider the imposition of the rates and charges for oil and heating.  There is also the cost of labour.  This is a very complex area. The labour content is adjacent to the city of Dublin.  The people in the county are trying to compete with the industrial sector.  There should be specific emphasis on the fact that the farm workers who stay on the land deserve credit.  They also deserve proper facilities and a decent wage.  They should be given parity with the industrial sector.  To achieve that the farmer must suffer.  His income must be brought up before we can bring up the income of the worker.  It is a vicious circle but it could be sorted out if we got down to the business of trying to control prices and to provide markets.  If we do not do that we will be tying our heads in a halter and when we go into the EEC we will be asking: &ldquo;Why did we not think of this before?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In my experience the Land Project people are doing a very good job in our county.  Why have the Land Project people down the country to go back up to Dublin for sanction for a small job costing about £150?  Why do we not decentralise sections of the Land Project at least and give authority to officials working down the country to decide on individual applications? We could make a stipulation that if the decision is not accepted the person concerned has an appeal to the Minister.  That would be the easiest way out.  It is ridiculous that there should be a delay of four or five months in obtaining sanction for a job that may be worth less than £200.  I am sure that any rural Deputy here has experienced these delays.  An application is sent to the Department and if there is any query in connection with it, the applicant receives a letter about two months later telling him that there is a query.  This, too, would be one way of recompensing those living in the areas to which decentralisation was promised.  It was unjust to have created the impression that there would be decentralisation.  There should be <Col N="896" /> phased decentralisation to most counties.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay a special tribute to the people in my area who are connected with land project work.  The men involved are extremely helpful and deserve the appreciation of the farmers for their efforts.</P>
    <P>In regard to An Foras Talúntais it has always been my opinion that their work was not recognised sufficiently by the Department.  In my constituency this body of people are engaged to an even greater extent than people may realise particularly in respect of tomato growing and other aspects of horticulture.  Very often I see these men going out late at night to see whether their plans are proving successful. They deserve to be complimented on the way they have assisted farmers down through the years.  In respect of drainage, too, they have been of tremendous help and they are making rapid progress in their experiments as to what can be produced from our bogs and wetland.  These men who have a high technical ability are prepared to don their rubber boots and raincoats and go out into the field to ascertain the condition of the soil in the various areas.  They are active particularly in areas where celery and other soft vegetables are being produced.</P>
    <P>I could speak for a long time on the cattle trade and its many anomalies, but I shall leave it to some of the other speakers to cover that matter.</P>
    <P>One question on which I want to say a special word is that of the West of Ireland.  For a number of years now there has been much talk about saving the West.  The issue became a sort of swansong and it was one in which I. too, indulged.  The West of Ireland must be saved but before attempting to save it we must get our priorities right.  In my opinion the only way in which farmers could manage to exist in the West would be by engaging in part-time farming on the one hand and in industry on the other.  Instead of flooding the city with industries and thereby creating additional problems for Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council, we should site these industries in the West.  The small <Col N="897" /> farmers could then engage in agriculture only to the extent of providing produce for themselves and their families while they would have an income from their work in the industries. The withdrawing of the dole from single men was something about which I was very grieved but that mistake was rectified partly by certain provisions of the Budget.  However, my point is that it would be much better to create industries in the West in which part-time farmers could be engaged and in which they could encourage their families to become involved.  In that way we would be making an honest effort to save the West rather than just paying lip-service to the idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>As a farmer who comes from the West of Ireland, I am anxious to contribute to this debate. At the outset, I must congratulate the farmers of Ireland on their increased output this year.  They have had to over-produce because of the increases in the prices of everything they buy.  If they are not able to increase their productivity, they have no hope of survival. I am happy to see that our external trade in respect of agriculture has increased but when we enter the EEC and when all the subsidies and grants disappear, I wonder what will be the position of our people.  This is something that I would like to hear the Minister's view on when he is replying.  I can foresee the disappearance of such schemes as the land project scheme and I can foresee the disappearance of subsidies for fertilisers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he had received an explanation from the British authorities regarding the aircraft incident of 29th October, 1971; if he would make a statement on the matter in view of the fact that this incident was in violation of IATA, International Confederation <Col N="898" /> of Aeronautical Organisations and Euro-Control regulations; and whether any further violations have occurred since that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>An explanation has now been received from the British authorities regarding the aircraft incident referred to.  According to the explanation, a flight was undertaken, on the morning of the 29th October, by a Canberra aircraft for the purpose of calibrating radar facilities and this flight involved flying close to the Border. Following our representations, the British authorities examined the navigational records of the flight and they have now stated that the aircraft inadvertently breached our airspace on two occasions.  They have expressed regret at the infringment.  The incident did not involve a breach of the regulations referred to in the Question as these apply to civil aircraft.</P>
      <P>Two confirmed incursions by British military aircraft have taken place since I answered a similar question on the 3rd November last.  One involved a helicopter which penetrated about 800 yards and the other an RAF C130 plane which penetrated less than a mile.  The time spent in our air space was a matter of minutes in both cases. The British Government have expressed regret in the case of the helicopter incident which they say was inadvertent.  The plane incident is at present being investigated by the British authorities.</P>

      <P>Is it not reasonable to assume that the plane did come very <Col N="899" /> close to Dublin city?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>I regard Mr. Wilson's statement at Westminster last Thursday, 25th November, as a serious contribution to finding a way forward by political action.  I particularly welcomed his recognition that the right aim of politics is the unity of Ireland by agreement in independence within a measurable time.</P>
      <P>Some of Mr. Wilson's proposals refer to short-term matters and already have been publicly discussed by, among others, elected representatives of the non-Unionist community in the North; they are the best judges of what they regard as inadequacies in that part of Mr. Wilson's proposals.</P>
      <P>Others of his proposals refer to long-term matters.  Some might be criticised in whole or in part, particularly those that run against the course of history &mdash; re-entry to the Commonwealth is obviously unacceptable &mdash; but the Government's view is that, together, they form a useful basis for further discussion and, as I said, a serious contribution to the subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    <Col N="902" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the proposals that were put forward by Mr. Wilson, in his capacity as Leader of the Opposition, have not met a very satisfactory response, as far as we can see, by the British Government but I take it that the immediate initiative in that respect would be with the British Government.  We certainly will do what is necessary on our part to ensure that these discussions are given a reasonable chance of success.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach can correct that in the reply but since Mr. Wilson's proposals have been followed by the setting up of an inter-party committee in Westminster on the Northern question and, more important than that, since Mr. Heath in winding up the debate on Monday night in the House of Commons said:</P>
      <P>The responsibility also lies on the Republic to show the North the sort of united Ireland which they themselves want</P>
      <P>would the Taoiseach now consider the advisability of setting up a Dáil committee composed of all parties in this House to consider the economic and constitutional implications of a united Ireland, which we all seek, by consent? Would the Taoiseach consider this a worthy initiative in the light of these inter-party developments in Westminster?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did indicate last night that I would favourably consider the setting up of a committee of the parties in the Oireachtas.  I do not think I would go as far as the Deputy suggested &mdash; an economic committee and a committee that would deal with other matters, with a secretariat and all kinds of constitutional and other <Col N="903" /> advisers.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility for policy is a matter primarily for the Government and we propose to maintain that responsibility but, in so far as there have been initiatives now from Mr. Wilson which would seem to suggest the setting up of inter-party committees in Britain and in the North of Ireland, there is every good reason why we should do something along the same lines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if a formal protest on behalf of the Government has yet been made to the British Government concerning the methods of interrogation revealed in <Col N="906" /> the Compton Report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have for some time been in communication with the British authorities on this matter and the Government announced yesterday their decision that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on their behalf, should refer to the European Commission on Human Rights an application concerning recent breaches in the Six Counties, by the British Government, of the Convention for the protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say if, apart from the reference of this very serious matter to the Commission and Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, it is proposed to male a formal protest to the British Government about the extraordinary disclosures that emerged in the Compton Report and the very serious reaction that is felt here at the results of that inquiry and if it is proposed in the circumstances to raise it specifically with the British Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject matter of the Compton Report &mdash; the ill treatment &mdash; has been raised several times with the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As distinct from raising the matter, has any formal protest been made at the manner in which interrogation was conducted and, even accepting &mdash; which I think very few do &mdash;the manner in which the Compton Commission investigated and the terms of its findings, does the Taoiseach not consider that there is in the report of the Compton Inquiry sufficient serious evidence of individual cases which should be the subject of protest to the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These matters have been raised and protested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that on the radio today a British journalist said that the decision to submit the case to Strasbourg was made without any notice to the British Government and that, as far as the EEC was concerned, we seemed to be fighting <Col N="907" /> in our own backyard?  Would the Taoiseach like to comment on this statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I happened to hear that statement and I want to say that as far back as August we first raised this matter with the British Government and have done so continually since then.  We pointed out the need for a form of inquiry that would be acceptable to the complainants and that would be seen to be independent and we pointed out also that the Compton Inquiry, in its form and in its terms of reference, was inadequate. We warned of the possibility of our bringing the matter before the European Commission on Human Rights. We made repeated representations and suggestions to the British Government. We thought that it was best, as between neighbouring Governments, to attempt to find redress in regard to these allegations and an ending of such alleged violence by private diplomacy.  I am sorry to say that we failed to persuade the British Government to respond fairly and adequately to our views. The suggestion that the British Government was in any way taken by surprise is completely without foundation because we told them of the possibility of our going to Strasbourg repeatedly.  With regard to the suggestion that as far as our entry to the EEC is concerned, we and the British would appear to be fighting in our own backyard, it was not we who picked the fight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not follow from what the Taoiseach has said and his own description of the Compton Inquiry, that it justifies the strongest possible protest to the British Government at the whole manner of interrogation in the North of Ireland and the fact that methods have been adopted there that have only been exceeded under Communist or Nazi regimes?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that in diplomatic circles the degree of protest and the seriousness <Col N="908" /> with which a protest is received would depend on whether it was informal or formal and that the highest form of protest one can make is a formal protest through the proper channels? Would the Taoiseach not agree that the fact that no formal protest has been made with regard to these tortures and brutalities means, naturally, that the British Government would not take a protest as seriously as they should and as they might have done had the proper formula been used?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is misleading the House when he tells us the figures are not comparable.  If you want to make them comparable the answer is 47,000 in 1961 and 94,000 now because, by manipulation, you took 27,000 off the figures three years ago.  It is 94,000 now.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The negotiating positions of the four applicant countries on animal health reflect the differences in the health status of livestock in each of these countries.  In the negotiations I have stressed our unique animal health status and the necessity to preserve it. Certain proposals put to us by the Community at last week's meeting at official level fell far short of our requests.  At the ministerial negotiating. session on Monday last I again reiterated our position and asked the Community to reconsider their proposals. Their response is now awaited.</P>

      <P>Is it not the case that the Minister has merely told us they are doing what they think is best for them.  Any fool knows that a country which is negotiating is going to do what is best for itself.  I have asked for specific information about the negotiating position they have adopted. That information is available to the Minister and is not available in the same way to Members of this House. I feel the Minister could have done the House the courtesy of giving information <Col N="915" /> which is useful for preparing arguments and assessing the possibilities of co-operation with the other applicants.</P>

There are certain common positions but there are also different positions but as I have indicated the proposals which have been put forward by the Commission at official level fall far short of our requirements.  The Minister has told the Community at the ministerial negotiations that this is so and he has asked them to reconsider their proposals and we are awaiting hearing from them.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Harbours Act, 1946, responsibility for the deepening, improving and dredging of harbours rests with the relevant harbour authority.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question refers to recent hydrographic and geophysical surveys, commissioned by the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, of areas in the Lower Shannon, including areas off Tarbert.  The Commissioners have informed me that the reports of the surveys show that, in so far as the Tarbert region of the estuary is concerned, depths there have not changed to any significant degree since the last complete survey carried out in 1841 and that they consider that vessels drawing up to 60 feet, taking advantage of the tide to cross the bar at the mouth of the Shannon, could proceed to Tarbert without difficulty. The reports also state that it is feasible to dredge the bar to a level of 80 feet and estimate the cost at between £2 million and £3 million, subject to further trial dredging, site investigations, model studies, <i>et cetera.</i>  There is no indication of the cost of maintenance dredging.</P>

      <P>The Government at all stages over a number of years have taken this up at the highest level in the United States of America right up to the level of President.  I have made this plain before.  Every possible intervention in every diplomatic and non-diplomatic way has been made to ensure that this step will not be taken by the US administration.  The fact is that this step has been taken.  In my statement last Friday I made it quite clear that the demands being made by the US are very exacting demands: they require admission of three US carriers to Dublin from all points in the US together with full onward rights from Dublin for each of these three carriers.  This is the sort of situation which places the matter into perspective as far as the US is concerned and shows the problem we have on hand.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has seen the quarterly economic commentary of the Economic and Social Research Institute with its concern over the high level of unemployment, the expected price rise of over 8 per cent and the balance of payments deficit of over £80 million; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that the views expressed in the commentary referred to are not those of the Economic and Social Research Institute.  The authors are solely responsible for the views expressed.</P>
      <P>As I stated in reply to questions by Deputies Hogan and E. Collins on Tuesday, 2nd November, 1971, it is likely, from such information as is available to my Department, that the deficit in 1971 will be of the order of £75 million.  If exceptional purchases of ships and aircraft are excluded, the balance of payments out-turn for 1971 is expected to be no greater than last year.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy generally to my statement to the Dáil on Wednesday, 27th October, 1971, in which I pointed out that inflationary pressures while still serious have become less insistent.  The rate of increase in consumer prices in the second and third quarters of 1971 was significantly below that of the two preceding quarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are indications, particularly by way of increased redundancies, that certain types of firms have been suffering from slack home demand, recession in certain important markets abroad and other factors.  With high unemployment in the UK and a consequent drop in emigration, the unemployment rate has risen.  The recent expansionary measures were designed specifically to increase employment opportunities by <Col N="925" /> providing a moderate stimulus to economic activity.</P>

      <P>Statistics in relation to income tax are not compiled in such a manner as would enable the information sought to be given.  The Deputy's attention is, however, invited to the sur-tax statistics in Table 77, page 152, of the annual report of the Revenue Commissioners for the year ended March 31st, 1970. This table shows that, for the year of assessment 1969-70, there were 3,025 persons assessed to sur-tax whose total income as defined for purposes of that tax exceeded £5,000.  The table does not provide information regarding the number of persons whose total income exceeded £7,500.  It does, however, indicate that 1,090 persons had total income for the year 1969-70 in excess of £8,000 and 603 persons had total income for that year in excess of £10,000. The income assessable to sur-tax in 1969-70 would to a great extent have arisen in the preceding year.</P>

      <P>The various pensions payable under the Social Welfare Acts are treated as income for tax purposes in common with pensions generally and I do not accept that any injustice exists in this treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income tax is payable only if a person's total income is in excess of the allowances and reliefs to which he is <Col N="929" /> entitled.  No liability to income tax can normally arise in the case of a person in receipt of a non-contributory social welfare pension, the award of which is subject to a means test.  In the case of a contributory pension, liability to tax would not arise unless the recipient had other taxable income. Social welfare benefits, other than pensions, are not treated as income for tax purposes.</P>

The Minister is aware that having done that it is now taxed again by his Department.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I am satisfied with that.  I was asked to raise these two queries.  The Minister has the necessary information to satisfy me that there is no substance in them.  The next matter I want to raise on this section is subsection (3) which increases the lunacy jurisdiction of the Circuit Court up to £5,000 capital and £300 income.  It has been suggested to me that the lunacy jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is not, in fact, availed of to any extent and that it might be a good thing to take away from the Circuit Court lunacy jurisdiction and the wardship of infancy jurisdiction.  The argument put forward in favour of that is that the Office of the Wards of Court in the High Court has specialised machinery for dealing with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, I should like to take this opportunity to say how efficiently the <Col N="943" /> Office of the Wards of Court in the High Court works, how simply it works and how little red tape seems to be associated with it.  For example, I had a case recently where something in the neighbourhood of £20,000 was involved in capital.  The ward, who was brought under the care of the court because of his mental condition, wished to have himself discharged from the wardship of the court.  All that was necessary was for the man to get a certificate from his general practitioner that he had recovered and that he was now able to look after his affairs.  Without any formal application in Chambers, or to the judge, or otherwise, an order was made discharging that man from the wardship of the court.</P>
    <P>Many people including, I think, county registrars consider that they are not really geared to deal with the jurisdiction in the Circuit Court and that, instead of simplifying the work of people who have to invoke this jurisdiction, it is more complicated.  The Minister may tell me that this is a concurrent jurisdiction, a jurisdiction which the Circuit Court exercises and which at the same time can be exercised in the High Court and that it is no harm to have it there.  That may be so. I certainly should like to pay the highest possible tribute to the Office of Wards of Court in the High Court.  This jurisdiction would be better exercised exclusively by them.  It is cheap, simple and informal and I would like to have the Minister's views on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would support Deputy Fitzpatrick some of the way and suggest that lunacy jurisdiction might leave the Circuit Court and be retained exclusively in the High Court for the reasons he has put forward.  I am happy to say that I have had similar experience with the Office of Wards of Court. It is highly efficient, humane and practical.  With the advent of increased jurisdiction to the Circuit Court, the amount of time that is available to the registrar and his staff will be limited and they will have to spend a lot more time on ordinary litigation and preparations therefor.  The advent to their office of something as technical as lunacy matters should be avoided and I would <Col N="944" /> support Deputy Fitzpatrick in saying that lunacy matters should go to the High Court.</P>
      <P>I am not so sure about Guardianship of Infants Acts matters.  Very often the parties concerned reside m the area adjacent to the Circuit Court offices and it might be more convenient for them in connection with the various matters that arise from time to time, that they would continue to have access to the Circuit Court.  The only aspect of wards of court which gives any trouble to practitioners is the Accountant's Office in the Four Courts and I experience considerable complaints regarding that office.  It seems to be undermanned and this results in considerable delays in payments being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I would like to raise in regard to the section is the general point as to whether the courts as presently constructed will be able to cope with the extra volume of work that will come to them.  The Minister has indicated that an extra judge will be appointed in Dublin which is where the greatest backlog occurs but I would suggest to the Minister that with the dramatic increase in jurisdiction now proposed, the backlog will be experienced also in the provincial Circuit Courts.  There must be a careful and detailed look at the structure of the Circuit Courts in rural Ireland to see if they will be able to cope with the increased jurisdiction.  I can say that with regard to the position of business of the Circuit Court in the area with which I am familiar there is a backlog building up.  This is due to the increased number of criminal cases coming to trial.  These cases arise mainly from road traffic matters and are not crime in the normal sense of that word.  With the build-up of criminal work which is necessarily and properly slow it is reasonable to assume the amount of civil work will be increased vastly because this build-up will be increasing and at the same time the civil jurisdiction of the court will be vastly increased.  Consequently, the present backlog will become greater and the position that was intended to be achieved by the Act will not be achieved, that is, to make available speedy justice in all parts of Ireland. <Col N="945" /> The appointment of one extra judge in Dublin will not clear the backlog. It is a common-sense step in the right direction that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court would be increased to the sum proposed in the Bill.  However, I would not like to see the Circuit Court costs following the increase in jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The point of having a Circuit Court and of having a reasonable jurisdiction throughout rural Ireland is to provide easy access to the courts for the public.  It is only right and proper that the public would have access to courts in their own locality and not have the expense of having to travel to Dublin for cases involving fairly substantial sums.  That easy access would be nullified if the expense of going to court keeps pace with the increased jurisdiction.  As I indicated at Second Stage, a Circuit Court action is in no way cheap in terms of costs.  I suppose that in order to avoid frivolous or vindictive litigation, it is necessary that a party losing a case should be punished in terms of cost but, to my mind, the punishment is too severe and the amount of costs in which an unsuccessful litigant can be involved can inhibit people from coming to court with cases that they would be justified in bringing forward.  It forces unjust compromises on people who otherwise would be entitled to and would be able to come to court.  I do not know what the remedy will be. Practitioners complain constantly that litigation is the least profitable part of their operations and no doubt with the increased responsibility that follows the increased jurisdiction, they will regard themselves as being entitled to increased fees for the extra work and responsibility involved.  This is a dilemma to which the Minister will have to give some thought to solving.</P>
    <P>I would not like to see the situation in the Circuit Court that we have in the High Court whereby there are automatically two senior counsel and a junior counsel pleading every case. If, say, an insurance company, who might not be as much afraid of expense as would the ordinary citizen, decide to brief two senior counsel and a junior, the plaintiff would be forced to go into the same position in order <Col N="946" /> to meet that heavy legal artillery and the result could be that litigation in the Circuit Court could be as expensive as it is in the High Court.  That is not what is intended by the Bill.  It would be very undesirable.  It is difficult to know what might be the answer to remunerating practitioners reasonably for their work in the courts while at the same time keeping the cost of litigation at a figure that will not inhibit citizens from having resort to the courts in justifiable cases. Indeed, the day may be coming when there will have to be a panel of State advocates throughout the country and that advocacy and practice in the courts will no longer be a matter for the legal profession.  That would be a drastic development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Be careful of Deputy Fitzpatrick's blood pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick and every honest solicitor practising will be the first to admit and, I think, Professor Kaim Caudle ascertained it scientifically, that litigation is not profitable so far as solicitors are concerned. In those circumstances the profession would not mind the business departing from them.  In any event our main concern must be the right of citizens to be able to go to law with an easy mind and not have to worry too much about the financial consequences. Perhaps at some stage thought will have to be given to the setting up of panels of professional, full-time independent persons who would look after litigation and who would perform functions of advocacy for citizens.  It could be far-reaching and it would mean drastic changes in our legal system.  If any such development were to ensue it would have to have within itself a built-in independence because while the public may criticise the Bar as being one of the main contributing factors to the expense of litigation, nevertheless, the tradition of the Bar and the independent and high ethical and professional standards maintained by them are one of the main guarantees of our liberties. Certainly, if the professional advocates as exemplified by our barristers were to be replaced by any other system, such system would have to be independent <Col N="947" /> so that the present high standards would be maintained for the protection of citizens.  These are some problems I see in relation to the increase in jurisdiction but I do not know how they are to be solved.  Perhaps they will be a matter eventually for the cost committees when they are revising costs of the court in question. Costs would have to be increased to meet the enhanced jurisdiction but I would like the Minister to keep in mind that the increase in jurisdiction is pointless if people are frightened of availing of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3) of the section we are discussing extends to jurisdiction in lunacy matters which was conferred on the Circuit Court by section 22 (2) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961 to cases where the value of property does not exceed £5,000 as against £2,000 at present or the income therefrom does not exceed £300 as against £100 at present.</P>
      <P>This jurisdiction is exercised by the Circuit Court concurrently with the High Court and enables an inquiry under a commission to be dispensed with where the property of the person concerned is within the limits specified. The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure considered that the Circuit Court should retain its concurrent jurisdiction in lunacy matters despite the fact that the jurisdiction is rarely exercised by the court and although they thought the majority of cases would continue to be dealt with in the High Court.</P>
      <P>I might, perhaps, read the relevant quotation from the fifth interim report of the committee, page 16.  They say:</P>
      <P>On the other hand the view has been expressed that it would be in the public interest to have this jurisdiction available at local Circuit Court venues throughout the country, and that such jurisdiction might in the future be more widely invoked particularly as the stigma which formerly attached to lunacy proceedings and which made it desirable to avoid a local venue was no longer apparent.</P>

    <P>Notwithstanding the excellent facilities <Col N="948" /> available in the Office of Wards of Court in regard to lunacy and wardship matters, the committee take the view that it is desirable that there should be also available in the Circuit Court a concurrent jurisdiction in these matters although we believe that the vast majority of the cases will continue to be dealt with in the High Court.</P>
    <P>The committee, with the exception of Mr. Justice John Kenny, recommend, accordingly, that whatever figures are chosen for the increased limits of the Circuit Court's equity jurisdiction should also apply to wardship matters in that court.</P>
    <P>It goes on to spell out the consequential proposed increases that are provided for here in the subsection.</P>
    <P>The thought struck me when Deputy Fitzpatrick was suggesting the dropping of the lunacy and wardship jurisdiction that he was, perhaps, suggesting it on the same grounds as I am suggesting the dropping of the civil jury in section 6 because, basically, I think the point is much the same.  To a great extent, I feel myself guided by the recommendations of the committee. This committee recommended the continuance, for the reasons stated, of the jurisdiction in lunacy and wardship and recommended the abolition of civil juries.  I have no great feeling one way or the other but in view of the fact that all the members of the committee, with one exception, recommended its continuance I would be slow to do away with it.  It does seem to have one practical effect anyway.  It enables an inquiry under a commission to be dispensed with where the property is within the jurisdiction limits.</P>
    <P>One possible solution to the problem that the office work may create in a county registrar's office might be that we might be able to provide, at some future time, that while the Circuit Court would retain its jurisdiction, the actual accounts and the more complicated side of the office work could be done in the Office of Wards of Court in Dublin and that the county registrar would simply have to produce the documents for the judge at the hearing but that he would not be involved in the very technical working-out <Col N="949" /> of the accounts and everything else which he normally would not have staff to deal with.  That might be a solution and if I found that to be a solution I could possibly include it in a Court Officers Bill which I am preparing at the moment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the more general remarks of Deputy Cooney about the question of the Circuit Court, I want to reiterate that it is only in Dublin that there is any serious arrears problem. You may get a backlog from time to time in a provincial area but that can be quickly cleared by the judge sitting an extra week usually.  There is no serious, permanent backlog as there is in Dublin.  The Dublin situation is very disturbing and that is why I have taken the steps that I have taken with regard to appointing an extra judge.</P>
    <P>As far as the reorganisation generally of the Circuit Court is concerned, Judge Walsh's committee recommends in their 12th report a fairly radical reorganisation of the Circuit Court by, in effect, creating two circuits in the country &mdash; Dublin as one circuit with four permanent judges and the provinces as another circuit with six permanent and two itinerant judges &mdash; by &ldquo;itinerant&rdquo; I mean travelling around, not anything else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that two of these judges would hear crime full-time and that the others would be devoted to civil work in particular groups of counties and that each man would stay at his job for a period of two years only and then that he would be moved on either from civil to criminal or <i>vice versa</i> or, alternatively, moved to a different group of counties. Of course, the grouping of the counties under this system could be much bigger because the judges would be dealing with civil work only.  This would give rise to greater efficiency. It would mean that the cases would be heard more quickly and it would also get over the present position where you <Col N="950" /> can have a judge in a particular circuit of, say, three counties for a very long time, for example there is at least one judge on one circuit for over 25 years.  In common with many people I regard this as undesirable no matter how good the judge is because he tends to stamp his own valuation of given injuries on all cases within that circuit.  While I am in no way committed to it and do not want to commit the Government to it until it is more closely examined, at first sight many of the recommendations made by the Walsh committee on this do seem attractive even though it may turn out eventually that some of them just are not feasible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooney said that he hoped we would not see the day when in the Circuit Court with the increased jurisdiction we would have two seniors and a junior.  I certainly very fervently hope we will not see that day because I think it is monstrous that at the moment in the High Court one in practice has to have two seniors and a junior.  The public find it very hard to understand why this must be so.  Quite frankly, I find it very hard to understand why this should be so too.  The public tend to look on this as a bit of a racket because in a very small and trivial case each side is represented by four lawyers&mdash;two senior counsel, a junior counsel and a solicitor.  At the moment, pending the increased jurisdiction, you could have those eight lawyers employed to fight a case in which £700 was involved because until this Bill is passed that would be within the jurisdiction of the High Court. That situation is ludicrous because it will cost a lot more than £700 to pay the eight lawyers.  I find it very hard to defend a situation where the costs, as they fairly regularly are in these types of cases today, are actually more than the amount involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would recoil with horror at the thought that we might have something similar in the new Circuit Court.  The whole purpose of this section would be defeated.  It is basically, I suppose, a matter for the Bar and for solicitors and for insurance companies as to how many they will employ and there is no direct control that I can have over <Col N="951" /> it but I can, I suppose, have an indirect control on the costs question by saying that the employment of more than one counsel should only be allowed on taxation in very unusual circumstances or in some particularly important cases.  I would hope that except in exceptionally important cases no more than one counsel would be employed in the new Circuit Court. Indeed, I would hope that solicitors will exercise their right of audience in the new Circuit Court.  They have it in the existing Circuit Court but do not exercise it very much.  I hope they will exercise it to an increasing degree in the new Circuit Court.  I certainly will do all in my power to see that costs in the Circuit Court will not spiral at a corresponding rate to the increase in the jurisdiction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): In regard to the Minister's remarks about the arguments in favour of transferring the lunacy jurisdiction to the High Court being something analogous to the argument in favour of the abolition of trial by jury in the Circuit Court, I hasten to assure him that when we come to section 6 I will be able.  I hope, to show that an entirely different set of circumstances exist and, indeed, that the third report of the commission on the courts was based on a set of circumstances which do not exist now at all.</P>
      <P>Like the Minister, I do not feel terribly strongly about this because there is concurrent jurisdiction but I agree with Deputy Cooney that perhaps it would be better to leave the minor matters to concurrent jurisdiction but if the lunacy matters were taken away, other functions could be given to county registrars, such as payment out of court of money; affirming of District Court appeals where the notice of appeal has been withdrawn; the ruling on settlements where the people are of full age.  These and several other matters like them which are non-contentious could be taken out of the judges' lists which they are cluttering up at present and be ruled on by the county registrar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has given us the <Col N="952" /> majority report contained in the Fifth Interim Report of the Committee on Court Procedure and Practice where they recommended that the lunacy jurisdiction should be retained in the Circuit Court but, although he referred to it, the Minister did not quote the dissenting recommendation of Mr. Justice John Kenny, who is a very learned judge of the High Court and a judge of great experience.  He recommended to the Minister as follows&mdash; paragraph 7, page 32 of the report:</P>
    <P>I dissent from the recommendation in paragraph 23.  There is a specialised and very competent staff in Dublin which deals with lunacy and wardship matters only and which disposes of them quickly and cheaply.  I see no advantage and many disadvantages in having these matters dealt with in the Circuit Court and I am glad to find that the members of the County Registrars' Association have the same views.  I recommend that the lunacy and wardship jurisdiction in the Circuit Court should be abolished.</P>
    <P>There you have the view of Mr. Justice John Kenny, which is backed up by the recommendation of the County Registrars' Association.  I can tell the Minister that it is not a question of the County Registrars' Association trying to shed themselves of work and to draw salary for doing less work; they are quite prepared to take on, as I understand it, the type of work which I have mentioned, work of a non-contentious nature, and in that way relieve the court lists of items that could properly be dealt with by them.</P>
    <P>On the general discussion by the Minister and Deputy Cooney on the question of costs in the Circuit Court, this argument and discussion flows from the fact that we are now about to pass this Bill increasing substantially the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and are bringing it into operation before rules have been made by the Rules Committee to implement it. The matters that are agitating the minds of the Minister and Deputy Cooney can properly be dealt with under the Rules of Court which will operate this measure when we pass it. I certainly agree that it would be defeating <Col N="953" /> the object of increasing the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and of simplifying legislation if we were to go on as we are in the High Court at the moment with three counsel on each side, but it would be unfair to the solicitors' profession, and especially to the Bar, if we were to conclude the discussion on this section with the impression having been given that there are three or four counsel on each side reaping a rich reward and charging unnecessary fees and that there were unnecessary counsel in court.  With all due respect, the Minister is the last person in the world who should give that impression.  The Minister knows that three counsel are necessary because we have no free legal aid in civil matters.  We all know that in many cases which are litigated in the High Court for two, three or four days, and where the plaintiff loses, that plaintiff walks out of court without having got any reward and in the knowledge that the solicitor and counsel in the case will throw the papers in the wastepaper basket and will never get a penny and, indeed, that the solicitor is at a loss because he has had to finance the court fees and, perhaps, some witnesses who had not enough money to get themselves from the country to Dublin.  That is the reason there are three counsel in a case.  One counsel could not afford to go into court and stay there for four or five days on a &ldquo;spec&rdquo; case without any certainty that he would get anything.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that until such time as we have here, as they have in Northern Ireland and England, a system by which a litigant with an arguable case can get a solicitor from the Incorporated Law Society and where his professional men will be paid out of a State fund, or some fund set up in conjunction with the Law Society and the State, I do not believe we have any right to complain too bitterly about the system we have.</P>
    <P>I do not consider myself in any way obliged to defend the Bar or, indeed, the solicitors' profession, but I should like to be fair to them.  Everyone will agree that if there were only one counsel in a case in the High Court and if he were to stay for four <Col N="954" /> days on a case, his fees would be twice or three times as much as the charge now, or as the taxing master allows. Those are my views.  I certainly believe that when Rules of Court are being made, only in exceptional circumstances &mdash; they would have to be very exceptional &mdash; would two senior counsel be taxed in an action in the Circuit Court and, I may incur the wrath of the Bar for saying this, but I believe that we might go even further and say that only beyond a certain figure should even one senior counsel be taxed in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>We come now to the point of the backlog and the delay in court, particularly in the Dublin circuit.  It would be a great pity if the increase in jurisdiction which we propose to confer on the Circuit Court here were to lead to further delays in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear that the Minister proposes to appoint more Circuit Court judges.  What I am about to say might be more appropriate on the Estimate, but I think it is also appropriate on the appointment of judges.  I would urge the Minister to make sure, when he is appointing judges, that he has accommodation for them because I believe there were rather unseemly, indeed disgraceful, scenes in the Four Courts within the last couple of weeks. Accommodation was being sought for a new Circuit Court judge and, in order to find that accommodation, it was sought to eject the Master of the High Court from the courtroom in which he and his predecessor before him presided for a great number of years. Apparently there was some misunderstanding about that because the Master of the High Court is still presiding in his court but this sort of thing can lead to misunderstanding between the Executive and the Judiciary and quasi-judicial officials.  I understand that it was not only the Master of the High Court who was involved; there are two taxing masters, and, when one tried to get into his office one morning not so long ago, he found a lath had been nailed across the door and the lock had been changed; the key he had did not open the door.  There was an arrow indicating to him that he was to go to another room.  His furniture, his books, <Col N="955" /> his files, the lot, had been shifted out of the room in which he had been presiding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): This is the section which lays it down that if a plaintiff brings an action in the High Court but recovers only damages within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, he shall be confined to <Col N="956" /> Circuit Court costs.  By and large, I agree with that principle but, if the Minister insists&mdash;I hope he will not&mdash; on abolishing trial by jury, under the new set of circumstances in the Circuit Court, I think that certain types of action should certainly be excluded from this rule.  There are types of action in which damages or money are not all-important.  We have the type of action in which the vindication of a man's character is the all-important thing.  We have other actions of a personal nature or involving personal claims.</P>
      <P>The type of actions I have in mind are libel and slander, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution and certain kinds of assault.  These are all actions about which people may feel very strongly.  They may feel that only trial by jury will vindicate their claim. They may feel that such a case can be properly tried only by a jury.  Indeed, the Constitution lays it down that certain types of cases involving the liberty of the subject, criminal cases, must be tried by a jury and only by an amendment of the Constitution can the law be changed in that respect. The dearest thing to a man after his liberty is his good name, his character. In a malicious prosecution or in false imprisonment his liberty could also be at stake.  I am inviting the Minister to say that, if a person recovers damages in the High Court in these cases, then he should be entitled to High Court costs; otherwise, he will win the case, have his character vindicated, or his liberty restored, but he will be at a financial loss.  This is not right. I hope I have got the point over to the Minister.  If the High Court had discretion it would not be so bad. I shall be glad to hear the Minister's views on this.  If necessary, I can come back to it again.</P>

      <P>Under section 12 of the Courts of Justice Act of 1936, the figures of which are being amended by this section, the judge hearing the action has power to grant a certificate that it was reasonable to take the action in the particular court.  In a case in which a judge felt it was reasonable that the case should be tried by a jury he can give that certificate.  The judge <Col N="957" /> has that power, as far as I understand, under section 12.  So far as I know this is done from time to time, it is probably more likely to be done in the future because of section 6 of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in any prior enactment no appeal other than an appeal on law shall lie from any judgment or order of the Circuit Court consequent on a civil action tried by a jury.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment is a peg on which we can argue about the question of juries. I shall deal with what I feel are the technicalities involved in the amendment later.</P>
      <P>I consider section 6 to be a retrograde section as it seeks to abolish the right to have a civil action in the Circuit Court tried by jury.  I do not consider that a good development.  I should like to see the right to trial by jury retained in the Circuit Court for a number of reasons.  The first reason would be relevant to what Deputy Fitzpatrick said in regard to section 5.  I would suggest to the Minister that certain types of actions for defamation of character, malicious prosecution and false imprisonment are such that they can best be tried and the personality issues that may be involved can best be assessed by a jury of 12 laymen. This is particularly so in a case of actions for false imprisonment.  Such actions are infrequent happily in our courts but where they have occurred, to my knowledge, they have occurred where there has been excessive exercise of function by the Garda authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The action has to be taken personally against the member of the force involved in the false imprisonment. The amount of damages involved could be comparatively trivial because the term of false imprisonment would normally not be more than a <Col N="958" /> matter of hours &mdash; a person might have been held for too long in a Garda station &mdash; the amount of damage suffered would be small and damages awarded by the court would necessarily be small also.  The action would lie to be taken in the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and if this section comes into operation the action will have to be taken by the person before the judge only.  It could happen that the person bringing the action might not be a very salubrious character and might not be a person who would command the sympathy of the judge.  I am not saying that the presiding person would be in any way biased against any particular litigant but, nevertheless, if a person is in a position of authority in the State, as a judge is, I feel there is probably an unconscious leaning towards the forces of law and order when faced with an action in which they are named as defendants and a person who, as I say, may not be a terribly attractive character, is the plaintiff but whose rights nevertheless have been infringed.  It is important that person should be able to bring that particular type of action before a jury and let 12 of his peers assess whether or not there was false imprisonment. In the case of malicious prosecution it is an equally personal thing and it, too, is very suitable for trial by jury rather than by judge and similarly with questions of libel and slander.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that if a person has such an action he can get his jury in the High Court but this is where section 5 can have an inhibiting effect.  If a person goes before a jury in the High Court and he is awarded £10, £15 or £20 on an action for false imprisonment where the imprisonment may have been only for a matter of hours, it is the breach of his right and the breach of his status that is really at issue and not the loss he has suffered, it is almost certain he will be punished in costs.  It is very difficult to imagine a High Court judge awarding costs on a High Court scale where the amount awarded by the jury is a small sum.  This is a very strong argument for leaving the right to trial by jury in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Another reason for leaving jury <Col N="959" /> actions in the Circuit Court is that they are a check, if one might use the word, on a judge who might be inclined to be oppressive or who might, as the Minister says, get into certain habits which might be common sense in most cases but in certain cases might work an injustice.  I hasten to say that in my experience judges of the Circuit Court bench have been men of humanity and practicality and I have never experienced the dangers of which I speak.  I can conceive of a situation in which that might occur and it would be of vital importance to the practitioners and litigants resorting to that court that as a check on such things they would have the right to call for a jury.  This is a very important principle especially now with the enhanced jurisdiction.  If a litigant can sue for £2,000, which is a large sum of money, in the Circuit Court it is important that his rights as a litigant be unimpeded and he should have available to him what we who live under the common law regard as the classic guarantee of justice &mdash; a right to trial by 12 of our peers.  It would be a shame if that right were to be removed from the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>I have heard various arguments advanced in support of this section and its proposed deletion of the right of trial by jury in the Circuit Court.  The first argument is that the right has not been exercised.  That may be so but it has to do with the rules and regulations of the court and is no reason for saying: &ldquo;Here is something which is not being used, let us tidy up the situation and cut it out.&rdquo;  The point is, even though it has been exercised only in a small number of cases, once it has been exercised a mere exercise as to tidiness falls down.  In any event, that argument does not hold when one considers that we have to look at the principle involved and not the mechanics. What is involved here is a basic principle of the common law system. It would be wrong to knock such a basic principle merely because there has not been need to exercise the right to trial by jury in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>I have drafted the amendment to deal with another argument which has <Col N="960" /> been raised in support of the Minister's proposition.  It has been argued in support of the proposition that the right to trial by jury be abolished that if there is to be an appeal from the Circuit Court this appeal is by way of a rehearing and it is a fruitless exercise to give a person a right to trial by jury in the Circuit Court if the other contending party can enter an appeal and have the matter reheard by a judge sitting alone; therefore, why not in the first instance have the matter heard by a judge sitting alone? I concede there is logic in that argument. It points to an anomaly in the present appellate system from the Circuit Court.  The answer to that argument is to change the nature of the appeal rather than abolish the jury trial.  It is not the jury trial that gives rise to the anomaly but the nature of the appeal.  Therefore, why not change the nature of the appeal to ensure that the anomalous situation does not arise on the appeal?  I have drafted the amendment to the effect that where the trial by jury takes place in the Circuit Court the appeal will be on a point of law only; in other words, the 12 men who heard the case, as to the facts, in the Circuit Court, will be the final arbiters of the facts.  This is a situation that pertains in the High Court at the moment.  If there is an appeal to the Supreme Court it is an appeal on a point of law.  It may be on a point of law that the jury were perverse and I suppose that impinges on the jury's finding on fact but it is a rare occurrence.</P>
    <P>The answer to the anomaly is to make the appeal in the case of a trial by jury on a point of law only.  I appreciate that this may lead to something the Minister referred to in the other House, namely, that there could be two types of appeal from the Circuit Court.  You can have the appeal on a point of law only where the original trial was before a jury, or you can have an appeal by way of a full re-hearing where the original trial was held by a judge only.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister there is no anomaly in those two different methods of appeal for the reason that in the case where the trial in the <Col N="961" /> Circuit Court is by jury and the appeal is on a point of law only it is only proper to say that if 12 men have heard the facts of the case in the Circuit Court there is no point in appealing on the facts to a single judge in a higher court.  If 12 citizens assess facts in a certain way that should be final and the only appeal is on law.  However, if the appeal is from a case heard by a judge only, it is logical enough to have a re-hearing on the grounds that only one citizen has heard the facts in the Circuit Court.  It is only proper and right that the assessment of one man of what might be a complicated, tendentious set of facts should be subject to review on the facts as well as the law.  However, if 12 men have heard the facts there is no need for a further opinion on the facts.  I would suggest there is nothing wrong in having two types of appeals in the Circuit Court depending on whether the action was heard by a judge only or by a judge and jury.</P>
    <P>My amendment is drafted to deal with this position.  I should like to see the right of trial by jury retained and appeals from such a trial on a point of law only.  If litigants continue to have actions heards by a judge only in a Circuit Court that is all right, but if there is an appeal from that judgment where the trial was before a judge only the present situation should continue because it has within it a second assessment of the facts.  It is a good thing that where the facts were heard and decided on by a single citizen&mdash; even though he is the judge &mdash; they should be subject to review but where they have been heard by 12 citizens their opinions should be good enough.</P>
    <P>I am not very sure about the drafting of my amendment but the idea behind it is to provide that where a jury trial takes place in the Circuit Court it will be final on fact but there can be an appeal on a point of law.  I know that in the other House the Minister made it clear &mdash; and I accept his assurance &mdash; that this is not the thin end of the wedge to abolish juries in the High Court.  If they are relevant in the High Court, equally they are relevant in the Circuit Court, especially as that court now will be performing functions that <Col N="962" /> previously were performed in the High Court and in which juries were involved. If they were not out of order there, surely they are not out of order, and indeed are desirable, in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>It is basic to our common law system that questions of fact, whether the contending parties are the State and a citizen or two citizens, would be submitted to the decision of 12 laymen. It is an admirable thing that the right should be there to check on any judicial excesses that might occur although I said earlier, and I wish to emphasise it again, in my experience these have not occurred.</P>
    <P>It is not a right that will be used frivolously in the Circuit Court.  As I understand the position, an application has to be made to the judge for a jury in a civil action and it does not follow as of right.  It may have been a good thing up to now when the jurisdiction was small that such restriction was there and I do not propose that it be removed.  In fact, it could remain and we would have the best of both worlds &mdash; there would be the right, which would be restricted to some extent by the necessity of making application to the judge, whose decision would be subject to appeal in case the necessity arose.  When the right is there it should be left there; it is bad logic to say that because it has not been used it should be discarded. I would ask the Minister to leave jury actions in the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the amendment of Deputy Cooney and the remarks he has made on this matter.  It has been debated at length in the Seanad.  It is right that trial by jury should be retained in the Circuit Court for the valid reasons outlined by Deputy Cooney.  I do not think the case presented by the Minister has been strong enough.  I welcome many of the desirable and commendable features of this Bill but this is one instance where I do not think the Minister has made a convincing case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This fundamental democratic check and facility available in the system should be retained.  With the extension of jurisdiction there is all the more <Col N="963" /> reason for its retention.  If in the years ahead it is found necessary to bring in amendments, I am sure this House would not prove unduly difficult in facilitating the Government.  However, the Labour Party do not think the views expressed by the Minister carry sufficient weight to enable us to accept this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments put forward today on this point are similar to those put forward in the Seanad.  I dealt at considerable length with these points in the other House; I refer to the Seanad Debates, Vol. 71, column 919 and the following columns, and on Report Stage I dealt with the matter at column 1017 of the same Volume.  It is significant that in the course of his argument although Deputy Cooney made various references to reasons against making this change he did not refer to the report and recommendation of the commission and they were predominantly in favour of the change now suggested in this section and which to a great extent would be negatived, or would entirely be negatived, by the amendment. There were some dissenters, as I remember, from that recommendation but they dissented not on the point that the right to a civil jury trial in the Circuit Court should be abolished, but on the point that it was not also being abolished in the High Court, because the dissenters, of whom Mr. Justice Kenny was one, felt that it should be abolished in all courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise here that what we are talking about is a proposal to do away with the right to a civil jury trial in the Circuit Court and I want to lay emphasis on the word &ldquo;civil&rdquo;. Deputy Desmond referred to the section as doing away with the right to a jury trial in the Circuit Court.  Of course, that is quite misleading because the vast majority of jury trials in the Circuit Court, which are of course being retained, are criminal trials, and the number of civil jury trials in the Circuit Court in the whole country in recent years has been minimal.  I have not got the precise figure, but I said in the Seanad that I thought the figure <Col N="964" /> would probably work out at one a year in the whole country and no serious disagreement was voiced by anybody with that estimate.</P>
    <P>I therefore want to make it clear that what is being proposed in the section itself is the abolition of something which in fact is rarely, if ever, used and that there is no question whatever of the abolition of criminal juries in the Circuit Court.  Lay people might well be easily misled into thinking that this was some sort of fundamental attack on one of the pillars of the legal system.  It is nothing of the sort.  What I am doing simply is following the recommendation of a committee, which one of my predecessors set up to advice on necessary changes in the legal system, and this committee are overwhelmingly in support of what I am now proposing. The committee consisted of Supreme Court, High Court and other judges, and barristers and solicitors, as well as a number of laymen.</P>
    <P>I do not think that in view of the fact that this is a Seanad Bill, initiated there and discussed there at great length, it is really necessary or desirable to go through all the arguments again.  I think they are pretty well known, one of the more obvious of them, and I think the one this amendment is designed to counter, being that under the system of appeal from the Circuit Court, about which the committee made no recommendation for change at all &mdash; they decided that it was a satisfactory system &mdash; the appeal is by way of full re-hearing and this is so whether the trial in the Circuit Court is before a judge, as 99.99 per cent of trials are, or whether it is before a judge and jury, as a small fraction of 1 per cent of trials are.</P>
    <P>One of the practical effects of that is that in the last resort a party can and will have his case heard before a judge sitting alone anyway.  Since there is no recommendation by the committee and there is clearly no need to change the appeals system, it seems to me that it would put those who did have a trial by jury in the Circuit Court, few and all as they are, possibly a dozen people in ten years, at a considerable disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> litigants <Col N="965" /> who follow the normal procedure of having their case heard by a judge alone.</P>
    <P>The particular amendment suggested seems to me also to limit the type of appeal that would be open to a litigant, if I were to accept it, because it would limit him to a far greater extent than a High Court litigant at the moment is limited in the type of appeal he may take to the Supreme Court, so therefore if I were to agree to delete section 6, as acceptance of this amendment would entail, I could not in any event accept the amendment, but I do not want to make any point of that.  The basic principle involved is the important one, and although the amendment is defective in limiting the type of appeal unduly, I still do not accept the principle of having a different type of appeal procedure set up for very few people who take these civil actions.</P>
    <P>I dealt at some length in the Seanad with one of the immediate consequences of an amendment of this kind, which would be to render it necessary for the appellant to get a transcript of the evidence.  The appeal would have to be on a transcript and I think we all know what the costs of transcripts are in civil cases.  We also know the difficulties particularly in provincial areas of getting stenographers.  In fact, I am told that it is extremely difficult and the Circuit Court runs into that problem fairly regularly in relation to the sort of cases where stenographers are needed at the moment.</P>
    <P>One of the problems about this type of appeal is that it would have to be brought in Dublin.  That would be consequential on the amendment.  It could not be brought in the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that for reasons which will appear from the debate in the Seanad, it could not be brought in the local High Court on circuit.  That is dealt with in the Seanad debate fairly fully.  It would have to come to Dublin.  This would be one of the consequences &mdash; I am sure an unintended consequence but it would be a consequence &mdash; but apart from that, <Col N="966" /> from having to come to Dublin, the litigant has the very high cost of the transcript.  We would in fact be put back, with certain limitations, in the pre-1936 position, which at that time was found to be unsatisfactory and costly, and that is why it was changed, and I think it would be strange that a new and better system which has worked very well from 1936 should be set aside now in 1971 and that we should go back to this system which was found to be unsatisfactory prior to 1936 and which unquestionably would be found to be unsatisfactory now.</P>
      <P>So far as the point made by Deputy Cooney with regard to certain types of actions that might more appropriately be tried by a jury is concerned, I want to say, first of all, that I am not convinced that there are any types of actions which would have to be tried by a jury, but if there were actions of a particular kind &mdash; and they are usually defamation, false imprisonment and analogous types of actions &mdash; if there were such an action, where it was clearly appropriate that it should be tried by a jury, it is open to the plaintiff to take his action in the High Court, and under section 12 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, as amended by section 5 of this Bill, there is power to the judge to certify that it was proper and appropriate that the action should have been brought in the High Court and brought before a jury.  I understand that that section is used from time to time and that certificates of that kind are given, and there is all the more reason to believe that where this right would not be open to a litigant within the Circuit Court jurisdiction, a High Court judge would all the more readily give the certificate in order to ensure that the plaintiff could bring his case before a jury where the judge was satisfied &mdash; as he would be in certain types of actions presumably &mdash; that it was a case suitable for a jury and in fact desirable that it should be heard by a jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has seen from time to time cases in the High Court, usually of defamation which, as Deputy Cooney put it, were brought to clear a man's good name and the plaintiff himself, in his case and his counsel's address, <Col N="967" /> in his own evidence and on cross-examination, said that he did not really want any money, that he simply wanted to clear his name.  That type of action has been brought from time to time and where judges have been satisfied that it was appropriate that it should be brought in that court the necessary certificate was given and the plaintiff was at no disadvantage.</P>
    <P>There are many other arguments in favour of what is proposed in the section and against the amendment but as this is a Seanad Bill and as we debated these points at very great length in the Seanad and dealt, I think, with all aspects there of what was raised here, which is much the same, I do not think I need go through all these other arguments.  I feel I have said enough to show that this is a desirable change, that it does not interfere with anybody's rights, that it will assist in the smooth running of the courts and that it will make things generally more efficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): The arguments put forward by the Minister and the reasoning in the third report are not sound because they are based on a set of circumstances quite different from those that will exist when the Bill becomes law.  One of the big arguments put forward in the third report and, I think, by the Minister is that trial by jury is not availed of in the Circuit Court in civil actions to any extent now.  Trial by jury does not exist in the Circuit Court at present and has not existed since the 1936 Act was passed.  I say that because, as the Minister has rightly said, the appeal is to a judge without a jury by way of retrial and, therefore, for all practical purposes trial by jury does not exist. I can tell the Minister, and I am sure he knows from his records or research, that trial by jury in the Circuit Court prior to 1936 was quite a common thing in civil actions, in negligence actions which were not as common then, breach of promise and seduction actions.  You had juries in all of those but with the 1936 Act which said the appeal would be to a judge without a jury there was no point in having trial by jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> Further, the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court was only £300 at one stage and was then increased to £600.  Indeed, one of the arguments put forward in the third report is that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is so small that the discrepancy in the award of damages that might be made by a judge and by a jury would be very little in any case.  That was because the amount of latitude for a difference of opinion was very narrow, only a few hundred pounds.  Here we are creating entirely different circumstances.  We are now deciding that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court will go up to £2,000 and we shall now have substantial actions tried in the Circuit Court.  From what I have read, most of the arguments in the third report are, I think, in favour of trial by jury and commend it and decide that trial by jury shall be retained in the High Court and, in my opinion, only decide it should not be retained in the Circuit Court because its jurisdiction was so small.  But now we are increasing the jurisdiction to £2,000 which means that quite considerable actions will be tried there.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution sets out that trial by jury must be retained in criminal actions.  It must, therefore, have something to recommend it.  It involves the wisdom and the vast experience of 12 men.  I remember a High Court action not so long ago involving a new car which was only on the road a short time.  One of the tyres on the car was bald.  This great point was being made against the plaintiff because he was driving this car, that the tyre was bald. It was hard to understand this because the car was only on the road a short time.  The jury disregarded this point completely and did not listen to it. In the course of conversation afterwards one of them, as they often do and they are not breaking any oath by talking, said they came to the conclusion that when the car was brought into the garage a good tyre was whipped off and a second-hand, worn tyre put on.  Nobody had made the point in court but the jury were probably quite correct; there had to be some explanation and that was the one they selected.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, some judges are known <Col N="969" /> to be plaintiffs' judges and some defendants' judges.  That is no reflection on them; they are only human beings and suffer from human defects and shortcomings.  That is overcome if you have a jury of 12 men who bring their common sense to bear on things.  By and large, jury verdicts are always sound.  I have also noticed that many of the people who gave evidence before the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure which recommend the abolition of juries in the Circuit Court were people who normally act for insurance companies, some of the lawyers.  I do not know what evidence they gave.  I just looked through the list today and saw some well-known names of lawyers who act for insurance companies and probably have an insurance company bias.</P>
    <P>Another argument against trial by jury is that trials take more time.  If the Minister explored the possibility of tidying up trials by agreeing expert evidence beforehand, before the county registrar or somebody else, much time could be saved and only net issues as to who is to blame or who is at fault would be decided by the jury.  As I say, I am not impressed by either of two arguments.  I am not impressed by the third report because I think it contains vast arguments in favour of trial by jury.  The report was made at a time when the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court was small and apparently the arguments took that into consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): One of the arguments, anyway, was that the jurisdiction was such &mdash; I read that in the debate &mdash; that there was not much place for discrepancy between an award of damages by a judge and a jury.  The next thing that occurs to me <Col N="970" /> is that this is the thin end of the wedge.  We will be asked before very long, if an action for £2,000 can be tried by a judge without a jury, why cannot he try one for £3,000 or £5,000? It will be the end of trial by jury.  That would be a calamity.</P>
      <P>The Minister tells us that he has no intention of doing away with trial by jury in the High Court.  If it is necessary to try an action for £2,500, why is it not necessary to try an action for £2,000?  It is hard to follow that line of reasoning.  The Minister says that the appeal would have to be to Dublin.  Even so that will not add very much to the expenses.  On the contrary, it might reduce expenses if counsel were involved, because it will not be necessary to bring any of the parties to the High Court in Dublin.  It will only be a retrial, as the Minister has said, on the transcript of the evidence. There is no substance to that point.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said that the transcripts are expensive.  Admittedly, if the hearings are long you have to pay quite a bit of money for a transcript, but you have to pay for the transcript only if there is to be an appeal.  If there is not an appeal the amount involved is only a few guineas a day and that is invariably paid by the insurance companies because they say they want a transcript and, therefore, they pay for it.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any great difficulty in getting stenographers.  You have to have stenographers at the moment in criminal trials before juries in the Circuit Court.  They are quite numerous.  Certainly they are numerous on the northern circuit where there are trials of smuggling cases before juries and cases before juries arising out of road traffic accidents causing death or serious bodily injury.  Stenographers have to be used in all those cases and there does not seem to be any great difficulty in getting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, if a person decided to pay the cost of the transcript he must think he has good grounds for an appeal or he would not do so.  Indeed, many of these appeals are in cases where the judge has wrongfully &mdash; and by wrongfully I mean contrary to law &mdash; withdrawn the case from the jury.  That is <Col N="971" /> where many of these appeals are.  A party will not be likely to order a transcript and pay for it unless he thinks he got a raw deal and that he will succeed on appeal.  In most of the road traffic accidents it is the insurance companies who will be paying for it. If it is the plaintiff who is appealing, as often as not it is the solicitor who is paying for the transcript because many of his clients will not be able to put him in funds to pay for it.  That is another argument for saying that there will be grounds for an appeal before the transcript is purchased.</P>
    <P>The set of circumstances that we are creating here are totally and utterly different from those that prevailed in the Circuit Court in the thirties or, indeed, up to this date.  It could be argued that £600 is not a very sizeable amount taking into account the present value of money and that the case could be dealt with by a judge without running any risk of a miscarriage of justice.  We are creating a different set of circumstances now in which as much as £2,000 could be awarded.  It is very difficult to see why a jury is necessary in a case involving £2,500&mdash;I will not say £2,001 &mdash; and is not necessary in a case involving £2,000.</P>
    <P>With regard to the wording of the amendment I do not really want to have any long argument about it.  The effect is to delete section 6 and to provide that the system which prevails at present for appeals from trial by judge and jury in the High Court will be applied to trials by judge and jury in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's arguments, I regret to say, have not impressed me.  I do not think he has made a case for the abolition of juries in the Circuit Court.  The first point which he relies on &mdash; and one to which I did not advert when I was moving the amendment &mdash; is that the report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure recommended that juries in the Circuit Court should be abolished. With respect to the gentlemen who comprised that committee, their report, I suggest, contains a certain amount of illogicality.  For example, at paragraph 32 on page 20, they make the point <Col N="972" /> which I made that, in certain cases, fraud, defamation, malicious prosecution, seduction, false imprisonment, a jury is the more satisfactory tribunal. They go on to say they are satisfied that actions of this type which involve a person's liberty are eminently suitable for jury trial.</P>
      <P>All those actions lie in the Circuit Court.  A committee which specifically said that they are suitable for jury trial cannot be guilty of good logic if they abolish trial in a court where such actions can be taken.  The fact that the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure recommended the abolition of jury trial is not, to my mind, an argument in itself for abolishing it.  I have no doubt that there are numerous recommendations from such committees which have come before the Minister and which have not been accepted.  It is a weak argument on the Minister's part that he is following the committee recommendation.</P>
      <P>The committee also said at paragraph 47 that, unless it can clearly be shown that the cause of justice would best be served by either abolishing or severely curtailing the present right to trial by jury in civil actions in the High Court, there is no case for doing so. They went on to say that, in their opinion, not only had no such case been established but they were satisfied that the advantages of civil jury trials in serious cases far outweighed their disadvantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely an action for £2,000 constitutes a serious case and these are the type of cases with which the Circuit Court will be dealing from now on.  My argument for the retention of jury trials is reinforced by this committee. Their statement saying that no case has been established for the abolition of juries was made after they had heard much evidence and all the submissions that were put to them.  I suggest to the Minister that because of the increased jurisdiction proposed, the cases will be serious and that trial by jury should be retained.  I would reject the Minister's argument that the recommendation of the committee is a valid reason for abolishing jury trials.  The Minister makes the point that the amendment limits the appeal from the Circuit <Col N="973" /> Court.  Again, I reject this argument because what the amendment seeks to do is to make the appeal from a jury trial to a judge of the High Court on a point of law only.  That does not limit citizens' rights because the question of fact would have been decided already by 12 men.  At the moment, a full re-hearing lies only when the questions of fact have been decided by one man&mdash; the judge &mdash; and if that should be the nature of the trial in the Circuit Court, my amendment would not affect the present position where there can be an appeal and a full rehearing.  The Minister mentions, too, that if the appeal is to be on a point of law only, the cost of a transcript could be prohibitive.  I do not think this argument goes to the basis of the matter because that factor applies equally now to appeals from the High Court to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the amendment would have the effect of changing the venue of the High Court appeal if the appeal was to be on a point of law only and he referred to the provision of the 1936 Act which sets out that where there is no oral evidence in the Circuit Court, the appeal is to the High Court in Dublin but that where there is oral evidence and there is to be a rehearing, the appeal is to be to the High Court on circuit.  I doubt if it follows from my amendment if the appeal on a point of law following a jury trial in the Circuit Court, would be to the High Court in Dublin.  Oral evidence would have been offered in the Circuit Court and I think the appeal would lie with the High Court on circuit.  In any event, these matters are consequential to the basic principle of whether we have trial by jury.  The Minister said, too, that there would be a trend in this amendment back to the pre-1936 position when, I understand, the system of appeal was to two judges of the High Court and if they did not agree, there was a further appeal to the Supreme Court.  In effect, there were two appeals before a litigant could have finality.  I fail to see how this amendment goes in any way towards getting back to that ridiculous position. I do not think the Minister has overcome the force of argument regarding serious cases such as that highlighted by Deputy Fitzpatrick when he said <Col N="974" /> that in cases of £1,500 there is a right to trial by jury while in cases of £2,000 there is no such right.  I cannot see why there should be a distinction.  It is basic to the common law system we operate here that there be a right to trial by jury and that the facts as between the contending parties would be assessed by 12 persons.  To my mind there has not been put forward any argument to oppose that principle.</P>
    <P>The fact that there may be two different types of appeal is not in itself wrong nor would it result in any injustice. The appeal by way of re-hearing would be in a case where only one person judged the facts and it would be good to have those facts judged secondly by the High Court.  There would be no re-hearing where the facts in the first instance were adjudged by 12 persons and it is logical that their decision would be final but that an appeal would lie on a point of law. I have read the Minister's arguments as put forward by him in the Seanad and they reduce themselves to the points he made here rather more briefly.  I suggest to him that those points do not constitute valid arguments for doing away with something as basic as the right to trial by jury particularly now with the jurisdiction going in effect to High Court jurisdiction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to correct something that I said earlier.  That was that the appeal under this amendment would necessarily be to Dublin.  That is not entirely correct and this is due to one of the defects in the amendment in that it does not specify to where the appeal would be.  Although the overall effect of the amendment is the same as that put down by Senator Kelly in the Seanad the wording used in Senator Kelly's amendment made it mandatory that the appeal was to Dublin.  That is not mandatory here but it would appear that it could be to Dublin as often as not.</P>

I think that an appeal <Col N="975" /> on the transcript, even paying for the transcript, would be cheaper at the present time than a full-blown appeal where one would have to produce, maybe, ten witnesses, some of whom might be professional and receive considerable fees.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I am not basing this argument entirely on the basis that a plaintiff will be likely to get more damages.  I am basing it on the common sense that a jury can bring to bear on a dispute between people.  There have been cases in this country where a plaintiff might have got damages in a libel or a slander action from a judge alone but a jury, taking an overall view of the case and not applying, perhaps, absolutely strict law but bringing their knowledge of people and places and of humanity in general, dismiss cases.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to argue against trial by jury in substantial cases.  The fault does not lie with the jury and neither does it lie to any great extent with the Minister because he has not been in office long enough for that. Rather, the fault lies with his predecessors who did not tidy up the procedure.  The whole argument is that trial before a jury takes too long.  The reason for that is that we have done nothing in this country that would expedite trial of court actions.  We have done nothing to try to agree before going to court on certain evidence that is really non-contentious. Every fact has to be considered in court.  Some solicitors try to agree special damages but there is no reason why, say, an engineer's evidence should not be agreed and the engineer left at home to get on with his work.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Yes, but it is not availed of.  There should be some measure whereby a county registrar or Master of the High Court or some other such person could do it.  Medical evidence, too, could be agreed so that the doctors could be left at home to attend their patients instead of spending a couple of days in court in Dublin against their will.  If that was the case, a trial would not take any longer before a judge and jury than it would take before a judge alone.  I think that is where we are to blame.  We have not made any serious effort to modernise trials or to bring court procedure up to date.  We are doing it now, I suppose, but it is unfortunate that we simply attack the system that has given satisfaction and leave the other slovenly procedures to continue.  The Minister should seriously think about this.  Apparently he has made up his mind and is not open to conviction but it is hard to see the logic of his whole approach unless it is that this is the thin end of the wedge, an experiment to see how it works and then go the whole hog.</P>

      <P>One could say the same about £600 and £601.  One must fix the jurisdiction somewhere.  In fact, I think Deputy Fitzpatrick's argument on Second Stage was that, if anything, the jurisdiction for the Circuit Court should be higher than £2,000.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 7.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the increased jurisdiction proposed by section 7.  Up to now the District Court had jurisdiction up to only £50 and this is quite ridiculous in this day and age particularly as our District Courts are presided over by professional lawyers, not like in England where the magistrates' court is composed of a bench of laymen advised by a professional clerk.  Indeed, in the District Court, the standards of advocacy and litigation generally are quite high enough to warrant this increase in jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>This is a very sensible increase as it will bring the venue to all parts of the country for a great number of small claims, claims probably arising from traffic accidents, and will ensure that these can be heard in the person's local town or village, as the case may be.  The increase in jurisdiction will bring certain problems with it, such as problems of staffing in the District Court office, in the sense that District Justices may not have sufficient time to deal with the increased work the enhanced jurisdiction will bring to their courts.  It will also bring problems of costs.  It will bring problems as to what, if anything, is to be done about the question of pleadings in the District Court.</P>
      <P>On the question of staffing, I should like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the universal efficiency of District Court clerks.  I have never yet met a District Court clerk who was not absolutely and completely on top of his job, <i>au fait</i> with all the rules and regulations and all the laws pertaining to District Court practice.  I have no doubt but that this able group will be able to deal without any difficulty with the increased work which will come in their way.</P>
      <P>Whether or not there are enough District Justices to deal with the increased jurisdiction and the extra work involved in that increased jurisdiction is a moot question.  It is common experience in the District Courts that the amount of trivial criminal business is on the increase; road traffic prosecutions are on the increase and the average District Court day is now taken up, as to 90 per cent of it, with road traffic prosecutions of one kind or another, even trivial ones for defective lights, no tax, and so forth.  These things take time as they have to be proved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a dangerous driving or drunken driving charge is added, invariably the business of the court goes on after lunch non-stop up to four o'clock, or thereabouts, and unless the sittings are increased there will not be time to deal with the increased civil business. If the number of sittings are increased, will there be, I wonder, enough justices to deal with these increased sittings? Occasionally justices may have half days, but these are not sufficiently frequent or regular to enable one to say that they could be appointed specially for civil business.  There will have to be, as there is in some <Col N="981" /> court districts at the moment, a division between days.  There will have to be a summary day and a civil business day.</P>
    <P>At the moment civil business and police business are done on the same day in most towns.  This has proved fairly satisfactory but, if a contract and to case, involving jurisdiction up to £250 comes into the District Court, a special day will have to be set aside to deal with this because I cannot see how any of these actions could be heard in any District Court together with the police business that has to be done there.  There will have to be separate days for civil business with no other business listed for those days.  If this is done, it could happen that there would be days when the civil list would collapse due to settlements and unexpected adjournments, but that is a risk that will have to be taken.  I think this will involve the appointment of extra justices.  There is nothing to indicate the Minister's mind in this matter and I should be interested to hear what he has to say about it.</P>
    <P>Another point that will have to be considered is the question of costs in the District Court.  At the moment the kind of costs in which an unsuccessful litigant will be involved are reasonable and are such that no man will be deterred from taking his case to the District Court.  The responsibility of practitioners will be increased with increased jurisdiction and there will have to be some compensation for that increased work.  This is the old dilemma I mentioned when speaking on section 2.  How will the Minister remunerate practitioners adequately and, at the same time, avoid making the court too expensive?  This will have to be left to the good sense of the costs committee.  However, I would emphasise that this is something that will have to be decided before the Act comes into operation.  The Act is scheduled to come into operation on 1st March next and, in effect, we have only two months in which to change the costs and make any other consequential changes necessary in the rules of the District Court.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister propose to regulate civil procedure in the District Court?  Will he set up a form of pleading <Col N="982" /> akin to that pertaining in the Circuit Court or will he leave it as it stands?  In normal civil business a statement of claim can be expressed rather informally and I have not so far seen any objection taken to it.  There is, I think, a very sensible decision of the High Court on this question of pleadings.  Excessive formality and excessive detail are unnecessary so long as the cause of action is clearly shown and can be clearly seen.</P>
    <P>The only thing that is lacking in the rules at the moment is provision for notice of particulars.  At the moment, so far as I recall, there is provision for notice for particulars only in an action for liquidated damages arising out of contract.  In that case the defendant can serve a notice for particulars and it is provided in the rules that these must be given before judgment can be made.  There is no such provision in the case of unliquidated claims and, if the jurisdiction goes to £250, it is essential that such provision should be made.</P>
    <P>Whether there is any need to put in formal heads of defence is something on which I have an open mind.  So far, lack of a formal defence in the District Court has not inhibited trials and has not, in my experience, told against defendants.  While I say that there is no provision for notice for particulars, they have been issued and practitioners generally have answered such notices as between each other and the issues have been very well defined in advance, sufficiently well defined for a satisfactory trial.</P>
    <P>If the present form of civil process, with an informal statement of the cause of action, is retained, and provision for notice for particulars is inserted into the rules in the case of unliquidated claims, these two documents would be sufficient to get the matter to hearing and have the issues clearly defined beforehand.  I do not think the notice for particulars should be in any particular form.  I think it should just take the form of a letter of request setting out the matters requested. If there is any dispute as to what should be furnished or not furnished, as in the High Court, I think that matter will have to be decided by <Col N="983" /> the court when the case comes for hearing.  The court will decide whether it is a matter of evidence or a matter of furnishing particulars in advance.</P>
    <P>It would be a pity if the smooth and easy procedure of the District Court, which can, and has been, operated by laymen, were stifled, made too cumbersome or too technical.  If these points are dealt with I look forward to section 7 of this Bill making a great change, a change for the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the extension of the jurisdiction of the District Court but I think it should be extended still further.  Certain matters have been brought to my attention at constituency level by members of the legal profession. I suggest the Minister should also include in the jurisdiction applications for licences under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, malicious injury claims up to £1,000&mdash;an arbitrary figure, but these are relatively small claims now &mdash; and valuation appeals and appeals from decisions of local authorities in respect of such matters as closing orders, which are local matters.  If the District Court has power to grant a money-lender's licence, a public dancehall licence, a bookmaker's licence on appeal from a Garda decision or an off-licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor then it could usefully and effectively have jurisdiction in the matters I have just suggested. Too much song and dance is made about applications for intoxicating liquor licences in the Circuit Court.  It should not be necessary in 1971 to have all the ceremony and paraphernalia surrounding these applications in the Circuit Court.  One would think an application was being made to open a publichouse on a new planet.  A great deal of the time of the gardaí is spent dealing with such applications.  The District Court can grant an order for the payment of rates up to any sum and the Minister might bear this fact in mind.  The matters I have mentioned could usefully come within the jurisdiction of the District Courts.  If this extended jurisdiction was given it would take a good deal of work away from the Circuit Courts which are grossly overworked and it would expedite the work of the courts in <Col N="984" /> general.  As many members of the legal profession and local authority officers have to travel great distances in and out of the Dublin area this measure could be useful in rationalising much of the work which has to be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Like Deputy Cooney, and to a certain extent Deputy Desmond, I approve of an increase in the jurisdiction of the District Court.  I would have gone a little further than the £250 but at any rate it is a move in the right direction. I wonder if we have room to implement section 7.  I agree with Deputy Cooney, it would be a pity if we had to have any formal pleadings because that would be taking away from the advantages that this section will confer on litigants who wish to litigate on comparatively small matters.  At the same time the rules of court should make some provision for an informal exchange of letters which would clarify the issues at stake, otherwise a plaintiff will have to come to court and prove every single item or he might find himself being dismissed on the grounds that some formal proof had not been complied with.  This difficulty could be got over by providing rules of court which would stipulate that the plaintiff could serve a notice on the defendant asking him to admit certain facts or <i>vice versa</i> and the other side would be obliged to answer such a notice.  In my opinion it would not be necessary for this notice to be filed on the court files but it would be necessary if this exchange of letters took place between the parties.  In that way certain formal proofs might be dispensed with and certain expenses might be avoided.  There is not any proper procedure in the District Court at the moment for making a lodgment with the defence.  It can be done but I do not think there is any proper procedure there.  Here again the rules of the District Court will have to be revised because as from now that court will be dealing with more substantial claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are handing over to the District Court jurisdiction to give decrees up to £250 in contract and tort and indeed up to £1,000 in certain other matters, but I do not think there is any machinery by which a District Court decree <Col N="985" /> can be converted into a judgment mortgage and that is essential.  Garnishee procedures are available in the Circuit Court.  There is also a procedure for recovering an amount due by way of appointing a receiver and by way of attachment and charging orders.  A similar procedure will have to be written into the rules of the District Court otherwise this will be a court with power to grant decrees up to £250 but with no real machinery to enforce those decrees.</P>
    <P>Suppose a claim is brought in the District Court on behalf of a minor and he gets a decree for £250.  How is that minor going to be protected?  Is the money to be handed over to the guardian and if so is there any guarantee that he will not spend it foolishly or spend it otherwise than for the benefit of the minor?  Is there any guarantee that if a minor of 16 years gets a decree for £250 that that sum will be there when he is 21?  There is no machinery in the District Court at present, of which I am aware, to deal with this and it will have to be provided.  Perhaps it will be decided to transfer this to the Circuit Court and be lodged there for him.  Something will have to be done or otherwise it will not be possible to proceed in the District Court on behalf of a minor and be sure that the minor will be protected.  Most parents would lodge the money in the post office or some such place but some parents are living from hand to mouth and if they get their hands on a sum of money like that they might use it for the payment of general household expenses rather than for the benefit of the minor.</P>
    <P>These are matters which strike me in relation to this section.  Provision should be made for some form of informal pleadings, not unnecessary pleadings, but pleadings that will cut down the issues that are really at issue and thereby avoid the necessity of bringing unnecessary witnesses to court.  If the defendant finds the plaintiff in court minus some formal witness he would be very foolish not to avail of it.  If the procedure that I have suggested were adopted that could be sewn up beforehand.  There is also the question of enforcing District Court decrees and the question of a minor.</P>
    <Col N="986" />
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The section has been generally welcomed.  Most of the comments on it have been to the effect that the District Court should be given jurisdiction in matters in which it does not have jurisdiction at the moment, but of course any such extension of jurisdiction to different types of cases as opposed to this increase in monetary jurisdiction would be matters for Bills appropriate to the branches or codes of law involved.  For example, if it were decided to give the District Court sole jurisdiction in licensing &mdash; it has jurisdiction at the moment in every type of licence application except in applications for new on-licences and for new club licences &mdash; the amendment would have to be made in a licensing Bill rather than in a Bill of this kind. I am not saying that the suggestions put forward were not worthy of consideration. Most of them were, but their implementation would be a matter for a Bill appropriate to each sector of the law rather than to a general Bill of this kind which deals with monetary limits.</P>
      <P>The second major point was in relation to procedures or possible changes in procedure under the proposed increased jurisdiction.  These procedures would be a matter for determination in the rules of court by the District Court Rules Committee.  It is not a matter for me to initiate changes in the rules.  No doubt the committee shortly will send me new rules for my concurrence.  Broadly speaking, I agree with what has been said today as to the type of rules that might be desirable. I agree that no more elaborate pleading system should be introduced than exists at the moment because it seems to be satisfactory and simple to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had been under the impression that there was provision for a notice or a letter for particulars in the District Court but I understand from Deputy Cooney that there is not.  In practice, most practitioners write and reply to these letters as a matter of course and I do not think there is any great problem there.  If a reply was not forthcoming, I should imagine they would apply to the justice to adjourn the case until it is forthcoming.  In order <Col N="987" /> to give that usual procedure full backing, I am sure that the District Court Rules Committee will avail of the opportunity to make a rule to that effect.</P>
    <P>So far as lodgments are concerned, there would be two courses open to the committee.  Either they could make new rules under which lodgments could be made and retained in the District Court for the benefit of the minor, or they could arrange to have such moneys transferred to the Circuit Court accounts.  I do not envisage that it would be necessary to apply in the Circuit Court to get the money out.  It would be necessary to go only to the District Court and when that court granted an application for payment the Circuit Court would forward the cheque to the appropriate person.</P>
    <P>These are matters for the rules making committee and I look forward to receiving the rules as soon as possible.  The Bill has been published since last June and the committee are aware in broad terms of the likely outcome.  Although there have been some amendments to the Bill, they did not go to the root of the Bill and the jurisdiction changes are the same as when published.  I should imagine the committee have made a fair amount of progress and I do not anticipate that there will be any problem in having the rules ready as from 1st March.</P>
    <P>The new jurisdiction and procedures laid down by the Bill will apply only in respect of cases commenced on or after 1st March so that it would be some months later before some of these cases would come for hearing.</P>
    <P>I have covered in a general way most of the points raised.  Deputy Cooney referred to the staffing of the District Court under the increased jurisdiction.  We recognise that there will be increased work and I am providing some additional staff.  I cannot say how many at the moment but they are easily recruited.  So far as the sitting hours of justices are concerned, at the moment they seem to me to be remarkably uneven.  I have seen a return for 1970 of the hours put in by each justice and there seems to be extraordinary discrepancies between them.  These figures are not comparable <Col N="988" /> because some justices are very fast and some are very slow but in some cases justices appear to sit five times as long as certain other justices although on the face of it the areas appear to be similar in size.  These figures are not comparable and they could be misleading because some justices will do as much in one hour as another would do in four hours.  I am not saying that the man who is going quickly is not doing his job properly. He may be doing it as well if not better than the man who takes an excessive length of time.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure have made some recommendations with regard to re-organisation of the District Court.  I have not studied them in detail but my impression from their 12th interim report is that if a reorganisation on the lines they suggest is carried out extra district justices would not be necessary but some increases in staff would be necessary.  If it is necessary I shall appoint another one or more additional district justice.  I am inclined to think we might solve problems by changing around the districts to make the burden of work more evenly distributed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with enforcement of court orders.  I would draw the attention of the Minister to what might be called the most unsatisfactory part of District Court activities, namely, the collection of debts pursuant to the Enforcement of Court Orders Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister knows, the procedure is to obtain a decree, which is simple and not fraught with technical difficulty.  If the debtor is unlikely to produce anything to the sheriff the plaintiff can apply for an instalment order.  This is an order which requires the defendant to attend in court on a day specified in the order to be examined as to his means with a view to the district justice making an order for <Col N="989" /> so much per week.  It is necessary to allow 21 days service of the order.  My experience is that in nine cases out of ten it is ignored by the debtor.  The district justice then has to rely on what he is told by the plaintiff's solicitor as to the defendant's means and he then makes what he thinks is a fair order, having regard to whatever scanty information is before him.  He makes what is called an instalment order for the payment of the debt, usually by weekly instalments of whatever amount is fixed which he thinks is fair.  This order is also served, and in theory, the debtor should then commence paying the weekly sum.  If he does not do so, plaintiff's remedy is to issue a summons to have him attend in court to show cause why he should not be committed to jail for his failure to pay the weekly instalments.</P>
    <P>As described, that seems a simple enough and speedy enough procedure, but in practice it is extremely cumbersome. After the committal summons is served, the debtor at that stage will begin to sit up and take notice because he is in danger of being put away.  He will probably come in and plead that the original order made was too high for him to meet and seek to have it voluntarily reduced.  He may come into the District Court to make this plea to the justice and the justice may vary the instalment order down to an amount expressed to be equitable by the debtor.  Again, he may make a few payments and then fall down, and it is necessary to start the whole procedure over again.  I wonder has the Minister ever considered in some way streamlining this collection of debts. While it may seem a trivial enough matter in relation to the general business of the courts, as far as merchants up and down the country are concerned, it is a matter of considerable importance that they are able to get after the defaulting debtors in an effective and speedy way.</P>
    <P>At the moment these matters have to be dealt with by solicitors through solicitors' offices and it is my experience that there is no solicitor who wants to deal with the enforcement of Court Orders Act procedure.  It is expensive in the sense that it involves <Col N="990" /> the expenditure of a considerable amount of court fees, paying stamps on various court documents to be served, paying a summons server if there is a summons server in the area, and fees to commissioners for oaths and, in addition, there is quite an amount of work in preparing affidavits of debts, of service and the various other documents.  At the end of it all, the solicitor may find himself collecting 2s 6d a week or not even in regular weekly payments, having to keep books and submit accounts to the creditor.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister might consider putting the actual collection of the debt, or the operation of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act procedure, in the hands of the District Court office.  These offices are highly efficient and I do not think they would be unduly burdened by having this extra work put into them.  I think, too, that the matter has been dealt with entirely by the court and there is no solicitor acting as a buffer between the parties and the eventual sanction of the court would ensure more speedy collection and a better rate of payment, and this is what the Act is all about. I put that suggestion to the Minister for consideration at a future date or perhaps even for a new Part of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Cooney that the present enforcement procedures are unsatisfactory and over-elaborate. I understand that the District Court Rules Committee have draft rules in hand which would simplify this considerably.  I have not yet received them, but they did say it would be necessary to amend the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts and if an amendment was made, as it were, taking the procedure out of the Acts, their draft rules, if I then concurred in them, could come into operation and could of course, be amended more easily. I certainly would be willing to fall in with their proposals, in general terms anyway because I do not know the details, to simplify this procedure, and since I think it would be necessary to amend the Judgment Mortgage Acts to enable judgment mortgages to be registered on the strength of District Court decrees, I might at the same <Col N="991" /> time, provided I got the draft rules at that time, be able to incorporate with that the necessary amendments of the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): We had a discussion on this on Second Stage.  I know, and I am sure the Minister knows, that the District Court bench and the District Court Clerks Association are not entirely satisfied with this section, or at least with this section taken in conjunction with the next.  The District Court is now to become a court of record, and whether it is for this House, or for the Oireachtas, to provide the machinery by which these records are to be kept or whether that again is a matter for the rule making committee &mdash; it is probably more a matter for the rule making committee &mdash; it is felt that provision should be made for registering District Court decrees.  There is no such provision at present.  Probably what I want to say could more properly be said on section 14 but the Minister will appreciate that the converting of the District Court into a court of record does impose further considerable obligations, work and duties on District Court clerks and in that event, perhaps, the status of District Court clerks should be upgraded and the salaries accordingly adjusted.  I hope that the District Court Rules Committee will make proper rules for retaining the records, because as the matter stands at the moment, we are simply saying that the District Court is to be a court of record and not imposing on anybody any obligation to keep records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 14, the District Justice has to sign an order, if it is required.  I think that in the vast majority of the cases no orders are <Col N="992" /> required, and I should like the Minister to say whether the old minute book is to be scrapped or whether it is to be retained.  There was not very much detail put into that book but it certainly was a book in which the issue before the court could be found and the decision of the court could be found, and the order could be made up years afterwards from this minute book.  Perhaps the Minister would deal with that in a general way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The two sections are really bound up together and, with your permission, Sir, I will have to talk about section 14 as well, because this section in conjunction with it proposes an amendment of the present law related to District Court orders and records which was recommended by the District Court Rules Committee. Under section 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 1951, a justice of the District Court is required to enter concisely in a minute book, or a charge sheet in the Dublin Metropolitan District, his decision in every case of summary jurisdiction.  He must also sign each entry which is then held to be the decision of the court.  The entry made by the justice is only <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the decision and the court's decision can be upset on <i>certiorari</i> proceedings if there is any mistake or omission in the entry in the minute book.  As a result of this, it is necessary for justices to make elaborate and time-consuming entries and it is possible to get the High Court to upset perfectly good decisions of the District Court on technicalities in regard to entries in the minute book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed in section 13 to declare the District Court to be a court of record.  This appears to be the present position, although there is no statutory enactment similar to section 21 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, which was formerly section 47 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924, which provides that the Circuit Court should be a court of record.  In section 14 it is proposed that in any proceedings relating to a decision of the District Court, regard will be had only to a formal order drawn up by the District Court clerk and signed by the justice. The section will ensure that orders will <Col N="993" /> be drawn up and signed only when required and the provision for the drawing up of the orders by the District Court clerk gives statutory effect to the present practice, and I may add that section 14 is on the lines requested by the District Court Clerks Association&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Subject to one thing, that they wanted it to go a bit further and that they themselves would sign the order, but I amended section 14 in the Seanad to meet in part their request.  I cannot see a justification for relieving the district justice of final responsibility in the signing of his own orders.  This has been a feature of the District Court system for a long time and while it is true that it contrasts with the position in the Circuit Court where the others are signed not by the judge but by the county registrar, the important distinction is that the county registrar is a legally qualified person of at least eight years standing and usually a good deal more than that.  It is probably fair to say that these two sections, which are there at the request of the District Rules Committee, have the agreement of justices and subject to one fairly minor point, have the approval of the District Court Clerks Association also.</P>

As I see it, it is very seldom that an order of the District Court will be required at the time but if we are making it a court of record it could be required certainly within five or six years.  A District Court clerk may have died or a justice may have died and if no record was kept at the time I fail to see how an order can then be drawn up.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The District Court clerks feel very strongly that they should be empowered to sign these orders and I think the district justices feel the same way.  Otherwise, it could mean delay in having the order signed as it might mean sending the order backwards and forwards through the post.  The Minister has said he does not think District Court clerks should be entrusted with the signing of these orders because they are not professionally qualified. The standard of our District Court clerks is exceptionaly high.  One is impressed by their standard even if they have not the benefit of formal legal training and do not hold legal qualifications.  They are entrusted with so many other things that they could well be entrusted with signing these orders.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> Section 15 has the commendable motive, as the Minister explained in the Seanad, of enabling speedy proceedings to be taken in the District Court in an emergency situation.  The example he gave there was where it might be necessary to issue a summons consequent on an outbreak of foot and mouth disease so as to get very quick remedial action.  One can understand the need for a quick procedure and, indeed, if one thought about it one could agree that there is a need for a fast procedure.</P>
    <P>Of course, such a procedure carries within itself certain elements of danger.  The section as drafted lets these dangerous elements in.  I have no quibble with the Minister's anxiety to get a speedy hearing of an urgent matter, but I would be anxious to ensure that that speedy hearing, and the procedure for it, would not lead inadvertently to a situation where there could be what, in effect, would be private, secret courts.  I would suggest to the Minister that, as drafted, this section could allow that to happen. My amendments are designed to ensure that, while a speedy hearing could take place, it would have to be in a normal place, in a normal courtroom and that the normal organs of publicity would be alerted.</P>
    <P>Section 15 (2) (b) gives a justice of the District Court power to hold the court at a time or place not standing appointed.  In other words, it gives him power to direct that this summons be heard in a place other than a courthouse within his district or within his area.  I have no quibble with the provision giving him jurisdiction to deal with it in any court area within his district.  That is quite sensible.  I would complain about the provision giving him power to deal with it at a place or a time not standing appointed.  That is extremely dangerous.  It is too wide. It opens the door completely to secret and altogether too sudden courts.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At a place&rdquo;&mdash;that could be anywhere within the district of the justice. It could be in his own home.  Worse still, it could be in a Garda station.  It could be in a caravan.  There is an endless list of unlikely places where it <Col N="998" /> could be heard.  More than likely as a matter of convenience, the justice will direct that the short summons should be heard in the nearest courthouse, but there are so many courthouses in every District Court area that there would be no hardship, and it would not in any way cut across the intent of the section, in specifying that these summonses should be heard in a courthouse.</P>
    <P>It would be altogether wrong if they were to be heard in the justice's own home or, worse still, in the Garda station, or in an office of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. These summonses should be heard only in a courthouse.  Every district has a courthouse.  There would be no hardship on the justice or the party in directing the summons to a courthouse. In the end it adds to these proceedings that they should take place in a place which is usually, although not always, laid out as a courthouse.  This helps the dignity of the proceedings.</P>
    <P>There is provision for the justice specifying the time being a time other than a normal court time.  If this is to provide for a speedy trial of an urgent matter it is reasonable enough that the justice should have power to say that the summons would be heard at 5 o'clock in the evening rather than at 11 o'clock in the morning, the normal sitting hour of the District Court. Nevertheless, I should like to see the actual time of the sitting specified on the summons originating the proceedings&mdash;and that is the purpose of amendment No. 5&mdash;so that the defendant will be adequately warned as to the time of the sitting.</P>
    <P>I suggest, too, to avoid any danger that this procedure might be used for holding secret courts, that a copy of a summons issued pursuant to this section should be sent to the editor of the newspaper published nearest to the place of the sitting.  There is no compulsion, and newspapers are not served with notice of existing District Court sittings.  They are notorious in the sense that they are a matter of public knowledge and newspapermen can be present.  I think it is essential, particularly with the dangers that are contained within this procedure, that <Col N="999" /> organs of public opinion should be aware of where these sittings were taking place.  I remember an outcry some years ago when a prosecution for drunken driving, I think it was, was held in the District Court&mdash;I forget the personalities involved but I remember hearing about it at the time &mdash;in Dublin, I think it was, in the afternoon long after the normal sitting had ended.  There was considerable dissatisfaction that that should have happened.  Of course, it was quite illegal that it should have happened.</P>
    <P>One could imagine a situation where, perhaps, powerful personages might be involved and there would be a temptation to invoke the powers under this procedure, or the type of offence specified under this procedure might be the one in question and the procedure here could be invoked and there could be a speedy trial in an unusual place at an unusual hour.  This would be contrary to our system and it would be most undesirable.  The Minister's reasons for wanting this are good.  He gave an example in the Seanad, a rather unlikely one, perhaps, but I gather this is where the need has come from.  I do not quibble with the principle but I think it should be hedged around with guarantees to ensure that it will not lead to secret courts in unsuitable places at odd times.</P>
    <P>My amendments are designed to ensure that the place will be a courthouse, that it will not be secret in the sense that the nearest newspaper will have notice of the procedure and that the time will be specified in the summons so that, while the newspaper may be served with notice of the sitting, if it is in the summons the newspapermen will see precisely the time and cannot arrive when everybody has gone home.  I propose in amendment No. 3 that the sitting will be only at the place and at the time to be specified in the summons.</P>
    <P>I am in some doubt&mdash;I did not consult the District Court rules&mdash;but I recall that the District Court rules give the justice power to abridge the time of service of the summons and to provide for substituted service in certain cases.  I wonder has the Minister <Col N="1000" /> examined the powers in the District Court rules and satisfied himself that they are lacking and do not enable the justice to do what is required in the emergency envisaged by this section. It would be altogether preferable if the rules could provide for it and avoid the necessity of introducing this section.</P>
    <P>I am not against the principle because I can see the need for it, but it is such a novel principle that I think it should be hedged around with restrictions of the type aimed for in the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take amendment No. 2 first.  I am afraid the amendment is not acceptable since it would make it mandatory on justices to hold sittings in a building that is called or generally recognised as a courthouse.  Very frequently this is not possible and the eventuality of normal court accommodation not being available and alternative accommodation having to be used must be provided for.  In any event, courthouses are not appointed for sittings.  I have the duty of appointing the places at which the District Court shall sit in each District Court area and of appointing the days and the times but &ldquo;place&rdquo; does not mean a physical building.  It means the town or village of X.  I have no duty in regard to the actual building in which the sittings are held other than to ask the local authority to provide accommodation, a task in which I regret to say that I am unsuccessful regularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accommodation which is provided by the local authority is very often premises of one kind or another which by no means could come within the description of a courthouse.  Such places as dance halls, lounge bars with the bar cut off, church halls, libraries, fire stations and even sheds are provided for this purpose from time to time by local authorities.  The accommodation may be leased by the local authority for appointed sitting <Col N="1001" /> days only and may not be available on other days for special sittings in which event the local authority would have to make alternative arrangements. This is usually the case when part of a hotel or when a dance hall or some such place is used.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am afraid that for these reasons, amendment No. 2 would not be feasible and I am sure the Deputy would accept that.  So far as amendment No. 3 is concerned where the Deputy seeks to add the words &ldquo;and at the hour specified in the summons and hereinafter provided for&rdquo;, this proposed amendment is unnecessary because it proposes that a sitting of the District Court to deal with these sort of urgent cases under this section will be at the hour specified in the summons.  This as it were, is putting the cart before the horse.  The justice must fix the time of the sitting and the summons then must be for whatever time the justice fixes.  One cannot have, for example, a situation where a sitting is fixed for a day without any time in that day being specified.  Equally, of course, the summons without a time on it for the court would be invalid. Therefore, the necessity for the amendment does not arise.</P>
    <P>I would find it difficult to accept amendment No. 5 for much the same reasons.  The proposal that the summons should specify the hour of commencement of the sitting is unnecessary for the reasons that I have given and also because the prescribed form of the summons provides already for this.  I see no grounds for giving newspapers or any other third party entitlement to copies of summonses in the type of case envisaged by section 15 or, indeed, in any other type of case. If copies of summonses were to be provided for newspaper editors the same right could be claimed by any other citizens who might say they were interested.  I can appreciate the fear on the part of Deputies that newspapers might not be aware of a case under the section but I think that fear is groundless because a case under this section will, in the normal way, be arranged for a prescribed sitting of the District Court in an area other than the area in which the offence is committed, but <Col N="1002" /> which comes within the justice's district. On occasions it may be necessary to list such a case for hearing at a special sitting but the number of occasions on which it would be necessary to have a special sitting in the sense that the justice would have to sit in a particular place where he would not otherwise sit, would be very few because in any event a justice would be sitting on most days of the month, excluding Saturdays and Sundays.  Therefore, the obvious place where one of these summonses would be taken would be at some place where he would be sitting on the appropriate day, say, the third day after the service of the summons.</P>
    <P>Special sittings are held by justices in areas where the work is very heavy for the purpose of trying to clear arrears of work and the newspapers never had any difficulty in keeping themselves informed of cases that take place at such existing special sittings or at the normal prescribed sittings because notice would be given at the ordinary sitting of the court that it was intended to have a special sitting.</P>
    <P>So far as general restrictions on the procedure under this section are concerned, I accept that the concept is a novel one.  In order to try to allay the legitimate fears that people might have about this I added subsection (5) as an amendment in the Seanad at the suggestion of one of the Opposition Senators. Since the Order has to be laid before each House and since it can be annulled within 21 sitting days, I have no doubt that any proceedings necessary under this section would get ample publicity and that people would be on the lookout to ensure that there would be no abuse of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure under the section, even with subsection (5), could be over and done with before anyone would become aware of it because it states that the annulment would be without prejudice to anything previously done thereunder so that the Order would be valid until annulled and it would take 21 days to annul it.  The Order provides for dealing with offences in respect of which only two clear days service is required. <Col N="1003" /> There could be a lot of summonses issued and convictions imposed on foot of an order which might subsequently be annulled by the House.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's motive but I do not know whether it goes very far towards allaying the fears we have concerning this section.  I accept that the Minister has not jurisdiction to nominate the actual venue beyond saying the time at which the sitting will take place but that is a drafting matter and it would be quite simple, instead of using the word &ldquo;courthouse&rdquo; to use the words &ldquo;in the building for the time being used for the holding of sittings&rdquo;. This would meet that point and would cover the difficulty of having secret courts in unusual venues.  I would not accept the Minister's argument that because he appoints only the places, there is no point in the amendment.  If it was to read &ldquo;that the justice may hold a sitting of the District Court within his district to deal with the offences at the place where courts are normally held within his districts&rdquo;, the difficulty would be met.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that would not necessarily meet the difficulty because many of these temporary premises are rented by local authorities on an arrangement that they are available on a particular day of the month and on that day only and that on other days they are used for other purposes. At present where a special sitting has to be held the local authorities frequently have to try and find some alternative premises.  This would apply even more under this procedure because the amount of notice that the local authority would get would be very short.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  All I can say to the Minister then is that the hearing of these special short notice summonses should be confined, even if it means a bit of travelling, to full-time courthouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will accept that in practice they will because a justice in a district will sit nearly every one of his sitting days in <Col N="1004" /> his district and, therefore, he will be sitting in the ordinary or usual place for sitting and the special court or the special prosecution under this section would, therefore, be brought in one of the other areas in which he happens to be sitting in any district on that day so that the question of his having to sit in some unusual premises would not arise.  I would imagine that if no suitable premises in the area were available at short notice the justice would say that he would sit in the courthouse of the adjoining town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that it probably would not normally arise but the point I want to make is that it could arise and it does leave an open door to secret courts.  The Minister does not intend that, the justices do not intend that, but nevertheless the door is there.  It would be bad for us to pass an Act that would leave that door open, particularly if we are now down to a question of drafting.  I would ask the Minister to close that door.  If the thing is above board let it be seen to be absolutely above board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is the only person who saw anything in it that was not above board.  It would never occur to me, on reading the section, that you could have secret courts.  The Deputy should bear in mind that every night of the week, in this and every city, there are courts held in Garda barracks before peace commissioners when people are remanded in custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This will obviously be more than remand.  This is intended to deal substantially with the offence because a remand obviously would not meet the circumstances envisaged here. What is intended here is to get something done quickly before harm is done.  A remand would not be sufficient there.  What is obviously intended is finality.  I indicated to the Minister earlier that I have a recollection of a case, I think in this city where there was a trial in the late afternoon and there was talk and whispers and some amount of publicity afterwards.  It would be a bad principle to allow summonses to be issued at <Col N="1005" /> short notice to be heard in any place decided on by the district justice.  There should be some certainty, uniformity and regularity about it.  I would ask the Minister to look at this.  If it is only a drafting problem it could be got over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is more than that because the word &ldquo;place&rdquo; there has a particular meaning.  It means a town or village.  It does not mean the physical building.  I cannot specify that the court will sit in any particular building.  I have no jurisdiction to do that.  That is a matter for the local authority.  I think the House would achieve nothing by amending the Bill on the lines suggested by Deputy Cooney because I would not have the power to specify.</P>

I understand that his power at the moment is to say that the District Court shall sit in Town A or Village B on such a day of the week, but where the District Court sits in that town or village is a matter of getting a suitable premises.  There is nothing to prevent the Minister saying that, for the particular narrow requirements of this section, the District Court shall sit only in buildings, in places.</P>

I do not know any District Justice who will hold a secret court and the Minister does not know any either, but we are passing a piece of law here to apply in <i>saecula saeculorum</i> and I do not think we should leave in it power for a district justice in 20 or 30 years time, or even sooner, to do something that would be wrong when we can exclude that power.</P>

Deputy Cooney is wrong in his approach that you must assume the very worst from everyone and try to legislate against that.  You have to accept a sort of normal standard of behaviour.  In the example I gave, a district justice could hold secret courts in the middle of the night and could, on the face of it, do it legally by muttering that he was adjourning until 2 o'clock in the morning.</P>

      <P>This is to ensure personal service of the type of summons provided for in this section.  Subsection (3) provides that a summons may be served at any time not less than two clear days before the sitting.  This is the special sitting which may be held at any place in the district and at any time which may suit the justice and the exigencies of the case.  The summons has to be served on the defendant within not less than two clear days.  Two clear days would be, as far as I know, a Saturday and a Sunday.  A summons served on a Friday night to a defendant who is away for the weekend could be heard on Monday morning, before he would get it, unless the service has to be personal.  In view of the drastic abridgement of time proposed in the section, it is essential for justice to be done, that the service be effected personally on the defendant.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I strongly support this amendment. There is an unanswerable case for it because many summonses can be served by leaving them, say, at the residence of the defendant or accused person with somebody over the age of 16 residing there with him.  In that case there is seven days notice at least of the court.  Here we are giving only two days notice and a person could quite easily be away from home and the people in the house might not know where he was.  There are many provisions for serving documents personally. Under the Enforcement of Court Orders Act certain documents have to <Col N="1011" /> be served personally.  In many rules of court there is provision for the service of documents personally.  If ever there was a case where a document should be served personally, it is this case where only two days notice is being given.  It is absolutely essential that the person concerned should know that the court will be held.  If it has not to be served personally, then in many cases the accused person may have no notice whatever and may first learn of the proceedings when the garda comes to arrest him or when he reads in the paper that he has been fined a substantial sum of money.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> There is a substantial point here, an unanswerable case.  It may well be said that the district justice may ask did the defendant get the notice but if the service is not personal there is no reason why he should.  It is very difficult to justify an abridgement of the time of service to this extent without making it absolutely obligatory that the service be personal.</P>

      <P>I must confess that my initial reaction to this amendment when I looked at it was on the lines that I agreed with it but when I went into the matter in somewhat more detail and the consequences of accepting the amendment were put to me, I had grave doubts as to the advisability of accepting it.  It does seem that the whole purpose of the section could be avoided by the defendant evading personal service.  It is, of course, very easy to evade personal service.  Deputy Fitzpatrick is not, I think, right in saying that personal service is necessary for a wide range of documents.  Under the Enforcement of Court Order Acts, as amended, it is no longer necessary for any document, even committal summonses, to be served personally.  Up to quite recently they had to be served personally, but not now.  The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure have advised in one of their most recent reports that personal service should be <Col N="1012" /> done away with as much as possible because they believe it only creates difficulties.  Where personal service is necessary there are usually efforts at evasion.  So far as I know, in the case of superior court documents, the only documents that now have to be served personally, and I think the committee have advised that the obligation be removed from them, are debtor summonses and certain motions of judgment and an originating matrimonial summons.  There is some special name; whether it is a <i>mensa et thora</i> or the other one, whatever you call it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Outside of this very limited range, and the range is rapidly decreasing, there is no need for personal service.  I am very much in two minds about this.  My reaction would be that there could clearly be a situation in which a man genuinely would not get a summons; on the other hand, I have to look on the other side, too. There clearly could be, and I am afraid there will be, situations, if the amendment is accepted, where people will evade service and the summons will have to be constantly re-issued. Frankly, I am in some difficulty about this because I think the argument on each side is pretty compelling.  I find it hard to know what to do.</P>

If the justice happened to be sitting on the other side of the county one could not go over there and apply to him for leave to serve the summons other than personally.</P>

      <P>The people discussing this are all members of the legal profession. Perhaps a layman's point of view might help the Minister to make up his mind.

      <P>This is an entirely different set of circumstances.  A great many people, through no fault of their own, could find themselves on the wrong side of the law because it would not be possible for them to know that these summonses were served if, in fact, they were not served personally. The Minister is quite correct when he says it might be easy enough to evade service and, if you have to go to the District Court, there is no point in serving the summons anyway because that would defeat the whole object. If you have to go to the District Court you might as well take it in the normal way.  This is one case in which the Minister should spell out that it must be served personally.  Could he put in some kind of protection by stipulating that, if this cannot be done within seven days, then it can be served other than personally?</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I have very strong views about this because the whole thing is weighted against the accused person.  He will get only two days notice.  His rights are being restricted by the section, as it stands, and we are now going further because we are not imposing on anyone the obligation to see that the particular person gets the summons.  If there is a genuine case of a man not having notice that will mean an appeal. Suppose the man were taken by surprise, he could have judgment set aside.  I agree there is a possibility of evading service but that is not a good reason for introducing this dangerous sort of provision into an Act of Parliament. It has been said, and it has always been a rule of our law, that it is better that many guilty people escape rather than that one innocent person be convicted.  I would say that it is better that the odd person should evade service &mdash; this is something that can be put right &mdash; than that some innocent person not guilty of an offence should be convicted in his absence.  I do not think our concept of the law or our interpretation of the law should stand for this sort of provision.</P>

I am not giving this with any great authority but I think the procedure is that the justice simply endorses the summons by saying, &ldquo;I hereby abridge the time and reduce it to two days or three days&rdquo;. If a guard were to go to the justice and say, &ldquo;This man is evading service, I know he deliberately went away.

      <P>This section is designed to resolve doubts which have arisen in relation to the powers of the Minister for Justice under section 26 of the Courts of Justice Act. 1953. The section referred to authorises the Minister for Justice to create, vary or abolish District Court districts and District Court areas and to alter the places and times appointed for court sittings in any District Court area. However, the section does not authorise the appointing of places and times <Col N="1017" /> for sittings of the District Court in a newly created District Court area.  It does not authorise the changing of the name of a district or area which for convenience of the public may from time to time be desirable.  The section proposes, therefore, to empower the Minister whenever he creates or varies a District Court area to appoint a venue for sittings of the District Court and also the time and days of the sittings of the court at such venue. Power has also been taken to assign a name to or change the name of any District Court district or area.  At present under the District Court Districts and Areas Order of 1961 District Court districts are assigned numbers and the areas are identified by the name of the place at which the sittings are appointed to be held.</P>

      <P>I welcome this section which gives solicitors the right of audience in any court in the land.  Up to now their right of audience has been confined to pleading in the District Court and Circuit Court.  The practice has grown up whereby that right has not been exercised in the Circuit Court. The Minister expressed the wish earlier in this debate that the right would in fact be exercised in the Circuit Court.  It is a wish with which I would concur but I do not ever see it coming to pass to any great extent.  The reason is this: the profession of advocate is a skilled profession and it is one that requires constant practice, like any profession, before the practitioner will become adept.  The solicitor's business is such that he does not have sufficient opportunities to practise his advocacy to reach the high level required to practise it successfully and at all levels. This is something which barristers do achieve because their time is almost entirely spent pleading in the courts. If a person spends enough time at any particular activity he will become proficient and more professional at it. While this right may be given to solicitors I foresee that it will continue to <Col N="1018" /> be exercised and carried on almost exclusively by barristers, and properly so, because they will be the experts at the particular skill of advocacy which is a skill that has to be acquired like any other skill, by constant practice. I know the Minister is in favour of the fusion of the two branches of the profession&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises on this section so I shall have to say something about it.  There is a great deal to recommend that as an ideal; it is logical and it is tidy but when one considers the nature of the Bar and the nature of the solicitors' profession in rural Ireland it is not a good suggestion.  If it were to happen and we were not to have any more barristers the position of a single solicitor, or even a partnership of solicitors, in rural Ireland would be very difficult under a number of heads.  First of all they would be in difficulty in getting a second opinion on what might be an abstruse legal point.  At the moment these opinions are available at a reasonable cost from the Bar as part of the service and part of the work they perform.  They have the facilities of a large library and up-to-date reports available to them but above all they have the facility of contact with each other, the facility to consult with each other and thereby provide a very wide range of expert opinion.  This would be removed if the professions were fused.  The position of the average solicitor practising in rural Ireland &mdash; I am not talking about the solicitor who might be a member of a powerful firm in Dublin where one member could specialise &mdash; would be difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, too, the facilities which the Bar provide by way of skilled advocacy would not be available to the solicitor in rural Ireland.  Large Dublin firms would employ a partner who could become trained as a skilled advocate and it would mean nothing to them. The general public do not realise the importance of the independence of the Bar to their liberties.  While there are aspects of the barrister's profession which one finds tedious and which <Col N="1019" /> could be condemned as a little precious at times, nevertheless it is essentially a healthy profession with high ethical standards.  It does have this rather fierce and jealously guarded independence. My experience is that independence is a wonderful buffer between the State and its citizens.  If fusion were to mean the end of that I would not be for it.  I am in favour of this section which gives solicitors the right to plead in every court in the land.  This is as it should be, but I doubt if it is going to be exercised in the way the Minister hopes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy of some years standing in this House who is known to be a practising barrister, I would like to support this section.  The section is timely and I see no reason why we should have had any prohibition in our statute law on the right of any lawyer to practise and plead his clients' interests in any court in the land.  I say that because I believe I am expressing the view of the majority of my colleagues at the Bar.  I do not claim to speak for them, but because I sense that people may have felt that the Bar of Ireland was concerned in relation to a possible bar on a solicitor pleading in any court, I would like to assure the House that this is not so. I do not know whether the advent of my colleagues, Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick or Deputy Cooney, into the High Court of Justice and the Supreme Court of this country is going to destroy my practice.  Maybe it will; maybe it will not.  I would like to feel that they have a great deal of work on hands which is going to continue to engage their attention&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that they may still feel the necessity for someone who specialises in the art &mdash; and it is an art &mdash; of advocacy and would continue to seek such a person.  In any event, I think it is right that we should have in the High Court of Justice what has been the position, ever since the <Col N="1020" /> Courts of Justice Act, 1924, in the Circuit Courts of this country where solicitors were entitled to appear and plead and do their cases.  I have found as a professional man that I have the support and goodwill of many solicitors all over Ireland and I have found that solicitors are generally men of sound commonsense, and it is, and has been, the exceptional case in which a solicitor in fact exercises his rights to appear as an advocate in the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>I should imagine that this will continue to be the situation, but it is important that the right should be there, because I remember being present many years ago when I was a junior member of this House and a junior member of the Bar, seeing a solicitor seeking the right to appear before the Court of Criminal Appeal and being denied that right.  I often questioned whether the denial was right or in accordance with the Constitution.  I very much doubt whether it was.</P>

      <P>I think that is probably so.  May I say &mdash; I can only say it as a Member of this House &mdash; that I would support this section?  I think it is the removal of an anomaly which has survived in our laws and it is well to put it right.</P>
      <P>My friend and colleague, Deputy Cooney, supported the fusion of the professions or seemed to indicate that he was in favour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I must have misunderstood what the Deputy was saying. I do think that irrespective of any changes of this kind there will continue to be a need for some kind of profession or separate association of advocates, unless we are to face the high-power merger of firms of lawyers which certainly has become the besetting sin of so many other countries.  In most of the States of America, and indeed in Canada, the provincial areas, the areas outside centres of population, just cannot get adequate legal advice because the position has arisen whereby groups of lawyers get together to form a complete firm, a firm which is able to give specialised advice on income tax, on <Col N="1021" /> death duties, on company matters, on ordinary <i>nisi prius</i> claims to title and so on and able to provide an advocate, a court lawyer, who is able to do the case, if court involvement arises.  This has meant that the single one-man lawyer down in the rural areas is more and more bypassed.  He cannot compete; he cannot provide the service; and he cannot give his clients the kind of advice which the bigger firms can give.</P>
      <P>There is this development at the moment taking place in the legal profession in this country, in centres of population &mdash; in Dublin city, in Cork and, as I noted recently, in Limerick city.  This is a development which is in accordance with the trend of the times, but I would like to feel that as long as there is available at a moderate fee to the independent one-man solicitor in some remote part or some part of Ireland &mdash; I hesitate to mention any part of Ireland &mdash; in relation to a matter relating to income tax, death duties, company law, law of property &mdash; whatever it may be&mdash;the specialised mystic subjects &mdash; as long as there is available to him on the payment of a reasonable fee, which is never extreme, the advice of a specialist which he gets as a result of sending a case to counsel in the Law Library, he is able to match in the advice which he gets for his client the services of the largest merger of lawyers in Dublin city.</P>
      <P>I think that is important, and as long as we can maintain that situation here, I think the interests of the people are better served, and &mdash; I do not regard providing a right of audience to a solicitor as of any real significance&mdash; the solicitor will continue to be, as he has been for many decades in this country, a very significant person in his own locality and amongst his own people.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I have strayed from the real effect of this section but I want to say that I support the section.  I do not think it is going to bring about drastic fundamental change in our courts and I want to say as a practising barrister that in my interpretation of the feelings of my colleagues, there certainly would be no feelings against a section of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I rise to say that I support this section <Col N="1022" /> too and say that it is refreshing to hear a member of the Senior Bar such as Deputy O'Higgins standing up here and supporting the right of the solicitor's profession to audience in every court in the land.  It shows very clearly the good fellowship that exists between the two branches of the legal profession in this country.  As time goes on I think solicitors will avail themselves of this right of audience in the Circuit Court and, perhaps, in the High Court. I should not like to think that it would be the crank who would avail himself of this right but rather would it be the member of the profession who feels he is on top of his subject and can do justice to his client as well as any senior counsel.  I sincerely hope that is the type of solicitor who will avail himself of this provision.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy O'Higgins will agree with the hope I expressed on the Second Reading and again express now that this is a move in another direction and that it will follow from this that solicitors will be regarded as qualified to sit on the Circuit Court bench.  There are many solicitors who would adorn the Circuit Court bench and bring to it the commonsense and knowledge of country people and their lives that their experience as members of the profession over the years has brought them. I hope that suggestion will be given consideration by the Minister.</P>

      <P>On a point of clarification in regard to section 17 which says: &ldquo;A solicitor who is acting for a party in an action... and a solicitor qualified to practise ... who is acting as his assistant shall have a right of audience in that court,&rdquo; I could see a situation where a solicitor would make himself a specialist in advocacy and would be retained by another solicitor to act as a pleader for him.  Is that closed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is prevented. We had some point like that in the Seanad.  The reason for the wording there&mdash;&ldquo;... a solicitor qualified to practise (within the meaning of the Solicitors Act, 1954) who is acting as his assistant ...&rdquo; is that he would have to have a practising certificate.  It would not be sufficient for him to <Col N="1023" /> be qualified to practise.  For example, if you are the proprietor of a firm of solicitors and you employ an assistant solicitor, that assistant solicitor does not need a practising certificate unless he appears in court.  That is to ensure that the position in regard to the High Court and the Supreme Court would be the same as it is in regard to the District Court and Circuit Court.  Even though he may be an assistant he can only appear if he has a practising certificate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that under this provision as it stands you could have a solicitor who says: &ldquo;I shall specialise entirely in advocacy&rdquo; and who would be briefed and therefore become an assistant to a number of other firms of solicitors? I see no reason why he should not have this but you could, I think, have this situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 50 to 54, to delete subsection (5) (a).</P>
      <P>The amendment is to delete subsection (5) (a) of the section which increases the sum that may be paid to a deserted wife from the present figure of, I think, £4 10s which was fixed a great number of years ago.  It is completely out-of-date and it is payable irrespective of the means of the husband.  This section increases the amount which may be paid but, under subsection (5) (a), there is a limit of £15 for the support of the wife and £5 for the support of the child.  I propose to delete that sub-section and leave the discretion entirely with the district justice.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister argued in a half-hearted way in the Seanad that he was half-advised that there was some constitutional objection to giving district justices unfettered power under this Bill.  If it is constitutional for him to award a sum with a fixed ceiling I cannot see how it is unconstitutional for him to award a bigger sum or a lesser sum, as the case may be, depending on the means of the errant husband.  A district justice can order the payment of weekly sums to pay off a debt and can enforce his order with committal to prison and this situation here seems to be analogous.  If he is to be trusted with that procedure for the collection of a debt, he is surely to be trusted with it in deciding what a husband should pay the wife and children he has deserted.</P>
      <P>I have confidence in the District Court bench.  I believe that their powers under this section will be exercised reasonably and with justice to both parties.  I should like to see the ceiling removed.  In the case of a very wealthy husband who deserted his wife the ceiling is altogether too low.  The court should have power to make an order according to the means of the individual.</P>

      <P>In the District Court, but a wife can apply in a summary way in the High Court and there is no limit on the figure she can get there.  Deputy Cooney said that I was half-advised that it was unconstitutional. He is half-wrong, because I was fully advised by the Attorney General that it might be unconstitutional and that I should place some limitation on the District Court and give unlimited jurisdiction to the High Court.  I have done that.  The number of cases that would have to be brought in the High Court would be very few.  The sort of people who would be in that category would probably be able to afford it without any great problem.  In any event, it would cost them very little because it would be a purely summary application.</P>

I read in the Official Report of the Seanad that the Minister said he was advised that to give the district justice power to award more than £15 a week would be unconstitutional. I certainly respect the opinion of the Attorney General but I find it hard to follow this reasoning.  As Deputy Cooney has pointed out, a district justice has power at the moment to order the payment of £1,000 in one sum.  Furthermore, I think the Minister will find that a district justice can give a decree for rates in any amount.  He can certainly give a decree for rates in a sum far in excess of the jurisdiction of the District Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment proceedings by a deserted wife looking for a weekly payment from her erring husband, or an application for a payment under the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act are heard in open court.  Very often these proceedings involve matters of intimate and distressing personal details.  Without any doubt they should be heard in private in chambers.  I do not think anyone would suggest that we were instituting a star chamber or a private court if we agreed to this.</P>
      <P>It was highlighted to me recently in the District Court in Limerick.  I heard an application under the Married Women (Maintenance in case of Desertion) Act and the defence was that the applicant was engaged in an unholy alliance.  This had to be made in open court and I understand that children of the marriage were present. The whole thing was very distressing. There is no doubt that these proceedings and proceedings under the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act should be heard in chambers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment section 3 of the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930, provides for the clearing of the court of all persons other than the parties' legal representatives, relatives, <i>et cetera</i>, and Press reporters.  Publication of the proceedings is severely restricted.  I think this meets the point in relation to the illegitimate children.  I understand that it is the usual practice, in fact; to hold them in private so that disposes of amendment No. 9.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other amendment, there has been no demand for a change of this kind.  Normally these cases are undefended.  The case Deputy Cooney referred to must be a very unusual one, first of all in that it was defended, and secondly in that it was defended in the particular way in question.  If that defence was open the normal thing would be that the applicant would not bring the application, I venture to think.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the situation it may be no harm to have these cases heard in public to deter an applicant in those circumstances from bringing what on the face of it would seem to be an improper application because she would appear, certainly morally and probably legally, not to be entitled to any money.  However, something which occurs to me about this is that it is like some of the extensions of jurisdiction that were suggested earlier for the District Court.  Really, they are matters that would have to be dealt with in an appropriate Act amending, say, the Married Women (Maintenance in case of Desertion) Act, 1886 and the Enforcement of the Court Orders Act. That would be the appropriate place in which to make an amendment of this kind.  In general, because of the fact that there is no demand for this, since the cases are rarely contested anyway and the evidence consists simply of a woman saying: &ldquo;My husband left me and is now living elsewhere,&rdquo; one hesitates to make private unnecessarily any part of the judicial proceeding and I contrast, respectfully, Deputy Cooney's anxiety for secrecy here with his undue anxiety to avoid it in an earlier section we were discussing.</P>

      <P>Yes, but is it not a good thing that in the absence of a very limited type of defence such as that mentioned by Deputy Cooney the case should be heard in public?  If a wife knows that the case is to be heard in private and that her husband is not in a position to defend himself anyway, is it not an encouragement to her to bring the case without having any basis for doing so and to go into court and say outrageous things in private about her husband which she would not say in public?</P>

      <P>Surely a matrimonial matter is of a personal and intimate nature and that it is no concern of the general public that a marriage has failed to progress satisfactorily.  There is no breach of the principle of public justice when the matter concerns a private relationship between a man and his wife.  When the Minister says there is no demand for such cases to be heard in Chambers and that all that is involved is a wife going to court and telling the justice that her husband has deserted her, surely he can appreciate the plight of an unfortunate woman in such circumstances who has to make that humiliating statement in a courthouse packed with the public, with gardaí, solicitors and witnesses.  Surely, that should take place in the privacy of the judge's Chambers.</P>

During those proceedings the most intimate details were given of traps set by the husband and of evidence that he ascertained in roundabout ways.  There was a full disclosure before the court of a very intimate set of circumstances that would have been better dealt with in private.  However, this is something that the Minister should keep in mind. Deputy Cooney's suggestion is a reasonable one.  It is of the utmost importance that, in general, justice should be administered in courts that are open to the public and the Press but there are cases, and I submit that this particular type of case is one of them, at which the public should be excluded and where the evidence should be heard <i>in camera</i> either at the request of one or both parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically to do what was wanted in the last amendment that we discussed, to have legitimacy applications heard in Chambers.  The section amends section 2 of the Legitimacy Act, 1931.  This Act provides for the legitimation of illegitimate children by the subsequent marriage of their parents and it provides that applications for declarations of legitimacy by children so legitimated may be made to the Circuit Court under the Legitimacy Declaration Act (Ireland) 1868.  Under the 1868 Act an <Col N="1033" /> application for a certificate in respect of a legitimated person may be made only by the legitimated person himself. Moreover as such an application is not specifically mentioned in section 45 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961 (Administration of Justice otherwise than in Public)&mdash; that is the provision I referred to recently&mdash;it appears that it must be heard in open court.  In order to avoid embarrassment for a legitimated person it is desirable that his parents should be able to apply for the declaration and it is desirable also that the circuit judge should hear the application in Chambers.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): It is clear from the Committee Stage discussion on this Bill today that there is much work to be done by the rule making committee and by the cost committee before the Circuit Court and the District Court will be ready to deal with the increased jurisdiction which will be conferred upon them by this Bill.  The Bill provides that the increase in jurisdiction shall come into operation on 1st March next.  I am not satisfied that the necessary rules will be made and in operation, that the necessary scales of costs will be drawn up and ready for that date.  If these requirements have not been brought into operation before then, I can see considerable chaos and difficulty in operating this Bill.  I think the Minister is satisfied that there are several matters in regard to the District Court jurisdiction like the provision for dealing with minors which will need a lot of thought and probably there will be rules necessary in connection with the Circuit Court jurisdiction.  There would certainly need to be new scales of costs drawn and it is not proper to increase the jurisdiction of these courts without at the same time revising the scales of costs.  That should not be done.  I suggest that the date should be put back to 1st August at latest.  I would even agree to providing that sections 2 to 12 of this Act shall come <Col N="1036" /> into operation on such day as the Minister may appoint.  He could hold that over the committee that he said were inclined to be rather slow moving, to urge them to get on with the work and complete the rules.  I cannot see these new rules and new scales of costs being in operation by 1st March.</P>

I have every confidence that they can have it in the three months.  I believe they have started on it but how far they have got I could not really say.  I do not like to say this in case it is quoted against me afterwards but it is really only when the cases are over that the rules will be needed, for the most part, rather than when they begin.  So, in fact if they are ready by 1st April it would be time enough in most instances.  Off-hand, I cannot think of any amendment that the Circuit Court Rules Committee must necessarily make as a result of this Bill, apart from the jurisdictional references.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress I had been speaking of the effect on the small farmer, particularly the small farmer in the west of Ireland, of our entry into the EEC.  I would be grateful if I could find out what that position will be when he loses the subsidies, after a period of grace of a number of years.  At that time the subsidies on ground limestone and on manures and other subsidies will be abolished, with consequent serious effect on the population in the West of Ireland.  If some concessions similar to those applicable to southern Italy are not obtained for the West of Ireland it is difficult to see how the farmer there will be able to survive.  For some time past farmers have been leaving that area.  If the farmer is not put in a position to develop the marginal land, it will be difficult for him to survive.  Therefore, we in the West of Ireland would like to know, before the referendum is held, what the position of the small farmer there will be.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that production could have been increased by one-third if sufficient money had been put into agriculture over the past five or six years so that the industry could have been geared for entry to the European Community.  The cattle population could have been increased. The same would apply to pigs and sheep.  Milk production could have been increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the increased allocation given by the Minister to dairying but that does not offset the increased costs to the farmer in respect of manures, farm machinery, and so on, and it does <Col N="1039" /> not bring him up to the required standard. The farmer is just as badly off today as he was five years ago.  Admittedly, the price of beef has gone up considerably but the £ has been devalued. In those circumstances what will be our position in Europe?  We are taking 12½ per cent less for our cattle by reason of the devaluation of the £.</P>
    <P>There should have been rationalisation of all the creameries in the West of Ireland in order to have a viable unit, or a few viable units there, which would be able to compete in Common Market conditions.  At this stage the Minister should suggest that the creameries should amalgamate and gear themselves for the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Our entry to Europe is not yet certain. That is a matter for the people to decide.  If Britain does not enter the Common Market and if we, by a majority vote of the people, opt for entry, what will be the position of the farmer?</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in the price of pigs and pigmeat but, side by side with that, there has been an increase in the price of feeding stuffs. Transport costs have helped to increase the price of the farmers' feeding stuffs while the price of the pig has not increased in line with the increase in the price of feeding stuffs. This situation should be remedied.  In my own county in the last week or two I have seen bonhams sold at a lower price than that which they commanded five years ago.  We have two first-class bacon factories and a first-class pig fattening station.  Both are doing very well.  They are gearing themselves for Common Market conditions.  They have taken steps to modernise.</P>
    <P>In the case of sheep, the farmer is not getting the price he should get.  I know this from personal experience. The farmer is not getting the price he should for his mutton and lamb.  The Government should do something about this Lamb was sold this year at a shockingly low price.</P>
    <P>It was suggested to me recently that the subsidy paid for mountain lamb should also be paid on lowland sheep, such as the Galway sheep.  We would <Col N="1040" /> welcome this in Mayo because the southern part of our county is an extensive Galway sheep area.  The farmers there go in for sheep production in a big way.</P>
    <P>Wool prices have gone down.  Why has the price gone down to such an extent?  We had several small wool buyers in Mayo who had first-class storage but, because they did not comply with all the conditions laid down, they were deprived of the right to purchase wool.  This was just one more attempt to put the small man out.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister must be aware that the price of fertilisers increased last year by 10 per cent.  It also increased the year before by 10 per cent.  Next year we will have the value added tax of 25 per cent.  Never in the history of the State have such large dividends been paid by the manufacturers of fertilisers as have been paid this year.  The Minister should look into this because all these things come out of the pocket of the farmer. If the farmer cannot fertilise his land he will not be able to increase productivity.</P>
    <P>Last year Erin Foods had contracts in Galway for 48,000 acres of potatoes. I hear that this is being reduced to 23,000 acres.  This reduction will create grave hardship.  Because of the trouble, in Tuam farmers had to hold on to their potatoes.  Who will compensate them?  They had contracts signed.</P>
    <P>I understand beet production will also be cut.  I would not produce potatoes for Erin Foods because I do not regard the price as satisfactory.  It would be quite uneconomic for me to produce potatoes for Erin Foods.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Land Project men in my county.  The officers are first-class.  They are doing an excellent job.  It would be a tragedy if this project were to cease.  Wonderful work has been done in the West.</P>
    <P>Mayo has availed in a big way of the small farm incentive bonus scheme. A great deal of the credit for this must go to the agricultural officers and to our late CAO who has been transferred to Galway.  We were sorry to lose him.  This is a problem where <Col N="1041" /> these people are concerned.  An officer is appointed in a particular district and, no sooner has he become really <i>au fait</i>, than he is transferred to another area.  It takes an officer six to 12 months to acclimatise in an area.</P>
    <P>He is a loss to the area he has left and it will take the new man who replaces him six months to get going on the schemes that his predecessor was implementing.  The Appointments Commission should ensure agricultural officers who opt to come to their own counties are considered for jobs there first.  It is true that some agricultural officers will be anxious to get near universities and schools for their children but when an agricultural officer leaves an area he is a tremendous loss.</P>
    <P>I was happy to hear the Minister say that Mayo will be declared a brucellosis-free area very soon.  This will be a very good thing because we are in line with Sligo and Donegal, which have already been declared free areas.  Fortunately we have not had the problems with regard to brucellosis that other counties have had.  We have not had many reactors.  I must congratulate the Chief Agricultural Officer in Castlebar together with his staff, who have done a really good and fast job.  I can convey to the Minister that his officers have done a wonderful job in County Mayo.</P>
    <P>So far as agricultural credit is concerned, I know of two people who had their applications for loans turned down.  I wrote to the Agricultural Credit Corporation about this because I could not understand how a widow, whose son is working, who had built a piggery and wanted money to stock it was refused a loan by the ACC.</P>
    <P>If the ACC refused to give such people credit, how can we hope to increase production?  I do not know whether the ACC have a secret service crew operating, but wherever they got their information in relation to the two cases I have mentioned, it was wrong.  It is a serious situation when people who are anxious to produce are denied credit.</P>
    <P>I am sure we could produce at least one-third more cattle, beef and tillage in the West were it not for the way the unemployment assistance order is <Col N="1042" /> operated.  If a farmer, whether he is drawing unemployment assistance or not, is prepared to work his farm, he should be allowed to produce.  These people do not have the required number of stamps in the unemployment benefit section and, if they earn more than ten shillings a day, they automatically lose their unemployment assistance. This order is killing farming in the west of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am speaking about the production which would be there if this regulation did not exist.  I thank the Minister for the increase granted to dairy farmers.  However, any increase given is automatically offset by increases in costs.  I am a farmer.  I know what it costs to run a farm.  I know what fertilisers and machinery cost.  I do not think farmers are well-off today. The expenses involved in running the farm have increased to such an extent that any increases given are automatically eaten up before the farmer gets them.</P>
      <P>Before the small farmers in Mayo vote on the EEC we want to know what the Government's policy will be as far as the west of Ireland is concerned and how the small farmer is going to survive.  Will industry be set up there so that farmers can be part-time farmers?  We can never hope to hold our population in the west if industry and part-time farming are not created there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to congratulate the Minister on his fine statement and comprehensive review of the present agricultural position. The Minister is in charge of a very complex Department, a Department which embraces a great variety of items and I think these congratulations <Col N="1043" /> are due to the Minister.  I also want to say that his Department, and indeed the agricultural community as a whole, are making steady progress. This of course is due to the sound economic planning by the Government and as a result agriculture is making steady and sound progress.  This is borne out by the latest figures we have which show that agricultural output has increased by 2.6 per cent over the previous year.  Agricultural prices rose in 1970 and the figure is now in the region of £343 million, or £24 million over the previous year.  Total family income has risen over the 1969 figure by over £10 million, or in the region of 6 per cent.  Many of our farmers can compete with any of their counterparts in Europe and indeed some of our farmers are the best in Europe and can take their place, on our accession to the Common Market, side by side with any of their counterparts in Europe.</P>
      <P>The demand in agriculture was never greater than it is at present and indeed the Government have continually emphasised their faith in it by backing it up with practical deeds and that faith in agriculture is paying off. This is apparent in a great many places.  There are definite advances and the people engaged in agriculture are aware of this.  There is a more definite approach made to the production end and also the marketing end, and the increasing use of fertilisers is having the required impact on farm output, and the very generous subsidies provided by the Government are bound to have a further significant impact in the future.  These aids are being backed up by facts and knowledge imparted to the farmers and the agricultural community by the advisory services. Our farmers are now doing things which they never did before.  This is the sort of spirit that is around and this indeed is the sort of spirit that must be around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basis for these advances was education and consequently in that area there must be significant progress. Agricultural education is an immediate need and one which will play an important role in putting into effect the <Col N="1044" /> aims and objectives of the programme for expansion necessary for our farmers when this country becomes a member of the EEC.  All our farmers must realise the importance of education in their profession so that they can become efficient with the least possible delay.  Furthermore, I feel that we need to put agriculture into the minds of the whole population as our key industry, the basis of our economy, the provider of raw materials for our industries, the best hope of quick success in the years that lie ahead and indeed the very staff of our national life.  We can effectively do this by concentrated programme planning on our farms and projecting the proper public image to the non-farmer sector.</P>
    <P>We are now launched on a new era and, economically speaking, one which is likely to be a period of great significance for our country.  Now more than ever before farmers must take a pride in their profession, because if pride was not considered amongst the rewards of their vocation, in the difficult years that lie ahead, perhaps the other incentive rewards may not be sufficient to encourage our young people to remain on the land.  I believe, however, that the long-term prospects for agriculture are good and if we can pull through, which I feel we can by pulling together in an organised manner, the prospects are indeed worthy of the effort.  Also&mdash;and this is important&mdash; the financial rewards of agriculture must be made sufficiently attractive, and at the same time, our farmers must not see their way of life merely as a resort of those who have been outstripped in the race for better callings. The farmer must regard his work not as a mere routine procedure but as giving a scope for originality and experiment and the constant application of new information.</P>
    <P>I was glad that the Minister made reference to the co-operative movement in so far as it affects creamery rationalisation.  In this respect the Minister and his Department are to be congratulated on having this matter speeded up.</P>
    <P>I wish to say something about co-operation in farming in a much wider sense.  Co-operation will have a growing <Col N="1045" /> influence on farm economy from now on especially in communities where holdings are small.  The co-operative movement can only be really successful if it is operated by the farmers themselves for themselves.  I believe that co-operation and the promotion of the co-operative spirit is essential for efficient progress in the Irish agricultural economy and, indeed, the whole economy because agriculture is its bedrock.  The co-operative movement can do this and the need for it is as great today and, perhaps, more urgent than when Plunkett decided to devote his life to promoting it in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Through co-operation as Dr. Knapp, the American co-operative expert said when he surveyed the co-operative movement in Ireland some years ago, &ldquo;The self-reliance and self-respect of the Irish farmer will be improved.  It will help to raise the income and living standards of Irish agriculture through better marketing of farm products and better purchasing of agricultural requirements. The productivity of Irish agriculture will be increased and this in turn will encourage better agricultural practices&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Efficient and well-run co-operatives can bring about a change in productivity in an area by giving the farmer a greater stake in the advantages that come from a more productive agriculture. An example of this is that approximately 75 per cent of our farms are of 50 acres or less in size.  With the gradual breakdown of international trade and transport barriers in the EEC, it is necessary, if the majority of these farms are to survive as viable economic units, that Irish agriculture should be abreast of foreign competitors in all its techniques.  It is through co-operation and using the co-operative movement to the best advantage that our farmers can achieve great results for themselves in the future, more particularly when we join the EEC.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to education and particularly the advisory services.  I am glad that the Minister in referring to education, research and advisory services said:</P>
    <P>By far the most important agricultural <Col N="1046" /> resource are the men and women who work on our farms.  My Department is very much concerned with improving their management and technical efficiency.  This involves a continuing process of education and advice and the provision and application of new information and techniques.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to the advisory services, their personnel, the CAOs, the advisory officers in each county and to everybody associated with these services.</P>
    <P>In this context tribute should also be paid to the farming organisations dealing with farm education such as Macra na Feirme and Macra na Tuaithe which are responsible in no small way for the progress being made in agriculture at present.  I am glad the Minister sees fit each year to give a very generous grant to Macra na Feirme and I hope that when he is budgeting for the coming 12 months he will further increase the grant to Macra na Feirme which has given so much of itself to Irish agriculture.  It would be remiss of me not to include the very fine work being done by our residential agricultural colleges throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It was, indeed, a source of joy to me to read in the papers some months ago that the Minister had opened another of these colleges in his own native Kilkenny.  I hope that is the forerunner of many more because the demand for this type of agricultural education far exceeds the resources which are available. I should like to see a great expansion in this type of education.  No farmer's son or potential farmer should consider it beneath his dignity to spend a year or two in one of these very fine and very well-equipped colleges which are providing the information and the know-how on farming methods.</P>
    <P>The winter farm schools and the evening classes conducted by the advisory services are keeping our farmers abreast of present-day trends and present-day advances in agriculture, and present-day advances in agricultural education.</P>
    <P>I was also glad to see that the farm <Col N="1047" /> apprenticeship scheme has grown from 24 participants in 1964 to something in the region of 123 in the present year. There is room for further expansion. I should like to see this scheme extended.  The financial aids which are being provided by the Department should also be extended.  The operation of this scheme has proved to be an unqualified success as a method of training in farm management.  The scheme came into operation in October, 1964, and since that time the numbers entering apprenticeship have increased steadily each year.</P>
    <P>The scheme is designed to give a three to four year course in in-service apprenticeship training leading to qualification in farm management.  A boy who has reached the age of 18 years on entry may sit for his first certificate examination at the end of three years.  The qualification is phased over three stages.  First there is a certificate in farm management on the completion of apprenticeship service.  A senior certificate in farm management can be obtained a minimum of two years after taking the first certificate. Finally, there is the master farmer's certificate.  This examination may be taken three years after taking the senior certificate.</P>
    <P>After the first years of the operation of this scheme a growing awareness of its value has become noticeable.  There is very little difficulty in obtaining sufficient suitable teaching farmers.  We have found that these men are most co-operative.  I should like to pay tribute to the farmers who are known as master farmers for taking on apprentices and training them in the rudiments of agriculture and good farming husbandry.</P>
    <P>The standard of the academic education of the apprentices entering this scheme has been rising every year.  The boys who have qualified through this scheme so far have remained in the country and they are all commanding a good living.  It is obvious that the management training and the skills which these boys have acquired through the scheme are highly valued.  There is no doubt that there are plenty of opportunities <Col N="1048" /> in our agricultural industry for young men with the training which this scheme provides.  If these opportunities were not evident in the past it was because the young men were not there. The Farm Apprenticeship Board are aware of the fact that, after the experience of the past few years, a review of the scheme is now necessary further to improve the standard of training.  I understand this is under consideration at present with the co-operation of the Minister's Department.  I hope that the improvement sought will be well within the compass of the board.</P>
    <P>The board have enjoyed the co-operation of the Minister's Department from the outset.  Since 1967, three years after the inception of the scheme, the Minister's Department have provided a basic grant of £2,600 per annum to the board for administrative purposes plus a further £ for £ on income received by the board from non-State sources.  I would urgently ask the Minister to consider the very valid argument for increasing the grants to this board to ensure the further expansion of this very vital section of agricultural education.</P>
    <P>A reorganisation of the advisory services has been talked about quite a lot over the past 12 months or so.  Submissions have been made to the Minister by the different farming organisations, by the advisory services, by the organisations themselves and by the General Council of Committees of Agriculture.  I hope that in considering these submissions the personnel of the Department and the Minister will give a thorough and deep study to this important section in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The county committees of agriculture are providing a very fine service. Much reference has been made to the composition of these committees, but by and large their services in each county are expanding and progressing and, also, there are an increasing number of instructors being appointed. Therefore, any decision as to the future of these committees, should be reached only after all considerations in the context of their services down through the years have been taken into account. The men on these committees are well aware of the particular problems in their respective counties so that at <Col N="1049" /> their monthly meetings they are in a position to reach the decisions that are best suited to solving the problems of the farmers in their areas.  I urge the Minister to consider very carefully any suggestion that may be put to him regarding the diminishing of any of the powers of these committees.  The importance of an efficient advisory service as an aid to agricultural development cannot be over-emphasised.</P>
    <P>In regard to the recruitment of staff, the present system should be changed and advisors should be appointed on the basis of interview, whether it be at national or county level.  I refer, of course, to the appointment of temporary advisors.  These people should be made permanent as soon as possible. Perhaps they could be made permanent after a 12 month probationary period. Also, their conditions of employment should be comparable to those obtaining in any other service because it is important that men of outstanding ability in the sphere of agriculture are attracted to these posts.  I would ask the Minister to have published a White Paper on the whole aspect of the re-organisation of the advisory service so that there could be comprehensive consultation with all the parties concerned. Already, we know the views of the various parties, but so far we have had no indication of the Department's thinking on the matter.  I look forward to hearing their ideas and suggestions in this respect.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement by the Minister telling us that the Minister for Finance has authorised the Agricultural Credit Corporation to lend to farmers a further £4.5 million in this current year.  Our farmers have the ability to utilise this money to the best advantage.  It is good to know that any farmer who can produce a worthwhile scheme will not be refused a loan by the corporation.</P>
    <P>May I refer again briefly to the question of re-organisation and make the suggestion that the Agricultural Credit Corporation should be under the control of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and not under <Col N="1050" /> the control of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The subject of agriculture is so wide that one could spend many hours discussing it, but on an Estimate such as this we can talk only on certain aspects of the industry.  In conclusion, I want to say a few words in regard to our entry into the EEC in so far as it will affect agriculture.  Many of the economic benefits that are likely to accrue from membership of the Community will be to the benefit of the agricultural sector.  The Community's agricultural policy and the implications of that policy for Irish agriculture are of the greatest importance not only to the agricultural industry itself but to the economic development of our country as a whole.  Clearly the effects of membership of the EEC will be very much to the advantage of agriculture, especially in our main sectors of livestock and livestock products.  While we will meet the keenest competition in an enlarged Community, I have the fullest confidence in the ability of farmers, processors and export interests to meet this competition successfully and to make the most of the opportunities that will arise when Irish agricultural products will be placed on all the markets of the Community on an equal footing with the products of the other member States.</P>
    <P>A prosperous agriculture is vital to Ireland's economic well-being and advancement.  Membership of the EEC will open for us the opportunity to compete on fair terms in a market of 250 million people.  Between 1966 and 1969 the value of total agricultural output rose by almost 30 per cent in this country.  This was achieved by a smaller labour force as it is well known that fewer people are now remaining on the land.  This is not just happening in this country, it is a world-wide trend. The value of output per man in farming rose by almost 10 per cent in that same period.  Many of our industries use raw materials from agriculture. Indeed, industries based on agriculture are responsible for about 45 per cent of industrial output.  Therefore, the value of our agricultural exports has risen from about £125 million in 1966 <Col N="1051" /> to £167 million in 1969.  The total value of exports of agricultural products and commodities derived from agriculture in 1969 was £207 million which is about 60 per cent of our total exports.  This high contribution provides cash for the importation of equipment and raw materials necessary for industry.  Without it perhaps industry would have to fold up or would not be able to keep moving.</P>
    <P>While we are proud of the contribution made by agriculture to the national economy we realise that this contribution could be far greater.  In 1959 a competition in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the committees of agriculture was launched by Macra na Feirme.  It was a national farm management competition.  In that year the gross output per acre of the first prize winner was three times the national average. The gross output of the winner in 1969, the most recent competition for which results are available, was six times the national average.  Therefore, output, with consequent increase in family income, is increased by adopting the most modern techniques.  For example, in dairying this would include paddock grazing, heavy use of fertiliser, heavy stocking and modern farmbuildings. The adoption of modern methods entails extra costs.  Farmers generally are not afraid of increased costs if they get a greater award for their produce.  We know that there are more progressive dairy farmers in creamery areas where a good milk price is paid.  We know that if the creamery is efficient and if it has good marketing &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; it will be able to pay a better price than any neighbouring creamery with inefficient techniques.  When we enter the Common Market the payment of better prices will instil confidence and encourage further progress in farming. The same can be said about enterprises other than dairying, for example, beet and vegetable growing and pig production. When the market is assured and a reasonably good price guaranteed the farmer increases his output.</P>

      <P>Heretofore, we depended on the British market, with about 50 million people to whom to sell our products, a market on which at times world produce was haphazardly dumped.  In the EEC we will have a market of about 250 million people to whom to sell our products and to whom they can and will be sold in an orderly marketing fashion.  With our mild climate, adequate rainfall spread over the year, it would be difficult for Europe to compete with us in grass production.  Deputies will appreciate what I mean as they see grass growing in the mild conditions obtaining this winter.  When Mansholt was here <Col N="1053" /> recently and also when he was present at a Macra na Feirme gathering in October, 1969, he was amazed to find the grass so green and that our winters were so short and so mild.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is learning all the time.  The problem of securing export outlets at remunerative prices is a continuing one.  Outside the EEC there is no prospect of an early improvement. Britain is and probably will continue to be the main market for our agricultural exports.  We sell 75 per cent of our agricultural exports there.  No realistic case has been made for any alternative to EEC membership. Britain in and Ireland out would have disastrous consequences for the economy, particularly for agriculture. Almost one-half of the output of Irish <Col N="1054" /> farms is exported, of which livestock and livestock products account for over 90 per cent.  The main effect of membership for our agricultural exports would be access to a large market at remunerative prices thus enabling our products to compete on equal terms with similar products of other member States.  This would mean a considerably higher return for our main exports, cattle and beef, dairy products, lamb and pigmeat.  Exports to non-member countries would, of course, qualify for aid from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund.  Because of our geographical situation, the bulk of our export trade would probably continue to be with the UK, where existing import arrangements for dairy products, bacon, sugar and ware potatoes would have to be terminated.  Agricultural products would, however, have to meet increased competition on the British market.  Exports of cattle and beef, lamb and, perhaps, pigmeat, to Continental countries of the Community would probably increase but the prospects of developing exports of dairy products or of sugar to these countries would be limited until such time as the current surplus problems there would be solved.  Our agricultural production pattern, predominantly grass based, livestock and livestock products, is ideally suited to reap full advantage from EEC membership.</P>
      <P>No discussion of agriculture and the Common Market would be complete without reference to the Mansholt Plan.  There are misconceptions about it and the voluntary aspect is completely overlooked.  We all realise that movement out of agriculture is a worldwide trend and will continue to take place here whether we join the Common Market or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A memorandum on the reform of agriculture in the European Economic Community was submitted to the Council of the EEC in December, 1968.  This document, which is now known as the Mansholt Plan, outlined a set of economic and social measures which are intended to bring about major structural changes in agricultural production.  Agricultural production in Europe increased by 33 per <Col N="1055" /> cent annually from 1957 to 1965.  Manpower, on the other hand, has been moving out of agriculture.  The number employed in agriculture has decreased from 16 million in 1955 to 12 million in 1965.  Therefore, productivity per person in agriculture&mdash;I am speaking in the European context&mdash;has been rising by 7 per cent per year.  The average size of a farm in Common Market countries is about 24 acres and it is stated that about two-thirds of all farm holdings are less than 22 acres. More than 80 per cent of dairy farmers own, at most, 10 cows and of more than four million dairy farmers only about 75,000 keep more than 20 cows.</P>
    <P>In the Mansholt Report it is stated that the history of the last ten years has proved beyond doubt that the industrial revolution is bringing in its wake a greater increase in prosperity.  In the last ten years the overwhelming majority of rural families have fallen behind in both living and income conditions while those who work in industry and the services have been advancing and can look forward to yet further improvements so long as economic conditions remain.  A farm which gives a farmer and his family neither enough work nor a proper income and which does not give good access to a reasonable social position and living conditions is no longer what the family farm should be.  The only way to provide our farmers with an equitable income and better living conditions and, at the same time, ensure an indispensable balance between output and sales outlet is by re-shaping the structure of production.  Certain measures are proposed to help persons withdraw from farming and measures to help persons remain in modernised agriculture are also proposed.</P>
    <P>These proposals of Mansholt have, of course, received widespread discussion throughout Europe.  Not all farmers in the Common Market countries accept these proposals.  Present day thinking in certain quarters aims at larger production units so that modern technology can be availed of to the fullest extent.  I emphasise this and I also emphasise the value being placed on industrial employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> It is difficult to estimate the extent to which Irish agricultural output would increase on the basis of the full application here of the EEC agricultural programme.  A tentative estimate suggests that the volume of gross agricultural output might be expected to increase in the latter half of this decade by 30 to 40 per cent over the present level.  The increase in the value of gross output could, of course, be considerably more because of the change to the higher level of producer prices.  Membership of the EEC offers Irish agriculture an opportunity of exploiting its fullest potential.  There will be keen competition both at home and on the export market from our fellow-farmers in the Community. However, our natural resources, plus the skill of our farmers, will ensure that the Irish farming community will reap the full benefit of membership of the EEC which will bring increased prosperity to our farmers and to the nation as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to start where Deputy Murphy, leading for the Labour Party, left off.  He called for the setting-up of an all-party committee of this House to consider the problems of agriculture.  I had the privilege recently of meeting two members of two Common Market Parliaments&mdash;the Belgian Parliament and the Luxemburg Parliament&mdash;and they told me that in both these Parliaments they have committees studying agriculture.  They have committees dealing with other aspects as well.  They have found these committees necessary to assimilate the very large volume of material coming before them for consideration both from the national administration and from the EEC.  This is particularly important in the field of agriculture because it is in this field the EEC have developed to the greatest extent and have achieved the greatest degree of integration.  The material coming from the Community, the decisions and directives, is much greater in relation to this subject. There is, therefore, a greater burden on agricultural members of particular Parliaments in assimilating a very large volume of detailed matter.  There is, of course, on the Continent a much wider variety of both agricultural and horticultural <Col N="1057" /> produce.  We must, however, take an interest in the systems adopted for the marketing and price support of these products because, if precedents are established in wine production or in fruit production along the Mediterranean, quite possibly these could be applied by us in other fields.  It is vital, therefore, that we should interest ourselves in every aspect of agricultural legislation enacted by the Community to see if precedents are established which can be applied by us to our own benefit and in regard to which we can agitate in relation to the commodities in which we are particularly interested. It is because of this vast volume of matter coming before us as members of the Community that I would urge the setting up of an all-party committee of this House to consider our agricultural problems.</P>

      <P>I raise the subject matter of this question on the Adjournment because, as the House is probably aware, there exists in Border constituencies at present a very high degree of tension.  This tension has been generated mainly by the cratering of Border roads by the British Army.  Question No. 6 of Thursday, 25th November asked the Minister what representations he had made and what replies he had received.  In reply the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>Strong and repeated protests have been made to the British authorities in regard to the cratering of border roads; the policy in this matter and its implementation are, of course, the responsibility of the Government. Every opportunity is taken of pointing out the folly of cratering and blocking border roads and the dangers involved.

      <P>I would like to know what reply, if any, the Minister has received from the Stormont Government.  I should also like to know if stronger protests could not be made.  Without accusing the Minister of being neglectful or irresponsible I doubt very much if he realises the present situation which exists close to the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to refer to one particular incident with which I have been dealing over the past two days.  It involves an incident which occurred on Sunday evening when a regiment of British soldiers came to a crater outside Clones, seized two mechanical diggers, taking one away with them and the other, which they could not start because it had no battery, they damaged.  The nature of the damage was, for example, removing the valves from all wheels, removing the bung from the sump, throwing it away and allowing oil to run out, removing the cap and filling the tank with clay, breaking a number of hydraulic iron pipes, removing some others, removing the self-starter and injector pump, breaking windows and the clocks in the dashboard with the butt of a rifle.  The owner told the police that as a safeguard against the machine being commandeered he had removed the battery, nevertheless he was kept waiting for one hour by the Northern police force before they handed him back some of the parts. Some of the parts he was given back were so badly broken that they were no longer of any use. <Col N="1059" /> This is the sort of situation which prevails along the Border area.  The road to which I am referring leads to an area known as Coleman, County Monaghan, in which 13 people own property and 11 people reside.  For practically one month those people had no access to their homes, their businesses and their farms except on foot. Admittedly within the last week the British Army have removed two spikes on a road leading into the North and have allowed them to pass by the remaining spikes.  But for one month the people who live in this artificial island, which had been created by the cratering of roads, had no means of access other than by foot.  If any of those people required the assistance of a doctor or a veterinary surgeon, the doctor or veterinary surgeon would have to park in a dangerous area and walk through a water-filled crater and through a bog in order to reach his patients or clients.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that I am questioning the representations the Minister has made; it is for that reason I am endeavouring to tell the House how serious the problem is at present.  I have pointed out the disadvantages which those people are at from a material point of view but in my opinion there is a much more serious disadvantage from this sad episode than inconvenience alone.  There are in this area people of different political persuasions and different religious beliefs who have lived in peace and harmony with each other but at present I am sorry to say this relationship is becoming, to put it mildly, slightly strained.  The Government, the Taoiseach and the Minister should spare no effort in informing the British Government not only of the hardships but of the consequences which this can create.</P>
    <P>In an area known as the Clogher Road on which a small country shop is situated, the owner, Mr. Traynor, has a business on both sides of the Border but at present both businesses are closed because he has no access to either place of business.  The situation is so serious in areas such as these that stronger action should be taken <Col N="1060" /> than merely a letter to the British Government or a call made by a representative from the Irish Embassy in London.  I would have thought the situation along the Border at present is so serious that, perhaps, the Minister could make time to come and see not only the material damage done but the inconvenience that is being caused.</P>
    <P>We had another episode recently known as the Munnelly Bridge.  The British Army had prepared to lay charges about 30 feet across a bridge in the Republic and luckily the National Army were able to arrive in time to prevent this charge being detonated.  The first people on the scene, the people to whom credit should be given for holding the fort until the Army arrived, were members of the Garda Síochána from Clones, who had to take the insults as they were hurled at them from British soldiers.  They remained there until the Army arrived and were then in a position to take whatever action was necessary. Luckily, the British soldiers withdrew their charges and retreated.  The remaining charges on the Republic side were taken by the National Army and that was the end of it, but now the situation is that that bridge is blown up&mdash;it has been repaired by locals&mdash;and it is creating a considerable amount of flooding because these local people have had no assistance whatever and have had to make a road over a river with a few telephone poles and a couple of lines of girders. I believe that some assistance could have been given to local people to make good roads that were damaged, where they were necessary and in all cases these roads are very necessary.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider this whole problem and to remember that these incidents on the Border are generating a degree of polarisation between different sections of the community which was not there before this sad episode took place.  I would ask him to view, if possible, some of these places and see for himself the hardship and damage being imposed on decent people who have no axe to grind and are in no way interfering with anybody.  I would ask him to make stronger representations <Col N="1061" /> and to make sure that all these representations, in so far as he can, are listened to because I am afraid that, if not, this whole sad episode will have a very poor end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his contribution to our information about the inconvenience and difficulties caused by this silly policy of the British Government.  Deputy Lynch asked a question last week, and before that Deputy Harte, and when we spoke of representations, I had a great deal of information available on the representations. It is not just a letter, there were representations by the Taoiseach and by me, very strong representations, but as I said to Deputy Harte at the time, if a government, as the British Government is, is silly enough to introduce this policy, representations to them can have very little effect but this does not mean that there have not been representations of the strongest kind.</P>
      <P>There is a basis in some of what Deputy Fox said of the thinking that representations would end the particular aspect of this policy of the British, if only we would make them. I can assure the Deputy that the strongest and most frequent representations were made at the highest level, and only repeat that this lunatic policy of the British Government is a British Government policy, and in so far as he criticises it that way, I can tell him that the Government are in complete agreement with him, but we must not be trapped into any situation where we take on ourselves or on each other any responsibility for the total intransigence of the British Government in dealing with representations in regard to this lunatic policy.</P>

There is a serious situation between our Government and the British Government now because of their policy and this serious situation does include the inconvenience caused to people, which the Deputy has <Col N="1062" /> told us about.  It includes more than inconvenience&mdash;the serious internment situation, not to speak at all of the treatment of people in internment.  It includes a situation in which our Government have repeatedly, not alone made representations, but have told the British Government where they were going; and picking isolated cases of different aspects of what I have called a lunatic policy should not make us forget that it is the whole policy of a Government in Britain who are pushing through this policy, regardless of what we say, regardless, I believe, of the wishes of their own electorate and regardless of the dictates of common sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as effectiveness is concerned &mdash; Deputy Fox wants to know was there any effect, any good answer that they would do anything about it.  The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  You are now dealing with a most serious situation between two Governments and you have to decide which side you are on.  If you like, I could read out what the Taoiseach said publicly when this policy started.  It covered the Government attitude, apart from private representations, but I would ask the House to treat this as a serious situation between two Governments in which we are taking totally opposing attitudes, and you have to be very clear in your thinking then as to whether you are making representations or whether it is our fault that they do not do what we want.  We do not blame ourselves any more if we are dealing with people who are taking such an opposing attitude.</P>
      <P>I would quote the Taoiseach on l3th October, when this aggravating business began.  The Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>I have protested against the blocking of Border crossings.  Such measures are not alone directed at the wrong problem in the wrong place, but they are unlikely to succeed in their overt intention.  In my opinion, they will aggravate a deteriorating situation.  They will subvert the influence exercised by men of moderation such as the leaders of the non-Unionist community. Public opinion here will be disturbed very substantially.  People living in the Border area on both sides will resent the serious inconvenience caused to them and this will increase the risk of incidents along the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extent to which cross-Border activities contribute to the scale of violence in the North is not significant and we have taken and continue to take, all possible precautions to prevent it.  I reject any inference that the contrary is the case.  Indeed, Lord Windlesham, Minister for State, British Home Office, admitted recently in the House of Lords that these activities do not <Col N="1065" /> play a significant part in the campaign of violence.  The stepping-up of military action to create physical barriers between the people of this island is a retrograde step.  What is needed now and needed urgently is positive action towards finding a political solution to the problems of the North, action which must take account of the views of the elected representatives of the non-Unionist community.  I have taken steps to make my views on this matter known to the British Government at the highest level.</P>
    <P>That is what the Taoiseach said and everything he said at that time was accurate.  Not alone that, but we can say tonight that everything he forecast has come to pass.  The influence of men of moderation in the North, as far as preventing the polarisation of the two communities is concerned, is no longer capable of preventing that polarisation.  Internment without trial, not to speak of the treatment of internees, had already ensured that the non-Unionist community in the North would have nothing to do any longer with the Stormont regime.  This attempt to divide the island into two by digging holes has only served to increase the reluctance of the non-Unionist public representatives in the North to take any Stormont regime seriously or to acquiesce in their policies.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that public opinion would be substantially disturbed and it is.  Public opinion here is very disturbed.  He said at the time that there would be serious inconvenience at the Border.  The Deputy has given us good reasons why people on the Border resent this inconvenience on top of the tension already existing there, as the Deputy says.  Worse still, there has been an increase in serious incidents along the Border.  I call it a lunatic policy because the whole thing has an air of lunacy about it.  Perhaps it is the last lunacy of a British Government that does not know what is going on in the North of Ireland, does not know that 40 per cent of the people there are in revolt against the Unionist Government and that they are satisfied and we are satisfied, I think, that their refusal to be governed by <Col N="1066" /> Unionism has already succeeded.  I do not know whether it is any good making recommendations or representations to the British Government but perhaps we could recommend that they take full notice of what Mr. Maudling said, rather than dig holes in the roads. Mr. Maudling said:</P>
    <P>If, by agreement, the North and South should at some time decide to come together in a United Ireland; if, by agreement, this should be their wish then not only would we not obstruct the solution but I am sure the whole British people would warmly welcome it.</P>
    <P>I am sure he is right about the feelings of the British public.  I am certain of what the feelings of the majority of the Irish people are and I think it is incumbent on the British Government to respond to the wishes of their own electorate instead of having their Army going around destroying roads and bridges and doing it repeatedly while local people undo their work.</P>
    <P>The British Government should, and could now get down to the basic issue of meeting the wishes, not alone of the Irish people but, as they seem to be realising at last, the wishes of the British people.</P>
    <P>I do not know what will bring it about.  A single act of statesmanship is what is now required on the part of the British Government.  This would be a response to the desires of the British people and the Irish people. That is what the situation now requires. What would bring it about? Our representations?  I do not know. Their own people's feelings?  I am not sure.  If common sense would come into the picture, perhaps that would do it.  We can make representations; we can give them advice but only God can give them sense.</P>
    <P>Time and again matters are raised in this House arising out of the situation in the North.  I know the Deputy feels he must make representations here and he is right and he is entitled to do so but I think we must face the fact that this is a policy of the British Government deliberately entered into and that no matter how <Col N="1067" /> lunatic it is to us they have decided on it and seem determined to carry it on.  We should continue to make our representations and I think the Deputy should continue, with other Deputies in the House, to play his part by raising matters like this but I do not <Col N="1068" /> think we should blame each other, for the real responsibility lies with the British Government, not with us and not even in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 2nd December, 1971.</P>

      <P>There is no legislation aimed specifically at controlling the export of young cattle.  From 1946 to 1953 the export of cattle to countries other than Britain and Northern Ireland was prohibited except under licence under the terms of the Cattle (Export Prohibition) Order, 1946 (S.R.O. No. 83 of 1946). In 1953 when the position in regard to orders made during the war and post-war years was being reviewed it was decided to incorporate this control in a general order, namely, the Agricultural Products (Restriction of Export) Order, 1953 (S.I. No. 234 of 1953) which was made on 30th June, 1953.  Export control has been necessary to enable the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to regulate exports of cattle to destinations other than Britain and Northern Ireland so as to meet our obligations under trade agreements as regards the supply of live cattle to the UK.</P>
