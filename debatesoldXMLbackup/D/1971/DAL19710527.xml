    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that it was agreed to take Estimates on Thursdays but I should like to ask the Minister for Labour, through you, Sir, why the Redundancy Payments Bill is not being finished?  Could the Minister not have used the opportunity of getting the Bill through the House today?  It is an important Bill.  Every day people are losing their jobs because there are those who want to avoid what the Bill will do and they are dodging this by letting people go.  We have evidence of this.  While I know it was agreed by the Whips to take Estimates on Thursdays we have on other occasions found the Order of Business being changed on Thursdays and other days for the purpose of getting important business through the House.  I just want to register this personal protest because I feel the Redundancy Payments Bill is a most important Bill for the workers in view of the redundancies which are occurring.  I feel that a mistake has been made that we are <Col N="393" /> not taking this this morning and I would appeal to the Minister to get it through as quickly as he can.</P>
      <P>The Department of Labour were set up some years ago with a great fanfare of trumpets and were supposed to end all our troubles so far as labour matters were concerned.  It is regrettable that this has not been achieved. This is not because the officials of the Department have not being doing everything they can, under the terms of reference which they have, to run things properly.  The fact is that we are no nearer a solution to our problems than when the Department were set up. Yesterday evening, for what reason I do not know, possibly because the ICTU booklet had been issued and it has a handy reference, we had Deputies coming in here talking about the number of strikes that have taken place in recent times and they used the &ldquo;in&rdquo; words &ldquo;we are top of the league&rdquo; or &ldquo;we are third from the top of the league&rdquo; as far as strikes are concerned in Europe.  We even had a rather naïve suggestion from a Fianna Fáil Deputy whose name, as he is a friend of mine, I will not mention, that the cause of the strikes was that there are too many unions and that in certain Iron Curtain countries there was only one union.  I did not know whether he had in mind that some place like the saltmines should be opened in Longford-Westmeath, or over in the west, to which those who did not behave properly could be sent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It always mystifies me why people, both inside and outside the House, who do not know the cause of strikes or who do not take the trouble to find out, consider that they have a right to speak out on matters on which they know so little.  Yesterday when I was in the Chair for a short time I heard a comment from somebody who was objecting because auctioneers had a vested interest in the Forcible Entry Bill before the House.  A suggestion was made that trade union officials and employer representatives had a vested interest in the question of labour relations. We have, and we do not deny it. It is our job to try to improve labour relations.  When people talk about where we stand in the league we know <Col N="394" /> that we must compare like with like. It is ridiculous to talk about the percentage of people unemployed here because of strikes and to compare that figure with the percentage of unemployed in Britain.  That is not a fair comparison.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour have not yet attempted to segregate the particular areas of unrest and to find out why strikes recur in certain types of employment. CIE have had more than their share of strikes.  From my experience and dealings with CIE if the people in that firm who were negotiating with me and dealing with wages of employees are typical of those who negotiate on a national scale with other trade unions, I am not surprised that we have had numerous strikes in CIE. If I tell the Minister that a wage demand served in July, 1970, which has been before the Labour Court twice, has not yet been finalised he will understand the position.  The people who represent CIE are most obstructive.  When the Labour Court recommended after a full hearing and after seven weeks' consideration that CIE should discuss with the union the matter which was the cause of the dispute, CIE took about ten minutes in which they used whatever type of insulting behaviour they could to prove that they were not going to negotiate. They went back to conciliation and they attempted to prove there that what they had tried to do the first time was the correct way.  They argued further at the Labour Court hearing as they had done at the first hearing. If that is typical of CIE it is no wonder that they have strikes so often.</P>
    <P>Strike action should only be used as a last resort.  It is a pity that the people most affected by strike action are fellow-workers of those on strike.  We must all consider this matter.  Having been in the trade union movement for so long and having participated in so many strikes myself, I appreciate that there is a point at which people who can find no other way to solve their problems are tempted to go on strike. I appeal to everyone concerned to consider the effects of strike action on innocent people who cannot hope to gain from it.  This should be considered <Col N="395" /> before strike action is taken. We are supposed to be entering a civilised era.  Those of us who are involved in the trade union movement should do everything we can in order to avoid hardship to the general public through strikes.  We know that the only way in which some employers can be made act is by directing public opinion against them.  A situation can be reached where it is necessary to do something in order to force an employer to be reasonable.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour might check on strikes which occurred over the last few years and compare the demands served by the trade unions with the original offer of the employers; these figures should be compared also with the final offer of the employer.  If that comparison were made, I would challenge the Department of Labour to say that the workers were unreasonable.  My experience has been that the final settlement is nearer the original demand of the workers than the original offer of the employer. There have been strikes and lock-outs which have damaged the economy.  It often suits an employer to have a strike and saves him money.  We have one small strike in progress at the moment which would fit into that category.  It can be said that this is a free country and that we cannot force the employers or workers to do what is in the common good.  There are State bodies, semi-State bodies and so-called private firms in this country who have been assisted many times by the taxpayers' money and they should not be allowed to draw their dividends when there is a slack period while saying to the workers &ldquo;These men are being unreasonable and we will not meet them and will not agree&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>An employer can arrange his affairs in such a way that he can close down at a certain period without giving any intimation of such action to the employees affected until the last moment. This trend is increasing.  The Department of Labour must do something about it.  There is no point in saying that the private employer is entitled to lay-off people if he has no use for them.  That is so, but the employee is <Col N="396" /> entitled to reasonable notification of such action.  We have had experience recently of firms who have known apparently for months in advance&mdash; and where it has been alleged that the Government have known for months in advance&mdash;that they were closing down and the unfortunate employees did not know of this until they got a fortnight's notice under the Redundancy Payments Act.  This matter must be dealt with at a high level.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour are aware from certain inquiries that have been made that there is concern about the question of the national agreement. There are people who, having participated in the drawing up of the national agreement and having examined it carefully, still do not seem to understand what it means.  The national agreement covers those whose agreements had terminated.  It covers a period of 18 months.  It also covers people whose agreements have not yet terminated but will terminate over six, nine or 12 months.  It is ridiculous to try to do as some people are doing and to say that the terms of the national agreement must bind people whose existing agreements have not yet terminated.  If that is so it is extending the terms of the national pay agreement by three, six or 12 months.  This was never intended and it will not be allowed.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to find a few days ago that there were people who were engaged in negotiations who did not appreciate that this was the situation. Let me spell it out again.  The national pay agreement covers a period of 18 months from the termination of an agreement on 1st January, 1971 and the agreement covers a number of matters as well as wages.  Those who are already working on an existing agreement which has not yet terminated cannot be counted to be under the national agreement and, therefore, the terms of the national agreement do not apply to them.  This matter must be clarified and understood by all.  I do not mind those people who do not understand labour relations making a mistake in this regard but I fault those who should know about it.</P>
    <P>There are many matters that must be <Col N="397" /> cleared up.  I have been a severe critic of the Labour Court from time to time. The conciliation officers of the Labour Court are doing an excellent job but I consider they are lacking in one respect.  There should be a general liaison officer between the Labour Court and the trade unions whose job it would be to see if a complaint is made by either a trade union or an employers' organisation asking for conciliation, that a conference is arranged when requested.  It is not sufficient to write to both sides asking if conciliation can be agreed to and a conference arranged.  What happens in many cases is that the employer will not reply, the trade union may be dealing with other matters and may be waiting to see what will happen.  Months may go by and eventually the people who have been waiting for the conference will get fed up and a strike may occur.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court are doing a good job.  My main criticism is the delay which takes place in some cases between the hearing of the case and the issuing of a recommendation.  I discussed this with the chairman of the court and I found, that he and the officials were most courteous.  I have no complaint to make against employer or employee representatives or the chairman. My complaint is that if it is to be an effective means of remedying disputes when a matter is reported to the court there should not be a delay before the case is heard at conciliation level and, if necessary, before the court. No matter what happens there should be a recommendation within a reasonable time.  I do not regard seven weeks as a reasonable time to wait for a Labour Court recommendation.</P>
    <P>There are a number of matters that cannot come before the Labour Court but that must be dealt with eventually by someone and the Department of Labour must take the initiative.  We have a large number of trade unions, with a consequent large number of trade unionists.  However, there is a considerable number of persons who are not members of any trade union&mdash; they may be members of house associations and so on.  There are in operation certain regulations which are not being administered in a proper <Col N="398" /> manner.  Let us consider the case of a person who works a normal number of hours.  If such a person works overtime and is not paid or compensated for it, if the person is a member of a trade union a claim will be made which will eventually find its way to the Labour Court or some kind of conciliation. If he is not a member of a trade union it is quite possible that he will have to work for very long hours without any compensation&mdash;he may have to work right through the night and all through the following day, as has happened in this House&mdash;and nobody seems to worry about it.  We get promises that they will be paid; we are told &ldquo;the State always deals fairly with these matters&rdquo;.  The only thing about it is that the State does not deal fairly and, despite fair promises, the State does not pay.  If the State will not pay neither will anybody else because the attitude of people is &ldquo;If the State can get away with this, why should I pay?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are also certain areas which could be dealt with, such as people who are &ldquo;put on the staff&rdquo;.  It is a kind of magic used by certain employers who, when they get an industry going fairly well, select some people who may be a little better than the other employees and they are put on the staff.  In many cases being &ldquo;put on the staff&rdquo; means that they are paid for longer holidays, they are paid more wages, they are entitled to sick pay and so on.  However, there are certain employers who do not consider it is possible for those people who are put on the staff to be loyal to the firm if they remain members of their trade union.  These employees are told &ldquo;You are on the staff now.  You should not be a member of a trade union.  After all, you are in control of a certain number of people&rdquo;.  If those people fall ill they are not paid, or if they work long hours they will not get compensation. This nice little racket has been worked by people for many years and it is something the Minister might inquire into.  It may not be as easy as it seems to solve but something should be done.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Supplementary Estimates, it is rather extraordinary that immediately after the Budget&mdash;which <Col N="399" /> is supposed to be the housekeeping account for the next 12 months&mdash;we find it necessary to bring in Supplementary Estimates.  I was pooh-poohed by the Minister for Finance who said that this was the normal thing to do and that it has been done before. However, the fact that it has been done before does not make it any better.  The housekeeper who cannot manage on her housekeeping allowance and asks for additional money during the week will not be popular and will find that her methods of housekeeping will be questioned. However, the State apparently thinks that so far as its housekeeping is concerned there is nothing wrong in introducing a Budget for 12 months and immediately afterwards introducing Supplementary Estimates.</P>
    <P>The money is required and it is for a good purpose but, with due respect to the Minister and his officials, there is no reason why a week earlier it could not have been made known that this extra money was required and, therefore, the money included in the Budget.  I have been on a local authority for a long time and I know that every time we meet to strike the rates we get requests from every sector who are in any way affected asking us not to over-expend during the year.  From time to time someone who has been well primed by a Minister will get up and make a proposition that in no circumstances will there be over-expenditure during the year&mdash;knowing quite well that there will be over-expenditure. The State also decides that it will require additional money.</P>
    <P>Money provided for AnCO is money well spent.  As I commented during the Budget debate, the provision of new training headquarters is an excellent idea.  All I regret is that the Taoiseach does not come from Meath because we could do with something like that down there, particularly in the town of Navan which is the home of furniture making as well as producing other commodities. Attempts were made to have a furniture training school there but this did not do so well.  Perhaps the reason for this was that the State was not in a position to provide the necessary <Col N="400" /> funds.  This school was opened with much fanfare but it disappeared very quietly and nobody was supposed to remark that it had closed.  When I asked a question here in connection with it the new &ldquo;in&rdquo; expression of &ldquo;anti-national&rdquo; was thrown at me. The Minister for Foreign Affairs seems to have claimed that expression for his own.</P>
    <P>We must train more people but we must also do something else and this is where I take issue with the Minister for Labour.  There appears to be the idea that it is all right to train people without going into very much detail as to what they should be trained for.  I am surprised that so far nobody has produced a document indicating what are the skills likely to be required in this country whether we are in or out of the Common Market.  Until a few months ago we were training people for the textile industry at a time when many textile factories were closing down.  A great deal of money was spent on this training.  If people are to be trained they should be trained in skills that will be useful to them and skills that will be required because it is worse than useless to train people in skills that are not required.  In the same way it is useless to train people and give them the impression that when their training is completed there will be jobs for them when we know, as experience has shown, that those jobs do not exist. This seems to be the present situation.</P>
    <P>Some of my friends from the west may slate me for saying that there has been too much emphasis on the west in relation to training because the industries are not there, that the industries are in the east and in the south. Therefore, provision should be made for the training of people in the eastern part of the country for jobs that will be there for them when their training is completed.  To emphasise the point I am making, I shall take mining as an example.  At present mining is a big business in this country but how much training in mining is being given by AnCO or by anybody else?  What schemes are there to train young people who should be able to do well paid jobs in mining in the years ahead?</P>
    <P>In certain parts of the country at present and, particularly, around this <Col N="401" /> city, there is a grave shortage of craftsmen for house building.  Has any effort been made to reach agreement with the craftsmen's unions so as to ensure that there will be a supply of young craftsmen to take the place of those who retire?  Have any efforts been made to ensure that the many people who have been working at crafts for a number of years but who have not served their time would be accepted by the craft unions?  I am not speaking for them but I am only making the suggestion that they could be brought into the trade to do jobs that are there for them.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion that the Department of Labour are not taking enough trouble in this respect.  It was not enough to set up the Department and to decide to do what was being done by other Departments.  I do not wish to embarrass the Secretary of the Department but I know that he is a man who is not afraid to try new ideas.  The whole emphasis from the Government side should be on an attempt to make the Department of Labour a Department whose job it will be to look to the future and to ensure that every effort is made to keep things going.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that unemployment figures have continued to increase.  The decision to remove certain persons from the unemployment register for one reason or another is nonsensical.  There is no point in trying to reduce the register by saying that people are not unemployed and by not giving them any money.  There are many people unemployed. Also, there are many young people studying for academic careers which, again, do not appear to be there for them.  Anybody who listened to the news bulletin this morning will know what is happening in respect of one of the teaching professions.</P>
    <P>There are many young people now approaching the stage where they must decide whether they will have an academic career or otherwise.  Nobody seems to realise that these young people who are striving to get four honours in the leaving certificate so as to qualify for admission to a university and train for God knows what, would be much better off in many cases if they were trained for a craft. This should be the task of the Department <Col N="402" /> of Labour.  They must not try to shrug it off and pretend that the Department of Education or somebody else are responsible.  They must start in the schools because it appears that the older section of our community cannot be trained for anything.  When I asked the Minister for Labour some time ago why advertisements were being inserted in English newspapers asking people to come home to this country either to jobs that were there for them or to be trained for particular jobs at a time when we had more than 60,000 people unemployed, the Minister's reply was depressing especially to a person like myself who knows a lot about the way these people live. The Minister told me that it was not possible to train most of the people who are on the unemployment register. I would not agree with that but I would agree that because of our peculiar social welfare system whereby people have been retained on the unemployment register for many years, some of them not having worked for a long time, it would not be possible for them to be trained and they would not be able to take a job.  However, it should be possible to train at least half of those who are on the unemployment register assuming, of course, that there would be jobs for them when they had completed their training.</P>
    <P>Until we reach the stage where we have a Government who will say that, first of all, there must be employment for our people and, if the employment is not available, a Government who will go out and create industries that will provide jobs, we will continue to have a high unemployment figure.  Let me emphasise, however, that there is no point in starting a factory in Connemara for people who are living in Dublin just as there would be no point in starting a factory in Athlone for people who are living in Donegal. Factories should be sited where the pool of employment is available.  I believe it should be possible for the Department of Labour to make arrangements for those who are signing for unemployment benefit or assistance over a lengthy period to be provided with work by private enterprise, if that <Col N="403" /> is how the Government want it, or if that does not work out, the Government should have the responsibility of starting industries where these people can be employed and the training should fall on the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>Those are the points I want to make. I have no quarrel with the Department of Labour.  As individuals, I think they are doing the best they can under the circumstances but I do not think the initiative I expect from the Department is there.  The Government are not giving them a fair deal.  There should be a new charter for the Department of Labour whereby it could step out on its own and say: &ldquo;We must have full employment.  We are the people to get the workers and train them for it.&rdquo; I hope we shall soon see an effort made to do something like that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that when we think of the Department of Labour we immediately think of strikes.  Deputy Tully said a few moments ago that trade unionists try to avoid hardships during strikes.  I accept this.  One may then wonder why, with goodwill on the trade union side and, as we must accept, goodwill on the employers' side, we have so many strikes that cause such hardship. A mark of any democracy is the liberty of people to strike; they cannot strike in a totalitarian country.  Therefore, if we feel the strike weapon is being abused it is a blow at democracy as well as a blow at the wellbeing of the workers and families affected by a strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may well be that in this century the strike weapon is outdated.  It may be well to say that but yet we must recognise that the Department of Labour cannot legislate us into industrial happiness: it must come from the people involved in industry on both sides.  If asked to make one suggestion to reduce the number of strikes my first would be to strengthen, not the Department of Labour&mdash;which I think is very efficient&mdash;but the Congress of Trade Unions.  One cannot but admire <Col N="404" /> the efforts of this body in the past 18 months or two years to get some overall order in industrial relations.  When they devised, drafted and had accepted their policy on picketing we hailed this as a great breakthrough by the council of trade unions, the men with the expertise.  It was accepted by a special delegate conference of the unions.  One is perhaps disillusioned then when one sees a strike like the one-day strikes of the CIE men.  I shall not probe why these strikes take place or why pickets are put on various depots so that the people of this city were without buses on one day each week for the past few weeks.  Everybody will have to face this in future. One might say the perfect Department of Labour would be a Department which could somehow stop this, but we must be realists and realise that despite the efficiency of the Department that is not possible.  Strangely&mdash; or perhaps not so strangely&mdash;there is a high regard among trade unionists for the Department of Labour and yet we still have the strikes which are causing loss of a bus service one day each week or loss of electric power over a wide area.</P>
    <P>The strike weapon which has been used and used violently at times is perhaps not the most effective remedy for the ills of those involved in industry.  The attitude of the European trade unions seems to be &ldquo;take it and come again&rdquo;. If they have a grievance they negotiate with the employers.  Some progress is made and an increase in pay or better conditions is gained, but they never, of course, achieve 100 per cent success. They immediately serve notice that they will expect negotiations on the balance of their claim.  These negotiations will go on while the factories still work or the trains still run and electric power stations still operate with the result that there is no loss to the workers or to the national economy.</P>
    <P>It is always said that in Ireland one takes one's political affiliations from one's father or grandfather.  This seems to be true also in trade union circles in that sooner than pass a picket many workers would starve because they feel that to pass a picket is a betrayal of a <Col N="405" /> principle.  There is no doubt that these men's loyalty and high principles have been abused at times by people not so interested in trade union achievements but simply because this loyalty can be used to cause trouble.  Again, this is why I say every effort should be made to strengthen the Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>I believe that in a democracy a government cannot legislate to provide perfect industrial relations.  We must then see what can be done so that first of all we may reduce the number of man days lost in strikes and, what is more important, remove the hardships inflicted on some workers and their families during strikes.  One can prove anything with statistics but the report of Congress on strikes just issued is a most educational and informative document.  A lesson can be learned from this report which will go a long way to prevent us from being near the top of the table of OECD figures for strikes.  We have had two or three very long strikes which gave us a false image in the industrial world.  It is a fact that these strikes did take place. How can we&mdash;not prevent them&mdash;but remove the conditions which cause them?  Irish workers have a grave sense of insecurity.  They feel they must take what they can get at the moment, that they cannot look too far into the future either because they cannot trust the employer or because of historic reasons.  They feel they cannot say that next year they will have salaries which would give them much higher standards of living than they now have.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully mentioned full employment. It is the duty of the Government to continue to provide more employment until we have full employment. I do not think either side of the industrial fence creates the confidence in the country which will attract outside investors.  We need foreign capital in order to give workers the opportunity of working in Dublin, even though they may be working for a foreign firm; it is much better that Irish workers should work for a foreign firm in Ireland rather than for a foreign firm in Britain.</P>
    <P>I cannot suggest what should be done to improve the bad industrial relations <Col N="406" /> which exist but I would say the Minister's Department is held in high esteem by the trade unions and I presume by the employers.  There is a tremendous opportunity for the Department, the Congress of Trade Unions and the various employers' organisations to make 1971 the turning point. We should think not only of the man and woman in employment but of the many people who cannot find work and have to emigrate.  We are inclined to forget our emigrants once they are gone but they do not forget us.  Many thousands of emigrants look forward to the day when they can return to jobs here.  The only way jobs can be created is if the Department, the Congress of Trade Unions and the employers' organisations recognise that we have the same duty to the man without a job as to a member of a trade union or of an employers' organisation.  There is a duty on each one of us to strive by every means possible to bring about full employment.  If we are able to do that many of our problems will be removed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully dealt with the training of workers.  He rightly said that there is a grave shortage of craftsmen in the building trades at a time when we need more houses than ever before.  If the Government were given all the money necessary to eradicate every slum dwelling and provide every family with a proper dwelling they could not do it because there are not the workers available.  Because of the recession in building in the midlands in Britain some workers have come back but still the papers are full of advertisements for carpenters, bricklayers and other craftsmen in all parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The point is that people are being trained to fill white collar jobs instead of jobs at a bench or on a building site. It is very often the choice of the parents because of snobbishness, or perhaps I should be more charitable and say because of the deep interest of every parent in the future of his child and the position he will obtain, and not the choice of the boy himself.  The boy who passes the intermediate and leaving certificate examination and goes to university and obtains a degree may have to join the brain drain and <Col N="407" /> emigrate to Britain, the States and no doubt the Continent in the future, because he cannot find a job at home.</P>
    <P>I remember some years ago looking at the apprenticeship tests in Dublin. The Japanese, the German and the Spanish boys took the medals in the more sophisticated trades.  Our boys did very well but not on such a wide scale.  With all due respects to AnCO they should look into the changing pattern of trades.  Building techniques change and this means some of the older trades will disappear and newer ones will take their places.  We must ensure we have enough trained workers to fill the jobs available at home.  The time will come when more and more of our children will go to university but we should keep in mind what jobs can be offered them at the end of their studies instead of simply having in mind the prestige value of sending a son or daughter to university.</P>
    <P>If I am not treading on too dangerous ground I would suggest our vocational schools should be in much greater contact with the Department of Labour than with the Department of Education as is the case at present.  I have always felt the name, &ldquo;Department of Labour&rdquo; was a misnomer.  If the teachers worked in closer harmony with the Department there would be a much brighter future for the boys and girls who wished to acquire the expertise of the craftsmen because as I have already said we cannot guarantee employment at university level.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a speech yesterday, with which we all agree, about the placement of blind workers in industry. I believe as the Minister believes that these men and women have something to offer society.  We cannot afford to let their skills waste away because we have not created opportunities for them.  I would suggest AnCO set up a rehabilitation institute where men and women who do not have the full faculties or are in some way physically handicapped could be trained to fill a vacuum in society and help to create wealth for the nation and for themselves.</P>
    <P>In conclusion all I can say is I wish <Col N="408" /> the Minister well in the coming year. I wish him Utopia if ever the Department of Labour would be so good that no strikes would take place and indeed if the trade unions were so good that no strikes were threatened, but I suppose human nature being what it is that is far too much to expect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Deputy for wishing me well and not expecting Utopia.  I think it was in search of Eldorado that it was said it was better to travel hopefully than to arrive.  At least we are travelling hopefully and I suppose in the Department of Labour one never arrives.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank those Deputies who spoke constructively and made useful contributions to the debate.  I know the temptation is always there to exaggerate, but many who contributed to the debate had regard to the serious work involved in the Department. This is the one Department more than any other, I think, in relation to which we have got to take a most responsible approach because of the seriousness of the work involved and also because of the profoundly human element involved.  In the Department of Labour one is dealing with all types of humanity and the all-important matter of their employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton expressed some concern about our objectives being properly defined.  He said this was essential to ensure that targets had been met.  He was mainly referring to training.  In actual fact AnCO are ahead of the target.  I shall return to this later.  Both Deputy Belton and Deputy Desmond made play on comparisons between the number of training places in the Republic and those in Northern Ireland.  This is not a fair comparison.  We are new in this field and our progress has been very creditable compared with the rate of development in training in other countries. Indeed, progress has been exceptionally good.  We must have regard to the resources available.  We should certainly not be guided by the rate achieved elsewhere or the number of places available.  Our training programme at the moment provides for 1,150 trainees.  The fact that there are <Col N="409" /> 2,400 training places in Northern Ireland is immaterial.  We have our own system.  In Sweden they have 35,000 training places and if we were to provide training places in proportion to Sweden we would have 14,000 places.  Our intention is to lay a proper foundation because training must be based on the best possible system designed to meet our own needs.  These are the lines along which we are moving.  Deputy Belton and Deputy Cluskey said that only eight people were retrained.  That is absolutely incorrect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 900 have been trained by AnCO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Retrained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  A substantial number of this 900 could have been retrained.  I think the figure of eight was taken from a reply to a Parliamentary Question I gave here.  That answer related to the retraining of eight female upholsterers.  A total of 900 persons have been trained.  I could not give the number retrained because some have been trained in skills they did not have before and others in skills they were improving.  Fairly good progress has been made.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton also referred to 1 per cent of the wage bill for retraining. Training by AnCO is financed from the Department's Vote.  The grant levy scheme is for self-training within industry. The 1 per cent levy on payroll relates to the levy grants scheme, of which about 90 per cent is recouped without delay to the firms of the particular industry if those firms retrain as prescribed by AnCO.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton also suggested that we should rent training centres rather than build them.  Except in Dublin all the training centres are rented.  We are building in Dublin.  I do not believe these buildings will become obsolete because we will always have to keep abreast of technological developments and, rather than becoming obsolete, more and more training centres will be needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey suggested we did not put training and retraining very high <Col N="410" /> on our priority list.  The amount of money provided has increased over the past three years, as a glance at the figures will show.  In 1969-70 the total amount was £1,145,000 out of which £100,000 went to CERT, £90,000 to the Irish Management Institute and £975,000 to AnCO.  In 1970-71 that total had risen to £1,405,000, of which £132,000 went to CERT, £120,000 to the Irish Management Institute, and £1,530,000 to AnCO.  In the current year, 1971-72, the amount has risen to £2,390,000, of which £165,000 goes to CERT, £175,000 to the Irish Management Institute and £2,050,000 to AnCO, which includes a Supplementary Estimate of £200,000 which Deputy Tully complained we had brought in rather early this year.  As Deputy Tully knows, this £200,000 is provided and mentioned in the Budget as additional for training and retraining, which indicates that it is a priority&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was it not included in the Budget figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not just as good to do it this way?  This is a recognition of the need there is in the general context of the Budget and the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far AnCO have been concentrating on training for manufacturing industry.  This is the priority, but I would hope that as soon as possible we will turn our attention to training for the requirements of the service and distribution industries.  Deputy Dr. O'Donovan said that the amount collected by levy of £3 million was very large in addition to the £3.6 million spent in my own Department.  The Deputy wants to see sizeable results from it.  He went on to say that the various training schemes would not seem to cover a very large number of people.  I would point out in relation to the £3 million which it is estimated will be collected by way of levy in the first training year for the designated industries, that only about 10 per cent will be retained by AnCO to cover administration costs, <i>et cetera</i>, and the remainder will go back with very little delay to the firms concerned in the <Col N="411" /> form of grants.  None of this £3 million will be spent on direct training at the training centres.  The direct training by AnCO is subvented by the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cott complained about the lack of courses for instructors in provincial centres.  I would like to remind him that such courses for instructors are right now being provided and that refresher courses can be put on if there is a sufficient demand.  I attach the greatest importance to these instructor and refresher courses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond advocated better training facilities for apprentices, especially in the early years of apprenticeship.  AnCO is at present operating schemes of off-the-job training for certain categories.  These are run at the AnCO training centre with releases to technical schools for courses.  If these are successful and subject to the advice of the review committee in relation to apprenticeship, it may be considered desirable to extend the schemes.  This committee is keeping the whole question of apprenticeship training under review and any proposals that may emerge from its review will be brought into operation with the co-operation of the employers and the trade unions.</P>
    <P>In regard to forthcoming legislation I would like to point out that the Hours of Work Bill and the Terms of Employment Bill have had a good deal of prior discussion and preparation and I would hope to have this legislation before the House next session.  I had at one time hoped it would be available this session, but we have already a fairly heavy programme of legislation and, while these Bills may be introduced in this session they will have to be debated in the autumn session.</P>
    <P>Deputies, particularly Deputy Cott, criticised the factory inspectorate, and I would suggest he is not sufficiently familiar with the calibre of the inspectorate. These are all graduates and persons of specialised qualifications for the highly technical jobs which factory inspections now present, particularly as a result of the technical advancement <Col N="412" /> in manufacturing industry.  The factory inspectorate is not a snatch squad that waits until some damage is done and then presecutes.  They are available also as an advisory service and I would like them to be used as such.  They are prepared to go in even at the start of a new industry or at any time to give the necessary advice to management as to what is required in the matter of lay-out, safety precautions and better conditions for workers. All good firms use the service in that way.  It is the few negligent people about whom we are concerned.  Prosecutions only take place where persons are obstinate and refuse to comply with most essential regulations that have an important bearing on the welfare, safety, health and lives of the workers.  As I said last year, I would like to see these inspectors contacted by firms who should be concerned about the safety precautions within their industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cott bluntly suggested that placement officers were not appointed impartially, that there was some ministerial favouritism or patronage shown in their appointment.  I want to refute this absolutely.  They were selected in the usual way by the Civil Service Commission and the persons whose names were submitted to me were appointed.  If I were asked to name them now I could not do so.</P>
    <P>The field of training was the one which came in for most comment, and that is as I would like it.  While references were naturally inclined to be critical&mdash;and we welcome criticism&mdash;I would say again to those people who accuse us of training people when we have not sufficient opportunities for them and, at the same time, criticise us for not creating the opportunities, that my approach always and particularly now to training and to improvement of skills in any direction is, irrespective of what opportunities there are, the training of our labour force at all levels in the community should go on apace.</P>

      <P>Training for anything. One cannot always forecast that <Col N="413" /> jobs will be available for every person trained.  We are prepared to train for where we know the best outlets to be and this depends on forecasting to some extent.  Forecasting is not always accurate.  Let our people be given the chance to have skills.  We aim to train those who are likely to be the most suitable and to provide the training that is best suited to their capabilities and their vocations.  Let us send them out with skills, capable of doing something other than being hewers of wood and drawers of water and then no matter where they may find themselves they are equipped to do a better job and to find job satisfaction.</P>

      <P>Cork is the second <Col N="414" /> largest city in Ireland and it is only natural that there should be a training centre there.  In fact, there should have been one there before now.  In addition to these training centres we are making provision for a type of training where we can move trainers to a particular area at a particular time to do a specific job, an <i>ad hoc</i> operation. Deputy Tully mentioned mining. Mining is comparatively new in this country but I am sure that if the need for skilled persons in that particular industry arose in a particular area at any time we would be in a position, as a result of this type of mobility which we are bringing into our training system, to move in persons to carry out training on the spot.  That is part of what the £200,000 is for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When one speaks of the 60,000 unemployed one cannot <Col N="415" /> say that all of these people are suitable for retraining in the skills that are available.  The place where skills are most required at present is in the construction industry and the number of these you can take and train there to be absorbed in that industry is a very small percentage.  It is not facing up to the simple facts of the situation to make that statement.  We are most anxious to have people offering themselves for training.  It is surprising how reluctant people are to submit themselves for retraining particularly when they get into the higher age groups.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully's speech related mainly to industrial relations.  To be honest I was positively disappointed by his attitude.  In the field of industrial relations there is always room for people to criticise and that is what one expects.  The most encouraging signs at present are the provisions of the national wage agreement and I hope that nobody would equivocate by what or to whom it applies.  The spirit of the agreement applies to everybody in this country and I would hope that is the way it would be approached.  The Prices and Incomes Bill which was before this House at the time was completely withdrawn when the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and myself had a number of meetings with officials of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. They pointed out the importance of permitting the system of free collective bargaining to have another opportunity. The management-labour conference had been endeavouring to bring in a formula for some time and they failed.  The position was reaching a crisis and the Government moved in at the critical time and produced the Prices and Incomes Bill.  It was when the management-labour conference ultimately came up with a reasonably acceptable formula, which was very definitely a step in the right direction particularly in so far as it contained elements to curb inflation, that we decided to completely withdraw the Prices and Incomes Bill in order that the national agreement would get an opportunity to be put into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing more than anything else which characterised the determination <Col N="416" /> of all three parties&mdash;the trade unions, the management side and the Government&mdash;was that every possible means had been used to ensure that it worked.  I would hope that nobody interested in better industrial relations would do anything to attempt to upset the terms of that agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to have misunderstood me.  I am as much in favour of the national wage agreement as he is.  It is the interpretation of those to whom it applies which, I think, will have to be carefully dealt with.  It can only apply to those who got £2 from a certain date and the Minister knows that.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully knows that provision is made in the agreement for anomalies to be dealt with.  I would not attempt to come to this House as he did and interpret the agreement.  It is plainly stated at paragraph 2:</P>
      <P>The terms of this agreement shall be effective as and when current agreements on pay and conditions of employment expire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope that no effort would be made to apply the terms of the agreement where existing agreements had not already expired.  I would like to read the script of the Deputy's speech on this again because I understood him to say the opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  For instance, the local authorities agreement terminates on 31st December next and they come under the new agreement on 1st January, 1972.  Therefore, they are not at present under the national wage agreement.  That is all I am saying. Some people are mistaken in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened most carefully.  I also listened to the Deputy condemning out of hand the attitude of certain employers.  He may have been right but I have no evidence to prove that he is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be so extravagant about CIE which the Deputy condemned out of hand in regard to industrial relations.  It must be remembered they are only one party to a dispute, that the workers are only another and that there is a third very important party, the general public who have to pay for what the other two parties do when they come together.  CIE are a semi-State body getting a large subvention from the Exchequer, subsidised heavily, and each time an adjustment takes place it is immediately reflected in the cost of fares to the public, to the people going to work in the morning.  I do not think this is an area where one can lightly dismiss the source of trouble by saying it is due to the attitude of CIE.  Any company can avoid strikes if they accede to the demands made and the greatest demands come from where the greatest economic power lies. Sometimes we are too sensitive in not speaking out.  Workers in such industries know they can leave the country crippled overnight because they are in a position to do so.  That does not give them any moral right to do so.</P>
      <P>It is not therefore sufficient to blame a management for not having a proper approach to industrial relations.  We must always remember that there are the people who have to pay extra for their electricity, for their transport and the various other cost services.  Whatever criticism we may make of CIE or other State bodies such as the ESB, I do not think anybody can claim they are the worst places to work.</P>

My reason for this is that this is a dispute which is doing phenomenal damage, yet the claim involved was processed by the Labour Court in conciliation. It is declared to be in breach of the national agreement which, as far as I am concerned, is sacrosanct.  What is likely to happen as a result is anybody's business.  There is something seriously wrong somewhere here.  It is openly admitted by both sides that it is in breach of the national agreement, yet the people of Dublin are made to walk.  At the same time, people ask if anybody is taking an interest in it.  I have been asked for an examination so that the facts may be made known.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not make it clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not allowed them to take strike action because we do not want these things if they can be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reference of the settlement of disputes and problems on which the Department of Labour should check up on as being capable of being settled, many strikes could be avoided if the full demand were acceded to at the beginning.  You have people who know that but who will persist in striking knowing that they will bring the economy to such a serious situation that their demands have to be met.  The old question of strikes, of industrial disputes, will be difficult until workers and employers are prepared to act in a responsible way.  It has been said a hundred times, <Col N="419" /> but perhaps it is no harm to repeat it now.  No matter what legislation we may bring in here, no matter how we try to create new institutions and new procedures, unless we have the right attitude and patriotic approach on both sides we cannot expect to get the results so essential to the proper development of our economy and the ultimate achievement of full employment, which we desire so keenly.</P>
      <P>I do not know how much the workers and management take into consideration the overall effect on the economy of a particular action.  I have no evidence that either takes this into consideration.  But until they do, until that responsibility becomes evident, until it is accepted, we cannot expect any real progress in this field.  The national wage agreement is the first serious step in this direction, towards the bringing about of some sense of realism, of responsibility and sanity into the whole field of industrial relations in this country.  The agreement is of paramount importance on that account.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I believe that when it expires&mdash;it comes up for review at the beginning of next year&mdash;when both sides see in retrospect the beneficial, the mutual advantage of having observed the agreement, succeeding agreements will be much easier.  All concerned will be bound to appreciate with hind-sight the effect the agreement will have on inflationary trends, on the real value of wages and incomes and they will more readily appreciate its importance, significance and success. For that reason it is most important that we carry the agreement through in the spirit as well as in the letter.  Then we will be in a position better to complete further agreements of better quality leading into the foreseeable future, thereby giving ourselves a reputation for sensible industrial relations that will have really worthwhile effects on the overall economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I used to be asked whether increasing wages and incomes had a serious impact on the development of the economy and on our movement towards full employment.  I always said that, while one could not point to a <Col N="420" /> lot of industries that had closed as a result of increased wages or incomes, nobody could estimate the number of industries that would have been here if we had a better reputation in regard to industrial relations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the main cause of this is different taxation here from that in England?  Is that not the main cause?  You cannot be competitive. There is no point in saying wages are the sole reason.  It is the difference in taxation, 58 per cent as against 48 per cent.</P>

      <P>We have more foreign investment and more outside capital coming in here than we ever had before.  The number of people prepared to set up industries here is still most encouraging.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of having proper industrial relations and having the reputation of being seen to have better industrial relations is one of the most important factors we could have with regard to the inducement of outside industries to come in here and the investment of our own capital and our own people in industry and the expansion of existing industries.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to go into the question raised by some speakers of the effect of the Free Trade Area Agreement. The Minister for Finance in his concluding speech on the Budget yesterday dealt adequately with that.  I believe we have got to take serious notice of what the future holds.  We are now embarking on a period where we could do a tremendous job if we have the proper sense of responsibility and the proper spirit of patriotism to condition ourselves for the advantages which the future must hold.  I shall not talk about the overall position of the economy or make a state of the nation speech.  However, I get annoyed, and I am sometimes amused, at people who talk about the present chill winds which are blowing in the economy throughout the world.  Are their memories so short that they cannot remember that this thing has occurred periodically time and again in our memory?  The most encouraging thing about it is that when we have these lows the peaks tend to be higher afterwards when the people clear the shelves in the recession.  When the period of recession ultimately moves away the boom which follows is invariably better than the period which came before.  I would not be the slightest discouraged by any recession that is taking place at the present time.  I think it is already showing signs of moving off, because each time we have a recession we have that inevitably followed by a period of greater activity and greater economic development than the period which came before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Government have taken the right steps to deal with the situation.  I believe we can look forward to a period of rapid economic advancement <Col N="422" /> in which all the matters that have been just discussed during this Estimate debate will have a vital role to play, not the least of which is our training programme.  I am glad all the speakers, whatever criticism they had to offer&mdash;this applied to Deputy Belton's opening speech which I dealt with in detail in his absence and Deputy Tully's&mdash;are agreed that training is essential and is a useful thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This one has some priority indeed.  I agree with the Deputy it is a top priority and that is the reason why we are considering a £200,000 Supplementary Estimate with the main Estimate.  I am glad Deputies approach to it was sound.  I can only say that any criticism of the Department is welcomed by me, so long as it is not completely below the belt.  We can expect to get a little of that as well. I have tried to deal with the different points made by the Deputies with regard to the overall working of the Department.  I have deliberately refrained from dealing with redundancy since the Redundancy Payments Bill is still before the House and I hope we will have the Report Stage shortly.</P>
      <P>Many of the speeches dealt entirely with industrial relations but I rather think the most important work of the Department is in the field of manpower, retraining, career guidance, placement, the conditions of employment and bringing in legislation, which I have just referred to, for the improvement in the conditions of workers generally.  These fundamental things must ultimately lead to better industrial relations.  I am not for a moment denying that industrial relations is one of the most serious aspects of the work in which we are indirectly involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="423" /> I want to conclude by again reiterating what I have said so often, by referring again to what the Minister should do when industrial disputes occur.  I am glad that members of the Labour Party, with one exception, agree with me that in the matter of industrial disputes we have the necessary institutions and the Minister should not get involved because he is not a part of the procedural arrangements and the institutions which we have set up to process industrial disputes.  Immediately he makes a habit of getting into industrial disputes he will be regarded as just another step above the Labour Court to which the people can appeal in order to have their grievances settled.</P>
    <P>To those people who have criticised me for being inactive and sitting back watching disputes having a serious effect on the economy I want to make that statement once again: the buck should stop at the Labour Court.  The more we can ensure that the Labour Court is regarded as the last ditch in the matter of processing disputes, and that its recommendations are accepted, the more we are ensuring that the institutions we have provided will work successfully.  It is simple to suggest that we should make some new arrangement, or have a new committee or a new institution.  People think this will be great, but we already have adequate machinery to deal with any disputes if it is given the proper recognition and if people are prepared to accept it and abide by the recommendations of these institutions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore referred to rehabilitation employment.  I hope that whether we have many opportunities or few opportunities for employment, we will always try to find as many as possible at different levels for persons who are handicapped by blindness or some other affliction.</P>

    <P>Muna bhfuil aon rud ina choinne, beartaím go bpléifear freisin an Meastachán Foirlíontach de £500,000 a bheidh ag teastáil ó mo Roinnse chun an scéim Feabhsúchán Áitiúla leathnú.  Scéim é seo de dheontaisí i leith costaisí tógála nó feabhsaithe bóithre cóiríochta agus bóithre portaigh, draenacha, agus eile, ar mhaithe le grúpaí feirmeóirí i gcoitinne.</P>
    <P>Taispeánann an tairiscint, maraon leis an Meastachán Foirlíontach, go bhfuil méadú thar £2 mhilliún, ar Vhóta na Roinne i gcóir na bliana dar críoch an 31ú Márta seo chaithte, agus na meastachain bhreise a rith an Dáil i gcaitheamh na bliana sin d'aireamh. Taobh amuigh den Meastachán Foirlíontach, is iad na deontaisí agus foirdheontaisí i gcabhair le tithíocht is mó is cúis leis an ardú i gcaiteachas na Roinne agus tá méadú tábhachtach freisin i bhfoirdheontaisí ar ghlasíocaíochtaí le haghaidh córacha uisce agus séarachais. Cruthú ar dóigh é sin&mdash;dá mbeadh a leithéid de dhith&mdash;ar an dul chun cinn atá saothraithe ag polasaithe an Rialtais maidir leis na gníomhaíochtaí tábhachta sin.</P>
    <P>Cuirfidh mé na sonraí i dtaobh na gcláranna sin ós bhur gcomhair ar ball beag agus is suntasach an scéal a léiríonn siad.  Mar shompla, i gcaitheamh na ndeich mbliana dar críoch an 31ú Márta, 1971, tógadh breis is 100,000 tithe nua agus deisíodh amuigh is istigh ar 90,000 tithe a bhí ann cheana féin.

Caithfear an deóntas talmhaíochta a thabhairt san áireamh freisin.</P>
    <P>Tugann méid airgead na n-íocóir cánach agus rátaí a chaithtear ar sheirbhísí rialtais áitiúil le fios do chách an tábhacht atá ag baint leis na seirbhísí sin i gcúrsaí geilleagair agus san eacnamaíocht náisiúnta.  Tá sé de dhualgas orainn freisin bheith cinnte go riartar na seirbhísí éagsúla go h-éifeachtúil, agus go bhfaightear cúiteamh ar an gcaiteachas.  Ón lá a cheapadh mé mar Aire Rialtais Áitiúil, bhíodh athbhreithniú á dhéanamh agam ar na príomh-réimsí caiteachais, d'fhonn bheith cinnte go bhfuil aidhmeanna agus cuspóirí dea-rialacháin áitiúil á mbaint amach.  Tuigim go maith nach féidir na cuspóirí uilig ba mhaith linn a chur i ngníomh a shroisint láithreach.  Riartar seirbhísi na n-údarás áitiúil tré chláracha fad- tréimhseacha, a dteastaíonn pleanáil agus ullmhúcháin uatha.  D'fhéadfaí a rá go bhfuil fíor-ghá le h-aistriú treise anseo agus ansiúd in ionad seirbhísí nua a thosnú nó na seirbhísí atá ann anois a thréigint.  Níl aon dul as seo, má tá rialtas áitiúil le dul chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Athraíonn riar na ndaoine, agus caithfidh seirbhísí rialtais áitiúil riar a gcúis a thabhairt dóibh.  Caithfidh sinn freisin athraithe sa teicneolaíocht a chur san áireamh, go háirithe toisc an oiread sin teicneolaíochta a bheith i gceist sna seirbhísí atá faoi chúram rialtais áitiúil.  Caithfear smaoineamh freisin ar theicníochta nua-bhainisteoireachta. <Col N="427" /> Cuirim an-bheim ar theicníocht bhainisteoireachta a fheabhsú, agus tá a fhios agam go dtuigeann na bainisteoirí agus na cumainn fhóirne an tábhacht atá ag dul le leas a bhaint as na módhanna nua-aimsire bainisteoireachta.</P>
    <P>Ina measc seo, tá boiséadadh cláreagrach, ar a bhfuil roinnt ullmhúchán tosnaithe cheana i mo Roinn-se.  Tá súil agam go gcuirfidh an córas nua seo feabhas leis an gcineál eolais atá ar fáil do bhainisteoireacht agus do bhaill, agus go mbeidh de toradh aige ná dáiliúchán níos fearr d'airgead i riarachán áitiúil.  Sé a bheidh i gceist sa chóras seo ar ball na miontuairisc ar chuspóirí agus forbairt cláracht chun iad seo a bhaint amach. Caithfear freisin cúntaisí a athriaradh chun meastachán caiteachais thar tréimhse áirithe agus costaisí níos cruinne gníomhaíochta faoi leith a theaspáint.  Ní gá dom béim a chur ar thábhacht an saghas córais seo i riaracháin áitiúil, lenar bhain caiteachas a bhí níos mó ná £150 milliúin sa bhlian 1970-71, agus fostaíocht do bhreis is 52,500 daoine ar sholáthar oibreacha agus seirbhísí (agus seirbhísí sláintíochta san aireamh).  De bhárr seo, tá an seirbhís áitiúil ar cheann des na fostóirí agus caiteoirí airgid is mó sa tir.</P>
    <P>I mí Feabhra fhoilsíodh Páipéar Bán maidir le hatheagrú rialtais áitiúil.  Léirítear sa Pháipéar tairiscintí an Rialtais chun an chóras rialtais áitiúil a atheagrú agus tugtar le fios ann na modhanna atá beartaithe chun an chóras a athrú agus a fheabhsú. Foilsíodh an Páipéar chun caoi a thabhairt don phobal i gcoitinne, agus go háirithe dóibh siúd a bhfuil baint díreach acu le rialtas áitiúil, na tairiscintí seo a scrúdú agus a phlé.  Tugtar cuireadh sa Pháipéar do gach éinne a bhfuil suim aige sa cheist a thuairimí faoi na tairiscintí a nochtadh.  Breithneófar go cúramach aon tuairimí a sholáthrófar agus cuirfear san áireamh iad sara ndéanfar aon bhreith chinnte.</P>
    <P>Tá athraithe móra tagaithe ar an saol uile le blianta beaga anuas.  Tá athrú mór freisin tagaithe ar dhualgaisí na n-údarás áitiúla agus tá na seirbhísí <Col N="428" /> a chuireann siad ar fáil níos tábhachtaí ná mar bhí riamh cheana.  Tuigim go maith go bhfuil meas mór ag morán daoine ar an gcóras rialtais áitiúil atá againn faoi láthair.  Ní ceart go mbeimís bogásach asainn féin, áfach, ag féachaint ar na hathraithe móra atá tagaithe ar an saol ó bunaíodh an córas sin i rith na naoú aoise déag.

    <P>I feel it is appropriate that in moving these Estimates I should briefly review the Government's achievements in relation to housing. These achievements merit mention.  In replying on the 24th March to the debate on a Supplementary Estimate for my Department, I reviewed briefly the achievements in housing of recent <Col N="429" /> years.  I mentioned that during the ten years to 31st March, 1970, we had built 98,000 houses and had reconstructed a further 93,000 with the aid of grants, at a total cost of £469 million, including £92 million spent in subsidies from central and local taxation. The 191,000 houses built or reconstructed represent more than a quarter of all the houses now in the country. In 1970-71 we spent approximately £72 million on providing and reconstructing houses and a further £14.8 million, approximately, in subsidies from taxation.</P>
    <P>At present, we are building at the rate of five houses for every two built in the opening years of the decade. Approximately 13,700 new dwellings were built in 1970-71 despite the serious setback caused by the long cement strike.  About 41,000 houses were built in the last three years&mdash;a greater number in such a period than ever before in our history as a State.</P>
    <P>The review of housing needs contained in the White Paper, <i>Housing in the Seventies</i>, showed that, mainly on account of demographic changes, a continuation of the upward trend in output will be essential in coming years.  The level of need projected in the paper for the mid-1970s is 15,000 to 17,000 houses a year, but the paper made it clear that the projections would not be regarded as limiting the level of building and that, in so far as the economy could afford it, any higher level of output found necessary would be sought.</P>
    <P>The pattern of increasing building output is reflected in increasing expenditure.  Of the £377 million spent from all sources on house-building and reconstruction during the 1960s, private sources provided £184 million and £193 million was provided through the public capital programme.  The total expenditure on providing and reconstructing houses is now running at an annual rate almost four times that a decade ago.  Expenditure on subsidies is more than twice the corresponding level for the early 1960s.</P>
    <P>While the growth in housing output has been most striking in the private sector&mdash;reflecting the increased prosperity <Col N="430" /> which enables more people to provide their own houses&mdash;building by local authorities has also been maintained at a satisfactory level.  During the year which ended on 31st March, 1971, local authorities completed 3,875 houses as compared with 4,706 in 1969-70.  The cement strike severely retarded progress last year, only 2,451 dwellings having been completed by the 31st January, 1971. The momentum of production is, however, well on the way to full recovery and the total number of dwellings in progress, in tender and at various stages of planning at 31st March, 1971, was 27,304, as compared with 26,433 at the end of March, 1970.</P>
    <P>The cost of building is, undoubtedly, the major factor inhibiting an expansion of the local authority housing programme.  Over a period of less than three years the cost of constructing an average local authority house increased by nearly 30 per cent.  This escalation of costs has got to be halted; otherwise output can never hope to overtake needs.  The House will be aware from statements which I have made in recent months that measures have been taken to offset the rise in building costs as far as practicable and to secure maximum feasible economies in construction.  The cutting of standards of accommodation, amenity and construction is a negative way of cost saving and is ultimately self-defeating. For many years, because of the rapid rise in building costs, our housing standards have not been getting the steady degree of improvement which we would have liked.  All that could be done to reduce costs without jettisoning acceptable standards has largely been done and local authorities have co-operated in securing economies which, although individually slight, cumulatively have been quite significant, amounting to as much as £200 a house in some cases. These economies, however, have proved relatively ineffective against the pace of increase in costs.</P>
    <P>The national economy cannot support an increase in capital costs for local authority houses which is completely out of line with the growth rate of the economy.  This is the basis on <Col N="431" /> which I have had to demand cuts in unit housing costs to give more dwellings for the amount of money which can be provided.  Cost savings can be achieved, for example, by increasing efficiency in building methods, by reasonable increases in the densities of housing schemes, by finding new and cheaper methods and materials of construction. I intend to deal more fully with the matter later in this statement.</P>
    <P>The view was expressed in the White Papers on Housing, published in 1964 and 1969, that the introduction into the local authority housing programme of a guaranteed annual demand, leading to relatively long-term contracts, would bring about substantial cost economies through more efficient organisation, management and production. Bearing this in mind, I decided some months ago to develop a special project for low-cost housing which would evaluate in practical terms what could be done in this direction.</P>
    <P>Last August, by public advertisement, I invited manufacturers and contractors to submit to me proposals for dwellings which would offer significant economies in cost on the basis of guaranteed orders over a period of years.  The invitation was advertised extensively in the national papers and in the leading Irish and British trade journals.  My idea in advertising was to give contractors and manufacturers the opportunity to propose the type of house&mdash;and possibly a model lay-out &mdash;which they could provide most economically.  An outline performance specification was prepared for the project to ensure that proposals would at least measure up to minimum standards.  I made it clear that I was prepared to consider proposals for dwellings either of traditional construction or prefabricated and for dwellings produced by rationalised traditional construction.  In order to encourage a wider knowledge and use of modular co-ordination it was stipulated that designs should preferably be based on the 100mm. module.</P>
    <P>Interested firms were asked to quote on the basis of guaranteed orders of <Col N="432" /> 100 dwellings, or multiples of 100 dwellings, each year over a period of three to five years, either to the proposer's own design or to the supplied outline plans.  As a result of the advertisement I received about 90 proposals, including 25 from Great Britain and four from Northern Ireland.  After preliminary examination, it was clear that about 50 of these proposals could be regarded as firm offers.  These embraced a wide variety of housing methods, ranging from traditional forms of construction to complete prefabrication. After a full appraisal, a preliminary short-list has been prepared of the proposals offering the best prospect of cost economies.  Additions will be made to this list from time to time according as other viable proposals are agreed with further firms.  The short-list to date comprises five firms who are prepared to work on a national basis but who require relatively large-scale schemes, seven firms who are willing to take on smaller schemes on a national, regional or local basis, and eight other firms whose operations are suited to providing dwellings in rural areas&mdash;either singly or in small groups.</P>
    <P>Nine out of the 12 of the largest firms short-listed so far are proposing to use traditional or semi-traditional forms of construction.  At present, therefore, it appears that all but a small amount of building immediately envisaged under the programme will be carried out by these methods.  When the preliminaries have been completed, the initiative for progress with the low-cost project will be governed by the degree of co-operation forthcoming from local housing authorities.  The authorities were informed at an early stage through their city and county managers about the project and their co-operation was requested.  If we are to get real benefit from the enterprise their fullest co-operation will, of course, be essential.  I am confident that they will come forward with a sufficient aggregate demand to ensure the success of the project over the next three or four years.</P>
    <P>I have also had consultations with representatives of the Irish Congress <Col N="433" /> of Trade Unions and I am confident of their help and co-operation in this project.  The services of the National Building Agency will be available to co-ordinate the demand in various areas and enter into general contracts with the selected firms on behalf of local authorities which so desire.  As I am anxious to get houses built under the low-cost project as soon as possible, I have already made special arrangements, with the ready co-operation of the housing authorities, to get pilot schemes under way in the coming months, in Counties Clare, and Dublin, and in Galway and Dublin cities, using some of the firms whose proposals particularly suited the available sites.</P>
    <P>While the project should secure significant cost savings, it is evident that, in itself, it cannot provide the complete solution to the problem of high costs of building.  In inviting building interests to put before me proposals for low-cost housing I had hoped that some radical new ideas might be forthcoming.  As I mentioned, one of my aims in launching the project was to encourage proposals for buildings with a probable life span shorter than that accepted for traditional housing, provided that proportionate savings in costs could be anticipated.  The response in this respect has been disappointing, possibly because a reduction in the probable life span of building seems, in the eyes of builders, to imply an undue lowering of standards and increased difficulties, first in obtaining a satisfactory finish to houses and subsequently in remedying any defects arising.  I still remain open to consider any proposals in this general context which offer prospects of satisfactory dwelling units at a fair level of cost.</P>
    <P>During the next 12 months we will come to the end of the first statutory period under the Housing Act, 1966, for the measurement of housing needs and the preparation of building programmes.  While a systematic measurement of housing needs and the preparation of building programmes by housing authorities is necessary, the fact is that the ultimate controlling factor in regard to the size of the housing <Col N="434" /> programme must be the amount of capital resources which can be made available and the value for money we can obtain in terms of dwelling units for this investment.  The question of allocating capital on an estimated basis over a period of years to maintain an effective programme is being examined as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>There have been important developments in the past year or so in regard to the provision of housing as a support to industry.  Arrangements for housing industrial workers have been discussed by my Department, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Industrial Development Authority and the National Building Agency.  The subsidy from my Department, made available under the Housing Act, 1970, for the provision of housing for key workers coming into an area for new or expanding industry has provided the basis for arrangements which, I hope, will become an effective service to industry.</P>
    <P>These new arrangements visualise that housing needs for new or expanding industry in an area should be assessed by the Industrial Development Authority in close consultation with the local housing authority.  When estimates of these needs have been agreed, my Department takes the initiative in co-ordinating the activities of the various bodies concerned to enable the National Building Agency, out of the special capital funds allocated to it for industrial housing, to build the houses which are needed.  Where houses must be provided for renting they will be taken over, maintained, and administered by the housing authority who will get the appropriate major subsidy on houses let to workers necessarily brought into an area for new or expanding industry.</P>
    <P>In other cases, where the new subsidy provisions would not apply, the principle is accepted that the Industrial Development Authority will recoup the local housing authority for any losses which may arise through letting houses to industrial employees nominated by the authority.  The new arrangements will rationalise the provision of housing for industry, enable forward provision of housing to be made where <Col N="435" /> necessary, and ensure that the primary position of the local housing authority is maintained.  Arrangements for schemes are already proceeding on this basis in Droichead Nua, Dundalk, Killarney, Sligo and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Another commendable development in relation to the housing activities of local authorities should help to ease the conditions in which many of our elderly citizens must spend their declining years.  In February, 1970, the report of an Inter-departmental Committee on the Care of the Aged was published. This project has an important bearing on policy about the housing of elderly persons.  The committee came out in favour of keeping old persons in their home environment as long as possible, providing them where necessary with separate housing units which would be supported by community services, and avoiding, except as a last resort, having them put into institutions.</P>
    <P>The committee favoured a sheltered form of housing as the best solution, where this was feasible.  Sheltered housing, which is a regular feature in many other countries, provides each elderly person or couple with a small dwelling of their own, having a separate hall door and all the usual facilities, while at the same time making available community facilities, such as a communal lounge, kitchen, launderette and so on, which the old people could use when they so wish.  With the co-operation of Limerick Corporation, who have provided a suitable site, a pilot scheme of sheltered housing is being developed by the National Building Agency under the general guidance of my Department and with the help and co-operation of the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>An essential feature in this project &mdash;and, indeed, in all aspects dealing with the housing of the elderly&mdash;is the co-operation of voluntary bodies.  The efforts of public authorities cannot hope for complete success without the aid of voluntary bodies in dealing with social problems such as the care of the aged.  I shall return briefly to this topic in the context of private enterprise housing.</P>
    <P>Two out of every three new houses <Col N="436" /> are now being built for persons purchasing their own accommodation&mdash; generally with the aid of grants and, in many cases, with loans&mdash;from public funds.</P>
    <P>The total of 8,129 houses completed in 1969-70 with the aid of grants from my Department was a remarkable achievement, but this record number was again substantially surpassed last year when 8,771 grants were paid on new houses.</P>
    <P>In 1970-71 also, grants were allocated for 14,602 new private houses&mdash; a greater number than ever before in any one year and more than 50 per cent higher than the number of grants actually paid in 1969-70.  This shows that the recasting of the grants system forecast in the White Paper, <i>Housing in the Seventies</i>, and implemented in the Housing Act, 1970, is paying off. Private builders will increasingly concentrate on medium sized houses, which the new system encourages, and the capital available for housing will thus produce a greater unit output of houses of a type for which the greater demand now exists.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will recall, higher grants are payable under the new system for medium-sized houses but grants are not payable for houses commenced on or after 1st January, 1971, which have a floor area exceeding 116 square metres, 1,249 square feet approximately.  The new system should help to counteract the effect of high land prices which often force builders to build to a luxury standard simply to cover their costs&mdash;despite the extremely strong demand for housing of a modest standard.</P>
    <P>From the 1st January last also, all measurements in relation to grant housing will be expressed in metric terms. This is in line with the Government's intention to support the introduction of metrication in the building industry.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the steps which I have been taking to see that the resources of the system building and component prefabrication sectors of the construction industry are availed of to speed up and achieve savings in the local authority housing programme.  On the private housing side, prefabricated <Col N="437" /> and system-built houses have been accepted as a normal part of the operations. Proposals for building by these methods are regularly submitted to my Department for clearance under the grant code.  To facilitate prospective purchasers the Department have prepared a leaflet listing the house types which have been approved.</P>
    <P>I am rather disappointed that the enhanced rates of grants for high-rise flats have not provided a stimulus to the provision of flats in towns.  Completions have been averaging only about 80 flats a year.  While I appreciate that most Irish people prefer to live in individual houses at street level and to have a garden of their own, I feel that some people would be happy to occupy a modern flat in a purpose-built building, especially if it is built in an area convenient to their place of work.</P>
    <P>In addition to the element of personal choice, the planning consideration is relevant that flat developments with proper landscaping of the surrounding space, could be an attractive feature in our towns, giving life to city centres which are tending more and more to exclusively commercial day-time use.  I should like developers to think further about this form of housing development.  The special grants which are available for the work, in conjunction with the value of the nine-year rate remissions, should help to make the provision of flats a good economic proposition.</P>
    <P>The increased level of new house grants payable to farmers and certain other specially deserving categories continues to play a significant part in the new house sector.  More than 9 per cent of the new houses built in 1970-71 qualified for these increased grants.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the particular needs of the aged.  This is a branch of housing activities in which a commendable headline has been set by charitable individuals and bodies. Good progress is being made with the provision of accommodation for elderly persons by religious and philanthropic bodies assisted by grants under the Housing Acts.  Since the scheme of grants to encourage this work was introduced in 1962, grants have been <Col N="438" /> allocated for 962 units, of which 530 have so far been completed.  My Department will be glad to give every assistance and encouragement to those proposing to provide this form of accommodation and, in the light of the recommendations of the Inter-departmental Committee on the Care of the Aged, is preparing a booklet for the guidance of persons interested in such projects.  I would welcome the co-operation of all Deputies in publicising these grants.</P>
    <P>On the more general front, the scheme of grants administered by my Department for the reconstruction of existing dwellings continues to play an important role in preserving the national stock of houses.  Grant allocations in 1970-71 were slightly lower than those for the preceding year, nevertheless, a total of 7,808 dwellings were reconstructed last year with the aid of the grants as against 7,697 in 1969-70.</P>
    <P>Activity appears to be waning in the case of the grants for essential repairs to unfit dwellings in rural areas.  The gradual decline in operations over the past two years suggests that the most pressing elements of the problem for which this scheme of grants was designed have been dealt with.  Since the scheme was initiated in 1962, a total of 5,408 essential repairs grants have been paid.</P>
    <P>Having taken stock briefly of the general trends in local authority and private housing.  I should now like to speak on some basic aspects of our policies relating to these branches of housing activity.  One of the fundamental aims of my overall strategy for housing is to ensure that as much money as possible is available to build houses.</P>
    <P>This means, for instance, that we cannot spend on subsidies for local authority houses money which we should be using for new construction. Persons living in houses of reasonable quality may have their grievances, but these can be nothing like as genuine and pressing as the grievances of families in slum conditions.  I do not think there is a Deputy in the House who would, if he considered the matter, <Col N="439" /> disagree with my policy of concentrating resources to the utmost on the building of houses to meet the often desperate needs of these persons.  This policy involves both subsidies and rents.</P>
    <P>The amount provided in my Department's Estimate for 1971-72 for subsidising the rent of local authority houses is £5.192 million&mdash;an increase of £929,000 over last year.  Subsidy on loan charges for other forms of State assistance given in the past is costing a further £400,000 approximately.  The amount being contributed as subsidy from rates will add at least another £5 million.  The £10.6 million thus being provided in the current year to keep the rents of local authority houses low would finance the building of 3,000 extra houses, if we could use it for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I know that subsidies are essential to bring the cost of housing accommodation down to a level that the poorer tenants can afford; and I certainly have no objection to them in principle. What I must insist, however, is that these financial aids from public funds should go to help people who genuinely need them, and that they do not unjustifiably absorb money which could be used for house building.  For that reason, therefore, the pressures which develop for increases in the levels of subsidy must be critically appraised and the justification for further relief at the expense of the tax-payers must be clearly established before new concessions are made.</P>
    <P>However, I am glad to say that it was recently found practicable to increase the subsidy on all housing work commenced after 31st December, 1970, or for which loans were sanctioned after that date and for which rent proposals were approved on or after 1st February, 1971.  The subsidisable limit for an unserviced house was increased from £1,200 to £1,300.  In the case of serviced houses, the previous limit of £1,850 was increased to £2,200 in respect of each dwelling provided either in an urban area or in a group of ten or more elsewhere, and to £2,000 for other serviced houses.  For a flat in a building of five storeys or less the former limit of <Col N="440" /> £2,650 was increased to £3,000; and for a flat in a building of more than five storeys the limit of £3,100 was increased to £3,200.</P>
    <P>The State subsidy generally amounts now to about £2.71 a week for a serviced house, £3.94 a week for a flat in a block of six or more storeys and £3.69 a week for other flats.  Local authorities provided about the same amounts from rates.  On an annual programme of nearly 5,000 dwellings, subsidies will increase every year by over £1.1 million.  Thus, in five more years, on the basis of the programme proposed in the 1969 White Paper, State and local authority subsidies at their current levels could have increased from £10.6 million to over £16 million a year&mdash;or nearly as much as we spent on building local authority houses last year.  It is this prospect and the effect it must inevitably have on our ability to build houses, that concerns me and must concern every Deputy with an interest in getting our people properly housed.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that I am fully committed to the idea that rents should be low for people with small incomes.  I am satisfied that rents which vary with income are the only means through which we can achieve this while leaving ourselves with sufficient money to continue to expand our building programme.  All new local authority houses are now let on this renting basis.  The scales which are being approved provide for rents ranging from a nominal figure for persons with low incomes up to an amount sufficient to meet the cost of providing and maintaining the house.  If a tenant's income is low, the amount of subsidy for his house is high&mdash;often as much as £200 to £300 a year.  If his income rises, the subsidy falls, but he will not be required in any event to pay more than his house is worth and he will generally have the option of buying his house if he so wishes.</P>
    <P>In the ten years to 31st March, 1970, local authorities sold over 45,000 of their houses to the tenants.  In the same period they built about 29,000 new dwellings.  At the end of the decade, therefore, they had fewer <Col N="441" /> houses in their possession than they had at the beginning.  Sales are continuing at a high rate&mdash;for example, in 1969-70 approximately 4,700 houses were sold.</P>
    <P>Policy on sales, like all other aspects of housing policy, must conform to the basic objective of providing decent housing for persons who have not got it, at a price or rent they can afford. If local authorities sell too many houses they weaken their ability to do this.  For example, it is estimated that out of their stock of approximately 105,000 rented houses, local authorities get back through surrenders of tenancies something over 1,000 houses a year for re-allocation to new tenants.  If the authorities sold all&mdash;or even a substantial proportion&mdash;of their housing estates they would no longer have the control of these houses; and it would cost them an extra £3 to £4 million a year to provide a corresponding number of new dwellings.  For this reason, if we are to achieve our primary objective in housing, we must ensure that sales do not unduly diminish the local authorities' ability to meet basic needs.  Because of this we require local authorities to use part of the proceeds of sales to build, or help build, new houses.  This principle fits in also with my general policy of increasing the flow of capital for housing.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it is desirable that local authority tenants should have the opportunity to buy their houses.  In this way tenants can stabilise their outgoings on the houses and build up a valuable asset for themselves and their children.  I have, therefore, encouraged local authorities to make sales schemes under the Housing Act, 1966.  The terms of sale under these schemes provide for a discount from the current market or replacement value of houses in built-up areas of up to 2 per cent for each year, after five, during which the tenant has been in continuous occupation, subject to a maximum discount of 30 per cent.  For houses outside built-up areas the figures are 3 per cent and 45 per cent respectively.  At the end of 1970-71, over 50,000 houses were covered by these sale schemes&mdash;or almost half the <Col N="442" /> remaining stock of rented local authority houses&mdash;and about 10,000 tenants had purchased or were purchasing their houses under the schemes.</P>
    <P>Building societies are the biggest private source of capital for housing. Their resources grew spectacularly in the early 1960s, up to about 1964. Economic difficulties in 1965-66 caused some cutback in the scale of their activities in that and the following financal year, but 1967-68 saw a return to their growth rate of earlier years and in 1969-70 they were able to advance £11,365,000 for house purchase. Advances in 1970-71 were even higher&mdash;at a record level in the region of £16 million.</P>
    <P>The trends in the societies' lending over the years make it clear that the amount which they are able to provide for housing in any year is determined by the rate at which the public invest with them.  For this reason, the 1969 White Paper indicated that if the societies were to be able to attract savings, they must be given the same freedom of action as the other bodies which compete with them for funds.  In the past two years there has been a steep increase in the rate of receipt of investment moneys by the societies.  Admittedly, the flow of funds to the societies last year was distorted by the effects of the bank dispute.  The growth in funds has been reflected in an increase in lending, with the result that the value of the unpaid loans which the societies have on hands rose from just over £5.8 million at the end of March, 1969, to £17.3 million at the end of December, 1970.  The number of new house loans which the societies were able to approve in the year ended 31st March, 1971, was about double the number of loans approved in the previous year. These trends will be welcomed by everyone who is anxious to see the housing drive pushed ahead as fast as possible.</P>
    <P>Assurance companies also play an important role in housing finance.  In 1970-71, for example, they advanced a total of £6.7 million in house purchase loans.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce made an agreement last <Col N="443" /> year with foreign assurance companies operating in this country under which the minimum level of their investments in Ireland of the funds appropriate to their Irish business will be raised by 1977 from the present level of 66? per cent to 80 per cent.  My Department have participated in discussions with the companies on the general question of investment by them in housing.</P>
    <P>In addition to building societies and assurance companies, I am also looking into the feasibility of other means of attracting greater private investment in housing.  For example, discussions have taken place between officers of my Department and of the Credit Union League of Ireland about the possibility of channelling into housing some of the funds which the credit union movement have at their disposal.  I feel sure that there is a fruitful field here for co-operation between the credit unions and housing co-operative groups which are showing signs of becoming a more potent force in housing.</P>
    <P>Local authorities provide funds on a large scale for private housing. Advances by the authorities in loans for house purchase rose from £4.8 million in 1967-68 to about £8 million in 1970-71&mdash;an increase of approximately £3.2 million in only three years.  Practically all of the loans advanced last year were in respect of new houses.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of the local authorities' scheme is to help persons of modest means to build or buy their own new homes.  Improvements have been made with effect as from 1st March, 1971, in the conditions subject to which the loans are made.  The annual income and, in the case of farmers, rateable valuation limits have been increased from £1,200 to £1,500 per annum and from £50 to £60 respectively for loans which are financed directly from the Local Loans Fund.  No income limit will apply where the applicant, being the tenant of a local authority dwelling, surrenders his tenancy on getting a loan.</P>
    <P>It is open to housing authorities in areas where commercial lending agencies such as building societies do not operate extensively, within their capital <Col N="444" /> allocations, to borrow money from sources other than the Local Loans Fund or to use capital derived from their internal resources to make loans to persons outside these limits.</P>
    <P>The maximum loan limit has been also increased from £2,700 to £3,000, except in the County Boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, the Boroughs of Dún Laoghaire and Galway and Dublin County, where the limit has been increased from £3,000 to £3,300.</P>
    <P>The arrangements made by the local authorities in the Dublin area for the construction of houses on a package-deal basis are helping to meet urgent housing needs.  Under these arrangements, the local authorities have contracted for the building of houses for sale to their existing tenants, to persons on their approved waiting lists and to other persons of modest means.  Capital for the houses is being provided largely by loans from building societies and assurance companies as well as from the local authorities themselves.  The loans from the commercial agencies are being made under a special agreement whereby the local authorities, with my consent, guarantee the lenders against loss.  The very significant contribution&mdash;over £1.5 million last year &mdash;which building societies and assurance companies are making in this matter is worthy of praise.  I would welcome an extension of these arrangements.</P>
    <P>Local authorities help persons of modest means to provide new houses by paying supplementary grants.  They also operate schemes of supplementary grants for the reconstruction of existing houses and their improvement by the installation of water and sewerage facilities.  Capital expenditure on these grants for new houses and reconstruction works amounted to £2.4 million in the financial year 1970-71.</P>
    <P>Many small urban authorities, because of their limited resources, did not operate supplementary grant schemes for new houses.  In order to get supplementary grants, many people built in the county health area on the fringes of towns, thus giving rise to costly extensions of water, sewerage and other public services.  For this <Col N="445" /> reason, the Housing Act, 1970, enables county councils to pay supplementary grants in the smaller urban districts.</P>
    <P>The 1970 Act increased also from £1,045 to £1,250 a year, the income limit of applicants for supplementary grants in respect of houses commenced on or after 1st August, 1970.  In addition, allowances of £100 a year for each dependant of an applicant may be made, up to a total of £400 in any case, thus bringing the maximum income limit for eligibility to £1,650 a year.  I should like to see local authorities operating supplementary grants schemes to the full extent now permitted by the Housing Acts.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted the appointment by me of a committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Kenny, to inquire into the problem of the cost of land for building.  This problem was under examination in my Department for some time but it was not found possible to devise a practical, workable solution.  The Government have been acutely conscious of the problem and wish to pursue the search for a solution, treating the matter as an issue of urgent public importance.  While I am aware of the difficulties involved, I hope that the committee, under their eminent chairman, may be able to find a solution within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I think it is right to point out that in the past ten years the price of second-hand houses sold on the open market increased by some-what more than the price of new houses.  This seems to indicate that the problem of rising prices is basically a problem of supply and demand.  The most effective way of getting prices down or stabilised is by building more houses.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to make any further statements at this stage on land prices except to refer to the arrangement whereby a special extra capital allocation of £3 million, spread over a three-year period, was made available from the Local Loans Fund to Dublin Corporation to acquire land for housing. Under this programme the corporation were able to buy more than 2,000 acres of serviced and unserviced land at an average price of about £1,500 an acre. <Col N="446" /> The first fruits of this exercise are already evident.  The corporation recently leased 115 acres of this developed land to private builders and will make more land available from time to time as it becomes serviced. They decided also to allocate 735 serviced sites, comprising about 150 acres, to smaller builders and to co-operative housing groups.</P>
    <P>The corporation have stated publicly that they will maintain a continuing supply of land for builders and that there is no reason, therefore, for panic buying at inflated prices.  On this point, it is clear that one of the factors that has pushed up land prices in the Dublin area in recent years has been competition among builders for the building land available.  The fact that builders without land can now apply to the corporation rather than compete in the open market should, in itself, take a lot of heat out of the demand and encourage a greater degree of price stability.</P>
    <P>A factor which contributes to rising house prices is that the demand for most private housing is not effectively organised.  People buying houses for themselves do not have the advantage of bulk ordering or of competitive tendering. The steps which have been taken to provide tenant-purchase houses by local authorities, co-operative groups and the National Building Agency, have helped to highlight the benefits of competitive tendering.  If the present strong demand for private housing should continue it is only prudent that we should plan for the provision of a bigger share of private housing output by these ways in the future.  In this connection, I have asked local authorities to help co-operative groups interested in the provision of houses.  In this, I do not propose that co-operative groups should get special financial assistance over and above the aids available to the ordinary individual. These aids and concessions are already very substantial&mdash;equivalent in most cases to more than £1,000 a house&mdash;and, given the need to maintain a proper balance between the use of resources for building and for subsidies, I am satisfied that a genuine case could not be made for increasing the assistance for co-operative groups, <Col N="447" /> alone.  Their activities must benefit primarily from better organisation. Given the right guidance and a sympathetic attitude by local authorities, these benefits can certainly be achieved. My Department will be glad to give help and advice to co-operative groups.</P>
    <P>Another factor which is definitely contributing to rising house prices is the apparent limitation of the capacity of the building industry.  There has been reason for some time now to believe that the industry may be working virtually at capacity.  Measures have been taken to raise efficiency and to increase output, but the question of capacity is one that will have to get a lot more attention in coming years if we are to achieve the necessary rate of growth in new house building.</P>
    <P>The output of the building industry in the current financial year will certainly exceed £200 million.  Efficiency in the industry is, obviously, of national importance and can bring dividends, not only to public authorities who provide much of the capital, but also to the community in general by way of lower prices for houses, schools, factories etc.  Steps are, therefore, being taken to encourage greater efficiency in building.  These steps include the conversion of the industry to the metric system, measures to secure more co-ordination and rationalisation of building components, the introduction of new building regulations and the technical assistance grants scheme.</P>
    <P>Initiative for the change to metric came from the building industry itself. An advisory committee, established by An Foras Forbartha, recommended a phased programme for the change to metric and this programme was accepted by the Government.  Progress towards the change has been going ahead steadily.  Already a number of suppliers of various building materials have changed their products to metric sizes.  Returns in my Department indicated that at 31st March, 1971, the value of work being designed in metric was not less than £36 million in the public sector, plus a further £35 million, approximately, in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The standardisation of the dimensions <Col N="448" /> of individual components used in building can also make a major contribution by facilitating production in large numbers.  This implies that there should be one basic module by reference to which the size of components would be settled.  The Government have already announced that the basic module to be used in work on modular co-ordination in this country should be 100 millimetres.  Work is proceeding in An Foras Forbartha, in conjunction with my Department, on the steps necessary for the detailed implementations of a modular programme.</P>
    <P>An Foras is also working on the rationalisation of the design of individual components.  This should help to increase efficiency and stabilise costs. It is essential, if maximum efficiency is to be obtained, that workers generally should keep themselves abreast of the latest techniques and developments and that the firms should be well organised.  These are the primary aims of the scheme of technical assistance grants operated by the Department. Managerial, supervisory or technical personnel engaged in the building industry, as well as certain trade union officials and representatives, are paid a portion of the cost of attending training courses and of making study visits abroad.  Grants are also paid for the engagement of consultants by builders and contractors to advise on matters directed to the improvement of their efficiency.</P>
    <P>An Foras has, with the assistance of these grants and in co-operation with the Construction Industry Federation, established a programme of construction management courses at various centres throughout the country. The extent to which these courses are being availed of by builders is, indeed, impressive and the higher level of efficiency which should result will affect costs in the industry in the long-term.</P>
    <P>I intend to introduce a new national code of building regulations which will supersede all building controls under bye-laws made by local authorities. Such bye-laws do not operate in all local authority areas.  Where they apply, they impose different standards in different areas.  They are based <Col N="449" /> largely on concepts and materials of the last century and impede innovations which could lower building costs.  A working party of An Foras Forbartha has drafted the technical specifications for the new regulations and these are now under revision in my Department.  Public comment on the revised draft will be considered before the regulations are made.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Housing Act, 1969, which came into operation in July, 1969, is to secure more effective control over the demolition or change of use of habitable houses.  While it may be necessary in carrying out industrial or commercial development to demolish some fit houses or to apply them to non-residential uses, it is desirable that the demolition or change of use be subject to a measure of control, with proper regard to the rights of persons who own houses and the need for change in the urban structure. This change is necessary on occasions so that the centre of a city may live rather than die, as has happened elsewhere, with development taking place at the ever more remote urban periphery.  The Act is a temporary measure, introduced to meet a particular situation and will fall to be reviewed before 31st December, 1972. All aspects of the working of the Act will be considered in the course of that review.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the direct influence on housing costs which the ready availability of adequate reserves of serviced land must have.  Services are no less vital for industrial and commercial development and for the preservation of amenities.  The Government are conscious of the importance of water and sewerage services in the national context and have been providing steadily increasing capital allocations and subsidies to encourage a planned expansion of the programmes.</P>
    <P>For example, a sum of £1.719 million is being provided this year in Subhead F.1 of the Vote in respect of State contributions to loan charges incurred by local authorities on sanitary services works.  This is £326,335 more than the amount paid to sanitary authorities in 1970-71 and directly <Col N="450" /> reflects the rising level of capital expenditure and activity in this sector.</P>
    <P>Subhead F.2 includes a sum of £210,000 to recoup county councils the expenditure incurred by them in the payment of supplementary grants for water supply installations to farmers who would have been eligible for the scheme of domestic grants formerly operated by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>The capital allocation for sanitary and miscellaneous services in the current year is £6.65 million&mdash;an increase of £900,000 over the amount provided in the Capital Budget for 1970-71.  This will enable a satisfactory level of activity to be maintained with the programme. The main emphasis must remain on the provision of works needed for new industry or new housing or which are required to improve existing water supplies or sewerage services which have become inadequate for current needs.  Approximately £16 million worth of such schemes have been released for commencement since 1st April, 1968.  A good deal of this work has already been completed and the rest generally is in progress.  It has been estimated that at 1st April, 1971, the work yet to be completed on all approved sanitary services schemes represents a pool of work in progress or released for commencement of approximately £11 million in value.</P>
    <P>While most of the major water supply schemes recently completed or now in construction are needed primarily to provide adequate supplies for built-up areas, many of them involve the laying of sections of trunk mains through rural areas.  These mains can provide considerable scope for the development of the group water supply movement in the areas adjoining their routes and I would be glad to see local authorities doing everything possible to encourage this movement.  In a number of areas, where the absence of good local water resources was holding up group schemes, I have approved of projects under which the local authorities provide the necessary head works and trunk mains, reservoirs etc to ensure that groups will have a reliable source from which to develop.</P>
    <P>I regard the group water scheme as <Col N="451" /> one of the most valuable forms of communal activity.  It has generated a spirit of co-operation at local level and a sense of enterprise and independence which I would like to see spilling over into co-operative housing.  Above all, it has brought the benefits of piped water into thousands of rural homes years earlier than would have been practicable if the task remained entirely with local sanitary authorities.  I am particularly pleased, therefore, that operations in connection with the grants for the installation of private water supplies and sewerage facilities are continuing to expand.  Projects completed and for which grants were paid during 1970-71 totalled 11,046, against 9,088 in the preceding year.  Grant allocations in 1970-71 numbered 13,595 as compared with 12,133 in 1969-70.  The proportion of this activity which is represented by group water supply schemes is growing steadily.  In 1970-71, a record number of 3,768 grants were paid for houses included in group schemes.</P>
    <P>At the 31st March last, 582 schemes, catering for 6,644 houses, were completed and there were 1,756 proposals then at other stages.  Output on group schemes increased by about 300 per cent over the past four years.  This is a first-class achievement by any standard, but I fully realise that a great deal still remains to be done.  In particular, more engineers are required for this work and my Department is trying to improve its technical resources in this regard.  In the meantime, we are doing our best with limited resources.</P>
    <P>It would be ungracious of me to pass from this subject without paying tribute to the trojan work being done in the interest of the local communities by the promoters of these schemes.  But for their perseverance and self-sacrifice many schemes would never progress.</P>
    <P>The solid amount of work done so far and the current volume of works being carried out must effectively counter any suggestion that the Department is holding back schemes or is failing to make money available to finance them.</P>
    <P>I should now like to speak about the steps I am taking to deal with the problem <Col N="452" /> of controlling water and air pollution. A significant development in this respect was the recent establishment of a working group representative of all Government Departments concerned to examine and report to me on the nature and extent of the air and water pollution problems, the different remedial strategies that might be adopted, the cost of these strategies, the appropriate distribution of the cost between the State, local authorities and the private sector&mdash;including industry&mdash; the adequacy of existing legislation and the need for new legislation.  It is intended that the existing functions of Departments in this field will also be co-ordinated through the group.  The working group have commenced their examination of these problems and I am confident that they will report without undue delay.</P>
    <P>This, of course, will be only the first step towards ensuring that our environment is kept at an acceptable standard. I may say that apart from the time which must be taken to plan necessary remedial works, the cost involved is likely to be very substantial.  It has been estimated that notwithstanding our relative freedom from serious water pollution, it could cost up to £35 million to carry out a comprehensive programme of works to eliminate this form of pollution alone.  Pending the completion of a report by the working group, I am having various measures taken to ensure that the position as regards water and air pollution is not allowed to deteriorate.</P>
    <P>Water pollution attracts a great deal of publicity, some of it calculated to cause unnecessary alarm and, on occasions, with little regard for the facts. Localised problems of water pollution do exist in this country and they have tended to increase in number and gravity in recent years, but we are in the fortunate position that, taking the country as a whole, no serious or widespread pollution is occurring.  In my opinion, the problems that exist do not call for panic measures.  Steady progress is being made with the building up of machinery to ensure that water pollution does not get out of hand. When this is fully operative I am satisfied that existing major problems will <Col N="453" /> be brought under control and that further serious problems will not be allowed to arise.</P>
    <P>The water resources division of An Foras Forbartha have made progress with the work of establishing the facts about water quality in our major rivers. Later this year when they have completed their preliminary surveys of 60 rivers, we will have a good outline picture on a national basis of the extent of the water pollution problem.  The preliminary surveys will be followed by investigations at locations where serious pollution has been found or where there is a danger that pollution might reach unacceptable levels.  These investigations will identify the causes of pollution and the appropriate authorities can then put in train action to reduce the degree of pollution or to ensure that it is not allowed to become a serious problem.</P>
    <P>I would urge any body concerned&mdash; be it a public authority, an industry or otherwise&mdash;not to wait until the researches of the water resources division identify them as water polluters before they take remedial action.  Instead, they should lose no time in taking steps to abate any pollution for which they are responsible.  In this connection I must commend the action of the Irish Sugar Company when it was shown that the effluent from their factories could be injurious to fish life when flows in the receiving rivers were low, they immediately decided to undertake a programme, estimated to cost about £500,000, to provide modern treatment works at their plants so as to ensure that pollution of the rivers would not recur from any source within their control.</P>
    <P>The local authorities in whose areas the sugar factories are situated have adopted an equally responsible attitude. Mallow Urban District Council, which had discharged untreated sewage into the River Blackwater, has decided to install modern treatment works. Carlow Urban Council is doing likewise to protect the Barrow.</P>
    <P>These are welcome examples of the enlightened approach of a local authority and a local industry to improve conditions in local rivers.  This is the kind of combined action that should be encouraged and I hope to see similar <Col N="454" /> concerted actions in other areas.  It shows what can be done without waiting for final reports from the water resources division or possible punitive measures.</P>
    <P>I have noted with interest the views of the Confederation of Irish Industry about water pollution and I feel sure that its members will co-operate in dealing with pollution problems arising out of industrial activity.  Such collaboration between the public authorities and industry will be essential.  It must be admitted, however, that there is no magic formula by which pollution problems can be resolved overnight. While water pollution in this country is not widespread, even the localised problems that exist will require a considerable amount of finance to bring them under control. The pace at which a programme to eliminate the problems can proceed must, therefore, depend on the rate at which money becomes available to finance it and, in so far as the public sector is concerned, that pace must have due regard to the competing demands on available resources.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of finance, the design and construction of remedial works must take time so that if we want to see results within a reasonable time, planning should now be under way.  I would, therefore, suggest to the confederation that they should encourage member firms who know that they will eventually have to undertake remedial works, to embark on these projects sooner rather than later.  Indeed, the federation might consider building up a fund from which industries who might otherwise find it difficult to finance remedial works could get assistance.  In the case of new industries, the quality and quantity of effluent can be controlled under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, and I have issued guidelines in this matter to planning authorities to prevent new sources of serious pollution from industry arising.</P>
    <P>Sanitary authorities have been doing a great deal of unpublicised work over the years in combating water pollution. The sewerage schemes provided in the past decade or so have been designed to high modern standards. <Col N="455" /> However, many of the older sewerage systems have inadequate or obsolete treatment works.  Special attention will have to be given to this aspect.  Remedial work must be done in such a way as not to disrupt the normal sanitary services programme which must continue to be geared primarily towards catering for the needs of other expanding programmes such as industry and housing.</P>
    <P>Water pollution in the Dublin area has come in for particularly severe criticism from time to time and I should like to give the Dáil a brief account of what is being done to improve the position.  There is little doubt that stretches of the three major rivers, the Dodder, Tolka and Liffey, require attention.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Dodder, the discharges causing significant pollution will be diverted into the new Dodder Valley sewer.  Two of the four major sections of this project, which go to make up the main trunk sewer, have been completed and the third has been commenced.  The documentation for the final section has now been completed and it is hoped to invite tenders shortly for the work.  In addition to remedying pollution, this project will open up 6,300 acres of new land for housing and industrial development.</P>
    <P>As regards the Tolka, Dublin Corporation have provided a rising main and a pump house at Finglas Bridge which should improve the quality of the river.  Nobody, however, can do anything about the fact that in summer the flow in the Tolka is extremely low and that any discharge of deleterious matter or the dumping of waste into the river is bound to have a serious effect.  I would appeal, therefore, to the people living in the vicinity of the river to co-operate with the sanitary authorities in preventing further dumping into the Tolka; otherwise they will be depriving themselves of what should be a major amenity in their area.</P>
    <P>Pollution of the Liffey is caused by two main sources.  The Camac, which flows into the Liffey at Heuston Bridge, is heavily polluted, mainly by industrial effluents.  In addition, overflows <Col N="456" /> into the Liffey from the city centre sewers are now much more frequent than previously because they now carry the sewage from the major housing and industrial developments in the Ballyfermot and Crumlin areas.  It is intended that the Greater Dublin drainage scheme, sometimes referred to as the &ldquo;Grand Canal&rdquo; sewer, will take discharges at present going into the Camac and will also intercept the flows from the city centre sewers. Dublin Corporation are pushing ahead with the design of this project, but it is a large, complex and costly undertaking and, even with the maximum pressure for progress, must take some years to complete.  This scheme will also open up some 11,000 acres of new land for development so that between it and the Dodder Valley scheme the present pressure on land for development in the Dublin area should be substantially eased.  The discharge from these two schemes will be brought to the Pigeon House for treatment.  To ensure that the discharges will not cause a deterioration in the position in Dublin Bay, a scheme for major extensions and improvements of the treatment works at the Pigeon House is also being undertaken.  Dublin Corporation have retained a firm of international standing to advise them on the project in order to ensure that the effluent from the treatment works will be of an acceptable standard. When the new treatment works come into commission the position in Dublin Bay should be noticeably improved.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of the treatment works is £3.5 million.  The Greater Dublin drainage scheme will cost £6.5 million and the Dodder Valley sewer £2.5 million, giving a total of £12.5 million.  Other local authorities in the Dublin area are also engaged on schemes to free their areas from pollution problems&mdash;for example, the Blackrock main drainage scheme, which is estimated to cost about £600,000, and the Bray joint sewerage scheme.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that Dublin Corporation is co-operating with the Electricity Supply Board and the Dublin Port and Docks Board in a joint survey to establish the level of <Col N="457" /> pollution in Dublin Bay.  I can assure the House that the attack on the water pollution problem in the Dublin area is an all-out one and that, if it should be established that the works at present in hand will not, in fact, result in acceptable standards in the Dublin rivers and in Dublin Bay, then any further remedial works which may be necessary will be undertaken.</P>
    <P>Cork Corporation is also planning a comprehensive main drainage system.  I hope that the preliminary difficulties which were encountered will be resolved and that the planning and execution of the scheme will proceed rapidly. In Galway Borough, satisfactory progress is being made on the construction of several sections of a new main drainage system.  Waterford Corporation has also constructed sewerage works which will ultimately form part of a new main drainage system for the city.  Similar schemes are in hands in other areas.  All this activity goes to show that local authorities generally are well aware of the need to provide against water pollution in their areas. I would appeal to the private sector to co-operate fully with the public authorities in ensuring that, in so far as they can, the standard of our environment in this respect is not allowed to deteriorate.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal briefly with the question of controlling the pollution of the atmosphere.  While the general level of our air pollution is not dangerous, it, too, is a subject which attracts a good deal of publicity. People nowadays are genuinely concerned about the environment in which they live and it is only natural that they should be conscious about air pollution.</P>
    <P>I believe that the coming into operation on 1st January, 1971, of the Control of Atmospheric Pollution Regulations, 1970, has been generally welcomed. These regulations control the heavier smoke emissions and make it an offence to cause a nuisance by emission of smoke, dust, grit, gas or fumes from premises other than private houses.  The administration of the regulations rests with sanitary authorities and I visualise that the best approach is to foster the fullest co-operation between the sanitary authorities and <Col N="458" /> local industry as the key to effective remedial action.  Heavy industrial smoke emissions are in many cases a by-product of badly maintained, inefficient or out-of-date plant and improvements designed to reduce the smoke emissions could also bring about savings in running costs and a better return on investment. Industry should, therefore, be willing to co-operate in the implementation of the regulations.</P>
    <P>The emission of noxious gases from certain chemical and other processes is controlled by the Alkali Works Regulation Act, 1906.  I am considering if there are other processes which may be giving off harmful emissions and which should be similarly controlled.</P>
    <P>Air pollution measurements are taken at recording stations in six of the larger urban areas.  It is intended to increase substantially the number and coverage of monitoring stations and I am asking sanitary authorities to arrange, in consultation with my Department, for the setting up of monitoring stations in towns with populations of 15,000 or more.  When sufficient information is available, the need for further control measures will be examined.</P>
    <P>Smoke from domestic fires in the larger towns contributes significantly to the pollution of the air.  This is one of the matters which it is intended to investigate to see if feasible remedial measures are possible.  The big majority of new dwellings are heated otherwise than by solid fuel fires and many existing houses also have been installing central heating.  It may be assumed, therefore, that the smoke problem from domestic sources is not increasing. Indeed this is borne out by the records of the existing monitoring stations.</P>
    <P>I should point out also that smoke is not the most dangerous of emissions. The sulphur dioxide emissions from industrial plant and from central heating systems is at least as noxious as dark smoke discharged from domestic flues.</P>
    <P>As announced last autumn by the Minister for Transport and Power, overall responsibility for the clearance of oil pollution of coastal areas has been assigned to me by the Government. Priority in this matter will be <Col N="459" /> given to interim arrangements to deal with the effects of oil spillages at sea. Preparation of the necessary legislation will also be put in hands as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the topic of pollution of the air, water and our shores, I should like to emphasise that the control of pollution, although a necessary task, is of its nature a negative operation.  I do not see my role as one of concern solely with controls and prohibitions; rather should the emphasis be on the positive work of creating a pleasant environment in which to live.  In this work, local authorities can do much to improve the general quality of life and it will be my concern to encourage them, within available resources, to maintain a steady progress with the provision of facilities and amenities which are important in improving the general standard of our environment.  A capital allocation of £1.3 million is available in the current year to assist local authorities in providing miscellaneous services, many of which directly contribute towards this end.</P>
    <P>One such service, in which I have a particular interest, concerns the provision of swimming pools.  Pools have a tremendous amenity value, especially in built-up areas.  They provide scope for healthy exercise and reduce the incidence of delinquency and they save lives by making available facilities for training in swimming and life-saving. There has been a growing, and welcome, demand for pools in many areas. The proof of local enthusiasm is to be seen in the substantial voluntary contributions which have been collected, even in small towns, towards the cost of construction.  I am glad to say, therefore, that I found it possible last year to release 18 pools, subject to the finalisation of technical details in each case and the adequacy of the local voluntary contribution.  These pools, in conjunction with the ten released during 1967-68, should go a long way towards easing the national lack of swimming and training facilities.</P>
    <P>I am particularly conscious of the need to provide more pools in larger areas of population and I was glad, therefore, to be able to approve of a <Col N="460" /> recent proposal by Dublin Corporation to borrow £100,000 towards the cost of providing two further public pools in the city, one in Ballyfermot and the other either in Finglas or in Cabra, as decided by the corporation.  These pools, which are additional to the 18 pools at various places throughout the country which I have already mentioned, should prove of tremendous amenity value in areas where there are so many young people.  I hope that swimming and life-saving instruction will be a major feature in the operation of these pools.</P>
    <P>Provided the demands on public capital resources do not impede progress on essential services such as housing, water supplies and sewerage facilities, it will be my aim to encourage the provision of more and more swimming pools of a proper standard, regard being had to the population to be served and, in the early stages, to the necessity to spread the programme broadly over the country so that at least one pool will be within reasonable distance of all areas.  We will also have to consider, in particular, the suitability of the pools from the viewpoint of design and depth, for the giving of instruction in swimming.</P>
    <P>In the provision of pools, the primary aim should be the promotion of training, first in swimming and then in life-saving.  I look forward to the time when every Irish youngster will regard it as natural to swim as to ride a bike or punt a ball.  This aim can become a reality only when we have succeeded in providing pools on a wide basis throughout the country.  This is a task in which local voluntary effort and enthusiasm must play an important part.</P>
    <P>I have reviewed, in consultation with the various bodies concerned, the arrangements for the promotion of water safety, including life-saving and swimming instruction, with the intention of expanding their coverage and making them more effective.  This review convinced me that the necessary expansion and co-ordination of the present limited programme of water safety instruction could be brought about only by the establishment of a central organisation to promote and <Col N="461" /> guide operations, and I have recently set up such a body, called the Irish Water Safety Association, An Comhlachas Snámha is Tarrthála.  The membership includes representatives of local authorities, the Irish Amateur Swimming Association and former members of the water safety committee of the Irish Red Cross Society.  The functions of this new organisation will include the expansion and co-ordination of water safety and swimming activities, the training of instructors, the award of certificates and the promotion of water safety publicity.</P>
    <P>Life-saving and swimming instruction can help to save lives.  Local sanitary authorities also help in another important way to reduce the loss of life and property by their activities to combat fires and promote fire precautions.  Nevertheless, the steep increase in the number of fire out-breaks in recent years, coupled with the tragic losses of life and the losses of property, of an estimated value of £8 million in 1970-71, caused by fire, must be of the greatest concern to everybody.</P>
    <P>Sanitary authorities are under a statutory duty to make reasonable provision to extinguish fires in their areas promptly and efficiently, and to protect persons and property from injury by fire.  The authorities have done a lot to provide themselves with modern appliances and equipment, but the proper training of personnel is also essential so that the modern sophisticated equipment will be used to maximum effect and that different brigades can work together efficiently at major fires.  An instructional film to assist in the work of training and co-ordination has been made by my Department and distributed to fire authorities throughout the country.  A second film has recently been completed and will be distributed shortly.  In addition, courses of training for station officers and sub-officers have been organised by the Department and further courses for training instructors are being arranged.  These courses and the provision of qualified instructors should go a long way towards improving the efficiency of local brigades.</P>
    <P>The next step must be the building <Col N="462" /> up of a proper fire prevention system. The expense of establishing effective fire prevention machinery, supported at national level by educational and publicity campaigns, would be repaid many times over by reduced fire losses.</P>
    <P>I want now to say a word of appreciation to the local authorities who have faced up to their responsibilities of providing houses or serviced camping sites for itinerant families in their areas.  In particular, also, I want to express my gratitude to the dedicated voluntary workers whose help in the problems arising in the early stages of settlement of itinerants is an essential element if the programme of rehabilitation is to achieve the ultimate aim of full integration.  I am glad to say that almost 500 itinerant families have now been accommodated, either on properly serviced camping sites or in houses.  If schemes now planned come to fruition, more than half of the itinerant population will have been provided for.</P>
    <P>In order to ascertain the scale of operations still to be undertaken, and to see how the number and distribution of itinerants may have altered in the period since data were previously collected, I recently asked local authorities to carry out a count of itinerants in their areas.  This information is being assembled and when it has been collated we will have a reliable picture of the extent and nature of the remaining problems.</P>
    <P>One of the most important results of settlement is that proper arrangements for education can be made and it is good to know that many itinerant children are now attending at school regularly.  It is tragic, however, to think that a number of children of school-going age in itinerant families not yet settled are still denied this opportunity and that a few short years will bring them to young manhood or womanhood, unfitted for any way of life except continued itinerancy.  One thing is clear&mdash;those selfish people who still oppose camping sites in their own vicinity can no longer take refuge in the argument that itinerants do not want to settle and will not send their children to school.  I do not deny that the difficulties associated with the settlement of itinerants are real, but any thinking person will agree that the <Col N="463" /> difficulties are outweighed by the responsibility of the community for the social uplifting of the most depressed section of our people and particularly for the education of every itinerant child.</P>
    <P>I appeal again to local authorities not to allow another winter to come with itinerant families living in squalor on roadsides and in ditches in the inclement weather.  Proper provision should be made for these unfortunates, whether on a permanent or temporary basis, in the areas where they are accustomed to spend the winter. In so far as the cost may inhibit action I should like to remind local authorities that subsidies of up to 100 per cent of approved expenditure will be provided by my Department.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that a 90 per cent subsidy is now available towards the employment of social workers on work for the rehabilitation of itinerants. I hope that this generous subvention will encourage many more local authorities to employ full-time workers.  This would be a worthwhile investment for the community since the efforts of trained social workers should help in appreciably shortening the transition period from itinerancy to full integration in the case of families wishing to settle.</P>
    <P>My Department's work in regional planning is of vital significance in influencing the future shape of the country and the House will forgive me if I deal with this subject in some detail. It is the aim of regional planning to make it possible for each area to contribute to national growth to the full extent of its potential and, on the other hand, to ensure that the benefits of national economic growth are spread throughout the country.  In physical terms it is the objective to provide a framework, or guidelines, for investment in the building and construction that will be needed if the economic and social objectives are to be attained. Such a framework, or guidelines, must be designed to take account of the various relevant objectives of national policy, including the objectives for western and Gaeltacht development and for rural development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="464" /> The Buchanan Report is one view, by independent United Nations consultants, of what the framework for regional development might be.  The Government are determined that there should be adequate opportunity for other views to be aired and for the implications of the Buchanan recommendations to be examined before policy is determined as regards objectives for development at the regional level.  The basic view in the Buchanan Report is that if national development is to be accelerated and more progress made towards reducing emigration the trend towards general urbanisation will need to be supplemented by a growth centre programme based on national, regional and local centres.  In the view of the consultants a programme of that kind could mean that an additional 140,000 people would be accommodated in the country by 1986.  The recommendations in the report follow a description by the consultants of various alternative courses that might be followed as regards the location of physical development, reflecting a greater or lesser degree of concentration and in association a higher or lower projected population for 1986.</P>
    <P>The benefits claimed by the consultants for their policy recommendations, in terms of additional people provided with work and houses and all the facilities of modern living in this country in 20 years time, are such that very serious consideration must be given to the kind of action recommended in the report.  On the other hand, the implications of such a course of action in terms of future population distribution, in terms in particular of the effect of the programme on development in the remoter parts of the country; and in terms of the capital programme for building and construction are such that no recommendations of the kind could be adopted responsibly without the fullest examination and wide consultation with bodies who might be in a position to comment constructively on the issues at stake.</P>
    <P>All interests in the private sector are invited to make their views known. To facilitate proper consultation in the public sector the regional development <Col N="465" /> organisations were set up and are now in operation in all regions.  These organisations are co-ordinating bodies representative of local authorities and of other development interests including the industrial and tourism authorities. The representation includes elected members and officials of local authorities. They will have a general co-ordinating and advisory function in regional planning.  As an immediate task they have been requested to report for their regions on the major considerations, particularly the physical and infrastructure considerations, which are important for a regional development programme.  As part of this report the organisations have also been invited to make known their own views and conclusions on how a programme for regional development should be approached in their regions.</P>
    <P>I expect that these reports will improve the basis for regional decisions in three ways.  First, they will attempt to establish for each region whether there are significant changes in population or employment trends or in development prospects in particular locations in the four years since the last census material was published. Second, the reports are expected to bring out and quantify the potential for development, and the obstacles to development in each region and in the various parts of it.  This applies particularly to the physical potential and obstacles&mdash;the considerations of location, water and sewerage capacities, roads, housing, availability and suitability of sites and other infrastructure prospects.  Third, the reports will provide a means of getting views from the regions, related to the factual material, on a rational pattern for development in the years ahead taking account of the different functions of the towns and how they are performing, or the limitations on resources and of the need to establish priorities for investment. The need to establish priorities is nothing new because there has to be a progressive approach to development in any programme.  While the basic decisions about resource allocations must be made at national level, I think it would be a step forward if priorities within and between <Col N="466" /> local areas could be determined less from outside and more through consultation and discussion among the bodies responsible for planning and development locally.</P>
    <P>These reports are to be seen as part of the ongoing evaluation of regional development possibilities which the Government have undertaken.  They will serve to complement the work which has already been done not alone through the Buchanan study but through the various other regional and sub-regional studies including the Wright Report on the Dublin region, the Lichfield Report on the Limerick region and the recently issued report on the Cork city and county area.  The last-mentioned report, by the United Nations project manager, followed on a study in the Cork area carried out by the United Nations in association with An Foras Forbartha.  Further planning work, part of an ongoing. programme, includes special studies of the Gaeltacht areas being carried out by consultants engaged by An Foras Forbartha and by Foras staff; they are now completed and are being printed for publication.  In the Limerick region valuable results are also expected from a study commissioned by the Limerick, Clare, Tipperary (NR) Regional Development Organisation which is now nearing completion there.  One of the primary purposes of this particular study is to evaluate in a comparative way the implications of different development strategies in the central part of the region with particular reference to infrastructure costs.  It is hoped that it will be possible to bring the results of much of this planning work into the reckoning in the evaluation of the regional reports, which will be carried out with the help of the Regional Development Committee which has been set up to assist in the work. When this phase of regional planning investigation has been completed I would envisage being in a position to bring the matter of regional policy before the Government for further consideration.  The Government's concern is to secure that the resources of every region are exploited to the greatest extent possible and that the development <Col N="467" /> of small towns and rural areas is encouraged in order to improve employment opportunities locally.  The work I have outlined is designed to ensure that the possibilities for achieving this objective will be explored before any further decisions are taken on long-term objectives for the accommodation and distribution of future populations.</P>
    <P>The procedure I have described takes time, considerable time.  No apology need be made for this.  Basic decisions in regional planning can have a profound effect on the lives of all of us and, indeed, of future generations and it would be irresponsible to make decisions of that kind on the basis of inadequate information.  Progress in the different regions has been somewhat uneven but in the last few months the reports generally have reached an advanced stage.  I want to avail of this opportunity to appeal to the regional organisations generally to press on with the work and to bring it to completion at the earliest date possible.  My Department is participating in the work of the Regional Development Organisations and a subhead of the Estimates for 1970-71 and 1971-72 respectively includes a sum for grants to regional planning and development groups and to local planning authorities to enable me to make a contribution towards the operating costs of the organisations. Since industry is obviously of key importance in the total regional development picture, special arrangements have been made for liaison between my Department, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>Regional planning is of special interest to local authorities for a number of reasons.  In the first place theirs is the local responsibility for physical planning and for fixing the objectives for their own districts.  The co-ordination of local plans, which is my responsibility under the 1963 Planning and Development Act, is one aspect of regional planning.  Another aspect is a need for co-ordinating and reconciling the objectives for local development as contained in the statutory local plans, with the objectives for regional development.  Local authorities are, of <Col N="468" /> course, responsible for water and sewerage, roads, housing and other aspects of community and infrastructure development and these are of critical importance in any plan to achieve targets for population or employment expansion.  The physical planning responsibilities of local authorities, including development, control and infrastructure functions, mean, in effect, that the quality of the local physical environment depends very much on their policies and on the decisions they make.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another level of planning, in which each planning authority can give effect to their role as development corporation for their area.  In a wider sense than that indicated by their planning functions and their responsibility for providing various services, the local authorities have a general interest in the wellbeing of their area and its inhabitants and they have been urged to conduct their affairs accordingly and within the limits of their powers and resources, support local enterprise and take the initiative to open up development opportunities. Those counties which do not come within the scope of the arrangements for county development teams have been encouraged to appoint staff to act as liaison units between the local authorities and industrial prospects. Counties in general have made some arrangement to this effect and in the process work in close relationship with the Industrial Development Authority which, I understand, has the highest appreciation for this service which the local authorities can give.  The development plan is more than a local authority works programme.  It can and should be an instrument for supporting and stimulating the economic and social improvement of the area generally. I am aware of the difficulties faced by planning authorities in drawing up their first development plans, in particular the scarcity of skilled personnel. I should like to pay a tribute to the way in which they surmounted these difficulties.  At the same time, I would remind the House of the very substantial assistance given by the Department and An Foras Forbartha to the local authorities by way of personal advice, seminars and specialist studies.  This <Col N="469" /> still goes on.  For instance, An Foras hope to have completed shortly a study of the coastline and a specific one of Brittas Bay.  They have also in hands an inventory of heritage items.  A few planning authorities have not been able to complete the formal making of their first development plan yet, largely because of the magnitude of the task in their area and the volume of comments received from the public.  They have been given extra time to do it.  But in general the development plans are due for review in 1972 and I have recently written to planning authorities on the subject.  In doing so I took account of the very practical problems identified by myself and the Parliamentary Secretary in the consideration of planning appeals.  Here I may say that there is a very significant feedback of information on policy from the appeals system.</P>
    <P>We perceived that there was a danger to the acceptance by the public of planning because of the human difficulties which can arise in individual cases, and our object is to reduce these to the minimum while preserving fundamental requirements.  The basis on which the first generation of plans was of necessity framed involved the use of broad rules and principles in many cases, due, of course, to lack of certain data, more detailed study and sufficient technical staff&mdash;a start, of course, had to be made.  The planning authorities may now be faced with the dilemma that, if they apply general rules rigidly, they are accused of ignoring real personal problems, and planning after all is for people.  If, however, they relax unduly in the application of general rules, it can lead to a snowball effect by way of precedent, bringing a non-planning result with all the cost of planning.  Areas under strong development pressure experience the greatest problems.</P>
    <P>Our solution is, I believe, a reasonable one.  We start with the first principle that fundamental requirements of public health, traffic and amenity must be met.  Within that, we suggest that due account should be taken of the scarcity of technical resources and that planning be made more liberal, reserving its force for key issues and key areas.  I cannot anticipate how my <Col N="470" /> suggestions will work, but if the planning authorities make a real effort to follow them I am sure they will operate to the benefit of the public and of planning.  I shall not go into detail on them, because the letters have had wide circulation already.</P>
    <P>During the year ended 31st March, 1970, there was a continuing increase in the number of proposals for development as compared with the preceding years.  Returns from planning authorities show that they received 27,480 applications in 1969-70 against 25,024 in the previous year.  They also show that the number of refusals for permission increased from 2,838 to 3,303. These increases primarily reflected the pressures for development in such areas as Cork, Dublin, Galway and Wicklow. It seems that applications continued to increase during 1970-71.</P>
    <P>In view of the rise in the number of applications to planning authorities and in the number of refusals by them, it is not surprising that the number of appeals increased&mdash;from 1,897 in 1968-69 to 2,279 in 1969-70 and 2,491 in 1970-71.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that more appeals are disposed of each year, i.e. 1,392 in 1968-69, 1,759 in 1969-70 and 2,349 in 1970-71, the fact remains that the number of appeals awaiting decision keeps increasing rather than decreasing.</P>
    <P>Another factor which has given rise to the delay in dealing with appeals is an increase in the number of requests for oral hearings.  There were 297 such requests in 1968-69 and 530 in 1969-70 and 513 in 1970-71.  The oral hearings dealt with rose from 267 in 1968-69 to 324 in 1969-70 and 535 in 1970-71, but the number on hands is still substantial.  I am not suggesting that requests should not be made for oral hearings.  I only wish to point out that as oral hearings take time to organise when there are a number of parties concerned, they involve a further delay factor.</P>
    <P>I am fully alive to the problems which arise from the growing volume of appeals, and which cannot be lightly solved in view of the overall shortage of skilled staff.  It can involve delay, <Col N="471" /> and this can cause hardship in individual cases.  It absorbs a great proportion of the time of the limited skilled staff available to us, both in the Department and the local authorities and thus diverts them from that positive planning work which, if undertaken, would improve the quality of development plans and thus reduce the need for appeals.</P>
    <P>In an effort to break the vicious circle, I have asked the planning authorities to approach the matter in the spirit in which I have asked them to tackle the review of their development plans and so settle as many of the problems as possible at local level. Applicants for planning permission are not always free from fault and I would appeal to them to consult the local authority before taking a decision on proposed development, to document their applications properly and not to press the impossible proposals.  For my part, I will do all I can to remedy the position, both by way of advice and assistance to the planning authorities and by such administrative steps as are possible.  I may mention that efforts are being made by way of scholarships and otherwise to increase the output of skilled staff.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill is designed to deal with a specific aspect of planning appeals and it would not necessarily affect the volume of appeals or the time factor involved, which are largely dependent on the staff available.  I intend to have the Bill examined in the light of my experience and that of the Parliamentary Secretary in dealing with appeals.  It may be that this close examination of the Bill will confirm that it should remain as it is, but I should prefer not to proceed with it until that examination has been completed.</P>
    <P>Previous Ministers have urged the local authorities concerned to give special attention to the Gaeltacht areas in the discharge of their planning functions and the pursuit of development objectives.  I have repeated this request and I have asked the county councils to consider appointing special planning advisory committees for the <Col N="472" /> Gaeltacht areas, to include the elective members for these areas.  I have already referred to the Foras planning studies for the Gaeltacht areas now completed and due for publication very shortly.</P>
    <P>Conservation year had particular significance for local Government.  A number of public authorities have responsibilities which impinge on conservation, but it is important to remember that the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, introduced a comprehensive provision whereby the preservation and development of our national and man-made heritage is brought within the planning functions of the local authorities.  This is over and above the local authorities' responsibility for the provision of housing, roads, sanitary services, all of which impact on and are inter-related with conservation.  Planning means not merely the planning of resources for the material welfare of the people but also to improve the quality of their life.</P>
    <P>It was realised that planning authorities would themselves find it difficult to secure all the necessary skills adequately to perform their functions in this regard and from their foundation An Foras Forbartha have done a considerable amount to help them.  I have already mentioned some of the further studies they have in hands and the fact that the water resources division will assess on a comprehensive scale the quantity and quality of our water resources.  During the year, with generous assistance from an industrial sponsor and in consultation with the Department of Education, An Foras published and circulated free to schools a booklet to stimulate youthful interest in nature studies.  Their lectures and seminars during the year took particular account of conservation.</P>
    <P>The Department's Estimate for 1970-71 contained a provision for grants in respect of amenity works and derelict sites.  The provision for 1971-72 is being increased from £70,000 to £120,500, and this has enabled me to release the amenity schemes on hands. As to future work, I have decided to reshape the scheme concentrating the work on the amenity schemes and devolving <Col N="473" /> it substantially to the local authorities.  The latter is part of a general development I hope to secure in the operation of the Department's activities.  The derelict sites scheme, has, in my opinion, run for a sufficient period to have dealt effectively with this problem, and it is necessary that the moneys available, which are bound to be relatively limited, should be devoted to works of more positive amenity content.  I would hope that the local authorities' activities in this regard, run in conjunction with local community groups, will reflect their general care for the area and the communities which they serve and will be an apposite feature of that general role which is envisaged for them.  I have been able to release grants for derelict sites schemes already in hands and in order, but no new application can be considered unless the scheme merits consideration as an amenity scheme because of amenity features in it.</P>
    <P>Elsewhere in my speech I mention some of the activities of An Foras Forbartha, enough I think to give an idea of the varied and valuable work which they are doing.  The institute are singular in the range of activities they cover, a wide range but all related to the environment in which we live and work.  The institute are fortunate in thereby having such a wide spread of skills, a fact that increases their ability to deal effectively with the complex problems arising in research today. They are a young institute, confident of their ability to serve the nation and naturally anxious to expand.  No one is more conscious than I of the value of the work which they can do and I am only too glad to avail of their potential.  However, their financial demands have to be considered in the light of competing demands for other valuable services as well.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it was possible to increase the grant-in-aid in 1969-70 by £35,000 to £185,000, and a Supplementary Estimate in 1970-71 made a further sum of £11,400 available.  The voted grant-in-aid relates to the planning, construction and water resources divisions of the institute; the roads division is financed by a grant from the Road Fund.  I am pleased to say <Col N="474" /> that, despite other pressing demands, it has been possible to make provision for a grant-in-aid of £235,200 for An Foras for 1971-72.  This of course falls short of what the institute sought, but is not an ungenerous contribution in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>An Foras work in close consultation with my Department, with other Departments and interests concerned and with local authorities.  This ensures that the research is relevant to practical problems and that the results, which are widely disseminated, are applied.</P>
    <P>An Foras have the guidance and assistance of a consultative panel, advisory committees, groups and working parties representative of the professional, vocational and consumer interests. The large volume of work accomplished has been made possible by the voluntary work contributed so generously by the members of these consultative and advisory units.  I should like to thank them and the various professional and other bodies which they represent for the valuable assistance they have given, and I would also like to express my appreciation to the members of the board.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the White Paper on local government reorganisation which was laid before each House of the Oireachtas last February.  Deputies will already be familiar with the proposals contained in the White Paper and I will, not, therefore, attempt to make a full presentation at this stage. Instead, I propose to deal with a number of general points about the Paper and to refer briefly to the main proposals.</P>
    <P>The White Paper is presented for public discussion purposes.  Its central theme is that local government is important both in its own right, as an essential part of a democracy, and because of the important services it provides.  It is essential, for these reasons, that we should have a live local government system, with a sound structure and sound principles of operation.  The proposals in the White Paper are, in my view, a realistic attempt to bring this about.  The structural proposals are evolutionary in character&mdash;they represent an attempt to <Col N="475" /> mould the existing system into a more modern and effective one rather than an attempt to replace it by an entirely new one.  I believe that this evolutionary approach is best in dealing with local government for, by tackling the problem of reorganisation in this way, we can preserve what is best in our present system while, at the same time, creating a system which will be better able to cope with the increasingly heavy demands which are being made on local government.</P>
    <P>The White Paper concludes that the best local government structure is one based on the county, with additional elements at higher and lower levels.  At the higher level, provision is made for regional bodies to promote regional studies, to advise on co-ordination and, if local authorities so desire, to provide facilities such as scarce professional staff or expensive machinery on a service basis.  At the lower level, the proposals envisage that each county council would have area committees, based on suitable towns and their hinterlands with local offices where possible.  These would help councils maintain contact with local communities without sacrificing advantages of scale in the actual provision of services.  It is also proposed that voluntary local community councils should be promoted and that the powers of local authorities to help them and co-operate with them would be widened.  I am writing to local authorities advising them of how at this stage I envisage these area committees and local community councils would operate.</P>
    <P>If the foregoing principles are accepted, it follows that substantial changes must be made in the case of town commissioners and urban districts. The White Paper proposes, therefore, to transfer the functions of town commissioners to the county councils.  Since the present functions of the commissioners are minimal, the main effect of this&mdash;in so far as the actual provision of local government services is concerned&mdash;would be that the rates would be reduced in towns concerned, by amounts ranging up to 45p or 9/- in the £, taking 1970-71 <Col N="476" /> figures.  The transfer of town commissioners' functions would not, of course, preclude the continuance of the status of the towns concerned for ceremonial and other traditional purposes.  In the case of urban districts, the Government are satisfied, for reasons set out in the White Paper in some detail, that the functions of many urban authorities must also be transferred to the county councils if the development of the towns concerned is to be facilitated.  It is proposed, however, that separate councils should be retained in suitable towns and all relevant factors, including local views, would be taken into account in selecting these.</P>
    <P>As a special case, the White Paper considers the government of the Dublin area and proposes a single council for the whole area with flexible provision for local committees of this council and local offices.  As I have already indicated, special consideration is given to the Gaeltacht.  The proposals here are that arrangements be made&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  to establish separate local electoral areas for Gaeltacht districts, so that public representatives can be elected specifically for those areas, and</P>
    <P>(2)  to assign some of the powers and functions of the county councils to those representatives.</P>
    <P>Improvements in the operation of the local government system are also dealt with in the White Paper and these, of course, are just as important as structural changes.  There are proposals in the White Paper for the elimination of unnecessary or outmoded controls over local authorities, the restatement of the permissive powers of local authorities in broad terms, and a wholesale modernisation of procedures, staff structure, organisation and methods generally, the statutory framework, and so on.  In addition, a new orientation is given to the position of the Department, with more emphasis on its positive role of providing services for local authorities at national level.</P>
    <P>The activities of local authorities reach into very many aspects of modern life; indeed it is often said that, &ldquo;from <Col N="477" /> the womb to the tomb&rdquo;, people are dependent on services provided through the local government system.  For this reason, and because local government is such a vital part of our democratic system, it is essential that changes in our present system should have wide support.  The decision to publish a White Paper containing proposals, rather than final decisions, took account of this fact.  I repeat that the White Paper is intended to provoke public discussion and to serve as a basis for consultation with interests concerned.  Constructive comments on the proposals, from whatever source, will be welcomed and taken into account before final decisions are made as to the changes which should be affected.</P>
    <P>I should like to take the opportunity of reminding those who wish to submit comments to do so as soon as possible because of the need to make real progress with local government reorganisation in 1971.  Local elections are due to be held in June next year and if there is to be any prospect of having any major structural proposals implemented by then, we must aim to have consultations completed at an early date.  It was for this reason that the White Paper itself asked that comments should be submitted before the end of April, 1971. I received, however, a number of requests from local authorities and other bodies to extend this date and, in order to meet these requests as far as possible, I decided to extend the date by two months, i.e., until 30th June 1971.  This was the maximum extension that could be granted.  It will provide in all a period of almost 5 months for the submission of comments on the proposals.  I have indicated to local authorities that, at the end of this period, I hope to hold discussions with local representatives throughout the country in regard to the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Assuming that an adequate local government structure is provided, in particular that the main functions are entrusted to councils with adequate resources and staff, and that a liberal approach is adopted towards the operation of the system, in particular by keeping controls to a minimum and <Col N="478" /> by broadening the legal powers of local authorities, the main constraint on action by local authorities will be finance.  It is essential, therefore, that the proposals for local government reorganisation should be matched by proposals for the reorganisation of the system of local finance.  In this connection, I note that there have been suggestions that we got our priorities mixed-up by publishing a White Paper on Local Government Reorganisation before putting forward comprehensive proposals on local finance.  These suggestions, however, ignore the fact that proposals on local finance cannot be worked out in isolation&mdash;they must have regard to the structure and functions of local government now, and in the future.</P>
    <P>The Government have recognised for some time that the present system of local finance and taxation is in need of overhaul.  Some years ago, an inter-departmental committee was established to examine and report on the present system, the changes which are desirable in it and the sources of local revenue as an alternative or supplement to rates which it may be considered practicable to recommend.  To date, three interim reports have been submitted by the committee.  These dealt with valuation for rating purposes, exemptions from and remissions of rates, and rates and other sources of revenue for local authorities.  In each case, a summarised version of the report was made available to the public for general information and to stimulate constructive comment but without commitment on the part of the Government to accepting all or any of the committee's recommendations.</P>
    <P>The inter-departmental committee had intended to deal, in a further report, with State grants to local authorities and with the other remaining aspects of the system of local finance and taxation.  It became evident, however, that before further progress could be made, it would be necessary to deal with problems such as the scope and shape of local government envisaged in the future.  Accordingly, the preparation of the committee's further report was deferred pending the completion of the review of the structure and functions of local government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="479" /> Now that this review has been completed and proposals for changes have been published, the Government believe that it would be appropriate that they should review those aspects of the system of local finance and taxation on which detailed recommendations have been made by the inter-departmental committee and set out, in general terms, the manner in which they consider that solutions to the overall problems can best be found.  Because of the importance and complexity of this subject, it was decided to deal comprehensively with it in a separate White Paper.  Work on this is well advanced and my intention is that it will be published at the earliest date possible.</P>
    <P>The comprehensive investigations and reviews which have been in progress are, of course, a necessary preliminary to any major overhaul of the system of local finance and taxation. In the meantime, however, positive interim steps have been taken by the Government to improve the system of local finance and to ease the lot of ratepayers.  These steps, some of which represent action on recommendations of the inter-departmental committee, include the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  Legislation has been enacted to allow local rating authorities to introduce schemes for the remission of rates in the case of necessitous persons.  In 1969-70, 45 authorities operated such schemes under which 3,565 persons were granted full relief and 2,839 received partial relief.</P>
    <P>2.  Legislation has also been enacted to confer on certain classes of ratepayer a right to pay their rates in instalments.  In 1970-71 over 9,000 ratepayers availed of this facility.</P>
    <P>3.  The omnibus rating concessions which applied under the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Acts to all new or reconstructed buildings which did not qualify for rates remission under any other code are being phased-out. This will relieve the general body of ratepayers of the burden of, in effect, subsidising buildings such as newly erected or improved office-blocks, <Col N="480" /> supermarkets and luxury houses.</P>
    <P>4.  The contribution from the rates towards the cost of scholarships has been frozen at the 1967-68 level.</P>
    <P>5.  The statutory contributions by rating authorities towards vocational education have been stabilised for some years, the additional expenditure on vocational education which would otherwise have fallen on ratepayers being met by higher grants.</P>
    <P>6.  Finally, the overall level of State grants to local authorities has increased significantly&mdash;in 1970-71 it stood at about 51 per cent of local expenditure.  Of the total revenue expenditure of local authorities&mdash;£151 million in that year&mdash;State grants met approximately £77 million.</P>
    <P>The measures I have just outlined are very valuable in themselves.  They are, however, only the first steps on the way to comprehensive reform of the local finance and taxation system. When the proposed White Paper on Local Finance is published they will be seen to be part of a realistic overall programme of reform, extending to all aspects of the present system.</P>
    <P>The combined purchasing system continues to bring benefits to local authorities.  The level of purchases by local authorities under the system is now estimated to be running at over £6 million per annum.  This system has been in operation from the 1920s, and in that time has been of benefit to local authorities in various ways&mdash; in terms of value for money, in setting and maintaining standards of quality, and in administrative convenience. The system has also been of help to growing Irish industries, both as a sales outlet, and in setting standards. The system is currently under review by a working party, with the object of determining what changes may be necessary to meet the needs of the present day.</P>
    <P>The Government are in favour of reducing the voting age to 18 for all elections.  The approval of the people will be necessary before the age can be reduced for Dáil and Presidential elections and this question will be <Col N="481" /> submitted to the people by referendum. In the case of local elections the age limit could be reduced by legislation in the normal way but the Government have decided that the introduction of such legislation should be deferred pending the result of the referendum relating to Presidential and Dáil elections.</P>
    <P>The Government have also decided to abolish property qualification for a local government vote.  Under the law as it stands, a person is entitled to be registered as a local government voter where he lives or where he occupies property, subject to the proviso that he may not be registered more than once in the area of the same local authority.  It is proposed to amend the law to provide that a person may be registered as a local government voter for the area of his residence only. When a person resides in an urban district or town commissioners' area he will as at present be able to vote for the urban district council.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with roads and traffic.  Certain important decisions were taken by the Government in July, 1969, in relation to future roads policy. There was a recognition that the classification of the road system which had been in existence since 1925 was out of date and should be modernised.  In the light of studies undertaken by my Department and An Foras Forbartha in consultation with the engineering organisations of the road authorities, the Government decided that roads should be reclassified into systems to be described as national primary, national secondary, regional and county systems. This decision was largely relevant to the rural road network as it was realised that a comprehensive reclassification of the networks in the cities and urban areas was a particularly complex problem for which final solutions could not be worked out until traffic studies and their implications in the context of development plans had been determined.</P>
    <P>I think it would be fair to say that there has been a general welcome for this decision and my major preoccupation in this respect so far has been to review its detailed application to particular areas in regard to the actual designation <Col N="482" /> of national primary and national secondary routes.  I have now completed this review and am satisfied that the fullest consideration has been given to the various claims and representations that were made to have particular routes accorded national status.  Deputies will appreciate that the reclassification of the entire network comprising more than 53,000 miles of public roads is a major task and that it can only be tackled on a phased basis.  Studies on the routes to form the regional and county systems are proceeding and I would propose at a later stage to have the fullest consultation with the road authorities before final selections of the routes to be designated as regional and county road are made.</P>
    <P>The Government have also decided that responsibility for the national road system should be transferred to the Minister so that a national programme can be devised for these roads and route improvements can be designed and executed on a uniform basis.  Legislation to give effect to this transfer of responsibility is being prepared.</P>
    <P>With the classification of the national roads already mentioned I accepted, last year, in advance of legislation full responsibility for financing the programme of work, including upkeep, on the national primary roads.  This was the first stage of a phased rearrangement of road finance and it relieved local authorities of a financial burden of almost £500,000 by reason of the increase in the rate of grant for upkeep works on these roads from 50 per cent to 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>The analysis and appraisal of various studies of our traffic problem has continued in my Department for the purpose of assessing future road improvement programmes required to keep abreast with the increasing volumes of road traffic.  Undoubtedly, our most urgent task is the implementation of a programme of street improvement and other works to cope with traffic loads in our larger cities and towns.  Traffic management schemes can play an important part in getting the maximum value out of the existing street systems.</P>
    <P>The increase in the percentage rate <Col N="483" /> of grant for the upkeep of national primary roads and increase in wages and other costs caused a substantial increase in the amount required last year to meet grant obligations to the various authorities.  Final grant allocations in 1970-71 amounted to approximately £12 million, compared with approximately £10.4 million in 1969-70. This caused a substantial rise in the amount of the outstanding commitments against the Road Fund at 31st March last and this factor had to be taken into account in determining the amounts of allocations for 1971-72.  In general, 1971-72 grants are being maintained at the same high level as in 1970-71, but increased provision has been made for urgent works in the Dublin area, and for the programme of traffic management schemes in the urban and built-up areas.  These increases amount to £400,000, bringing the total of the 1971-72 allocations to some £12.4 million.</P>
    <P>Progress with the Local Improvements Scheme in 1970-71 was satisfactory. The great majority of counties made full use of their grant allocations in the year.</P>
    <P>The provision under subhead K is £500,000, the same as in 1970-71.  As has already been announced it has been decided to supplement this provision for the current year by a further £500,000.  County councils have been notified of the allocation of the aggregate sum of £1 million.  Increased allocations have been made in all counties, but the bulk of the supplementary provision has been allocated to the western counties, broadly in proportion to last year's allocations.  I am glad to have been enabled to make these increased allocations and so facilitate councils in reducing the backlog of applications which have been the subject of complaint from many sources.  It is also an important purpose of the additional provision to create increased employment in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The co-operation of county councils will be necessary to ensure that full use will be made of the additional funds being provided for this scheme.  I am <Col N="484" /> confident that that co-operation will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>One of the most pressing problems facing urban road authorities is that of traffic congestion and how best to deploy the limited financial resources available to remedy the situation.  If I refer in some detail to the problem as it affects Dublin, it must not be taken that I am unmindful of the existence of traffic congestion in other towns and cities; it is merely that the problem is more acute in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Traffic problems in Dublin largely derive from the fact that the form which central city development has taken was largely determined before the advent of the motor car.</P>

      <P>Instances of damage to public roads by vehicles of the forest and wildlife service of my Department are very rare. My Department have no liability for damage which may be caused to various roads by contractors entering or leaving State forest properties but if such damage were extraordinary liability would attach to the contractor. The improvement, repair and maintenance of public roads is the responsibility of the county council.  The large State forest holding in the county <Col N="489" /> is reflected in the very considerable sum paid to the local authority by way of bounty in lieu of rates for which virtually the only return is the road service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he considers it in the national interest to introduce, by means of departmental regulation, major changes in the educational structure of the country; and if, in view of recent developments, particularly in relation to the view to the preparation of a new Education Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not feel that any such elaborate procedure as that outlined in the Deputy's question is called for.  Ample opportunity has been given in this House to discuss the Government's policy in education which is directed towards providing equality of educational opportunity for all our children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the current proposals relating to community schools were not given to this House by way of Estimate statement, in the form of management proposed, and in view of the fact that major national changes are proposed in the whole structure of the educational system in relation to 31 centres, does the Minister not consider it extraordinary and disgraceful that no White Paper has been published, more particularly as even the Vocational Teachers' Organisation asked for a White Paper to be published in a statement this morning?  The country is entitled to a new Education Bill rather than <i>ad hoc</i> proposals drawn up between the Minister and Cardinal Conway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not regard it as either extraordinary or disgraceful.  It is quite obvious to the Minister that the Deputy has not followed the line of Fianna Fáil educational policy over the years.  When the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dr. Hillery, was Minister for <Col N="492" /> Education the comprehensive schools were established; there was no legislation needed for that.  When Deputy George Colley became Minister for Education he was also concerned, not only with the comprehensive schools but with the comprehensive type of education, in order to try to provide this type of education for all the children of the country.  He issued a circular letter to all the schools asking that they should co-operate and in the process to help to break down the barriers which existed between secondary schools and vocational schools.  The late Donogh O'Malley brought in free education and free school transport schemes.  It became obvious that the need for comprehensive educational facilities in the schools had become more necessary because of the exceptionally large number of extra pupils who were seeking post-primary education.  All these moves were in furtherance of the concept of which I have already spoken on many occasions in this House.  Deputy B. Lenihan continued this policy.  When I became Minister for Education I too was very anxious that there should be equal education facilities for all children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was soon obvious that the co-operation we were looking for would not produce the equality of opportunity in the matter of providing comprehensive educational facilities particularly in the smaller towns.  The vocational education committees were not legally empowered to co-operate in any formal way.  For these reasons the community schools idea developed.  I introduced legislation to give legal authority to the vocational education committees to participate formally in the financing and the running of the joint schools. There has been a clear indication all along of what successive Ministers for Education have been trying to do.  The basic consideration is that the late Donogh O'Malley, having given access to free education to all those who wished to avail of it in the post-primary schools, we had to examine the situation in order to see whether equality of educational opportunity was in fact being given to all.  In the smaller country towns it was obvious that we <Col N="493" /> were not providing equality of educational opportunity.  The community school idea has evolved from this as a normal development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The late Donogh O'Malley would turn in his grave if he could hear what the Minister has just said.  At no stage since 1963 did the late Donogh O'Malley, Deputy Colley, Deputy Dr. Hillery, or Deputy Brian Lenihan when they were Ministers for Education in making statements in relation to the community schools and to comprehensive schools legally vest the ownership and effective control of these schools in a particular ecclesiastical authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

    <P>12.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will elaborate, in terms of dates and composition of delegations, on his statement that the Protestant community could not regard vocational schools as non-denominational in character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 11 and 12 together.  At the outset I would like to deprecate again in the strongest possible terms the efforts on the part of the Deputy to introduce sectarianism into this matter of community schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I informed the House on the 19th <Col N="494" /> of this month of the discussions which I and my Department had with various interests in relation to these schools.  At no stage did the seeking of or the giving of agreement arise.  The proposals which emanated are my proposals and I stand over them fully.</P>
    <P>As regards the statement made by His Grace, Dr. Buchanan, I can only repeat what I have said already&mdash;that Dr. Buchanan was no doubt referring to the legal position but that the factual position is that on numerous occasions deputation after deputation on behalf of the Protestant community stated that because the vast majority of pupils and teachers in vocational schools are Catholics they could not regard these schools as non-denominational in character.  That I and my predecessors respected the view that the Protestant community wished their children to attend schools under Protestant management is evidenced by the special provisions made in the matter of school transport for those children and by the provision of separate schools where such would not be otherwise warranted.  I do not feel that it would be correct for me to furnish details of deputations received by me or my Department.</P>
    <P>I might add for the Deputy's information in relation to the areas proposed for community schools that of the 13,800 pupils at present attending post-primary schools in these areas only 106 are Protestant pupils attending vocational schools.  He will, therefore, I trust appreciate the non-issue which he has raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's figures illustrate the sectarian character of his proposals.  I bitterly reject and completely repudiate any suggestion that we have introduced such connotations and overtones into the proposals.</P>

    <Col N="495" />
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that Cardinal Conway made it explicitly and unequivocally clear to him personally that he required that the proposed 31 community schools should be owned in trusteeship and effectively be under control by the majority board system of the Catholic ecclesiastical authority?  Would the Minister agree that this was the proposition? Would he agree that this indication was given to him and the Minister accordingly accepted it and then redrafted and brought in his proposals? Is that not the truth of the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>That is absolute nonsense.  I have stated here and have stated publicly on television and on the radio that I had discussions with the Hierarchy, with the vocational and with other groups.  My Department had discussions with the teaching organisations.  I listened to all they had to say, and when I had listened to them all it was quite obvious to me, as it is to anybody who looks at or reads of the controversy which is proceeding at the present time in relation to the position, that there was considerable opposition to my proposals, but that many of those who were opposing my proposals were opposing them for different reasons. It was obvious that if all sat around a table for years and tried to work out a completely acceptable solution they would never reach it.  Having listened to what all the various groups had to say, I made my own decision. The proposals put forward now are my own proposals.  I reject entirely the inference in Deputy Desmond's supplementary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered my question.  I asked the Minister if he would agree it was clearly conveyed to him by Cardinal Conway that the community schools would have to be&mdash;all 31 of them&mdash; under the legal ownership and the majority management control of the Catholic ecclesiastical authority.  The Minister has not answered that question. I challenge him to say whether the statement was put to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I said, and I repeat, <Col N="496" /> that what is implied in the Deputy's question is nonsense.  If the original document which I issued in the form of a working paper is examined particularly in relation to the board of management&mdash;and in so far as I can see most controversy appears to arise in that regard&mdash;and if it is related to the proposals which I made in my final document, it will be seen that there is very little difference except that there is in fact a considerable improvement.  In the original proposals I put forward only hope was expressed that the parents might become part of the management board; in fact, parents will now be on the management boards.</P>

    <P>As regards the school premises the question of the renovation of the existing buildings or the construction of new schools is under consideration at present.  The provision which might be made is complicated by the fact that many of the children now attending <Col N="499" /> the schools come from outside areas and that numbers are gradually diminishing according as new schools are being built in these other areas.  Therefore, it was found necessary to undertake a special survey of the pupil potential. This has been put in train.</P>

      <P>Wool markets have been held in towns and villages throughout the country for the last 40 years.  It is difficult to get away immediately from old customs.

Last year I raised this matter because many people after travelling for 20 miles found that there was no market. I would suggest to the Minister that Sligo should be made the centre.  Those who have authority to buy wool should be asked to arrange this in order to meet the wishes of the farming community who have gone to this market place for many years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is probably aware that for many years the marketing and the presentation for export of our wool has militated against the interests of the wool producers. It is for that reason that the legislation was introduced in 1968.  My information is that last year in Sligo, while certain farmers presented wool for sale in the open&mdash;which is now not in accordance with the regulations&mdash; no buyer attended.  While this may be the case, the county of Sligo is adequately catered for in the matter of registered premises where wool may be bought and sold within the regulations.</P>

      <P>If this is the type of intelligent comment that I am to get from a Minister of State when the jobs of 62 people are at stake I have very little hope for their future employment. I am fully alive to what is happening in this factory.  I want to ask the Minister if he is aware that in this factory &mdash;he has told us the type of subvention it has got&mdash;the workers there now are earning approximately £1,200 per week in a rural part of County Donegal and they pay approximately £1,500 a year income tax?  If they are unemployed they will be a burden on the State of approximately £35,000 per year.  I believe the company concerned, who make every effort to keep the factory open, gave notice to the Minister's Department four months ago through the IDA and the Minister has made no progress to date.  It is disgraceful that he should have to stand up here and try to sell that situation.  Why does the Minister not admit that he has done nothing at all and has taken no interest in it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>Representations on this matter have been made at various times down the years by the Dublin Corporation.  On the other hand, representations have been made to the corporation by my Department and by the Garda that the greater need is for pound accommodation and, where possible, the fencing of unused open areas which are owned by the corporation and in which animals are left to graze by their owners.  I am of course fully aware of the difficulties facing the corporation on both points.</P>
      <P>To allow animals to wander on public roads is already an offence and any legislation to amend or strengthen that law is a matter primarily for the Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>The question of an amendment of fees payable in respect of impounded animals is under consideration but it is necessary to bear in mind that a poundage fee is intended to meet outlay and is not a penalty in disguise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The ordinary law of negligence would apply, and if the party could prove negligence an action would lie.  Our law on wandering animals, I must confess, is rather outdated from the civil liability point of view and it is something we are looking into.  It developed over the years because of the fact that fencing was comparatively unknown until 150 years ago.  Unfortunately, our civil law on liability for damage has not progressed in accordance with modern conditions as much as it might have.</P>

      <P>The method of addressing non-commissioned officers and privates is not prescribed in Defence Force regulations. In practice such personnel are normally addressed orally by rank and surname and this method of address is considered correct and proper.  Regimental numbers are only used in oral address where there is a possibility of confusing the identity of personnel of the same rank and surname.  Regimental numbers together with surnames and Christian names or initials are normally used in any written communications to soldiers so as to clearly identity the personnel but the necessity for such communications rarely arise.</P>

      <P>The position concerning the other schemes referred to is that work on the scheme at Coolaprevane commenced in March, 1971.  A grant of £900&mdash;15 houses at £60&mdash;has been allocated and an instalment of £660 will be paid shortly.  A proposal by the county council to raise a loan of £1,350 to meet portion of the cost of the scheme is being considered in my Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Air pollution measurements have been taken at 17 monitoring stations in Dublin City for a number of years past.  Last February I asked Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation to consider increasing the number and spread of these stations. The ESB and certain other industrial undertakings have agreed to make available to my Department results obtained from measuring instruments operated by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of existing controls on atmospheric pollution.  The Control of Atmospheric Pollution Regulations, 1970, control the heavier smoke emissions from premises other <Col N="537" /> than private houses.  Sanitary authorities are carrying out, at my request, a survey of the premises likely to be affected and are taking appropriate action in respect of specific contraventions of these regulations.  Emission of noxious gases from certain chemical and other processes are controlled under the Alkali, etc.  Works Regulation Act, 1906.  The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 enables planning authorities to exercise control on new industries or extensions of existing industries which are liable to cause air pollution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider publishing some reports on the working of new regulations which came in in January of this year in order to allay public anxiety on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider doing that.  There is quite an amount of work being done in Dublin assessing the extent of atmospheric pollution, and steps will be taken in time if it is found that the present legislation is not strong enough to enforce these regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Questions I was dealing with traffic and in particular Dublin traffic.  One of the most pressing problems facing urban road authorities is that of the traffic situation and how best to deploy the limited financial resources available to remedy the situation. If I refer at some length to the problem as it affects Dublin it must not be taken that I am unmindful of the existence of traffic congestion in other towns and cities, merely that the problem is more acute in Dublin. Traffic problems in Dublin largely derive from the fact that the form which central city development has taken was largely determined before the advent of the motor car.  The street network is, therefore, incapable of catering for the vast and growing volume of vehicles.  The inadequate number of bridges over the River Liffey also contributes to the congestion. A number of studies have been undertaken by engineering and planning experts for the preparation of long term solutions.  These solutions involve very large amounts of capital which is <Col N="546" /> one of our scarcest resources.  There is, further, the problem of dealing in the interim with the short term situation. Dublin Corporation are proceeding with a programme of traffic management works on the radial routes leading into and out of the city centre. These works involve maximising the use of existing street networks, by such measures as one-way streets systems, improved road junctions, improved parking control (including parking meters), clearway restrictions, systems of integrated traffic light installations, and box junctions.  The corporation are also planning the provision of pedestrian subways at a number of critical locations, particularly at O'Connell Bridge and Henry Street/North Earl St. In order to speed the implementation of all these measures a special section dealing with traffic matters has been set up in the corporation.</P>
      <P>The existing street network, even after the completion of the most extensive practicable traffic management schemes, will not be able to cater for all those vehicles, which in a &ldquo;free for all&rdquo; situation drivers would wish to bring into the city centre.  Consequently, a greater degree of sophistication in traffic control, coupled with some restraints on non-essential traffic, are inevitable.  Parking restrictions and the parking meter scheme are examples of the restraints already in operation.  I am satisfied that some extension of traffic control will become necessary, for the very good reason that the greater the degree of traffic congestion the greater the disadvantage to public transport.  It must be borne in mind that almost 50 per cent of the public in the Dublin area rely on public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was with all this in mind that I suggested to the Dublin municipal authorities that they should experiment with measures to secure further relief of traffic congestion and I suggested certain courses for the consideration of the corporation through their traffic committee.  In particular, I suggested that experiments be conducted in the application of certain traffic techniques, including the pedestrianisation of streets and the restriction of certain <Col N="547" /> types of vehicular traffic in central city areas at certain times.</P>
    <P>In association with this activity, I increased the &ldquo;fine on the spot&rdquo; penalty from £1 to £2 and I also made regulations which enable a local authority to tow away or arrange for the removal of vehicles which were unlawfully parked or abandoned.  As regards the increase in the &ldquo;fine on the spot&rdquo; penalty, it had become clear to the enforcement authorities that a penalty of £1 was ineffective as a deterrent to many motorists who simply would not comply with traffic control requirements. The Dublin Corporation, who are responsible for administering the traffic warden system, pressed strongly for a substantial increase in the £1 penalty.  The Garda authorities were consulted and also advised that the £1 penalty was not achieving its purpose as a deterrent to unlawful parking. In deciding to increase the penalty to £2, I had regard to the foregoing, to the fall in the value of money since 1964, and to the substantially higher and more strict penalties now in force in European cities for similar offences.</P>
    <P>Arising from my suggestion the Dublin Traffic Committee recommended a phased series of experimental measures to be undertaken as a continuing programme.  Measures so far taken comprise a week's experiment to measure the effect on traffic flow of full observance of the &ldquo;Rules of the Road&rdquo; as well as of the various traffic and parking control measures provided for and the introduction of an experimental bus lane on the Fairview route. An experiment in the pedestrianisation of certain streets during business hours will also be undertaken to explore the possibility of improving civic amenity.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that these experiments are designed overall to help to find ways to improve Dublin's serious traffic problem.  The detailed results of the experiments are being carefully studied by the corporation and will give a lot of useful information on which to base future policy.  I should like to take this opportunity to thank everybody for their goodwill and co-operation in the traffic experiments already carried out.  I am confident <Col N="548" /> that such goodwill and co-operation will continue to be given in future experiments and that any inconvenience caused will be accepted for the sake of the common good.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to traffic in other towns.  As I mentioned earlier the problem of traffic congestion arises in cities and towns other than Dublin, and last year special Road Fund grants were made available to a number of urban authorities for the carrying out of traffic management schemes in their areas.  The urban areas in question were chosen because of the urgent problems facing them and of the fact that traffic management techniques were most appropriate in these cases.  I am satisfied that these grants will have a very beneficial effect and I am continuing to make such grants available for the current year.</P>
    <P>Speed limits are reviewed periodically on a county-by-county basis. Revised regulations for a number of areas have been made and revised regulations for a number of other areas are in course of preparation.  In reviewing speed limits account is taken of the views of the local authorities, the Garda and local representations.</P>
    <P>In September last I announced that I had asked An Foras Forbartha to continue their study of the effectiveness of the general speed limit of 60 mph and to relate experience to the international developments in this field. The findings of a report by An Foras on the first seven months of their operation had not been encouraging.  The limit had not during that period been successful in decreasing speeds or in reducing the number and severity of accidents.  It is clear that the 60 mph general speed limit has valuable potential as a safety measure if it is observed adequately and enforced and it was for this reason that I decided to have the enforcement and publicity aspects associated with it examined.  I asked my colleague, the Minister for Justice, to arrange for special enforcement of the limit on major routes.  An Foras Forbartha have facilitated the Garda Síochána by providing them with particulars of high accident sections of these routes where enforcement of the limit would be beneficial in securing a <Col N="549" /> reduction in the number of accidents. I hope to review the measure again in the course of the present year.</P>
    <P>I have now received the report and recommendations of An Foras Forbartha on a system of informative signposting which would be suitable for modern traffic needs.  Before the report was received, certain decisions had been taken.  These were that place names will be in Irish and English, both versions having equal prominence; that where the Irish version of a place name is reasonably similar to the English version, only the Irish version need be used; and that names of places in the Gaeltacht will be shown in Irish only on signs in the Gaeltacht.  A revision of the signs regulations was made by me which enables the latter decision to be implemented.  The recommendations of An Foras Forbartha are now under consideration and a suitable programme for the introduction of the new system of signs will be worked out.</P>
    <P>Two regulations came into operation on the 1st September, 1970, as part of a programme of road safety measures designed to bring about a reduction in the number of fatal and serious injury accidents.  These regulations provide for the fitting of safety frames to tractors and for display on the rears and sides of large goods vehicles and trailers of fluorescent and reflective markings.  The safety frames fitted must comply with an international standard.  They are required to be fitted to tractors first registered on or after 1st September, 1970. Frames will be required on other tractors as from 1st September, 1977.  The requirement about the marking of large vehicles will enable such vehicles to be more easily seen at all times.  This should reduce the risk of collisions at night or in conditions of poor daylight visibility.</P>
    <P>I recently made regulations requiring the fitting of safety belts for the front seats in cars, station wagons and light goods vehicles, first registered on or after 1st June next.  Safety belts and the anchorage points to which they should be attached are required to comply with certain national and international standards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> If all new cars are fitted with belts from a given day, the number of cars on the road without belts will gradually be eliminated.  This factor coupled with the growing voluntary fitting of belts will accelerate the growth in the proportion of cars with belts.  A vigorous publicity campaign has now commenced to encourage owners of existing vehicles to have belts installed and also to persuade people to use the belts when they are fitted in the vehicles, and so reduce the risk of serious injury to themselves in the event of a road accident.</P>
    <P>My Department are engaged on a general review of the vehicle regulations, helped by an informal committee which was set up for the purpose. This committee, and their sub-committees dealing with special aspects of the vehicle and its use, held a number of meetings throughout the year. The work of reviewing the whole body of vehicle regulations is a continuous process because of continual developments in the auto-motive field.  While the committee pursue their task, therefore, I may find it necessary from time to time to introduce regulations as, for example, in the case of the safety frames for tractors, the marking of large vehicles and the fitting of safety belts.  At the same time, my Department are engaged in the process of examining what adaptation of laws would arise in this field on the accession of Ireland to the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>Following representations from taxi interests for a limitation on the number of persons and vehicles admitted to the taxi business, an informal fact finding committee were set up to assemble all relevant facts relating to the taxi and hackney business.  On receipt of the report of this committee, I amended the public service vehicle regulations so as to restrict entry to the taxi and hackney business to limited periods of the year and to raise the standards for entry to the business.</P>
    <P>Consequent on the making of these new regulations and after considering representations made to me by taximen in the Dublin area I have set up <Col N="551" /> an informal committee which are looking into the factors relating to the livelihood of taximen in the area.  The committee are composed of representatives of the people and bodies in the city with interests in the taxi business. When the committee reports to me I shall be in a better position to consider what changes, if any, in the law are necessary to serve best the interests of taximen and the public.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of public service vehicles I should also mention that I have made regulations to permit the use of a 12 metre bus.  This brings our regulations into line with those in Britain and other European countries. Public service vehicle regulations will, of course, be subject to the general review to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Progress on the organisation of a pilot scheme of vehicle inspection is well advanced.  I hope that it will be initiated this year.  The scheme will in its first phase be a research exercise which will involve an examination of a representative sample of the classes of vehicles in use; data from this examination will be analysed with the primary purpose of determining the number of defective vehicles in use on our roads and the nature of these defects, including, for example, defects in lights, brakes and tyres.  Motorists whose vehicles are subjected to examination under the working scheme will be given advice about the condition of their vehicles.</P>
    <P>The scheme will also provide for a check on the laden weights of commercial vehicles; it will also include a comparison between defects in accidents&mdash;involved vehicles and those in the general vehicle population.  Because of the research nature of the initial phase of the scheme I have requested An Foras Forbartha to undertake the project.  It is intended, before the scheme gets under way, to have discussions on the main proposals with various interested bodies in the motor industry and motoring organisations.</P>
    <P>I refer now to the movement of extraordinary loads by road.  Evidence has been growing in recent years to show that problems exist in connection with the movement of very large <Col N="552" /> and extraordinary loads by road.  In the light of information reaching my Department it has become apparent that the present system whereby these loads are moved under permits issued by local authorities requires to be examined.  For this reason I have appointed an informal committee representative of my Department, the local authorities and the operators who will report to me on what changes in the existing system would meet the best interests of those involved.</P>
    <P>Up to the end of March, 1971, a total of just 270,000 driving tests had been carried out.  Approximately 54.8 per cent of applicants failed the test. This may seem a very high figure and, indeed, the test has been criticised from time to time as being too severe and of too high a standard.  I do not accept this.  In the nature of things, some people who fail the test are convinced that they are good drivers and are inclined to maintain that they were failed on what they call &ldquo;minor points&rdquo;, or on &ldquo;technicalities&rdquo;.  I would like to emphasise that these &ldquo;minor points&rdquo;, or &ldquo;technicalities&rdquo; are more often than not bad driving habits displayed during the test which could, if persisted in, lead to serious accidents.  The test aims at ensuring that a driver going on the roads has shown that he knows, and is competent to do, what is required of him for safe driving.  Every effort is made to ensure that the standard applied to the test is the same throughout the country as a whole.  To this end, and bearing in mind that applicants for test should generally not have to travel long distances in order to undergo the test, test centres have been established in 43 cities and towns each of which has a good network of roads carrying a reasonable amount of traffic.  Test routes have been planned in each centre so that, in so far as is possible, each route has the same types of driving features and hazards and, what is also important, has much the same numbers of each type of feature or hazard.  The necessity of planning in this way limits the number of towns in which centres can be established and also limits the routes which are acceptable for test.</P>
    <P>The physical element of standardising <Col N="553" /> tests is thus taken care of.  There remains, however, the personal element, that is, the possibility of variation in the standard applied as between individual testers.  This problem is not an easy one to solve since the question of subjective judgment arises.  However, everything possible is being done to ensure a uniform standard of testing and assessment.  First, all testers are, on recruitment, trained for several weeks in the application of standards which have been worked out by my Department in consultation with representatives of many other bodies with considerable experience in driver training and testing.  Later the testers' work is supervised on the road by supervisory testers while the Department itself examines work returns made by the testers.  There are, also, frequent local consultations between the Department's headquarters officers, the supervisory testers and the driver testers and there are retraining and familiarisation courses on various types of vehicles. As a result, I am satisfied that as far as is humanly possible the driving test scheme is fair and impartial throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the delay period in arranging tests which had reached very unsatisfactory proportions last year, has been drastically reduced. Whereas the delay period last year was about 25 weeks it has now been reduced to seven weeks.  This has been made possible by the recruitment of additional driver testers.  The position is not as good as I would wish. However, further additional driver testers are being recruited at present and even though test applications are showing a continuing increase I hope that the waiting period will be further and progressively reduced.</P>
    <P>It is a sad fact that year by year road deaths continue to increase in number.  Between 1965 and 1968 road deaths increased by an average of 7 per cent annually.  During 1969, 462 people were killed, compared with 447 in 1968.  This was an increase of 3 per cent.  The provisional figures for 1970, however, show that 532 people died on our roads, 70 more than in 1969.  This represents an increase of 15 per cent. A full analysis of these figures will not <Col N="554" /> be available for some time yet.  So far 1971 shows no improvement.  In the first four months of this year, 157 people died on the roads&mdash;an increase of 24 on the corresponding period in 1970.  Despite all our efforts, there is, therefore, no evidence of a decrease in the dangers which road users face in the course of their everyday lives. Indeed, it seems that the opposite may be true.  The House will recall that because of the steep increase in road deaths in the months of August, September and October, 1970, I asked An Foras Forbartha to carry out a survey in depth of all fatal road accidents recorded during these three months, with a view to pinpointing any significant factors.  An Foras have reported to me on their investigations. Their overall conclusion is that the increase in road deaths in the period investigated cannot be attributed to any single circumstance, condition or cause.  Fatal accident patterns and trends are widely and diversely distributed in time, space and circumstance. There was an estimated increase of 3 per cent in motor vehicle travel between 1969 and 1970.  Speed measurements made by An Foras in 1969 and 1970 show that there has been an increase both in the dispersion of the various speeds at which motor vehicles travel and also in the proportion of vehicles travelling in the high speed ranges.  Since accident severity increases with increasing speed, it is not surprising that fatal accidents have increased.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to point out, however, that growth in traffic and increased speed are hardly likely to provide a complete and adequate explanation. The inevitable conclusion from the study is that there has been a general overall intensification of the factors which contribute to fatal accidents and that the situation will not improve without greater efforts to improve the standard of behaviour of road users, the safety of vehicles and the roads themselves.</P>
    <P>In relation to drunken driving I am very glad to be able to say that the breath test is now back in full operation. Some people still no doubt feel that this type of legislation is an unwarranted <Col N="555" /> intrusion into the liberty of the individual, but all the evidence points to the fact that alcohol plays a part in many road accidents.  The breath test is there as a deterrent but if we are to make headway in bringing about a reduction in accidents in which alcohol plays a part, then there must be a radical change in our attitudes towards the present patterns of social drinking which lead too often to persons driving while their ability to do so safely is impaired by excessive amounts of alcohol.  In the short period in which the breath test has been in operation, more than half of the specimens of blood and urine analysed by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety had an alcohol content of more than 200 milligrammes per millilitre of blood. This level is more than 75 milligrammes above the legal limit of 125 milligrammes laid down in the Road Traffic Act, 1968, which itself is considerably higher than the limit applied in many other countries.  It is apparent that there is an appalling lack of appreciation by some drivers of their responsibilities as road users.  This lack of appreciation is due either to their failure to grasp fully the effects of alcohol on their ability to drive safely or to a complete disregard for the safety of themselves and others.  There is an obvious need to re-shape driver attitude in this respect.</P>
    <P>I understand that the European Conference of Ministers of Transport, in association with the International Road Safety Organisation intend to sponsor a special international campaign to highlight the dangers of drinking and driving. The tentative time proposed for this campaign is mid-December, 1971. It is my intention that Ireland should participate in this campaign.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with road safety propaganda and education, and road safety officers.  Education of drivers, cyclists, pedestrians, in fact, all road users plays an important part in road safety and is very much the concern of my Department.  Other Departments, such as the Department of Education, also play their part, especially in regard to children.  Down through the years the Safety First Association has worked <Col N="556" /> hard in the cause of road safety.  With the aid of a grant from my Department the Association operates a regional road safety officer service and employs four road safety officers.  Their work extends over 13 counties and includes instruction of children in schools, organising exhibitions, debates, competitions, film shows, indeed any worthwhile project likely to further the cause of road safety.  Local authorities have in the past assigned special officers to assist my Department in promoting specific road safety projects. Following an examination of the possibility of getting local authorities to participate more fully in the promotion of road safety at local level, I asked county councils and county borough councils in the areas not covered by the regional service of the Safety First Association to consider appointing their own road safety officers.  The response to my request was most encouraging and all the authorities concerned have appointed officers with the exception of Dublin Corporation where an appointment is pending.  This new scheme of local authority officers is being tried out for an experimental two year period.</P>
    <P>Another project which I think deserves special mention is the junior school warden scheme.  The scheme was introduced in Carlow on a pilot basis in January, 1970, and has been a great success there.  Boys of 12 years of age were successfully trained to patrol a school crossing for their fellow pupils. Not only does the scheme serve road safety but it is also a very valuable training in civics for all the students involved.  A special word of thanks is due to the Christian Brothers at whose school in Carlow the pilot scheme was introduced.  Without their whole-hearted backing, the generous co-operation of the boys' parents and the enthusiastic support of the Garda Síochána and the local authority, the scheme would never have got off the ground.  Following the introduction of the Carlow scheme, I asked authorities to examine the possibility of introducing the scheme at suitable locations in their areas.  The results so far are encouraging.</P>
    <P>Two further schemes are now in <Col N="557" /> operation&mdash;one sponsored by Roscommon County Council at the Convent of Mercy in Boyle and operated by girl pupils from that school, and the other sponsored by Carrick-on-Suir Urban Council at the Christian Brothers' primary school.  Two more schemes will be introduced shortly&mdash;in Millstreet, County Cork, and Kilmallock, County Limerick, and others are under consideration.</P>
    <P>The junior wardens receive no payment for their services.  Their duties are performed as an act in civics.  The outlay to the local authority is the cost of signs, barriers, uniforms for the wardens and insurance and my Department pays a grant amounting to half of those expenses.  The cost of a junior warden scheme, however, should not be the deciding factor.  Its real value lies in the training it gives to young people, not only in road safety but in the responsibilities of citizenship.  The boys in Carlow and Carrick-on-Suir and the girls in Boyle are now playing an important role in their own communities even at this young age and this augurs well for the future.</P>
    <P>The junior warden scheme is just one practical aspect of training children in good road behaviour. While parents have the duty to train their children to be safe road users, teachers, because of their specialist knowledge and skill are in a most favourable position to influence children. During the past year my Department, with the co-operation of the Department of Education, the teachers and local authorities, have made available to primary and junior schools the first of a series of visual aids to enable teachers to instruct children in road safety during the course of the normal school curriculum.  A second series of visual aids is in course of preparation and will be distributed to the schools later this year.</P>
    <P>The production of road safety literature, films and television material continues. Various leaflets are produced from time to time to publicise new regulations and emphasise particular aspects of road safety.  These leaflets are useful not only to those applying for a driving test but to the general public as well and I am glad to be <Col N="558" /> able to report that there is an increasing demand for this type of literature. Arising out of this demand my Department have at present in production a small booklet for motor cyclists and scooterists.  It is hoped to issue this booklet later this year and that it will prove a useful guide especially to the young motor cyclist.</P>
    <P>Recent and impending new regulations make it necessary to revise and up-date the &ldquo;Rules of the Road&rdquo; booklet, the last edition of which was issued in 1967.  Work has already started on this and I hope that I will be in a position to issue the new booklet towards the end of 1971.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten years my Department have produced and distributed a number of road safety films.  Several of these films are aimed especially at children and young people and, because of the importance which we attach to these age groups, we are at present devoting a considerable part of our resources available for film production to these groups.  Two new films are at present in production, one for children and one for young motor cyclists.  Apart from their uses at schools, clubs, road safety meetings, <i>et cetera</i> our films are screened extensively in cinemas throughout the country, and the co-operation of cinema managements and film distributors in this respect is greatly appreciated.</P>
    <P>The radio and television media are regularly used and the production of television material continues with the co-operation of Radio Telefís Éireann. Time for the screening of road safety material by Radio Telefís Éireann is provided by the authority free of charge as a public service.  This facility is very much appreciated.  In particular, the television publicity feature on the junior school warden scheme contributed greatly towards the development of the scheme.  The Press too by highlighting road accidents and by their coverage of road safety measures are making their own contribution and I should like to thank them.</P>
    <P>From time to time the need arises for special publicity campaigns by my Department.  Recent examples were the introduction of the new markings for heavy vehicles and trailers and the requirements <Col N="559" /> as to safety frames for tractors.  The special publicity for these measures included the issue of special leaflets to owners of vehicles affected, together with radio, television and newspaper publicity.</P>
    <P>Standard time has now been with us since 1968.  While, generally speaking, the extra hour's daylight in the evening in the winter months has been beneficial, the dark winter mornings can be a special hazard for children going to school.  To minimise the danger the Safety First Association once again provided reflective armbands at a nominal charge to primary school children through the schools.  This scheme has already proved its worth and it now appears that the public are becoming aware&mdash;at least as far as children are concerned&mdash;of the value of reflective materials as an aid to making pedestrians more visible in darkness. In support of this measure steps were taken to highlight the dangers of early morning darkness and the hazards for school children through Press, radio and television.  Perhaps I should mention that the question of reverting to Greenwich mean time in the winter months is at present under consideration by the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The tragic death of an adult school warden in Dublin brought home to us very forcibly the value of a service which, perhaps, we have come to take for granted and which involves hazards for the men whose duty it is to protect our children crossing busy roads outside our schools.  As I have indicated already, further consideration is being given to making school wardens more readily visible to traffic, whether in darkness or daylight and to the possibility of providing more clear cut advance warning of crossing places where school wardens operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a very long speech and I must admire the Minister's stamina in being able to read us 76 pages of typescript.  I do not know whether it is a departmental characteristic or a characteristic of the different incumbents of the office of Minister for Local Government but on all occasions they seem to have prolonged <Col N="560" /> speeches, and this was no exception. The Minister gave us an amount of statistical material in respect of housing and glancing superficially through this one would say that everything was well, that there is good work being done, and it is only when one begins to analyse it that one realises that with all the nice outward packaging, inside there is very little.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke of a housing target for the mid-seventies of 15,000 to 17,000 a year.  The target at which we were aiming some years ago was 14,000.  It has been increased a little. Of course a target depends entirely on what standard you are aiming at.  Some years ago in South Tipperary when we were preparing our county plans we were given figures, requirements were laid down and after that targets were laid down.  The targets fell short of the requirements and with the passage of years these targets have been lowered and lowered and our housing accomplishment has been quite poor.</P>
      <P>Indeed, originally the method of calculation was completely inaccurate and requirements were greatly understated, even approaching it as objectively as possible.  It is also true to say that the requirements in the White Paper dealing with the assessment of our requirements are also an understatement. Again it is relative; it depends on how high you are trying to go, what kind of living standards you are trying to provide and what kind of housing standards you aim at. The Minister mentions that total expenditure on providing and reconstructing houses is now running at an annual rate of almost four times that of a decade ago.  Then he goes on and very smoothly, speaking of local authority houses, says that:</P>
      <P>While the growth of housing output has been most striking in the private sector&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>and then he goes on to say in parenthesis&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>reflecting the increased prosperity which enabled more people to provide their own houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does it reflect that, or does it rather reflect the fact that local government <Col N="561" /> have failed to provide the less well off sections of our society with houses and that willy-nilly they have been forced to scrape the barrel, forced to mortgage their future because houses for letting are not available to them and they have been forced to go to building societies, banks, insurance companies and so on in order to get the necessary capital to provide a house for themselves?  I agree that it is nice to see people buying their own houses but if it is done by forcing them to mortgage their future then there is something wrong with the social thinking behind it.</P>
    <P>In the eyes of this Government housing has never been a matter of first priority.  I think it was in the First Programme for Economic Expansion&mdash;if one can use the word &ldquo;expansion&rdquo;&mdash; that it was stated that it was regarded as social welfare investment and therefore not in the same priority list as commercial investment which would give a commercial reward.  That is harsh economics.  I suppose it is true that a man from a slum is just as good a productive unit as a man who is well housed, or very nearly.  If that is your approach then you will say that this is social welfare spending and it has not, in the general programme of spending, a high priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Various suggestions have been thrown out from time to time in regard to methods for improving house building and there is reference again to that in the Minister's speech when he was dealing with the special facilities made available by his Department to co-operative groups for house building.  I have nothing against co-operative groups.  I am sure the idea is an excellent one but the essential thing in getting houses built is a Minister who wants to get them built or a Government who want to get them built.  Whatever technical method you use does not really matter, whether you do it through a co-operative system or whether you do it directly through the National Building Agency or <Col N="562" /> whether you get them built through the local authorities.  If the will is there and if the Government want to do it and the Minister wants to do it it can be done.  If the Minister or the Government do not want to do it it is quite simple to scale it down without showing your hand.</P>
      <P>The details of any housing scheme or even of a single house have to go to the Department several times.  We do not have to get sanction for the site. The plan, tender, borrowing of money, <i>et cetera</i> have to receive ministerial sanction.  The Minister and his officials can slow down a project if they feel there is too much building.  An inspector can come down from the Department to a scheme of 20 houses, speak to the local engineer and cut down the number of houses to be built to ten. The county councils do not always know what has happened.  Quarterly reports are furnished and in each case we can ask what has happened.  The schemes can be drastically reduced. The details of a scheme can lie on a Minister's desk for a long time.  Further questions can be asked about it.  The Department can speed or impede house building.  It is all a matter of policy decisions.  If the Government feel that capital expenditure should not be allowed to rise too rapidly they can slow down house building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor often blamed local authorities.  The authorities were blamed for anything that went wrong.  If there is a fall-off in housing the responsibility lies with the Minister. There was a change of Government in 1947-48 and before the change a White Paper was published in which it was stated that 100,000 houses were needed in a decade.  A new Minister came into office.  Within three years the total housing production increased seven-fold. Local authority housing increased at least tenfold.  There was no co-operative effort and no fancy ideas, but there was a Minister who said &ldquo;I want houses built&rdquo; and they were built.  That has not happened since then.  The annual housing production expanded in three years from 1,602 to 12,305.  The local authority content expanded from 729 to 7,787 houses. That was a housing revolution.  At that <Col N="563" /> time we were not regarded as being as well off as we are now.</P>
    <P>From 1948-49 to 1957-58, covering the period of office of two inter-Party Governments and a Fianna Fáil Government in between, over 100,000 houses were provided.  Fifty per cent of these were local authority houses.  In the 11 years subsequent to that under Fianna Fáil Government 95,000 houses were built and of these 28,639 were local authority houses.  These figures show a complete change of policy in favour of private housing.  It is cheaper for the Government to provide grants for private houses and then to take credit for having built them than it is to provide local authority houses.  There can be a great show and better figures can be produced, but this is less desirable socially.  Those who cannot provide a house for themselves are placed at a disadvantage.  If the percentage of local authority houses is too low the poorer sections of the community suffer.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the switch to private housing as being a reflection of increased prosperity.  I have looked at comparative figures for Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales. I have figures for 1960-69.  In Northern Ireland 62 per cent of the houses available for letting were local authority houses; in Scotland 76 per cent; in England and Wales 40 per cent; and in Ireland 30 per cent.  If these figures are accurate, it would seem that we are better off than the people in those countries.  We know that it is not so. The <i>per capita</i> income is higher in those countries than in this country. I fail to see the logic of having a low percentage of local authority houses and a high percentage of private houses when the incomes of our citizens are lower than those of people in other countries.  In most cases people in the countries I have mentioned are earning bigger salaries than corresponding people here.  I fail to reconcile the different situations.  Northern Ireland, with half our population, built as many houses annually as we are building.  Double the proportion of their houses are local authority houses and are available for letting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="564" /> Members of this House get copies of the OECD reports.  The question is often asked here how we stand by international comparison.  It is a sorry comparison for the Minister for Local Government because we have occupied one of the lowest positions internationally as regards the number of houses built per thousand of population.  For many years we were fourth lowest of the countries listed by the OECD, the countries at the bottom of the table were Spain, Portugal, Greece and Turkey&mdash;which are not perhaps very progressive countries by modern standards.  Spain has been conducting a quite considerable building programme and has now moved ahead of us and at the moment we are the third lowest.</P>
    <P>Our expenditure on housing as a percentage of our national wealth is among the lowest in Europe&mdash;at 4 per cent or 4.1 per cent.  These are aspects of housing to which the Minister does not advert when he tells us what has been done in house-building.</P>
    <P>If one examines the number of persons at work in the construction industry it will give an indication of what is happening because it reflects in great measure how our house-building programme has been proceeding. In 1948 there were 74,000 people at work in the construction industry; in 1970 we had the same number at work in that industry.  In the immediate years after 1948, when the great housing expansion took place, the numbers engaged in the construction industry increased to 86,000. During an adverse period when our housing figures were low we had a corresponding drop in the numbers engaged in the industry.  In 1958-59-60 it dropped to 56,000&mdash;the lowest in the last 20 years and it happened after the second inter-Party Government left office.</P>
    <P>Over a year ago the then Deputy Boland said that if we were to achieve full employment by 1986, some 30,000 or 40,000 extra jobs would have to be found in the manufacturing and mining industries and the same number of jobs in the construction industry.  The fact that in 1948 and in 1970 the same number of workers were employed in <Col N="565" /> the construction industry does not look so hopeful as to enable us to secure that degree of expansion which will give us full employment by 1986.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that about 41,000 houses were built in the last three years, which he stated was a greater number in such a period than ever before in our history.  The Minister is correct in that as the highest figure up to this time had been 39,000 houses.  However, the fundamental difference is the percentage of houses which are grant houses and the percentage which are local authority houses.  There was a decided change of policy and one set of figures is not comparable with the other.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that over a period of three years the cost of constructing an average local authority house increased by nearly 30 per cent and that this escalation of cost must be halted if we hope to overtake our needs. It would be interesting if the Minister would tell us how he is going to halt the cost because this cost of 30 per cent in a three-year period is merely a reflection of the fierce inflation which has got such a grip on this country&mdash; an inflation for which this Government stand charged.  They have failed to grapple with the problem; they have been looking at it foolishly in the expectation that it might disappear.</P>
    <P>In regard to housing, the Department of Local Government stand condemned.  In his long speech the Minister has mentioned all kinds of activities but the essential point&mdash;the number of houses being provided for those who need them most&mdash;has been glossed over.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Adjournment Debate: Dublin Widow's Pension.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BillyFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a question of mine of the 26th May, the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an essential qualification for the receipt of benefit under the Civil Service ex-gratia and contributory widows' and children's pensions schemes that marriage takes place <Col N="566" /> before retirement.  I do not propose to alter this requirement.</P>
    <P>I should like briefly to let the Minister know what was the purpose of the question and why I asked for permission to raise the matter on the Adjournment. I might state at the outset that I realise fully what the Minister said in his reply yesterday and that he might be creating a precedent or a responsibility for somebody who was not married to a particular person at the time of his retirement.  Nevertheless, I would ask the Minister as the Minister responsible for this important Minister and, above all, I ask him on human grounds to reconsider his views in this particular matter.</P>
    <P>The case to which I am referring is a unique case.  It is the case of a widow of a retired civil servant, a man who was deputy chief inspector of the Department of Education.  He became an inspector in 1919, I understand, and retired in 1952.  This man gave his life's service to education in this country.  There were exceptional circumstances attaching to his life by reason of which he did not marry until after he had left the Civil Service. On the death of his two brothers, he assumed responsibility for their widows and families.  Consequently, he was not in a position to marry until both families were self-supporting.  He looked after them so that they were no expense to the State.</P>
    <P>We find now that this man's widow and one child are in the situation of not being able to get any support from the State.  This woman is living on a widow's pension of £5 per week.  The flat in which she resides with her child is costing that amount in rent.  The pension officer has informed her that after her child has reached leaving certificate age, there will be a reduction of 50p per week in the pension, so that she will then be receiving 50p per week less than what her flat is costing in rent alone.  If it were not for her brothers, her circumstances would be very bad indeed.  Some weeks before her late husband died she herself underwent a serious operation from which she has not recovered fully so that she is not in a position to go <Col N="567" /> to work and earn an income that would provide for herself and her daughter.</P>
    <P>This is the only case of its kind so far as the Department of Education are concerned.  It is the only case of an officer having married for the first time or even for the second time after he had left the Department.  This woman is the only school inspector's widow who is not in receipt of a pension. At the time her husband retired in 1952, this particular scheme was not in operation so that women whose husbands died before the introduction of the present scheme were in similar circumstances.  However, the scheme was amended in 1968 and this change allowed for the payment of a pension to civil servants' widows.</P>
    <P>The woman to whom I am referring is the only one who was discriminated against.  This was not done intentionally but it is because of the provisions of the particular scheme.  Therefore I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this case.  It is not as if legislation had to be amended in order to do this.  I understand that it is only a matter of changing a ministerial order.  Therefore, it is within the power of the Minister either to deny this woman and her child a life that would be tolerable, or else to ensure that they have a situation in which they can manage to exist.  It would be a sad reflection on any private company, not to mention a State body, in the case of a man who gave the services this man obviously gave, that his widow should be treated as this widow is and be forced to live as she lives at present. I fully appreciate that, as the Minister said, at the time of his retirement this woman was not the responsibility of the Department but that argument is not sufficient.  If the Minister were to see the situation that exists where this widow lives and the conditions in which she is forced to exist he would have no hesitation in amending the law or making a ministerial order to allow the woman to be treated as the wives of other inspectors and civil servants are treated.  It is not too presumptuous of this woman to expect that at this stage the Minister and the House generally would support the payment <Col N="568" /> to her of a pension.  Any normal human being would welcome such a move by the Minister.  In putting forward this case I am not asking too much.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the case and provide this widow with a living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with this case and I acknowledge what the Deputy said regarding the service rendered by the late husband of this woman.  However, the Deputy is mistaken in thinking that this is a unique case.  There are known to us about half-a-dozen such cases and there may be others of which we do not know. Certainly, others can arise in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>In what Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Civil Service as a whole.  I must deal with this on the basis of the Civil Service as a whole and not merely in relation to the Department of Education because these regulations apply to the Civil Service as a whole.  I think what Deputy Fox said in describing the position is correct but one should see it in perspective. When this man retired, as Deputy Fox said, there was no provision for a pension for widows of civil servants and when the change was made in 1968 whereby pensions were provided for widows of civil servants there was also a provision for additional contributions from civil servants to finance the scheme.  But a special arrangement was made whereby an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of half of what would normally be payable to the widow of a civil servant was paid to widows of civil servants who had died before the operative date.  Therefore, for quite a number of years this particular woman was in the same position as widows of all other civil servants and it is only because of the introduction of the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme that this matter has become an issue at all.  The fact that she has not been able to benefit under the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme is what is really at stake here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>Her husband was able to provide for her until a short time before he died.  Her husband is dead only a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="569" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but her position was exactly the same as the position of all other Civil Service widows and if the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme had not been introduced this problem would not arise at all.  Simply because it was introduced and she is not included, it has arisen.  There are other people in the same position.</P>
      <P>However, there is a principle here which must be considered.  It is not merely the money that is involved.  It has certain implications.  For instance, the principle on which the whole superannuation scheme works is, as I explained yesterday in replying to the Deputy's question, that the status of the civil servant at the date of his retirement is what determines his pension and what happens after that is not the responsibility of his employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me illustrate it in this way: as the Deputy knows, in the Civil Service pay structure there is provision for allowances for children.  The normal case is that the allowances are paid and before the man retires in many cases his children have passed the age at which allowances are paid.  But in some cases he retires while the children are still eligible and allowances continue to be paid as long as they are eligible.  But if the principle being advocated by the Deputy is accepted then it would be possible for a man to retire, marry and have children who would then become entitled to children allowances: they are not at the moment.  If the principle advocated by the Deputy is accepted, a perfectly good case could be made for this. Further, it could be argued if this principle is accepted that all men who <Col N="570" /> marry after retirement from the Civil Service, retiring with a pension based on the single scale would, on marrying after retirement, be entitled to demand that their pensions should be adjusted to the married scale.</P>
    <P>There are other implications but what I am trying to illustrate is that it is not merely a simple case of one woman in difficult circumstances and that it merely requires a stroke of the pen for the Minister to remedy it.  It is not as simple as that.  There are implications involved which go far beyond this case and it is for this reason that I have been obliged to resist the claim. I have a great deal of sympathy with the particular case but I also have a responsibility.  The principle on which we must operate does not envisage the kind of thing I have mentioned developing. Whether this concept would be accepted some time in the future is another question.  It is a concept which certainly is not accepted in this country, as far as I know.  I know it is not accepted in the public service and I am almost certain that it is not accepted in the private sector either.  I have never heard of any such case and any research I have done indicates that it is not so accepted.  It is conceivable that the principle might be accepted in the future but, if it is, it will have to be accepted in the full knowledge of what is involved, that it is raising the kind of questions I have indicated and that it is not merely dealing with one particular case of hardship.  For that reason I must still resist it.</P>
