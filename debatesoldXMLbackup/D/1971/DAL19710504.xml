      <P>As on previous occasions the distribution and subsequent collection of the census forms is being carried out by official census enumerators.  These enumerators return the forms through their supervisors to the Central Statistics Office.  Before doing so they examine each form to ensure that it is filled in completely and accurately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The census was completed on a specific date and my information is now that the census forms themselves are in the process of being collected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state in respect of the period March, 1970, to March, 1971, (a) the amount of the change and (b) the percentage change in the case of all items covered by the consumer price index.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together, and to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving (a) the national average retail prices of certain items of food at mid-February, 1970, and mid-February, 1971, and the actual change in each case, and (b) the percentage change over the period in the prices of all the items entering into the consumer price index numbers.</P>
      <P>In the cases of items, other than certain food items, no attempt is made to obtain quotations for an identical quality of the different articles in all areas and, therefore, any average price computed would not be meaningful. The correctness of the relative price change is ensured by the fact that at each source the identical article is priced at successive inquiries.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" />
      <Col N="1006" />(a) National Average Retail Prices (including turnover tax) of principal food items at mid-February 1970 and mid-February 1971 and the actual change in each case.</P>

      <P>In the past I put this question to the Taoiseach and he has given the reasons, or at least tried to give the reasons, for the increase in the cost of living.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that there has been an abnormal increase in the past year, that the poor are suffering and that the increases given in the Budget will not go half way towards meeting the increase which has taken place in the cost of living in the past year?</P>
      <P>When a question is put down is neither the Taoiseach nor the Parliamentary Secretary supposed to answer? I asked a statistical question, but in (b) I asked for the reason for the increase. In the past either the Taoiseach or the Parliamentary Secretary has tried to give the answer but on this occasion no answer has been given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have been informed <Col N="1018" /> that the local authorities who appoint members to the Eastern Health Board, the North-Eastern Health Board and the North-Western Health Board have reached agreement on the apportionment of the expenditure of these boards.  I am at present having the terms of these agreements examined in my Department before I convey my consent in accordance with section 32 (3) of the Health Act, 1970.  Extensions of time have been granted to the local authorities who appoint members to the Midland and Southern Health Boards to enable agreements to be reached.</P>
      <P>The local authorities who appoint members to the other three boards have failed to reach agreement and consequently it will be necessary for me to appoint a person to make an appropriate determination under section 32 (3) of the Act in these cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reaching his decision on whether he will approve of agreements made, will the Minister bear in mind the cost to ratepayers in each particular local authority area and the necessity for an equalisation of the burden of rates on all ratepayers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, there are a number of ways of doing this.  If the Deputy reads the suggested formula for the apportionment of net health expenditure in the North-Eastern Health Board area, he will see that it is a comparatively complex situation.  It is very difficult to know whether that is the fairest way but I am advised that it is a reasonably fair method of distributing the rates.  Would the Deputy not agree with me that he could not think of a better way of distributing the rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree that the method reached is the fairest one but I would suggest to the Minister that he should look at the matter in a clinical way and ensure that each ratepayer, whether he be in Meath, Monaghan or Cavan or in any other part of the country, will pay an equal amount in respect of health charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons for the decision to increase the Exchequer lending rate were given in my reply to a debate on the Adjournment on 30th March, 1971.  Nothing that has happened since that date has affected interest rates in such a way that the rate for Exchequer lending could be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if there is some small drop in international interest rates, people buying houses in this country should be entitled to some advantage from this change in the economic climate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The decrease in interest rates announced by the banks applies only to certain kinds of loans and overdrafts. The effect of the reduction in the rate is much more immediate on short-term borrowing, but we are dealing here with long-term borrowing and there is no immediate effect on borrowing of that nature.  The present position is that the rate in question here is being subsidised by the State to the extent of ½ per cent.  As I indicated on the Adjournment Debate in relation to this matter, it is my desire and intention to reduce this rate of interest as soon as it is possible to do so, but this is not possible at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know why it is not possible.  Everybody knows that money is being invested in building societies and if the trend is for a reduction in interest rates why should the most fundamental borrowing rates, namely, the rates you pay when you borrow to have your own house, not be affected and why should there not be a reduction?  Is it Government policy not to have a reduction? Does it suit the Government not to have a reduction?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I will say it again in case he was not, that the reduction in interest rates recently announced affects short-term borrowing; it does not immediately affect long-term borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in principle it is true that bank overdraft accommodation is meant to be short-term but everybody here knows that the truth is that overdraft accommodation is long-term in 90 per cent of the cases. That disposes of the Minister's argument. Why then should there not be a reduction in interest rates as applied to repayments on houses bought through building societies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears as if I will have to spell it out a little further for the Deputy.  As the Deputy knows, or should know, the rate in question is governed by the rate at which the Government borrow long term and the latest borrowing by the Government, the most recent National Loan, was at a rate of nearly 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the local authority building rate to applications for SDA loans is 9¾ per cent and 10 per cent in some areas? Will he not therefore agree that this rate continues over the 35-year period irrespective of what may happen in time to come?  Will he agree that despite his statement that the recent National Loan cost 9¾ per cent the net cost to the State, having regard to income tax and sur-tax deductions, would be in the region of possibly less than 6 per cent?  If he agrees with that type of calculation, which I think is correct, would it not be feasible to try to encourage people to build their own houses by reducing the local authority interest rates.  The Minister need not tell me that he is losing one-half of 1 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of establishing national parks of the type suggested by the Deputy has been under examination by the National Parks and Monuments Branch of the Office of Public Works for some time.  A pilot study sponsored by the branch is in progress in the Kilkenny region to assess the feasibility of such a project and to clarify the problems it would pose.  A number of public meetings have been held in which representatives of many local and national organisations have participated. A steering committee was set up to arrange for detailed surveys of the amenity resources of the region, to co-ordinate the work of the various participants and to formulate guidelines for the management of the area in the interests of landowners and visitors alike.</P>
      <P>The committee issued a preliminary report last year and will issue a further report when the study has been completed. It is hoped that the Kilkenny pilot study will serve as a blueprint for other areas of outstanding amenity value and will help in identifying the legislative and administrative requirements for the management of such areas which might include part of the Dublin and Wicklow hills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate that I was not asking a question about Kilkenny; I was asking a question about the Dublin and Wicklow hills.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not answered the question.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have been trying to explain is that we are very interested in this type of project.  In fact, interest in the Dublin and Wicklow hills has continued to grow since October, 1969, following a report called &ldquo;Tourism in Ireland, East&rdquo; published by the Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation.  In the Office of Public Works we took a pilot area and we picked Kilkenny because of its architectural, archaeological and scenic features and we felt it was a very good place in which to find out what will be involved, what will be required and what legislation will be necessary. We hope as a result of experience in Kilkenny to request the Government to introduce legislation for the purpose of giving us greater powers in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation was necessary in England to set up similar parks and we will have to introduce legislation if the matter is to go ahead beyond the report stage, so to speak, because the matter has gone as far as it can go without legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but at their general assembly in New Delhi last November/December the IUCN passed a resolution which would define what these park areas would be and the type of park area which we are considering in Kilkenny, and the one suggested for the Dublin and Wicklow Mountains, would be on the British model and it would conform with the IUCN definition. If it was decided that the Republic should comply with the IUCN resolution a different title would have to be found for such areas as Kilkenny and the Dublin and Wicklow hills and a title such as the National Amenity Area or the National Conservation Area might be appropriate. However, as I said, we are carrying out our experiments in Kilkenny&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the Industrial Development Authority recently advertised for quantity surveyors and compiled a panel of quantity surveyors as consultants; and that this procedure operates to the detriment of some quantity surveyors who are not on the panel; and if he will ensure that no restriction operates in respect of persons to be selected for inclusion on the panel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Industrial Development Authority, following public advertisement, recently set up panels of consultants, including quantity surveyors, for use only in connection with the authority's own programme of advance factory construction. I see nothing unfair in this procedure.  The arrangement is an administrative one which is within the competence of the IDA and I have no function in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say whether these consultants are <Col N="1038" /> furnished to foreign industrialists who wish to establish factories here or is it solely confined to the IDA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is solely for use by the IDA for advice in relation to the setting up of their own advance factories. I am positively informed by the IDA that lists of firms on the IDA panel are not and will not be made available to individual firms which are constructing their own factory premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that it would be more appropriate to have the same procedure as that adopted by the Board of Works whereby a panel of all qualified consultants for particular work is compiled and then they are taken in turn from that panel, whereas in this way persons equally well qualified are excluded from the panel and those who have similar qualifications are included. In this way there is discrimination between one consultant and another, both of whom have identical qualifications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept this but the IDA which is autonomous in this regard decided to advertise in the first instance and those are consultants under one heading or another that they propose to call on in connection with advice relating to the creation of their own advance factories.  In fact, even if no such panel were set up the IDA would be technically free to select, perhaps, any individual in any given area.  I understand from the IDA that they have been selected to a great extent on a geographical basis in relation to covering the country as a whole in view of plans by the IDA for advance regional factory buildings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say if quantity surveyors for the IDA are selected on the same basis as auctioneers are selected by the Land Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not responsible for the manner in which auctioneers for the Land Commission are selected&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister bragging about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>No. My information from the IDA is&mdash;I want to make it <Col N="1039" /> quite clear that there is certainly no reference to the Minister at all in relation to this&mdash;that in fact applications for inclusion on the IDA panel were invited in the national press and this covers architects, quantity surveyors and engineers.  There were 191 applications received.  There were reviewed by a technical committee which included representatives of the Department of Local Government and the Department of Education as well as the IDA.  The committee recommended 65 applicants for inclusion in the panel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the consultants who were excluded have similar qualifications to those included and that they feel there is discrimination on no known grounds other than the fact that they were not included.  Their qualifications are identical but they are excluded from membership of the panel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The panel is only concerned with proposals by the IDA.  The panel is not a list that is handed out to an industrialist who is coming in here and who would normally perhaps be seeking advice from his solicitor or accountant.  Certainly, if the IDA were asked for advice by an industrialist coming in and proposing to set up his own factory, he would be referred to the appropriate professional bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cronin)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the background generally to this matter, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 49 on the 29th April, 1971.</P>
      <P>As far as the survey of Irish inshore waters is concerned the position is that the survey work at Baltimore Harbour has been completed and no arrangements have been made with the British authorities for the survey of any further such waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there are other works to be done?  If the British Government are not going to continue <Col N="1040" /> this highly important work it will not be possible for our shores to be charted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibilities of extending the service beyond Baltimore were discussed at a conference held between my Department and the British Hydrographic Survey Service in December but no further arrangements were made.  It appears that the British did intend resuming work in the present year but because of subsequent priorities they feel they may not now be able to do so.  This decision has nothing at all to do with the incident at Baltimore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that certain Admiralty charts are years out-of-date because changes have taken place in tidal waters? There is a great need for priority here even for British ships.  Because of the explosion at Baltimore the Minister is left in the position where the British are not carrying out work which we are not able to do ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that interest rates on building society loans are agreed between the Department of Local Government or some other State Department and the building societies; and will the Parliamentary Secretary see to it that the general reduction in interest rates, which has occurred not only here but in Europe, will be reflected in a reduced rate of interest to house purchasers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know there is no interference by the Department of Local Government with building societies and other commercial groups.  It is a free open commercial activity to get money at a certain price and lend it at a certain price and this is what is happening.  The demand for loans from building societies is so great that there is a queue waiting for loans from societies and in a free enterprise economy these are the things which determine interest rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government should have been watching carefully over the economy, devising ways and means of improving the economy, preparing proper plans for employment, but they were engaged in internal strife and dissension.  A government must consider its responsibility and a government should remember that a country's interests come before party interests.  Unfortunately, the Fianna Fáil Government suffer from the illusion that they identify the country's interests with the party's interests.  It is unfortunate that they should do so.</P>
      <P>Last year was a tragic year on both the political and economic fronts.  The Government were themselves responsible for the inflation engendered through the doubling of the turnover tax.  This peculiar system fooled people initially into thinking that no radical changes had taken place and that the Budget was an unimaginative one.  But it was the Budget which caused the inflation.  That has been pointed out time and time again by those in a position to know.  Bankers have said it and businessmen put the blame for inflation on the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The turnover tax was a fraudulent tax because the Government sat back and let the small shopkeepers collect it for them and it was the small shopkeepers who were blamed by their customers for the increase in prices.  I have had a deputation of small shopkeepers fighting for survival because of the doubling of the turnover tax. When a quarter pound of tea is stamped 2s it is very difficult to convince the customer that the extra 1d charged by the shopkeeper is tax.  The customer thinks he is being defrauded by the shopkeeper.  This tax was designed <Col N="1049" /> specifically to relieve the Government of their obligation.  It is not a sales tax.  It is a tax on turnover.  It is not a 5 per cent turnover tax; it is almost 6 per cent.  A special programme to educate the public about this tax should have been undertaken by the Government but the Government were content to remain silent and allow the unpaid tax collectors to take all the blame.</P>
    <P>This turnover tax has sent the cost of living soaring.  It has created the inflation in which we are now immersed, an inflation from which we show little signs of escaping.  In the past two or three years the Government have done untold harm to the economy through their indirect taxation.  Fianna Fáil boast of being interested in the people.  They boast about their concern for the people but, judging by their actions and their indirect taxation, they have no care at all for the people.  The pensioner, the lowly-paid workman, the person living on a fixed income find it impossible to make ends meet.  It is these who suffer most.  The Government which call themselves a Government of the people just do not believe in an equitable system of taxation.</P>
    <P>So far, no attempt has been made to alter our taxation system.  Britain has altered hers quite drastically.  Here, no effort is made at a graded tax structure and the man earning £15 to £20 a week pays proportionately as much in taxation as does the man earning £80 or £100 a week.  This Budget is a fraud. It was designed to dupe the people into thinking we now have normal conditions.  The Minister will not succeed in his object because events will ultimately overtake him and he will not be able to delude the public.</P>
    <P>I understood the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement was due for review this year.  So far as I know there have been no meetings and no effort has been made by the Government to have such a review.  That agreement is affecting the country adversely.  What has happened to the discussions that were to take place when it was found the agreement was not working equitably?  There should be urgent discussions and the Government <Col N="1050" /> should take steps immediately to ensure we do not suffer further as a result of that agreement.  Britain has got more and more of our domestic market.  Her imports are increasing in value and our trade gap with the United Kingdom now stands at £55.7 million.  That is a sizeable sum.  When the agreement was first made we had a credit balance with Britain.  The trade gap seems to be very different now.</P>
    <P>It was stated that the purpose of decimalisation was to prepare us for entry into the Common Market.  I think February 15th and decimalisation was a psychological confidence trick that was perpetrated on the public.  The public were deluded into thinking that prices had actually dropped.  In the phasing out stages of the old currency, changes took place so quickly that price increases took place before people were aware of what was happening. The dual currency combination has gone and now we do not know where we are.  This &ldquo;new penny trick&rdquo; as I would call it has been played on us.  The opportunity was availed of by manufacturers.  They employed every sort of ruse to increase prices, if not directly then indirectly by changing quantity, quality or presentation. Decimalisation Day was a glorious opportunity for them to take advantage of the public.  The Minister may not realise this but it was the poor person who was confused&mdash;the person on the fixed income, the pensioner, the disabled person.  This was the &ldquo;new penny trick&rdquo;.  They did not know what was happening.  The psychological effect was nice.  We actually thought for a while there was a reduction in prices.  I do not care what the purpose of it was, it was a trick that was played on the public and we have now learned the effects of it on the cost of living.  It would be interesting to see by how much exactly the cost of living has gone up since Decimalisation Day.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of this was to gear us for the Common Market.  From the industrial point of view, I do not think there is anything to be gained from our joining the Common Market. We will be swept aside if and when we join.  I have been reading the <i>Irish <Col N="1051" /> Banking Review</i> and even they admit that in industry the outlook for this country can be bad.  They refer to the survey entitled &ldquo;The Prospects of Irish Industry in Free Trade Conditions&rdquo;, conducted by the Committee on Industrial Organisation and by the Departments of Agriculture and Industry and Commerce.  They surveyed 54 industries, or 70 per cent of the total employment, and they said there will be a net decline in employment of approximately 10,000 people in all manufacturing industries as a result of free trade.  We will have 10,000 more people unemployed if we enter the Common Market. Our unemployment figure is high enough already; and try what ruse they will, abolishing the dole or otherwise, they will not disguise the fact that we have an unemployment figure of over 70,000 at the moment.  If this is to be increased by an extra 10,000 then the outlook for this country is really bad under free trade conditions.</P>
    <P>It would be well for Fine Gael to look at this problem and see what chance we have in the Common Market.  They talk about mobility of labour and retraining.  I think we will have a new set of workers&mdash;we will have the &ldquo;Ruhral&rdquo; workers, and I mean the workers on the Ruhr.  It is all right when there is unemployment here and people can take the boat to Britain, but it is a completely different situation if we talk about asking our people, people who are thrown on the slag heap, people who have been declared redundant under these new conditions, to work in Germany, France or any of the Continental countries. This is a very serious matter.  It is not good enough to say that they will be retrained or that there is mobility of labour or opportunities elsewhere. This is all right for Common Market countries in the Continent of Europe but I do not think it is good enough for the people of this island who would be completely lost in European countries with the disruption of their lives and their homes and the lives and homes of their children.  It would be completely wrong.  I would compare Ireland with Southern Italy, which is a depressed area.  In terms of the Common Market Ireland is a depressed area.</P>

      <P>I am just referring to it in the context of employment.  The Budget has made no provision for employment.  It is wrong of the Government to say our economy is geared to entering the Common Market.  The Minister has said that it is a real possibility that we will be in the Common Market within 18 months.  Eighteen months is a very short time.  Remember, it is over a year now since we had the dismissal of the Ministers.  In 18 months we may be all trying to learn foreign languages.  I do not think it will be compulsory Irish; it will be compulsory French and German.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in introducing a holding Budget, just to keep things right, has damaged the whole economy.  He has allowed no room for expansion of the economy.  His Budget called for no imagination, no vision, no drive, no energy, nothing on the part of the Minister for Finance.  I do not think he has done anything.  All he has done is to adjust, and barely that, the allowances to the disabled, the aged, the unemployed and the widows, to cope with the increase in the cost of living. That is no credit to a Minister for Finance.  He has not tried to alter the system.  He has done nothing about it. There are 70,000 people unemployed. I was told about the auctioneer who said on television on Saturday night that there are seven factories about to close down and their workers going to become redundant.  It is a very serious matter if people have this information, and obviously they have when they make statements like that.  I wonder if the trade unions have been notified of this.  I think we should ask a person who claims to have this inside information about the collapse of seven industries the names of those industries so that something can be done about it. We have seen pathetic efforts made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce when closures took place, even without his knowledge.  He admitted <Col N="1053" /> in the Dáil about the Goodbody factory in Clara, Offaly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Would the Ceann Comhairle not think it important to discuss employment on the Budget?  I am talking about the Budget not being one which will allow for economic expansion.  It is far from that.  It will only help to depress the economy so rapidly that unemployment will be the outcome.  I submit, therefore, that it is very relevant to discuss unemployment which will be the outcome of the provisions of this Budget which contains nothing that will promote expansion. There was need for economic expansion to try to absorb some of the 70,000 unemployed.  This is what I am blaming the Minister for.  Someone brought to my attention that in 1961, or sometime around then, there was a march in O'Connell Street and a sit-down on O'Connell Bridge because there were 60,000 unemployed.  Now when we have 70,000 unemployed nobody is doing anything about it.</P>

      <P>It is a pity no plans were made in this Budget to increase employment.  At the rate we are going, before we enter the Common Market I have no hesitation in saying there will be at least 75,000 unemployed.  That is no exaggeration.  Therefore, if we get into the EEC we will have more than 100,000 unemployed.  I only hope that for our sake Britain will not succeed in her application.  We can see the mounting pressure in Britain against membership of the Common Market. There is every sign the British are not so anxious any more.  We cannot go on dreaming that if we get into the EEC everything will be all right.  We must think and talk about solving our own unemployment problems at home instead of trying to solve them in far off lands.  Perhaps the Government realise that the US are cutting down on our emigrant quota, that the opportunities for employment in Britain are not what they were and that we must seek opportunities in other countries. We have a very important tourist industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It was one of our most important industries but we have done serious harm to it through our rising costs, through inflation, through taxation.  We have deterred a number of people from coming.  The attraction is not here any more.  Our cost of living is much higher than in Britain. Spiralling prices and the police state scare created by the Taoiseach's announcement on internment without trial have done untold harm to our tourist potential&mdash;that and the problem in Northern Ireland.  They have had equal effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed that the Government did not endeavour to do something about costs for tourists, some means of offering, for instance, petrol to tourists at low costs.  Nothing has been done <Col N="1055" /> and the result is that more and more hotels are being offered for sale.  In a few years time it will be disastrous for the industry.  We thought we had the tourist trade for keeps, we thought we could tax tourists as readily as our own people, but the tourists were a lot shrewder than we took them for.</P>
    <P>Another matter which damaged the tourist trade was the manner in which even reputable hotels treated tourists. Where it was understood that they must seek permission from the prices section of the Department of Industry and Commerce before they could increase prices, I have seen them by devious ways altering menus to get around the need for permission from the Department. They resorted to the cheap trick of altering menus.  It is a disgrace they should have been allowed to do this. Apparently they did not realise the responsibility they had.  They only harmed themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor has been vindicated in the action he took on the question of the dole.  To get the Taoiseach to go down to his constituency was quite an achievement.  The action they took in this respect was a wrong move on the part of the Government, prompted by the Minister for Finance. He, in his capacity as a Deputy in Dublin North Central, came across a few individual cases of people defrauding the State by drawing the dole when they should not have been doing so.  He is in a constituency in which isolated cases occur.  Therefore, he thought he should try to abolish it altogether.  This marvellous idea of his was presented to the Taoiseach.  The Minister thought that by getting rid of the dole he would save £1½ million.  Perhaps at any other time it might have been possible to do that but nowadays we are seeing more and more factories closing.  There is an increase in the number of unemployed. As I understand it, in the country because of increased mechanisation, fewer and fewer farm labourers are required.  These are the people who qualified for the dole.  The Minister deprived them of it.</P>
    <P>There is also in our society a high proportion of people who are unemployable. They cannot be classified <Col N="1056" /> as mentally retarded or physically disabled. They are just simply unemployable. They are border line cases.  If we had a proper screening procedure we might be able to classify them as physically or mentally disabled.  Unfortunately we have not got that procedure. They have been affected by the Minister's action.  I do not think that the slight concession which he was forced to give, by the brave and laudable action, if I may say so, of a few Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party, is sufficient because there are some people under the age of 50 years who are unemployable.</P>
    <P>The whole situation was bungled dreadfully.  It could not be covered up with a pack of lies, which is what we heard from them in an effort to cover up a real tactical blunder on their part. The Minister may well be remembered as &ldquo;Colley, the bungler&rdquo;.  His record as Minister for Finance is not the best. It is a record of errors and mistakes. He adopted an intransigent stand but he was forced to give in because the Taoiseach knew he was wrong.  With his record I do not think he is a fit person to be Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I have a letter here from a man in County Leitrim.  He said: &ldquo;I am among a number of men who have been cut off the dole.  As you see I live in the West of Ireland.  To get work I would have to leave here and go to Dublin.  You might say why not, only I have to stay with my widowed mother who is an invalid as there is no one else to provide for her or mind her.&rdquo;  He is just one of a number of victims of this decision.  The most defenceless in our community are affected by it.  These are the people the Minister decided to penalise and victimise&mdash;and to use their money to try to bolster up the economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister boasts of the fact that he has a social conscience and therefore it is strange that he should pick on this section of the community and ignore the parasites, the land grabbers, the speculators and the people who are constantly defrauding the Exchequer. No attempt was made to catch up with those evaders.  Surely he could have got that £1½ million from them.  Why did he not introduce a graded form of <Col N="1057" /> taxation that might bring in extra money from people who can afford it? I do not think any of us would have objected if some form of graded taxation had been introduced.  We would have been quite happy about that.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Seán Moore who said we have a free enterprise system here and that 95 per cent of industry in Sweden is privately owned. He should find out about the co-operatives as they exist in Sweden.  Their history is fascinating.  They even set up a factory to make bulbs when an international cartel&mdash;I think it was the Osram group and General Electric of America&mdash;tried to increase prices.  The Swedes decided to operate on a co-operative basis.  They did the same in the rubber industry.  Rubber boots are very important in Sweden.  Deputy Moore should read up how industries were started in Sweden by co-operative groups.  The managing directors earn no more than the ordinary workers.  I advise him to read up on this subject.</P>
    <P>We have a free enterprise society here, too much so I am afraid.  It is depressing to think that the profit from our mines, which could have provided £250 million in revenue for the State, was allowed to go out of the country. It is a tragedy that this should have happened.  I have no hesitation in blaming the inter-Party Government equally for this because they introduced the necessary legislation and allowed our mines to be exploited by private interests. I was interested in the case history of Tynagh.  Money could have come into the economy which would have helped us.  They boast about all the employment they provide in Tynagh. Considering what the Government have spent foolishly, £23 million is not a lot of money.  It was ludicrous to permit Potez to set up a factory here to build airplanes which were out-of-date from the very beginning.  It is a disgrace that we wasted £2½ million on that.  We have mines which could have provided a considerable amount of revenue but the money was allowed to go out of the country.  All we got in return was the employment of a certain number of people.  We got no money from them.</P>

      <P>They should be sending their employees around in Mercedes cars at the rate they collect profits.  They say this is a speculative business.  It is, and we have allowed the speculators in.  This money should have been used to bolster up the economy, but it was allowed to pass into the hands of these foreigners. They invested £23 million but their returns have been fantastic.  I know they are good employers.  I do not doubt that, but we are entitled to more from our mines than just employment. It is not good enough to say: &ldquo;We will employ your men, but we will take out all the profits.&rdquo;  Then they say the price of metals is falling on the European market.  As far as I know the price of metals is going up and up and up and up.  It was a very small investment for what will ultimately come out of this country.  It is ironic that they will start paying tax as soon as the mines are closed and they have gone. Those are the concessions we have provided for these foreigners.  We have given all the wealth of this country into their hands and all we have got back is the concession that they will employ our people.  This is one time when we stand idly by and watch them milking this country.</P>
      <P>I do not think we can be proud of what we have done in allowing this natural wealth to pass into the hands of foreigners.  All the time we are dreaming: we bring in Potez to build planes for us.  We are the suckers, the fools, as we were in regard to Shanahan's Stamps when we allowed Singer in and out.  They are all the same.  They take us for suckers and then abscond from the country.</P>

We learned in the Orphanage that there was wealth in our mines.  The first thing that should occur to a government is that if foreigners want to come in there is something in it.  They do not come in for love of us; they <Col N="1061" /> come in for what they can get out of the country.</P>
      <P>I am looking at this matter in the context of what it could have provided by way of money to the economy, money by way of revenue to the Government which could have been spent on housing, more industries and things like that.  I say: import the expertise; get the skilled people in here by all means.  There are many miners over in Canada who are looking for employment and those are the people we should have brought in.  The Government did not think of that.  The Government lack imagination, lack vision and drive.  If ever a country was duped we were by the Potez people.

Let us say that the Minister's outlook is very distorted.  If the Minister had his priorities right he might understand that a standstill Budget will not save the fortunes of Fianna Fáil.  I do not think this Budget will do anything for the Minister's party but, rather, the country will suffer in the meantime and that is the great danger.  The Minister should have tried to create opportunities for employment but he did not do so.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy cannot see the light, I give up so far as he is concerned, but I am sorry for him.  It is interesting to note that the Minister took insurance against an election, but he is also sitting down to prepare his Autumn Budget in the event of there not being an election before then.</P>
      <P>Our employment problem is a very serious one.  I was astonished to read this morning that there is the prospect of a further 10,000 people becoming unemployed in this country should we enter EEC.  That is a depressing thought.  I am concerned that we should have our Minister for Foreign Affairs negotiating for membership of the Community when he may be called back at any time because of the dissension within his party.  Whether we like it or not, we must realise that we are not yet ready for membership of the Community and it will be a long time yet before we can be ready. Therefore, our Ministers have no right to say to the other member countries that we are ready.</P>
      <P>I would have thought that we should have spent more money on industries such as fishing.  It is annoying to see so much imported canned fish on sale in our stores when we ourselves should have fish canning factories around our coasts.  There are opportunities for tremendous employment in this industry.  I am sure that up to 10,000 people could have been employed in this industry alone and we should be exporting canned fish to countries all over Europe and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to foreign industries setting up here, the Government should make it a condition that they themselves have a place on the board of any such company so that they would be aware of what was happening.  In fact it has not been made a precondition that these foreign industrialists employ trade union labour.  This is a disgrace and is the cause of a lot of trouble in this country.  Having heard how an American company was operating in Waterford, I would regard them as being undesirable to have in any country, let alone give them grants or permit them to set up here.  I remember hearing the managing director <Col N="1066" /> of the company say that when a worker joined the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union, and came in as a shop steward to speak to him, the managing director produced a book of rules, told the worker that under no circumstances must he leave his machine and that, if he did not return to it, he would be fired.  He read the relevant passage three times and then brought in a witness.  This firm had been operating a non-union house in the States and applied these rules. The managing director said that they had not been told they must employ trade union labour in this country.  We should insist on this condition before these people are given permission to set up here.  I should like to hear what the Minister's views are on this.</P>
    <P>We should be much more selective in giving grants.  The European Printing Corporation at Coolock got a grant and an 11-acre site but the owner then sold out and went away.  It was believed that the provision of the grant actually increased the value of the firm so that man literally collected his grant and walked out.  I wonder if we have any redress in matters such as that.</P>
    <P>In so far as strikes are concerned, the past year has been a bad one, perhaps the worst for the past decade. These strikes were bad in themselves and they were bad also in the way in which they affected the economy.  The reason for them can be attributed to the very poor management-worker relationship that exists in this country. Unfortunately, many industrialists fail to realise that workers have rights and that they must have a say.  I think our proposals for an industrial democracy would make very good reading for the Minister and his colleagues.  Would he like to smirk and snigger at it or jibe at us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Now <Col N="1067" /> they realise that the worker has more than a say.  He produces the goods and he cannot be pushed around as has been done for decades.  I should like Deputy Dowling to say what he said to the people in the Fiat factory because it is interesting.  The sooner we realise that we have to train and educate management&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;towards workers is such that the workers should not demand anything.  Harmony in industry is the most vital thing this country needs because if we are going to be bogged down by strikes the economy will suffer.  We must get at the root cause of the strikes.  This is the most important thing facing us.  Our record for the past year has been deplorable. We are highest in the European league for strikes.  This is a serious matter and not a matter for sneering or sniggering.  We have to educate management that workers must be respected and that their point of view must be listened to.  If this were done there would be no need for strikes. There should be worker-management committees in every factory.  If there was more industrial harmony in industry the economy would benefit.  I am appalled that we let one strike after another pass by without investigating their causes.  We pretend to investigate the causes but we never had a proper investigation into what has gone wrong in the relationships between management and workers.  There is something radically wrong with a system whereby we are at the top of the list for strikes. <Col N="1068" /> Management should always be prepared to listen to workers.  I have acted as mediator in a number of disputes and I found that where the management did listen to the workers and were prepared to sit down and talk with them industrial harmony resulted.  If we could encourage this and if we could bring management to the shop floor so that there would be greater understanding between the two sides and if we had industrial democracy, then we would have industrial harmony.  I should like the Government to make a serious effort in this regard.  There is no use saying that strikes are bad unless we can do something to solve them.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the trade unions have been irresponsible in this matter. They have been very responsible.  The other day I paid tribute to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for their most statesmanlike approach to this whole problem.  It went unnoticed that they had intervened in the ESB strike and in the teachers' strike.  This is a measure of the degree of responsibility among trade unionists.  They do not want strikes or this constant problem with management.  They want industrial harmony but they want to safeguard the rights of the workers and ensure that they get a proper share of the profits.  This is most important.</P>

      <P>It was a case of &ldquo;while Rome burned Nero fiddled&rdquo;. That is what happened.  The Ministers for Finance and Labour were like Nero when they fiddled while this country was in a state of economic and industrial chaos.  Again, we have this pretence about &ldquo;buy Irish&rdquo;.  The slogan is &ldquo;Put your money where your job is&rdquo;.  You must give example to the people and it is very difficult for workers, when they read that a semi-State body have purchased foreign goods instead of Irish goods, purchased <Col N="1069" /> goods from Japan or such places where they do not employ proper trade union labour, to follow what the Government say they must do when the Government do not give the example.  The Minister for Health, deputising for the Minister for Transport and Power, tried to answer a question from a Fine Gael Deputy about the purchase of cutlery.  He said that he was not going to ask the particular State body to buy the Irish goods when the price was so much higher.  I do not think that we should say that we will buy in Communist China because the goods are too expensive here.  They do not employ the same labour nor do they pay them a proper living wage there and why should we encourage them? Whoever ordered these goods from Japan or China should have been taken to task because they should have ordered Irish goods.  If we have to encourage our people to buy Irish, to put their money where their job is, we have got to see that the Government and Government agencies do the same. Recently a company which manufactures incinerators got in touch with me.  They had been asked to quote for incinerators for St. Kevin's Hospital. Their labour is Irish and all the materials are made in Ireland.  They quoted.  They knew that their quotation was smaller than the quotation from a company which imports the incinerators from Britain but despite that they did not even get an acknowledgment for their quotation and they did not get the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can we encourage Irish industry if we boost foreign products?  There seems to be some sort of status symbol about what we get abroad and the idea that a thing cannot be good if it is Irish.  This seems to be the prevailing attitude of semi-State bodies, health boards and others.  It would be wrong if this were to continue.  It is futile to have advertisements such as &ldquo;Put your money where your job is&rdquo;.  I know what the Irishman will tell them if this trend is continued by semi-State bodies who should be setting good example by buying Irish goods.  You cannot carry on fooling the people and buying abroad.  Whether an article came from China or Japan it was wrong to buy it, because they pay their workers in <Col N="1070" /> pennies and treat them as slaves.</P>
    <P>As Irish people it is vital to us to buy Irish.  Britain now has 56½ per cent of the Irish domestic market for her goods and it is vital to intensify the &ldquo;buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  We are precluded from giving so many incentives to Irish industries under the Free Trade Area Agreement that at all costs we should be encouraging people to &ldquo;buy Irish&rdquo; and eliminate the myth that because something is foreign it must be good.  There should be an all-out campaign, not confined to Irish week.</P>
    <P>I once lived in an American town where there was a factory making electrical goods and all the people in that town made sure that they bought electrical goods from that factory because they realised their jobs were at stake. Because there was a Westinghouse factory in the town the people bought only Westinghouse products.  This was a town of about 69,000 people.  They realised that if they did not support the local products the factory might be removed elsewhere.  We should think like this.  As regards the statement of the Minister for Health that he is not going to be forced&mdash;if he did not say it that way, that is what it amounts to&mdash;to buy Irish goods just because they were Irish, I would agree if he were not talking about goods from Japan or China.  It is not right to compare prices of goods from those countries with prices here.  According to the latest figures I have seen our balance of payments with Japan is not very good and where possible we should be discouraging people from buying their goods, especially when similar goods are made here.</P>
    <P>In the Budget the Minister said it is proposed to introduce compulsory health insurance from which he expected to raise £2 million in the current financial year.  He offers the bribe that people in the middle income group paying compulsory health insurance will not be burdened with the cost of hospitalisation.  Hospitalisation costs amount to £500,000 to £750,000 in the year.  He will collect £2 million in the present year and £3 million in the normal year.  Will the difference be applied in relieving the burden of <Col N="1071" /> health costs on the rates or will this be another form of taxation?  The Minister did not elaborate and I am anxious to know what is intended.  It is the Minister for Finance who will be applying it and the Minister for Health who will be bringing in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Many workers have complained, perhaps justifiably, that there is no concession to those working overtime. It should be possible to devise some means of reducing taxation for those working overtime.  Taxation is a disincentive and if we are to improve output and productivity, improve our economic position and increase our exports, we must provide for reduced taxation of overtime and so encourage people to work overtime, something it is now very difficult to get them to do because of the taxation rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would define overtime as any work done over and above the normal 40-hour week.  The worker is as much entitled to his rest as is the employer.  The worker may not take holidays in the Canaries or the Riviera but if he only goes to <i>La Muralla del Toro,</i> the Bull Wall, he is still entitled to holidays and to his rest period.  I realise that a system of reduced taxation for overtime could be open to abuse but it should be possible to devise a satisfactory system and to encourage workers to work overtime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not delay the House unnecessarily except to say that we have seen no innovations in this Budget.  It is a very poor effort on the part of the Minister for Finance.  I do not agree with those who say that he has done a lot for the pensioners and the disabled. I do not think he has done enough and I shall always say that. Taking into account the increase in the cost of living, what he has given them is insufficient.  These people are not able to keep pace with the cost of living.  It is no exaggeration to say that many people in the country are suffering from malnutrition.  I wonder if the Minister, or his Parliamentary Secretary, has ever worked with those concerned with meals on wheels.  It is very <Col N="1072" /> depressing to see some of the old people who live alone and who have no incentive to prepare their own meals, and who are barely existing.</P>
    <P>Poverty and malnutrition are big problems among these people.  I have worked with the Meals on Wheels organisation and it is not a nice sight to see people lying in absolute poverty. People living at a high level in society sometimes forget that there are people living in poverty.  Some prominent persons have said we are living in an age of affluence, but widows, disabled persons, unemployed persons and deserted wives&mdash;I was talking to one last Sunday who has ten children the eldest of whom is 14&mdash;are the victims of inflation. It is not good enough for the Government merely to increase social welfare benefits; they should go one step better and meet the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>We should decide to provide these increases and then decide whom we will tax to pay for them.  We seem to get our priorities wrong and decide first what tax we can get and second how we can spread that around.  It is ludicrous to say that by giving extra benefits we are creating inflation because the extra money which these people have to spend is negligible.  The Government would not be creating inflation by improving the lot of these people.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the attitude of some people that if someone else gets an increase they should get one too. I do not think any distinction should be made between contributory and non-contributory pensioners.  Non-contributory pensioners should be entitled to the same increases as contributory pensioners, because they all have to cope with the ever-increasing cost of living.  I should like to see us arrive at the situation where all pensioners could be treated as though they were contributory pensioners, but at the rate factories are closing and workers are discovering that their insurance contributions have not been paid by their former employers we are going to get more and more non-contributory pensioners.</P>
    <P>The public are well aware that this Budget was brought in to help the <Col N="1073" /> Government over a crisis.  This is exactly what is in the minds of every Fianna Fáil Deputy.  They know this Budget is to help the Taoiseach and his Cabinet over a crisis.  They are in a dilemma, hoping they will not be forced to go to the country, but feeling sure they will be and they think this Budget will save them.  Not even the best of budgets can save a government divided among themselves, and whether they are new Republican, Republican or pseudo-Republican they will have to declare themselves shortly.  The people will then be given an opportunity to show how they feel and it should be possible for Parliament to provide an effective alternative. We would get a Government with fresh ideas, a Government which could agree on a common programme for health, social welfare and housing would be a good government.  A change in government would eliminate the terrible apathy which exists at the present time.</P>
    <P>The sooner the people get an opportunity of declaring in the ballot box their lack of confidence in the present Government, the better.  The Fianna Fáil Government have tried to condition the people into believing&mdash;and they have succeeded for 14 years&mdash;that there is no alternative.  A reconditioning must take place.  The onus is on the press and the communications media to tell the people that there is an alternative. In the interests of democracy there must be an alternative to this Government and the sooner we all wake up to that fact the better.  For too long Fianna Fáil have feasted on the idea that there is no alternative.  The people have been deluded into thinking that Fianna Fáil have the divine right to rule by virtue of the fact that there is no alternative Government.  If the Opposition make it clear there is an alternative Government the people will decide to put Fianna Fáil out.  It would do Fianna Fáil good to solve their problems in Opposition.  I should like to see them in Opposition for a long time. There would be no need for them to try to solve their problems quickly if they were in Opposition.  I would give them ten to 15 years to solve their problems.</P>

    <P>I remember some years ago reading a description of Ireland in a digest. Ireland was described as a poverty-stricken country where one had to be very careful crossing the road because one could so easily be hit by a new motor car.  I think that describes Ireland quite accurately.  We have our problems.  We have increasing unemployment. We know this but we do not panic.  The country is not bankrupt. We are concerned to maintain employment as best we can.  Factories are closing down but they are closing down <Col N="1076" /> in other countries also.  Britain has her problems.  She has the highest rate of unemployment since before the war. West Germany, which is recognised as one of the fastest growing economies in Western Europe, had a cost of living increase in the period September to April of this year of 18 per cent.  The trend is worldwide.  Deputy Dr. O'Donovan may be amused by my economic theories.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear my theory first. While wages and costs of production go up, this is no harm provided we do not pass out the rate of increase in other countries.  Britain is our biggest market and I rejoice every time I see a big round of increases in Britain because I realise that once again we are in a competitive position.  That is why I am very nervous when I see unrealistic claims made here.</P>
      <P>The miracle always seems to be why Fianna Fáil are elected time after time, despite all the dissatisfaction we are told is rife.  I have come to the conclusion that the secret of our success is the fact that the voter is primarily concerned with one thing.  Is he working; does he have a good job; is he getting good wages; under whom is his job likely to continue?  The worker decides: under Fianna Fáil.  Maybe it is a case of &ldquo;the devil you know&rdquo;. The Opposition may find this discouraging, but this is the way people argue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Minister's Budget Statement not so many workers who left the land have been absorbed into industry this year.  We know the reason why.  In the USA, which is now getting over its recession, money is becoming freer for investment abroad.  About 16 per cent of all the industries which have come in here in the last decade have been American industries.  They have brought with them new skills and they have provided good employment. It irritates me to hear people insult these Americans who have come in here to provide employment for our people.  This is one of the last countries in Europe in which there is an availability of intelligent workers.  That is <Col N="1077" /> one of the greatest assets we have. Industries elsewhere are starved of such workers.  We all know about the numbers who have returned from Britain in the last ten years to take up jobs in factories here.</P>
    <P>I get depressed when I hear people talking in a manner which indicates they have no confidence in our people in a competitive world.  Fianna Fáil have always believed our people are capable of meeting any competition and we have made more progress in the last ten years than we did in the previous 100 years.  Competition is stiffening but we will win out.  We are told factories are closing down.  Those which are closing down were for the most part factories built for the export market.  Many of these are finding their costs of production outweighing the advantages they had initially.  That is why we must watch costs.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with mining. There is a great deal of talk about mining by people who know nothing about mining and the speculation involved in mining.  We hear of the mining share that is a great success but we do not hear so often of the mining share that is a dead loss, on which somebody's small savings are gone.  If we had spent £23 million exploring for minerals here and if we had not succeeded in finding any, Potez would not have been very much on Deputy O'Connell's mind.  The cost of exploration is phenomenal; the chances of success are minimal.  If you hit it lucky you are in but if you do not it can be disastrous for many people who perhaps have their life savings invested in it.</P>
    <P>Anyone who would suggest that a Government should put taxpayers' money into a speculative venture is grossly irresponsible and to my mind has a cheek to suggest that his party would be a responsible government. These are irresponsible statements. People come into this House and make irresponsible statements which they have not researched.  We were told about incinerators, that the Irish one was cheaper and it was not accepted. If I had heard that I would have made inquiries into it.  I would have gone to the various parties and made an investigation <Col N="1078" /> instead of saving it to throw out in this House as a political gimmick. I am quite satisfied that if there was anything to this Deputy O'Connell would have had a question down to the Minister for Industry and Commerce already about it.  If it happened very recently no doubt he will table a question and a thorough investigation will be carried out.  I am sure it will be found that there was some reason and if not it will be put to rights.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell blames the Government for other people's cheating. He talked about the change to decimalisation and how the shops are overcharging even though there is an Act which restricts prices.  When the odd shopkeeper overcharges and gets away with it the Government are blamed and it is called the &ldquo;penny confidence trick&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Everyone attacks the turnover tax. It now brings in somewhere in the region of £40 million.</P>

      <P>What is the alternative to the turnover tax?  The more money you have to spend the more tax you pay.  Every tourist who visits this country pays turnover tax.  We are told that we are pricing ourselves out of the tourist market.  It is the same when the Minister puts tax on the pint of beer or on cigarettes.</P>

      <P>I believe that when the Minister sees that the revenue is considerably up on a particular item he knows that this can take it.  The revenue from beer this year must have been up very considerably because it allowed for a small increase.  The revenue from cigarettes obviously is down.  If the Minister had put an increase on cigarettes I would have paid a tribute to those patriotic cigarette smokers who are literally giving their lives for Ireland.  However, he did not touch them.  The revenue there is down this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We have all read in the newspapers of the gigantic sums of money still being paid for certain pubs. There is a lot of money around the place.  Beer, we are told, is getting too expensive.  The man who owns that big pub in Ballymun will tell Deputies, I am sure, if they ask him confidentially what his turnover on pints is on a Friday or Saturday night.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell did mention something in which I have been interested for some years.  It is the question of categorising, if possible, what are known as the unemployables.  How many of the people on the list of unemployed have been unemployed for a period longer than, say, a year or two years?  How many of them are disabled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The disabled were taken out years ago by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are forms of disability other than physical disability and people who have not been in a job for two years have very little confidence about holding a job.  I would hope to see some sort of rehabilitation place for people who have been unemployed for long periods so that they could regain a certain amount of confidence. After a period of one or two years out of work one loses confidence. It is not that the urge to work leaves him or that he becomes lazy.  I am only a layman but I am sure Deputy Browne could comment on that if he would care to.</P>
      <P>Sometimes we engage in hypocrisy. How many times have I heard people talk about able-bodied people on the dole who should be working and who are too lazy to find work?  There are always complaints being made about these people living off the dole and the hardworking wage earners paying in taxes for it.  Then when the Government stop the dole in the rural areas for people under 50 there is an almighty outcry.  Some of us would want to examine our consciences in relation to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> Deputy O'Connell dealt with another point with which I agree.  It is the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; exhortation.  It is a shame we have to appeal to Irish people to buy Irish, particularly when we know the importance of keeping down imports.  We could keep down imports considerably if Irish people would ask for Irish goods.  Take Italian shoes.  Irish shoes are as good as Italian shoes.  The only difference is the price. Some people like to pay £8 or £9 for imported shoes, there being this snob value attached to the imported article.</P>
    <P>We should try to direct people's minds again to the importance and the benefit of buying Irish goods.  It would be a good investment to spend a little money on producing little notices here and there, not just hanging behind the door of a shop where nobody can see them.  When shopkeepers were being lectured on decimalisation it seems a great pity they were not reminded at the same time &ldquo;Sell Irish if you can&rdquo;.  We will be going into the metric system in 1973 and perhaps it is a good idea to consider such an exhortation then.  On every opportunity let us try to persuade our people to buy Irish goods, particularly when we can say that they are as good as any in the world.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by stating that I am very pleased with the way in which the Minister has spread the money which was available.  Budgets during the last few years have shown this small but important social conscience: &ldquo;We should like to do more for you. This is the best we can do at the moment.&rdquo;  The increase in the old age contributory pension is, percentagewise, in excess of any increase in the cost of living.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few observations on the Budget and on what some speakers and some media have said about it.  This is a very ordinary Budget.  One always hopes that a Budget will have something which would have not only social implications but economic results which would increase the volume of business and help employment.  From that point of view, this Budget has been a very poor one.  We all know the ills that the body politic is suffering from, some of them economic, some of them political.  This Budget has done very little to help that situation.</P>
      <P>We in this part of Ireland have one of the highest tax rates in the world and this country is beginning to show to a really alarming degree the effect that taxation is having on the ordinary businessman.  I am talking about the ordinary small business, not the very large ones&mdash;those that perhaps were public companies, some of them private businesses, that have not access to overseas markets in which to sell their products, those that have not access to the financial sources available to big international companies.  Those businesses, be they engaged in the retail or the manufacturing trade, are finding to an increasing degree that the high rate of taxation is taking away from them all or nearly all their profits, leaving them an insufficient amount to plough back into their businesses for necessary repairs to plant and machinery, improvement to buildings or whatever it may be.  Due to the cost of goods and services, every article a business buys or manufactures is costing more than it was this time last year, and even more than it cost two or three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of living is going up.  I do not know the exact figure but anybody who pays household accounts or has to find the money for them&mdash;and we all have to do this&mdash;finds that it takes an increasingly larger amount to buy the same goods.  Irish firms are finding it increasingly difficult to carry on.  There is a picture of amalgamation in some cases, and firms going out of business and closing down.  The Government should realise that.  Our friends in the Labour Party sometimes <Col N="1084" /> appear to think that every business is a very large one, making inordinate profits wrung from the inhabitants of this country, and that that money is being spent on trips to the Canaries or in going around in Mercedes or any other expensive make of car.</P>
    <P>In point of fact, with taxation and with the fall in the value of money, the average business today is finding it increasingly difficult to finance its continuance. Again and again business organisations of various sorts have pointed this out to the Government and have said: &ldquo;In industry and in business generally we are paying a rate of taxation which we cannot afford.&rdquo;  I listened to Deputies speaking here for many years&mdash;and before that I read about it&mdash;about what we would do when Ireland was free of England and how we would improve this, that and the other thing.  Certainly there have been improvements since we achieved self-government.  I have noticed that when we look across the water we do not always take the best that England or the Continent has to offer.  Sometimes we tend to follow the English markets irrespective of whether they suit our needs.</P>
    <P>England is one of the most highly industrialised countries in the world and for many years was the most highly industrialised country.  Naturally England has a taxation structure which suits a very highly industrialised country.  We are predominantly an agricultural country.  Even though the pattern has been in favour of the industrial income being greater than the agricultural income, nevertheless an overwhelming number of our inhabitants are farmers or are connected with the land.  The system of taxation which England, with her vast industrial wealth and vast industrial layout generally, can carry cannot be carried by us in this country.</P>
    <P>Some steps in that regard were taken when the turnover tax was brought in. I do not like the turnover tax.  It makes the business community free tax gatherers for the Government.  They certainly do not get paid for it and they do not get any thanks either.  At least the turnover tax does not tax the business community to the exclusion of other sections.  I am not trying to <Col N="1085" /> talk about the towns versus the country but it is a fact that taxation is bearing very heavily on the industrial community and, with the fall in the value of money, they are finding it very difficult to carry on.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell said that he would like to see reduced taxation for overtime. That sounds very well.  I asked him how he would define &ldquo;overtime&rdquo; and he said it was anything over a 40-hour week.  In the case of doctors and self-employed persons who by the nature of their employment cannot work a fixed pattern of hours&mdash;and there are many such people&mdash;how do you decide at what point they start to work overtime?  You would be placing people who can prove they work overtime in a more favourable position than those who could not prove at what point their overtime began. This sort of thing will not work.</P>
    <P>I mention these things because we suffer from economic ills.  Obviously we on this side of the House and the Labour Party do not belong to the Fianna Fáil Party.  If we want to settle our economic ills there is no point in blaming the Government for things which are not their fault.  There are many things which are their fault and for which we can blame them.  There is no point in saying that the Government should reduce taxation on overtime when it seems to me that this would be physically impossible.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is of vital importance today is the question of management and labour.  It is manifestly absurd for anyone who is speaking from a Left point of view or from a Labour point of view to say that all strikes are caused by management. They are not.  It is equally false to say that all strikes are caused by labour.  They are not. Nowadays the differences between management and labour are so subtle that every strike, dispute or lockout&mdash;and sometimes great heat is engendered as to whether a dispute should be called a strike or a lockout or merely a dispute&mdash;has to be judged on its merits.  Are we ever going to be able to settle these very delicate problems?</P>
    <P>At times it is quite obvious that the <Col N="1086" /> trade unions themselves have lost control of some of their members.  Sometimes a dispute or strike may be caused by tactlessness on the part of management&mdash;perhaps &ldquo;management&rdquo; would be a misnomer&mdash;or by one person who happens to be in a managerial position. When speaking in here, in order to be helpful in this grave situation, there is no use saying that the trouble is caused entirely by management.  I know of several instances where management was not at fault, but equally I know of instances where management was at fault.  We need more patience and understanding.  The situation can be compared with a matrimonial dispute. In such a dispute no outsider can ever know where the real blame lies.  In many cases economic circumstances have caused the trouble.  In a Budget speech one can only say that we have had too many strikes and disputes.  I use the word &ldquo;strike&rdquo; as an ordinary term and not in any loaded sense.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe said that we have had a good record this year.  We have had an appalling record over the past year.  We had a terrible bank dispute which went on for months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot blame the Government for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not blaming the Government for it.  I have already said so.  There was a cement strike also.  The Government should have done something about the bank dispute and should have taken action to settle it.  Not being in Government myself, I cannot say at what point exactly something could have been done.  Ten years ago when I was Lord Mayor of Dublin there was a strike in this city.  I brought both sides into the Mansion House and I set with them for days thinking that I would tire them out.  I did and I got a settlement.  I did not realise that I myself was twice as tired as they were.  I nearly collapsed afterwards.  I would not let them out of the Mansion House until they settled the strike to the satisfaction of both sides.   The Government should have done something about the bank strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cement strike went on for a very long time.  Pressure should have been brought to bear on all sides.  I do not <Col N="1087" /> know whether a Prices and Incomes Bill is really a very feasible thing.  Some economists say that it would be a solution to the problems.  Other economists say that such a Bill might not prove as helpful as was originally thought.  Continental countries call the situation which we are suffering from in this country &ldquo;the English sickness&rdquo;. Deputy Briscoe said that he was very glad when he saw a rise in England because it meant that our industries would stand a better chance with their competitors now because the competitors would have to pay greater wage bills.  The difficulty is that reaction is felt here.  The English increases in wages lead to increases over here and <i>vice versa</i>.  I do not know how the present riproaring inflation can now be stopped.  I should like to see the Government doing more.</P>
    <P>In this Budget the Government did not lower the bank rate to individual borrowers.  The Government may argue that they tried to put a brake on inflation but what has been done is too small to make any great difference. I hope the Government will take a firm stand on inflation.  The Government are not leading the country in this economic and inflationary crisis. The country is being dragged along. We all look to the Government to lead. I am speaking here as an Irishman who wants to see the Government running the country properly.  That is more important than whether Fianna Fáil are in power or out of it.  The country must be run properly.</P>
    <P>I want to see this inflation halted if possible.  I realise, of course, that if a small country like ours buys pig iron or metal products manufactured abroad we have nothing whatever to do with the price of those metals.  If we buy foreign grain we have nothing to do with its price either.  We have either to go without it or pay the price the foreigner asks for it.  Likewise, they have nothing directly to do with the price of our cattle, our sheep or our whiskey.  It can be argued that the price of imported feeding stuffs increases the price of our cattle.</P>
    <P>One does not blame the Government for this.  It is only ignorant tub <Col N="1088" /> thumping to do so and ultimately any party who indulge in that sort of rhetoric will find themselves out and not listened to by the public.  We can, however, blame the Government very severely for not really governing the country, not controlling the economic forces to the extent to which, even in a small country like this, we can expect our Government to do.</P>
    <P>I trust the Government will do something to control inflation which can have disastrous results if it gets out of hand.  Those of us who are old enough to remember the inflation in Germany know what an impact it had on the whole world.  All of us were adversely affected.  We do not want to suffer political ills as a result of the present inflationary tide.  I warn the Government that they will be very severe and they will not be limited just to economic matters.  It will not be just a question of giving old people more money or of helping certain people.  It will be a situation in which every person and business will need help but there will be nobody there to give it.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government grasped the nettle firmly and took what steps they can to control this inflationary situation.  We must have controlled wage rises.  Increased wages have now become such a spiral that nobody knows what started the situation. Every time there is a price increase people feel they need an increase in wages and this puts the price of goods, commodities and services up also.  This is where we expect firm handling by the Government.  The people cannot themselves control this tiger of inflation. The Government must do it or we will all be in dire trouble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to get particularly enthusiastic about the Budget ritual which goes on year after year and which appears to contribute less and less to the process of wealth creation in the community.  It seems to me that it is an attempt by the Minister for Finance to take a relatively static amount of money and attempt to do a sort of loaves and fishes job on it but without having the Divine power to work a miracle.  The result is that <Col N="1089" /> there is very little change from Budget to Budget.</P>
      <P>There are in this Budget many interesting aspects&mdash;the very nominal improvements for widows, deserted wives, unmarried mothers, the old people, transport facilities for people visiting their children in hospitals and so on. If the Budget provided money at a level which would make a significant difference in the lives of those people it would, in fact, be worth while.  All the Minister has done is to draw attention to the needs of many of the socially dependent groups in society and to show that if he had the money he would really help those people.  In fact, he leaves them very little better off than before he started.</P>
      <P>The Budget speech gives the impression that the Budget is the result of a kind of consumer survey, a public relations investigation into what the public would like the Minister to do.  One cannot fault the Minister in relation to most of the things he did.  It is just that he did not do enough.  The people normally assisted in the Budget are those who are greatly in need of increased financial assistance if they are to avoid very great hardship and, in some cases, hunger and need.</P>
      <P>We are all naturally and, I think, understandably suspicious of the Budget.  It appears to be a kind of Budget with which the Government could go to the country if they wished. It reminds me of a cartoon that I saw depicting an old spinster lady in a railway carriage, a gentleman sitting opposite her, the lady's umbrella hooked over the communication cord, just in case.  It strikes me that the Taoiseach is putting himself into a position where, if it is necessary due to the stresses in his party, he can go to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the way the country should be run.  We should not depend on the stresses within the party in Government, whatever about those in opposition, to provide us with a sound financial policy.  I do not think I am being unfair to the Taoiseach when I say that, because a short time prior to the Budget being introduced he told us it would be a tough Budget.  When he said that, he had at his disposal figures <Col N="1090" /> which gave him reasonable grounds to believe that there must be a tough Budget.  However, that is all part of politics.  We must try to examine the Budget for what it is worth, express our appreciation for the small things that have been done and suggest to the Minister what really should be done.</P>
    <P>Most people have agreed that this ritual annual Budget is a very inefficient way for a country to run its affairs.  One cannot direct the growth of one's finances in a society or community such as a nation simply from year to year.  It is obvious that there must be long-term planning over a number of years in order to invest in industry and agriculture and as a result of the investment, provide capital for what is needed to be done.</P>
    <P>If I may intrude on the conflict within Fianna Fáil, it interests me that the party is being assailed at the moment from the right.  It would appear that this Budget is the Budget of a very conservative Minister.  We know Deputy Colley is a conservative man in a conservative Cabinet.  However, the odd thing is that the Budget of the faction which is challenging the main section of the party, namely, last year's Budget, was an even more punitive and conservative Budget.  I am sorry about it because I should much prefer to see the party being attacked from the left &mdash;any development of that kind might push the party to the left.  However, it is a personal family affair they must sort out themselves.  I should hate anyone to think that the challenge to the party was anything but from the extreme right&mdash;from Deputies Blaney and Haughey and the former Deputy Boland.</P>
    <P>For years we have watched the process of government here.  We have listened to every Minister for Finance explain to us why he cannot do what he would like to but knows he should do, as this Minister appears to do in respect of the groups he dealt with in a minimal way.  At what stage do some Government accept that the methods of wealth creation which they use clearly will not work no matter how long they are tried?  There was a 1½ per cent growth rate last year.  I find it <Col N="1091" /> difficult to understand how men who, I am sure, would like to do things for the community and improve the social standards in the community generally can go on like this year after year. They know that this system of private enterprise capitalism creates wealth for a minority; it does this very well because this is its function.  It provides money for the educational needs, the health needs, old age needs and the recreational requirements of a relatively tiny minority in our society. Thereafter it has little power to create wealth in sufficient amounts to provide anything like the quality of service needed for the mass of people.</P>
    <P>We know that old people cannot live on £5 or £6 per week.  We know they are hungry and, as a medical man, I know that very many of them die of malnutrition.  In relation to education, there is not sufficient wealth to provide enough universities.  There is not enough wealth to provide secondary schools where classes can be sufficiently small to give everyone the same chance in their secondary education.  We have not enough money for houses; we have not enough money for hospitals or health services; we do not create enough jobs to ensure that people are not compelled to emigrate.  These facts are known to all.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that the reason things are like this is not that our people are inefficient, are bad craftsmen, bad technicians or bad professional people.  We are just as clever, intelligent and talented as anyone else. We have provided wonderful industries &mdash;we have given plenty of examples of that in the semi-State companies.  Technicians and technocrats are trained in our schools and universities.  In the matter of semi-State companies, I would mention Are Lingus and Bord na Móna and, as bad as CIE are, they are better than the organisation they replaced.</P>
    <P>One gets tired listening to successive Ministers saying we cannot do things overnight, that we would do them if we had the money.  They cannot really be sincere about their protestations because they know quite well <Col N="1092" /> that there are many countries in which these problems do not exist, that there is another form of organisation of society, an organisation of a socialist society, in which the purpose of the community is to use to the maximum the land, labour and capital of that community in order to create the maximum amount of wealth for all the people, not for a minority.</P>
    <P>That is the great conflict.  That is the great defference of opinion between us.  All of us are historically first generation peasants and it is extraordinary that we should get so far away from our origins that we can contemplate a society in which there is this great minority privilege, that we have our great schools for the privileged, the Clongoweses and the high schools, Protestant and Catholic.  There is no difference. One is as bad as another if you want to put it that way; one is as uninterested or as selfish as another, while the mass of the people, those who can survive here at all, find themselves living and working in precarious and frequently, not always, substandard conditions.  The quality of our educational services, health services, and services for the aged, is substandard. Housing in some cases is very good, but those other services, compared with those available to the wealthy minority in our society, are certainly substandard.  Compared with those available to the comparable working-class group in Britain they are substandard.  It must be remembered that socially Britain is a very backward country.  When we compare ourselves with Britain we compare ourselves with probably the most socially backward country the most socially makes us a very poor relation of most European countries in regard to social advances in the post-war years.  What is completely shocking is that ordinary working men and women find themselves in this position even after we have caused one-third of our people to emigrate because we could not give them jobs.</P>
    <P>Could any of those people who believe in private enterprise capitalism please give me a sound reason why we continue to operate this system here in Ireland?  It does not provide enough <Col N="1093" /> jobs.  It does not provide enough houses.  It does not provide proper health services.  It does not provide proper educational services of a universal kind.  It does not provide proper facilities for all our people.  It does not provide proper recreational facilities for the working-class child.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be the inescapable conclusion; yet I have seen competent Ministers over there, competent Ministers for Industry and Commerce in Fianna Fáil, in Fine Gael and no doubt in our own party, who saw these things just as clearly as I see them and who nearly invariably were prepared to accept any solution or any explanation rather than the one which they knew was staring them in the face.  For instance, we are now to have an explanation for our tourism problems in what the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Lenihan, calls the north-eastern corner of our country. We were told at one stage that a great drive for free trade would solve everything. We were told that a great drive for tariffs and protection in establishing our own industries would solve everything.  We were told that the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement would solve everything.  Now, the Common Market will solve everything.</P>
    <P>We do not believe the evidence of our eyes although it is absolutely overwhelming. As a convinced socialist, I have always believed in an abstract, academic sort of way, that the system was wrong, but I was never more convinced than by the reports of the Commission on Industrial Organisation set up by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass.  All those dreadful reports about the quality and efficiency of Irish industry were a devastating indictment of the inefficiency of private enterprise and its failure to do anything except exploit the captive market here.  There was little or no attempt to expand into British or continental markets or into the Commonwealth markets which were available at that time.  We played safe.  People who got in at the top made a lot of money for themselves, but the consumer paid dearly and, what was worse, the community as a whole paid because, as I have just said, of failure to create prosperity year <Col N="1094" /> after year and because private enterprise capitalism was a system run by people for themselves, for a minority. It had not the great community concept of concern for everybody, not just a minority, that one has in socialism. We saw how completely the whole system as envisaged by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, failed.  I suspect this was one of the things that finished him with politics, his own despair at this attempt to create a dynamic industrial arm here.  He dedicated his political life to it and his despair at the way it turned out was equal to anybody else's.</P>
    <P>I could talk here for hours, but it would have little or no effect.  However, it seems to me that, in spite of the apologias, the explanations and the excuses, the ordinary genuine politician who is doing some private thinking must know that this system has failed here.  It has failed in many other countries but it has failed here in a very obvious way.  It is very attractive for the various governments over the years to accept the explanations.</P>
    <P>There are plenty of clever people who believe in the system, who are interested in maintaining it and who provide explanations for Ministers and Taoiseachs.  The simple thing to do is to accept the explanations and to carry on as if there was nothing that could be done.  I wonder if anybody recalls even Mr. de Valera saying at one time that if the system did not work he would go outside it.  That was a long time ago.  Possibly somebody will realise that he has more than a simple responsibility to return a party to office and to have Ministers elected who can have the very pleasant experience of ministerial office.  I suppose the satisfying experience of being a Minister is due to the fact that one has so much power.  But surely there must be a generation of politicians who will understand the most wonderful thing that one could have as a politician is the power to change society in a fundamental way and our society needs changing in a very fundamental way.</P>
    <P>There is always a glib explanation and we are told that things will be better next year.  Many reasons have <Col N="1095" /> been put forward&mdash;the troubles in the North of Ireland, the postal strike in England or the foot-and-mouth disease. The war was a good reason for a long time.  We will now hear about Common Market transition and decimalisation. Such explanations are simple ones to give.  However, the most devitalising of all is this in-built facility that we have in our system whereby emigration is regarded as an intergral part of our economic policy.  We now depend on emigration to solve our employment problems.  For years socialists have hoped that, should there be a recession in Britain, our people would not be able to get work there and, consequently, the Government here would be forced to change society and create co-operative movements in rural Ireland as well as public ownership in the industrial sector.</P>
    <P>We have seen how a one-crop community such as Cuba have been able to mobilise their wealth and industry and although they are having a hard time, having been boycotted by the Americans in a most ruthless way in their efforts to bankrupt them, the way of life of the mass of the people in Cuba is infinitely better than what it was before the revolution.  It can be said also of most of those countries where socialism has been applied either in a revolutionary or, as in the case of the Scandinavian countries, in an evolutionary way, that the mass of the people have gained as a result and their way of life has improved enormously.</P>
    <P>Obviously, it would require a lot of courage and a lot of conviction on the part of a government to decide to introduce various control measures that would be needed in order to mobilise our wealth.  People talk about ours being a poor country but, of course, this is not true.  Irish citizens have about £1,000 million invested abroad. We have abundant land and labour force but yet we have the highest unemployment rate in Europe, even with emigration.  This is an astonishing fact. An unemployment rate of between 6 and 8 per cent is regarded in most other countries as being a per-revolutionary situation but we are able to continue being completely complacent and indifferent to the dreadful human <Col N="1096" /> suffering which this unemployment causes.  Mr. Heath is obviously very worried about the situation in Britain.</P>
    <P>That is in the negative sense, but in the positive sense there is the failure to organise the optimum amount of labour in order to use it with capital and to create the maximum amount of wealth for society as a whole.  Deputies have spoken about the question of unemployment assistance.  The decision in relation to the dole was an extraordinary one and I find it very difficult to understand how a man like the present Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;a man for whom we all have a great liking and respect&mdash;could have taken such an appallingly brutal decision as to deprive people of the few shillings they receive when they are unemployed. It is humiliating enough to have to draw those few shillings but it is much worse when these people are told that the few shillings will be taken away from them altogether.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand such insolence on the part of a Government in a country where 70,000 people cannot get work because of the failure of the Government to provide jobs for them. I do not know how members of the Government who, like most of us, live in reasonable comfort, could agree to this when they have failed in their first responsibility of providing reasonably well paid jobs for our people.  Many of the people who are now being deprived of the dole are at starvation level, but this is through no fault of their own. The idea of the unemployed man was common in Britain and in most other countries.  It is an attempt to offload the sense of guilt that society has because of its failure.  It turns on the victim of its failure and abuses him by calling him unemployed.  Deputy Briscoe referred to the man who may be out of a job for two years but that man may be an unskilled worker and, consequently, has a sense of not being wanted by society.  Any one of us who would be out of a job for two years would not wish to go back to work unless the job he could get was a very attractive one.  It is well known that in the dreadful hunger marches in Britain during the 1930s, when there was a lot of unemployment in Wales and in the <Col N="1097" /> North of England, when 10 or 15 per cent were unemplyed, the same jeers were heard from wealthy people in jobs who said that these people were unemployed and would not work in a fit.  When a Government came along which did provide full employment, all these &ldquo;unemployables&rdquo; disappeared from the street corners and from the labour exchanges.  They took work and they worked and they got their unemployment figures down to a ½ per cent, or 1 per cent, or 1½ per cent without any great difficulty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe suggests, and I am sure he means well, that there should be rehabilitation for these people.  The fact is that it is no good rehabilitating people for jobs in Ireland today because there are no jobs for them.  It is not rehabilitation they need but jobs, and jobs are not being provided.  The provision of jobs by a community is not simply an act of God; it is the result of planning, of positive economic decisions and fiscal policies which are directed towards the optimum use of the raw materials of wealth creation&mdash;land, labour and capital&mdash; to provide that wealth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe was particularly pleased with the £40 million from turnover tax&mdash;where would we be without it?  Where were we when we did not have it?  Where did the money come from them?  Of course the turnover tax is a very unfair tax, it is a Deputy Haughey tax and that is one of the reasons why I criticised that bloc of the Fianna Fáil Party as the right wing of the Fianna Fáil Party; whatever you may call the others they are not as right wing as they are.  It is a very unfair tax and I am glad that all these people have benefited from this Budget, the unmarried mother, the deserted wife, the widow and the old age pensioner all of whom pay on their essential commodities just the same amount of tax as Lord Moyne does, or any of these wealthy people we have in our community.  My objection and that of most members of the Labour Party to the turnover tax was its unfairness. It is a very efficient tax, as Deputy Briscoe said, because it collects the money very effciently, but it collects it from the wrong people.  It collects <Col N="1098" /> the money from the ordinary working class housewife and collects it in a way which penalises the family; the bigger the family the more she has to pay.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the children's allowances offset the amount of tax that a woman has to pay for a family of any size.  We are always on about the necessity for these large families but we give people very little assistance in bringing up these families.  The larger the family the more you are taxed. Deputy Briscoe, then, took this £40 million off the worker and we are going to take more off the worker this year. In other ways we are taxing some of them earlier than we used to.</P>
    <P>We then come to an extraordinary dichotomy of thinking in the conservative benches of both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.  We are told that industry cannot possibly survive.  Deputy Dockrell was complaining that industry was so heavily taxed that it could not survive. Of course part of it is due to gross inefficiency.  Then we have had these remarkably generous provisions of tax free profits given to people who come here for five or six years, and then they return to wherever they came from, but the tax free profits are paid only at the expense of the turnover tax about which Deputy Briscoe is so pleased.  The services have to be provided and if the wealthy industrialist, or the wealthy mine owner, or the wealthy factory owner does not pay taxes on the wealth he creates, then of course somebody else has to provide the money.</P>
    <P>This is a very efficient but, from the workers' point of view, punitive taxation system.  It is grossly unfair because the more he takes the advice of his advisers to increase the size of his family the higher his taxation goes.  The conflict then in thinking is this, that we are continually listening to whispers of agony from the federation of manufactures and from industrialists that the burdens of company tax, excess profits tax, corporation profits tax, death duties and so on, are so high that unless they are reduced they will not be able to work as hard, will not be able to create as much wealth, and at the same time nobody seems to care about the fact that the worker at the <Col N="1099" /> other end of the scale is taxed.  The white collar worker, the manual worker, is being more and more heavily taxed by all these forms of indirect taxation&mdash;the turnover tax, the wholesale tax, the retail tax, income tax and rates&mdash;and the white collar worker probably pays other taxes such as voluntary health insurance.  These taxes are being paid increasingly by the masses.  The minority are protected under private enterprise capital when they create great wealth and live in a lovely, privileged society, with the best schools, swimming pools, small classes, the best health services, with lovely places to retire to and so on, and they have this lovely island in an enormous area in which there is want, need and unhappiness.</P>
    <P>This is directly resulting from the whole concept of private enterprise capital in so far as it cares only for a minority.  That was bad enough, at least they were paying tax according to a scale, the more they earned&mdash; admitting that there were evasions&mdash; the more they paid; but it was decided that this was too hard on them and, as Deputy Briscoe said, they had to find the money somewhere so they turned around and got it off the ordinary worker.  It is the white collar worker and the manual worker who is now paying the taxes which these people should be paying.  That is one side of it.  Nobody adverts to the fact that if you tax the worker, if you take away too much of his hard-earned week's money, his overtime, his weekend time, then why should he not object also to having to work?  Why should he not stop working or why should he not slow down?  Why should increased or excessive taxation not be a disincentive to him?  Why is high taxation only a disincentive to the wealthy business man, the industrialist, or the farmer?</P>
    <P>The worker is going to find out this clever fiscal sleight of hand that has been carried out over the last 15 or 20 years in which the burden of tax has been very cleverly shifted from those who are well able to pay, the very wealthy people in our society, more and more to the broad mass of <Col N="1100" /> people in the community and that there is less and less attempt to get a real redistribution of wealth in Ireland.  All that we are doing between insurance contributions and direct and indirect taxes and rates is taking the money of the mass of consumers and redistributing it among themselves in the form of various social services but there is no serious attempt to redistribute the real wealth in the community held by the old families and by the new rich families.</P>
    <P>Quite obviously the worker is becoming more enlightened and is beginning to understand the basic conflict that is between him and the owner of the business or the dividend clipper.  He is beginning to understand that there is no reason why he should not take everything, every bit of the wealth he creates as a result of a week's work; that he does not owe anything to anybody; that profits belong to him since he creates the wealth.  Profits should not go to a shareholder outside the company.  Capital owned by private individuals is simply unpaid wages owed to workers in the past.  Workers are beginning to understand that capital should have been paid out in the form of profits in the past.  Their predecessors on the job made that wealth for these families in our community as in other capitalist communities.  The worker knows also that nobody has a right to the wealth he creates except himself and his community, the total community either directly in the form of wages or indirectly in the form of social services and that nothing should go in dividends and that nothing should go in profits.</P>
    <P>So long as you have this conflict of interests, all the conservative Deputies are worried about strikes.  As long as there is this understanding by the employer and by the worker that wages are undistributed profits, the profits are undistributed wages&mdash;this is the kernel of the conflict.  This is why strikes must go on and why there must be a continual class war in a society such as ours so that eventually the worker comes to control his own destiny and so that whatever wealth he creates goes to him entirely and <Col N="1101" /> completely, and he has not to hand over any at all in the form of these declarations of profits one reads about in the financial papers, always praised as &ldquo;a magnificent increase in profits&mdash; by ICI or Irish Ropes or Guinness or any of these, or the mines&mdash; 25 per cent, 15 per cent, 17 per cent &ldquo;much better than last year.&rdquo;  Then when the worker comes out and says he wants 7 per cent, 8 per cent or 9 per cent of an increase in wages there is blue murder.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell said that you have 300 or 400 ESB workers holding the country up to ranson but he did not tell us about the bankers, the people who eventually settled and made a just settlement.  Why the hell were they not made do it a long time before then?  Why did they get away with it so long, keeping those unfortunate people out on strike and, worse still, doing immeasurable damage to the community because of their dogged obstinacy and their refual to face the fact that they had to pay their employees a just wage?</P>
    <P>Somebody asked Deputy Briscoe why he did not do something about it. There is one facet of it which interested me.  When I was in the Cabinet we had a bank strike.  I do not suppose it matters to say this now but I remember&mdash;I do not know if people understand this but you cannot close a bank without a Government order and the Government order must be agreed with the Cabinet&mdash;on one occasion when there was a strike I refused to accept that we should sign the Government order because my attitude was that effectively it was a lock-out of the workers and I would not be party to it.  Shortly afterwards they succeeded in settling their strike but it is interesting to know that the banks are closed with the consent, approval and authority of the Government and that that happened over all that period.  Is there no responsibility on the Government at a certain stage to say: &ldquo;We will not continue to authorise you to lock out these strikers&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Obviously, there must be strikes when taxation increases and increases in the cost of essential commodities and goods of various kinds become <Col N="1102" /> dearer.  The worker must get money from his job so that he can buy the things he needs.  He is not buying holidays in the Canaries, mentioned by Deputy Dockrell, but simple things like bread, tea, eggs, meat, milk, clothes and books for his children at school.  If these things are allowed to increase in price and go beyond his means he has no alternative but to go on strike.  It astonishes me that people talk about those on strike as if it was a sort of holiday.  In reality it must be a very disturbing experience in the life of the ordinary worker and the average family and one must have sympathy for the unfortunate wife.  It is not like going to the seaside for a fortnight.  I remember seeing grey-haired maintenance men walking up and down with placards in the middle of November and feeling tremendous sympathy for them because they had to do these things in order to get decent wages.  It takes a very long time for those on strike to make up for the loss of income arising from strikes.</P>
    <P>It is useless to talk about a prices and income policy because one cannot have price fixing in a private enterprise setting.  Companies simply tell the Government they are not making big enough profits and if they do not make big enough profits they will stop working for the community.  They do not have any sense of social concern.  If they do not make a profit in Japan they will make one in Shannon; if they do not make one in Shannon they will make one in Hamburg and if they do not make one there they will make one in Birmingham or somewhere else. Henry Ford is going around the world saying he will cut off the work supply in order to blackmail his employees into an equitable settlement in the middle of a strike.</P>
    <P>The establishment of transnational companies is a very dangerous development from the workers' point of view because these people can take their businesses anywhere in the world.  For this reason one would hope to see the development of a linkage between the trade union movement so that there could be sympathetic strikes in different countries.  To a certain extent that happened during the cement strike, <Col N="1103" /> when there was a certain amount of liaison between our own people and the people in Holland, which meant a certain amount of pressure could be brought to bear.  I sincerely hope sympathetic transnational strike action will be a development of the years ahead as a counter to the action of the great cartels which sprawl all over Europe without having any interest in the national welfare of the countries in which they get their wealth.</P>
    <P>No attempt has been made by anybody to tell us why the growth rate should increase over that of last year. We used to be told what the projected increase in gross national product would be as a result of the implementation of the plans, for national growth. But this never happened.  Unemployment went on as ever; emigration was marginally reduced, but the life of the community went on unchanged.  No attempt is made in this Budget Statement to say how wealth is going to be increased by 4 or 4½ per cent, whatever it is we are now promised.  I do not think it will bear any more relation to next year's growth rate than it did to last year's.</P>
    <P>The dreadful part about this Budget is that Government spending is being reduced.  That is the most complete exposure of the admission of failure of this Government.  We need as never before more money for houses, road construction, secondary schools, universities and facilities for old people.  The Minister for Health tells us that the money for the psychiatric service is not available.  He tells us that we cannot expect him to find it overnight.  This Government first took office in 1932 and, with short intervals in between, they have been in office almost 40 years.  Yet the Minister for Health tells us that he cannot do it overnight.  Is the man stupid or is he dishonest?  How could he possibly speak like that in the light of what he must know for himself is the complete and total failure of the Government?  In the early days of the Fianna Fáil Government there was considerable expansion of wealth, industry and the social services.  I have frequently said that anything worthwhile done here since the foundation <Col N="1104" /> of the State was done in the early days of the Fianna Fáil Party but that has all changed now.  Despite the fact we have got rid of one-third of our population, we still have failed to achieve what all other countries in Europe have achieved.  Yet some of those countries had to recover from the most devastating war in history, a calamity we were spared.</P>
    <P>I continue to be astonished at the extraordinary tenacity of what I am sure are essentially decent men in maintaining a financial and economic system which has already proved to be so disastrous for our society and which I am quite certain will continue to be just as disastrous in the years ahead unless some Government brings about the necessary radical changes in our economic system by creating a socialist society, revolutionary socialism in the Connolly sense.  I do not mean killing people, but an up-ending of the present economic system with ownership, control, means of production, distribution and exchange vested in the workers.  It is not original; it is not unique; it is now, fortunately, a system of society which is accepted by one-third of the world.  Fifty years after Connolly first talked about it, it is an extraordinary anomaly that his own country does not trust him or it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Browne has criticised the Budget and the whole economic set-up. It is significant that while he criticises it he abstained from voting against it last Wednesday, a matter to which not much notice has been given, particularly in the light of notice given to certain other abstentions.  Deputy Browne attacked the Budget on the grounds that it allegedly continues a system which seeks to help the rich rather than the poor and seeks to force the poor to support the country out of proportion to their wealth or to their means.  I came in here this evening with the intention of saying the direct opposite, particularly in relation to this Budget and I am afraid that nothing I have heard from Deputy Browne would cause me to think otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be no harm if a large number of people were to read carefully and study what Deputy Browne has <Col N="1105" /> said during the past half hour or so. He is entitled to his opinions, and certainly anybody with any democracy in his make-up will defend Deputy Browne's right to express those opinions, but I cannot conceive of any system more likely to be rejected by the people than the one Deputy Browne has been talking about this evening.  To my understanding of it, having listened to it&mdash;of course, listening to it, one might not understand it as clearly as when one studies it&mdash;it consists of the advocacy of a form of Communism probably more extreme than that actually practised in many of the Communist countries.  Deputy Dr. Browne referred, with some gratification, to the fact that one-third of the people on this earth are now ruled by Communist governments with Communist doctrines. I wonder does he ever stop to ask himself how they are ruled and why they are ruled.  Does he ever ask himself why they are never given the opportunity to decide for themselves whether or not they want to continue to be ruled in that way.  I wonder does he ever ask himself how many of these countries originally voluntarily accepted the horrible form of government he now preaches and they labour under.  I wonder does he ever ask himself whether, if those people were now given a genuine, free, voluntary opportunity to choose what they have now or what we know as freedom, how many of them, given that opportunity, would choose to remain the way they are.  It is a somewhat hypothetical question because, while the system of government and the way of life Deputy Dr. Browne advocates here remain in those countries, these unfortunate people will never be given that opportunity. I always think that it is the greatest justification of our democracy that, while 99.5 per cent of the people reject strenuously and abhor to their very core the sort of doctrines that Deputy Dr. Browne preaches here, we still allow them to be preached while those who practise the doctrines Deputy Dr. Browne preaches do not allow any dissent whatever to be voiced in these unfortunate countries.</P>
    <P>I could speak for some time about what Dr. Browne has been preaching on behalf of the Labour Party, but the <Col N="1106" /> Chair might take the view that it did not fall entirely within the compass of this debate and so I think I had better bring myself down to an acceptance of the framework of a democratic system of government and of the necessity, within that system, for forms of taxation on the people designed to pay for the services necessary for the running of the country.  If we accept that then we must inevitably accept the various limitations a democratic system of government imposes on us.  Having seen the forms of limitation imposed by undemocratic systems, I think all of us would, should and do happily accept the limitation of democracy.</P>
    <P>One cannot seek to get away with things which, I suppose, a government could seek to get away with in the short term.  On the contrary, one must genuinely balance the books of the nation and do so in a way which is conducive to the greatest public and national good.  It is my submission that this Budget does exactly that.  While almost inevitably there have had to be certain taxation increases they are the sort of increases that can be most readily justified by anybody taking any sort of reasonably objective approach to the financial situation and to the problems facing the Minister.  If one accepts, as, I think, most of us do, that our greatest problem over the last year or two has been inflation, then one must equally accept that the most serious problem facing the Minister in this Budget was doing what he had to do while, at the same time, ensuring the minimum effect on prices; in other words, raising whatever taxation was found to be necessary and ensuring that this taxation had the minimum impact on price levels.</P>
    <P>If one examines the three headings under which the Minister has obtained the £9,500,000 extra that he needs in new taxation this year one must inevitably agree that the impact on prices is as near to nil as almost makes no difference.  Most of the money raised in income taxation is raised in a way which spreads it so widely that individual taxpayers will scarcely notice what difference there is.  At the same time there are built in additional reliefs which in the case of very many taxpayers nullify any increases that there <Col N="1107" /> might otherwise be or, in fact, decrease total liability.  Furthermore, a large section of taxpayers, some 20,000 or so, are taken out of the income tax net altogether.</P>
    <P>The other method by which the Minister proposes to raise additional revenue is by increased taxation on spirits and, to a lesser extent, on beer. While this has some effect on prices, inevitably, it has it in a sphere which is, to a very great extent, one of luxury. In no sense are spirits to be regarded as a necessity for any man or any family in the country, and I think that the increase which was brought about will have little effect on anyone's personal budget.  I do not think that anybody can quibble reasonably with the Minister for Finance for seeking to obtain the comparatively small amount of money which he did seek from spirits and, to a lesser extent, from beer.  Look around and see the vast turnover which seems to increase every year in lounge bars and in hotels.  It is one of the phenomena of our age in the last few years that so many young people seem to have so much money to spend in places like this.  The Minister for Finance would be a foolish Minister if he did not seek to reimburse the Exchequer to some extent from the extraordinary amount of high-powered spending that goes on in that region of the economy at present.</P>
    <P>The third field of revenue on which the Minister drew and to which I want to refer is death duties.  While he will receive only about £250,000 in his present year, the yield for a full year on the changes he announced would be something in the region of slightly over £1 million.  It has often been advocated in this country by people like Deputy Dr. Browne, and indeed by people much less extreme than Deputy Dr. Browne, that we should consider some form of capital gains tax here as a tax on accumulated wealth.  There is little doubt that most Members of this House would accept that argument in theory but unfortunately the argument falls down when you try to go into the practicalities of it in so far as capital gains tax is a tax on the personal wealth of living persons.  On <Col N="1108" /> the other hand, we do have a capital gains tax in this country.  We have had it for very many years.  It is often overlooked as such but it is essentially precisely the same thing except that it does not apply to the personal wealth of living persons.  It applies to the personal wealth of persons recently deceased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been happy and I think the whole House would be happy to see the rate of estate duty on the higher estates, that is estates exceeding £55,000 net, increased by percentages varying between 3 per cent at £55,000 to 15 per cent on estates of £200,000 and upwards.  I fail to see how anybody could criticise that and I do not think indeed that it has been criticised.  At the same time, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the particular fairness of our form of death duties.  When I do this I do not want in any way to appear to be critical of the death duties system of any other country.  It is not my business to be critical of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in our death duty system a built-in protection for the weaker sections of the community even though they may be comparatively better off in overall terms.  On the death of a man, a breadwinner, the persons most acutely hit are his widow and dependant children.  We have had now for some years, and the Minister this year has extended it very considerably, a system whereby a widow and her dependant children are entitled to very substantial abatements of duty.  One of the results of that, particularly in the light of the 50 per cent increases in abatement granted by the Minister this year, is that a widow without any children would not now pay estate duty unless the net estate left by her husband, that is after payment of debts and various other deductions which are allowed, exceeded £15,300.  A widow with six children is, in fact, completely free of duty due to the increased abatements when the net estate after deductions does not exceed the very substantial sum of £33,000.  We have here <Col N="1109" /> a system of taxation that seems to me to be eminently fair.  It has now been increased for those who can best afford to pay it and at the same time those who suffer any hardship by the operation of it are in fact totally exempted from payment up to figures that are now so high that payment over those figures would not, in fact, cause any hardship whatever.</P>
    <P>We can learn something about the feasibility or profitability of a capital gains tax on personal wealth from our experience with regard to estate duty because the yield last year from death duties was only £6,300,000 which is not a great deal of money for a tax of this kind.  The primary reason, of course, why the yield was not any higher was to my mind because the personal wealth is not there and if it is not there on death it is not there during life and substantial sums would not be easily come by on the introduction of a capital gains tax on personal wealth.</P>
    <P>Of all our taxes death duties are probably the greatest redistributors of wealth in the community from those who have most to give to those who have least.  I think the House would readily agree that the changes which the Minister for Finance made this year are changes which increased that tendency and made its redistribution more fair still&mdash;a proper social redistribution of the wealth or the assets of individuals in the country.</P>
    <P>Rarely, I think, has any Budget introduced in this House been subject to less criticism than this one.  The fact that it is not being criticised does not necessarily mean it is therefore perfect. Equally, neither is the converse true, that if something is criticised it is in some way defective.  A fair enough yardstick is public reaction to this Budget.  Public reaction has been that the people have judged it as socially and economically fair, that they have realised the difficulties of the Minister for Finance about what he might do and that within those limits what he has done is eminently and manifestly in the interests of the people of the country.</P>
    <P>One has only got to go through the lists of benefits which were given to <Col N="1110" /> social welfare recipients and farmers to realise the considerable effort made by the Minister to distribute as fairly as possible the limited amount of largesse he had to give.  As the Minister said in his Budget Statement, and as I should like to reiterate, perhaps the most significant and the most important aspect of this Budget is the overall approach to it in pre-Budget days&mdash;the effort to pare expenditure to the finest possible degree.</P>
    <P>This is a thing that we as a Government will probably never get sufficient credit for, but as one who lived through the many days of painful work not only for the Minister for Finance but for everybody who had to forego schemes that he had dreamed about, I say that at least we have the consolation of knowing that in giving up the sort of popularity we might otherwise have enjoyed, we have served the national interest very well indeed, in that the inflationary situation which has been difficult during the past couple of years and which would have been exacerbated by a further increase in Government expenditure on the lines of the percentages of the last couple of years, can be brought under control now by the action of the Government in drastically curbing their own expenditure.</P>
    <P>This is a lead which has been given to the people of the country as a whole. The Government alone are not able to overcome inflation.  As the Minister for Finance has made clear, the financial year on which we are now embarking is one in which the successful continued operation of the national wage agreement is of the most vital importance to the state of our economy. Excessive wage increases allied to excessive Government expenditure are perhaps the two greatest contributing factors to inflation.</P>
    <P>The Government have certainly given a lead here as far as their own expenditure is concerned, and I hope, in the interests of this country, that the lead will be followed, so that the pruning of expenditure, which I was amazed to find criticised in this House this evening by Deputy Noel Browne, will be seen as a mark of good faith on the part of the Government, and that what <Col N="1111" /> we have done will be done also by each individual throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In talking on this Budget, I want to speak to a considerable degree on the state of the economy and to relate the Budget to that.  That is what the Budget should be.  It should play a role in remedying economic problems and difficulties.  One can judge a Budget only in the context of the economic situation of the country.</P>
      <P>The position in which we find ourselves is notably unsatisfactory.  The growth of the economy has slowed down to a trickle from 1970 and though this has been to some degree attributable to the strike situation, it is only partly attributable to it.  It is quite clear that by any standards the economy is at present expanded and developed at a rate which is below what is possible in terms of growth of capacity, and this is being reflected in growing unemployment which, however, is aggravated by the situation in Britain.  The economic problem is so serious here because people are being thrown out of work or are failing to find employment here, but part of it undoubtedly is because the employment situation in Britain is also difficult. However, it is particularly unfortunate that at a time when Irish people have fewer opportunities for employment in Britain than normal, we should have chosen that moment effectively to close the door even more firmly on their employment prospects in this country.</P>
      <P>The slowing down of the economy has been quite dramatic.  There was in 1968 a spectacular spurt of growth which reflected a pent-up situation following the latest Fianna Fáil crisis of 1965-66.  During that period the growth of capacity in the economy continued at a faster rate than the real growth of output and demand and so, when the economic difficulties were over, a faster growth than is possible in a single year developed.  Since that peak occasion in 1968, we had the slowing of economic growth to 4 per cent the following year and 1½ per cent last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot trace in the annals of this country in so far as national accounts of economic growth are concerned any <Col N="1112" /> occasion when economic growth decelerated as rapidly as that.  There have been ups and downs, of course, throughout the period since these figures have become available but in no period that I can recall has economic growth slowed down so rapidly. That itself creates problems.  Quite apart from the desirability of at all times maintaining a high level of economic growth, it is also desirable that economic growth should remain fairly even.  We should not experience sharp fluctuations which disturb the economy very seriously and can be the cause of many inequities and can create a situation where the growth fluctuates between rates of 1½ per cent and 8 per cent, up and down again, in a period of five years.  That is not a happy situation.  It is indeed one for which it is difficult to find any parallel elsewhere in Europe.  Other European countries too have experienced difficulties at different times. Although all of them have had periods of inflationary pressures and consequent inflation, again I cannot easily recall any country in recent years which has experienced quite this sharp fluctuation.</P>
    <P>There is, however, another aspect of this problem which is particularly disturbing and which has limited considerably the Government's room to manoeuvre.  It is the fact that our balance of payments deficit, which rose very sharply in 1969, remained at a remarkably high level last year.  Those economists whose job it is to examine in depth the relationship between the different economic aggregates are extremely puzzled at this phenomenon. On the basis of past experience, there should not have been such an upsurge in imports in 1970, in a year in which growth of output and growth in demand were so sluggish.  All past experience suggests that, in these conditions, the value of imports would rise more slowly and that the balance of payments difficulties that had emerged in 1969 would have been somewhat eased.</P>
    <P>It has been a feature of the comments made by different independent economists and different independent sources of economic comment on the <Col N="1113" /> present situation, that they have all expressed a certain degree of puzzlement at this phenomenon.  They are, I think, agreed that among the factors responsible for it has been the fact that, as well as the exceptional rise in import prices&mdash;which is outside the Government's control of course&mdash;there is evidence of a significant change in the propensity to import.  The share of home demand absorbed by imports has risen very sharply in the past couple of years.  This can only be explained by some kind of change between the competitiveness of Irish goods and foreign goods.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, no coincidence that these past two years have seen a sharp deterioration in the relative competitiveness of our goods, a sharp increase in labour costs, more rapid here than in any other nearby country, an increase, indeed, which in the two years 1968 to 1970 pushed up our labour costs by as much as 24 per cent which may be compared with the British record, perhaps almost a record figure for Britain, of a 15 per cent increase in labour costs in the same period.  The British regard it as little short of disastrous that their competitiveness should be so eroded by comparison with the countries with which they trade: that in a short period of two years labour costs increased by 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>In this country the increase was 24 per cent.  This has meant that relative to British goods, in a two year period Irish goods have become less competitive by 8 per cent so far as labour costs are concerned.  That is a very serious development, indeed, because, given that labour costs represent something like 60 per cent of the total value of goods produced and sold, it means that the actual price level of Irish goods <i>vis-á-vis</i> British goods has deteriorated by something like 5 per cent in two years.  Experience in other countries has shown that, if the relative price situation of a certain country deteriorates <i>vis-á-vis</i> that of its neighbours by anything up to 10 per cent, it becomes impossible to maintain the parity of currency.  Therefore, in those two years we went half way towards a situation that threatened the ability of <Col N="1114" /> this country to maintain its existing currency parity.</P>
    <P>This, of course, has had its effect on exports and on imports.  In the past we have tended too much to concentrate upon the effect on exports.  We have concerned ourselves too much with exports as the test of competitiveness. There has been a tendency to say: &ldquo;Oh, exports are still rising. Things cannot be too bad.&rdquo; This is dangerous for two reasons.  First of all, there is a long-term upward trend in exports because of the establishment in this country of new export-orientated industries.  This means that at least in the short and medium run, even if we are becoming less competitive, there will be at least for a period a continuing increase in exports.  We should not allow this to confuse us or to delude us into thinking that, because exports continue to rise, in fact our established export trade is remaining competitive.</P>
    <P>When one examines the increases in exports one finds to a startling degree that they consist of new types of goods made by new industries established here and that the growth of exports in the past year or two has not been attributable to anything like the degree that was true in many earlier years to the expansion of exports made by our established industries.  If one looks behind the figures one finds, even on the export side, evidence of an erosion of competitiveness which is hidden and obscured by the continuing rapid growth of exports from newly established industries, in many cases foreign based.  That is one reason why we should be careful not to be misled by the relative buoyancy of exports into thinking that all is necessarily well so far as competitiveness on export markets is concerned.</P>
    <P>The other side of the coin is this. Quite apart from our goods ceasing to be competitive on export markets, they may cease to be competitive at home.  What is most striking about the past couple of years is the growth in the import content of Irish home consumption reflected last year in this remarkable stability of the external deficit in a year when a slackening in the growth of imports should have given us some leeway here and enabled <Col N="1115" /> us to reduce our external deficit below the very high level it is at.  This is what is most worrying about our present situation because, were it not for this difficulty, were it not for the decline in the competitiveness of our goods, were it not for the growing increase in imports, reflecting primarily the loss of competitiveness due to increased costs, the spare capacity that undoubtedly exists in the economy at the present time would have made it possible to stimulate growth, to achieve a more rapid rate of expansion and a reduction in unemployment.</P>
    <P>The trouble therefore is that we have got ourselves into a position where we have very little room for manoeuvre and where, owing to mistakes that have been made, and owing to the inflationary pressures that have been allowed to prevail, our ability to maintain not full employment&mdash;that is something we have never had&mdash;but even the kind of three-quarters provision of employment for our people&mdash;the best we have been able to achieve&mdash;has been eroded.  No longer is it true to say that three-quarters of those coming on the labour market, young people leaving school and university, and those leaving the land, have been able to get employment, which was the case for much of the 1960s.  It is true that this has manifested itself not in emigration, which is at a somewhat lower level than normal, but in unemployment due, perhaps, to the economic situation in Britain rather than to anything that is happening at home.</P>
    <P>The simple fact is that we are being forced away from even the kind of employment situation we had, unsatisfactory though it was, and although we have spare capacity, spare manpower, spare capacity in our industries, we are not able to use it fully lest, by stimulating home demand with a view to achieving the full utilisation of that capacity, we should worsen still further the external payments situation which is already so severe.  The trouble about this is that it is not clear how we are to get out of that situation.  Certainly the Government have not adverted to it.  I do not recall this whole problem being analysed in these terms, or anything approaching these terms, by Government <Col N="1116" /> spokesmen, nor have the Government given us any indication as to how they see us getting out of this difficulty.</P>
    <P>In fact, what is striking about this Budget in the economic sense is that it starts off with a situation where we are told in this volume, Review of 1970 and Outlook for 1971, that, on the basis of existing policies&mdash;this document was prepared on the basis of pre-Budget policies&mdash;the economy will grow by 3 per cent perhaps in 1971 which is the same rate at which it would have grown in 1970 but for the strikes.  In other words, before the Budget we are told that unless the Government take some action to stimulate the economy growth will remain well below the level which is feasible.  When the Budget was produced it proved to be a Budget which did nothing to stimulate growth.  The Minister in his speech said that the economy will expand by 3 per cent following this Budget. I am not saying that the Budget should have stimulated growth to a greater extent.  The truth is that the situation into which we have been put by the weakness and ineptitude of the Government policies is one in which the Government have not got the leeway to implement such a Budget and to stimulate growth to the extent which is technically possible.  That is the ultimate condemnation of our present position.</P>
    <P>It is one thing for a country to be in a position where it is expanding as rapidly as it can.  Given the level of investment it is not possible to increase expansion more rapidly and consequently, even if the rate of growth is unsatisfactory from an employment point of view, there is nothing more that can be done about it.  But it is quite a different thing when it is technically possible to stimulate growth and to reduce unemployment; but, although this can be done and the Budget could have done it, the Government are not in a position to do this lest they precipitate an even worse economic crisis.  That is the problem to be faced.  That is why one cannot help but be deeply concerned about our present economic position.</P>
    <P>We should look at this in the context of our Third Programme targets. <Col N="1117" /> Our Second and Third Programmes have been curious in one respect.  The Government have gone to much trouble in preparing these programmes.  This must be an interesting and useful exercise. Once the programmes have been prepared and published they do not seem to have relevance to what happens. The Ministers in what they say show no consciousness of the fact that there are programme targets.  I would expect that, when we have these programmes, the Ministers would get up and make their Budget Statements in the context of the programmes, that they would tell us how much it is possible to do in a particular year and whether they had to pull back from their targets.  They might tell us that the housing, education or health targets could not be met and that taxation will run above or below the target level.</P>
    <P>But this is not the format of Budget speeches.  For 13 years, going back to the First Programme, Ministers have been making Budget speeches in the same format as they made them more than 13 years ago.  They make no reference whatever to the programme or its targets.  It is true that unremitting pressure has extorted from the Government, in their annual review of the economy, a section dealing with programme targets.  This is very interesting to those who are able to delve deeply, to unravel the format in which these figures are presented and who are prepared to spend some hours in turning these calculations into a format which makes sense and which makes comparisons between the actual and the projected situation possible.</P>
    <P>If one is prepared to undertake this exercise it is possible to find out what, in fact, is happening <i>vis-á-vis</i> the programme targets.  I have attempted this exercise and I will give the House the benefit of my research.  We have not had such comparisons from the Government side.  The Second Programme has been abolished, so far as the Government are concerned.  The Third Programme exists in theory.  It is reviewed in an interesting section of this report, burried deeply in the middle of it.  There are lots of statistics.  Ministers are careful never to refer to these figures.  If this Government had ever managed to achieve any of their targets <Col N="1118" /> in the Second and Third Programmes we would have heard more about planning.  Perhaps it is a matter of bad luck that the Government failed to achieve their set targets.  They may feel that in such a situation, silence is golden.  If that is the attitude, they are not showing much understanding of what the planning exercise is all about.</P>
    <P>Planning is designed to extort from the unwilling Government, Departments and Ministers, some kind of commitment as to what the results of their policies will be and to force them to put down in black and white what they expect to achieve with their policies.  It is designed to produce a framework for the expansion of the economy within which policy can then, in future, be made.  It is not a rigid framework.  No one would suggest that, regardless of the changing course of events and of the new needs which may develop, the Government should rigidly follow the terms of the programmes throughout the four to six years of their span.</P>
    <P>Some changes in programme targets will be necessary in the course of a programme.  Good reasons may arise for this.  If Ministers were coming into the House with their Budgets and citing them in the context of the programme and telling us that, by and large, things were working out all right but that they felt this year it was necessary to vary the allocations somewhat or that they underestimated somewhat income maintenance needs in the original programme and overestimated housing needs and that, therefore, they were making slight adjustments, while I would not agree with the policy, which is the one followed by the Government, I would have to accept that such Ministers recognised what a plan was for and that they recognised its existence and were having regard to the plan.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that no Budget Statement and no speech of any Minister which I can recall in the last eight or nine years since the Second Programme was first devised has ever adverted to the targets in a way which would suggest that they play any role whatever in the formation of policy.  It may be possible that when the Government <Col N="1119" /> meet and discuss the framework of the Budget the target figures are brought forward.  They may have fascinating discussions about whether or not they should change the targets. If so, it is an absolutely extraordinary state of affairs that the Ministers never even drop a hint of this outside.  The best-kept secret of Government is that they ever discuss or advert to programme targets.  They have never allowed a hint of such discussion to escape.</P>
    <P>There never has been a public statement on this matter.  The only explanation for such silence is, perhaps, the more probable one, and that is that, the Ministers have no regard for such targets at all.  The Opposition and the public are entitled, in the absence of any evidence, to presume that the programme targets have no reality for the Government, that they are not considered by the Government and that policy-making, despite the existence of these programmes, continues to be an <i>ad hoc</i> matter, described to us in an interesting manner by the previous speaker.  Each Minister claims what he thinks he needs for the year ahead and there appears to be an enormous amount of infighting and horse-trading. Finally, Ministers are cut back here and there until a figure is reached which is acceptable for the year ahead.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice gave an interesting description of what goes on. I am sure the Minister's description is true.  In the portion of the Minister's speech which I heard, there was nothing dealing with targets.  When the Minister described how the Budget is prepared I did not detect that any role was being played anywhere by the Third Programme targets.  There is no suggestion of any Minister saying in the Cabinet: &ldquo;I must get so much money because I am entitled to it under the programme&rdquo; or that another Minister would say &ldquo;I know that I may not have applied for enough under the programme, but things have changed and I think I am now entitled to look for more, and I realise that this will cause a cut-back somewhere else&rdquo;.  Nothing in the speech of the Minister for Justice suggested that these considerations arise at all at the <Col N="1120" /> Cabinet meeting.  There is some old-style horse-trading in which the Ministers fight it out and the toughest man wins.  It is interesting to judge who are the toughest and weakest Members of the Government when we see which Departments get a little more than their share and which Departments suffer.  I am sure that attendance at such meetings must be an interesting human experience.  Such discussions have nothing whatever to do with planning.</P>
    <P>How, in fact, does the progress made in the past two years and the plans for the year ahead relate to the programme targets?  The Government have been careful not to disclose this to us. Have the Government looked to see what the position is?  I will take an opportunity of enlightening them in this matter.  There is a basic difficulty in that output has not risen at the planned rate.  Nearly all the figures I will be using will be 1968 money values because it is in those terms that the targets are expressed and that the annual review of the Third Programme discloses the results achieved. In 1968 money terms output fell short of the required amount by £35 million, a fairly large sum.  In the terms of 1971 money values I would hesitate to put a figure on it, inflation has gone on so rapidly, but it is probably nearer to £45 million.  That is a big shortfall.</P>
    <P>What happened as a result of this shortfall?  First of all, what caused it? I suppose here we can see the marks of Government policy.  One can see here, perhaps, that certain Government policies have achieved results.  I want to be fair to the Government.  Agricultural output has fallen instead of risen.  I am prepared to accept that that is due to Government policy, that the Government have for reasons which are a little obscure, having set targets for growth in agriculture in their programme, targets which would have involved an expansion in output in those two years by about 4 per cent, decided to change their policy and plan for a decline in agricultural output. They did this by varying the milk prices in a particular way, which had this effect.  I do not quite know why the Government originally planned for the output in agriculture to expand and <Col N="1121" /> then changed their mind and set about adopting a policy to reduce it.  I can guess some of the reasons but I am not sure but, of course, the Government have never told us about this policy decision.  They have not even told us the results of it.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to tell the Government the results of it.  The result is that as soon as they set a target for a growth of 2 per cent per annum in agriculture which would have given a 4 per cent increase in output, agricultural output fell by 3 per cent instead of rising by 4 per cent and so at the moment agricultural output is running at about 7½ per cent behind the target level.</P>
    <P>That is the first major shortfall. Mind you, the failures of the last couple of years are not confined to agriculture.  In the industrial sector and in services also the volume of output is below what has been planned. There has been a universal failure to achieve the targets of output, most marked and obvious in the case of agriculture, where the trend has not simply been one of slower growth but of decline.  So much for the output side.</P>
    <P>What conclusions are to be drawn from this?  If we have not got the additional resources has expenditure then been cut <i>pro rata</i>?  That, indeed, would be the logical thing to do.  If you plan for a certain rate of growth in output and if through policy decisions, lack of policy decisions or drift you fail to achieve this, then logically one would expect that expenditure would be cut according to the cloth.</P>
    <P>This has not, in fact, happened in general.  It happened in one area.  One type of expenditure has fallen below the target level though not, perhaps by as much as would be appropriate to the shortfall in output.  That is private consumption.  The consumer, the man in the street, has been hit. He has lost out because the Government's failure to achieve the output targets has left them short of resources and so the consumers living standards have risen less than they should have otherwise done, less than they were planned to do.  The shortfall here in 1968 money values is of the order of <Col N="1122" /> £10 million.  The man in the street has been able to buy £10 million less than he was supposed to be able to buy in 1970 in 1968 money terms, probably £12 million or £13 million less in current money terms.  The cut in living standards by comparison with what had been planned is an important and significant consequence of the failures in the output side but this cut in living standards has not been matched by equivalent cuts in other areas.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, current expenditure on goods and services by the public authorities, which one can describe more briefly as public consumption, not only increased but increased much more rapidly than planned.  Whichever belts were to be pulled in in this crisis it was not those of the Government and the public service.  The plan was that in this period of two years the expenditure on the public service, the cost of running the country in simple terms that everybody can understand, was to rise in real terms by 7½ per cent.  It was going to absorb 7½ per cent more resources running this country, the cost of the public service, the goods and services it needs, salaries and so on expressed in real terms, taking into account money changes. That was what was planned to happen. One might have thought that, given that there was a shortfall of £35 million in output, given that consumption, the living standards of the man in the street had to be cut on that account, the plans for the expansion in the public service would be correspondingly reduced.</P>
    <P>Not a bit of it.  They were not prepared to share in the belt tightening exercise which they advocated for the private sector and which they managed to achieve in the private sector.  On the contrary, despite the fact that output was short by £35 million the growth of expenditure by the public sector, the cost of running the country, the money used up in the public sector&mdash;I am not talking of transfer payments, or subsidies, but of the cost of the public service sector itself&mdash; rose by 12½ per cent in a period when the resources simply were not there. When they had failed to achieve the <Col N="1123" /> increase in output, they absorbed and used up themselves very much more than they planned to do, increasing the cost there by 12½ per cent as against 7½ per cent.</P>
    <P>There is another area in which, perhaps, it is less blameworthy, or should, perhaps, be less a matter for concern, in which spending has out run the plan, where there has been no corresponding cut back in expenditure to match the failure to achieve the output targets, and that is in the sphere of investment. Investment was planned to rise in volume terms by 15 per cent in those two years.  There has been no cut back there to a lower growth rate.  On the contrary, the increase in investment has been 23 per cent.  One is, perhaps, less critical of this because, obviously, whatever is cut in those circumstances it is better that investment should not be cut and that the capacity of the economy to produce in the years ahead, when we get out of the present difficulties the Government have got us into, would then be there to be used for the benefit of the country.  Nonetheless it may well be that in the difficult circumstances in which we are such a remarkable overspending on the investment side is perhaps not fully justified.  In any event, it is there and there has been no corresponding cut back elsewhere.  As far as the public service is concerned, they have happily overspent by a wide margin.</P>
    <P>The result of all this is that expenditure under these headings, even allowing for the cut back in consumption below the target level, is running £30 million more than planned.  Of course, if you are going to produce £35 million less than planned and spend £30 million more than planned you cannot be surprised if a gap emerges.  The gap is, of course, the balance of payments deficit, running last year at about £62 million.  The figures do not perfectly match because there are changes in the prices of imports and exports.  There are other factors to be taken into account which involve some adjustment in the figures but one can broadly say that we have failed to produce as much as we planned by a margin of £30 million or £35 million.  We have overspent by an equivalent amount on the <Col N="1124" /> opposite side and the difference between the two is reflected broadly in the £60 million external payments deficit. That is the situation we have got into.</P>
    <P>When you look further at the Government's own sphere of action, not alone have they overspent on themselves, not alone has the cost of running the country been allowed to mount up much more rapidly than planned in a period when the resources available were less than planned, but under some of the other headings, under which the Government spend money on purposes other than paying for their own activities, there has also been overspending.  National debt interest, for example, has risen in this period in real terms.  The burden on the economy in real terms, allowing for money changes, has risen by 21 per cent as against a planned 17 per cent. So, despite the fact that we are short of resources, that we have not achieved our output targets, the burden on the economy of national debt interest has risen more than planned.  Transfer payments, comprising mainly, though not exclusively, social welfare payments, have risen at double the planned rate. Only subsidies have, in fact, been held below the level projected in the programme. Here the success of the Government policy of cutting back milk output, is, of course, the explanation. In fact, as one analyses all these figures, one constantly comes back to this one success of the Government, the one policy that has succeeded, the cutting back of milk output.  In that they have achieved something but it is, in fact, the only area in which there is any achievement I can find to the credit&mdash;or debit &mdash;in this instance, of the Government. As a result of their great efforts to reduce milk output they have managed to keep subsidies from rising in 1970 above the 1969 level and thus have held them below the target level.  This is the only place in which there has been any economy to offset overspending under other headings.</P>
    <P>If one takes all these headings together&mdash;all the activities of government, the cost of running the country, the transfer payments, the subsidies to enterprises, national debt interest, and so on&mdash;one finds that in this two-year <Col N="1125" /> period spending has risen 40 per cent faster than the planned rate.  This is in a period when output has fallen short of the target.  So much for the discipline of the plan.</P>
    <P>On the capital side the system has worked somewhat better, although at great cost.  Here, one must challenge the Government's priorities but I shall come to the cost and priorities later. At this stage, I must record that, whereas there has been gross overspending on the current side under virtually every heading, on the capital side spending has been kept in the two years within the limits of the plan. This reflects the fact that resources have not been available on the scale planned because of the shortfall in output.</P>
    <P>There has been some evidence that the plan has worked so far as the capital programme is concerned but that evidence tends to evaporate when one looks at the details.  It looks very well when you see aggregate figures close to the target but when you find how they have been kept close to the target and that the individual figures are widely different from the target figures you come to the conclusion that it is not the result of planning&mdash;it is merely a happy chance.  The Government, having overspent madly under one heading and having underspent under another heading, happen to end up with a figure close to the target. Individual components of capital spending do not show any real relationship with the targets set in the programme.</P>
    <P>Social investment&mdash;which I describe housing, health and education investment as&mdash;is 9 per cent below the target level.  That is a big cut in a two-year period; effectively, it means that none of the increases in spending under this heading has happened.  This needs to be analysed in detail.</P>
    <P>From other figures given to us covering both the current and capital side, we know that health expenditure is fairly close to target.  Although we have not got a detailed breakdown on the capital side, I think that probably indicates that if there is a 9 per cent shortfall in social investment as a whole and if health capital investment is on target, the cuts in education and <Col N="1126" /> housing capital expenditure must be greater than 9 per cent.  It is almost certain that the target has been cut back by more than 10 per cent for these two items.</P>
    <P>The other type of investment which has been cut below target level is agricultural investment.  This was 10 per cent below the target level last year. I should like to have been a fly on the wall at the Cabinet meeting when these discussions took place.  Did the Ministers concerned even advert to these targets?  Did the discussion about capital spending take the form of Ministers saying: &ldquo;I think we have got to cut back under certain headings.  What needs to be cut in this country are education, housing and agriculture.&rdquo;  I rather doubt that such discussions took place.  I think it just happened because the pressures of different Ministers produced that result.  I do not think it had much to do with any planned decision although I may be wrong about this.  Perhaps I am being too charitable; maybe Fianna Fáil's first thought in a crisis is to cut education, housing and agricultural investment. Being charitable, I preferred to think that they were not aware of what they were doing.</P>

      <P>Perhaps they never looked at the targets and were unaware of the fact that they were cutting back by 10 per cent on the targets they had set two years earlier.  How do they explain this in this document? There are explanations given and it is worth looking to see how truthful and honest they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to housing we are told that owing to the cement strike housing investment fell short of the planned level.  Let us analyse this statement in detail.  I am sorry if I weary the House with figures but one can only pin down some of the dishonesty and evasions of the Government by looking at the detailed figures.  One could content oneself with a broad propaganda exercise, with shouting at the Government that they were misbehaving themselves, but I prefer to deal with hard facts and figures and to give the Minister <Col N="1127" /> in his reply an opportunity of telling me if I am wrong.  I am always willing to listen to such corrections.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of examining housing expenditure I must include current spending because the housing figure is not segregated in the capital side&mdash;an omission I recommend to the Government to rectify in the future.  It is only under the heading of social expenditure, including current as well as capital, that housing is segregated. As this is the only information we are given I must work with it.  In 1968 money terms the Government planned to spend £63.2 million in 1970.  They say they spent £58.4 million&mdash;a cut back of 8 per cent.  The excuse given was the cement strike; sufficient cement was not available and as a result they could not spend the full amount.</P>
    <P>How true is this?  If we look for the capital programme we must turn elsewhere for this because carefully these figures are segregated in another document. In table 6 of the Capital Budget we find that the amount the Government intended to spend on housing investment in 1970-71 in current money terms was £35.06 million.  They spent £33.21 million and the shortfall&mdash;the amount by which they underspent what they intended to spend&mdash;in current money terms was £1.85 million.  However, the total shortfall in housing expenditure was nearly £5 million. Therefore, something like two-thirds of the shortfall is not accounted for by underspending of the capital investment allocated in 1970-71&mdash;it is accounted for by something else.  Whatever else it may be, it cannot be the cement strike because that strike can be responsible only for the £1.85 million shortfall in capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>The reason for two-thirds of the shortfall in spending on housing in 1970/71 was that the Government did not plan to spend this money in the first place.  The Capital Budget for the year did not provide the sum of money which, in 1968 money terms, corresponded to the target.  Two-thirds of the shortfall in housing investment last year was planned by the Government in the Capital Budget; one-third was due to the cement strike.  So much for the honesty of the Government's explanations. <Col N="1128" /> The cut back in housing was planned by the Government.  It is there in black and white in the Capital Budget.  The amount they provided was less by something of the order of £3,500,000 in 1968 money terms than the amount they set out in their Third Programme one year earlier.  Even that figure was not spent because of the cement strike.</P>

Housing expenditure in 1968 money terms was short by £3,500,000 of the target figure and by about £4,500,000 in current money terms, because the Government planned to cut it back by that amount, and another £1,500,000 to £2,000,000 was lost because of the cement strike. The figures are there and if the Government have any other explanation to give we shall be glad to hear it in due course.</P>

      <P>The Government said mendaciously that the cut back in housing expenditure last year was due to the cement strike.  Only one third <Col N="1129" /> of it was due to that.  However, if that had been true one would expect that the provision for housing in the current year, in comparison with last year would show such an increase that we would be back at the target level again.  Nothing of the kind has happened. What are the plans for this year?  The plan for this year involves an increase in spending which is only 5 per cent above last year's estimate &mdash;I emphasise last year's estimate.  It is an increase of £1.76 million or 5 per cent of last year's estimate.  By how much does the Parliamentary Secretary think that building costs are increasing annually?  Would he seriously suggest they are rising by only 5 per cent?  He knows perfectly well the increase is more than that.  Therefore when the Government plan an increase of 5 per cent in current money terms they are planning a cut in the real volume of housing activity.  Therefore, far from the cement strike being the cause of a temporary drop last year in housing activities the Government are planning this year to cut housing activity below the level for last year which itself fell short of the target by something like £3,500,000 or £4,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unnecessary to say it; we have, indeed.  However, that is a matter for the past.  What I am concerned about is the Government's plans to cut housing still further in the future.  The Government's first priority in any difficulty is to cut back on housing.  That is what they plan to do here.  It is clear, one year after the other, the Government are cutting back on the target level of spending on housing, and at the end of this programme the amount spent on housing may well be from 15 to 20 per cent below what they promised to spend in the Third Programme. Did they ever intend to fulfil that promise?  If so, why is housing the first thing they decide to cut?  Why do they pick on housing, agriculture and education?  What Minister will tell us the answer to this?  We have had no word about these cuts from any Minister. <Col N="1130" /> There has been no explanation, just a cover up, an attempt by silence to suppress the whole matter in the hope that the Opposition will not draw attention to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>At the expense of the poor, those on the dole, those without housing.  They are the people who are hit, hit by inflation, in the first instance, and hit by the Government's remedy for inflation, in the second instance. Next I want to turn to education. Here, by comparison with the target, the cut is from £69 million to £65.2 million in 1968 money terms, a 5 per cent cut.  The reason given for this is:</P>
      <P>In education the growth rate was affected by the measures taken generally in 1970-71 to curb the rate of increase in public expenditure.</P>
      <P>That does not explain very much.  First of all, why should public expenditure be cut below the level, proposed in the Third Programme?  What failures of Government policy have caused this? Secondly, if public expenditure has to be cut why pick on education, housing and agriculture?  I would like any Deputy on the other side of the House to tell us the reason why these three have to be cut.  Why is this the characteristic feature of Fianna Fáil policy? We are entitled to an explanation.  The Government cannot go around publishing programmes like this, publishing reviews that tell us how they are failing to meet the targets, and telling us they have cut back deliberately.  There is nothing inadvertent about this.  They tell us this is the result of the plan to cut back expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cuts in expenditure on housing and education are compensated to some degree, although not, of course, completely, by additional spending under the heading of income maintenance. Nobody on this side of the House will challenge the desirability of increasing the income maintenance payments, but we are entitled to know why a Government which two years ago planned a particular rate of growth for <Col N="1131" /> income maintenance, for housing, for education and for health, should two years later reverse these growth rates. Two years ago it seemed good to the Government to plan for an 8½ per cent increase in the volume of expenditure on education and of less than 5 per cent in the volume of expenditure on income maintenance.  Now they cut the educational growth rate from 8½ per cent to less than 5½ per cent and raise the income maintenance rate from less than 5 per cent to 11½ per cent.  Such extraordinary changes involving more than doubling one figure and cutting the other back by 40 per cent must have some explanation.</P>
    <P>What kind of planning is going on here?  Was it that the Third Programme was drawn up without consulting the Departments concerned, that they were not asked their views?  That is not the case.  Every Department is fully consulted on these targets.  I know the mechanism, full consultation. It appears therefore that these Departments, Social Welfare, Education, Health, Local Government sent in their plans two years ago.  These plans were approved by the Government in the Third Programme and certain growth rates were set.  Some of these growth rates have to be more than doubled and some have to be cut by more than 40 per cent within two years.  How can any Government justify such an extraordinary lack of prescience and foresight?  What is the point in talking about planning if the variation between what is done and what is planned is so enormous in such a short period?  We are not talking here about a seven-year programme. One can understand that in the Second Programme over a period of seven years significant disparities were likely to arise between the plan and the performance towards the end of the period.  Seven years is too long for a medium-term plan.  However, within two years to end up spending the money so totally differently from what was planned argues an incoherence in Government policy or a total lack of regard for the targets once set and certainly reflects no credit on a Government which pretend, with <Col N="1132" /> diminishing credibility, to be in command of the economic situation.</P>
    <P>All this, of course, has had its impact on taxation.  It was a characteristic feature of the mismanagement of our economy during the period of the Second Programme that the burden of taxation during much of this period was at three times the planned rate, that is to say, whereas the Second Programme provided for an increase in taxation as a percentage of national output amounting to .35 percentage points each year, what actually happened was that it rose by 1.05 percentage points each year.</P>
    <P>The burden of taxation rose three times as fast as planned, which is a remarkable disparity in any plan.  I must tell the House because the Government will not&mdash;perhaps they are not even aware&mdash;that this disparity is somewhat reduced in the Third Programme and is now increasing at only double the planned rate.  That is what Fianna Fáil's Third Programme has done for us.  During this period of two years the burden of taxation as a percentage of gross national product has risen from 27.8 per cent to 31 per cent as we are told in the review.  However, the plan was that it would rise to 31 per cent in four years so that the burden of taxation has risen in two years by as much as had been planned for four years.  The consequence of this is that either they are going to continue raising the burden of taxation in the following two years so that once again the burden of taxation at the end of the period will be far greater than planned or, alternatively, they are not so that it will remain at 31 per cent in which case we would be in for a period of remarkable stringency in Government expenditure for two years.  Either way, we have evidence of continuous mismanagement on a massive scale.  Governments who persistently so organise their affairs that, having planned for an increase in taxation of a moderate and acceptable amount, then raise the rate first by three times the planned rate and then by twice the planned rate, are Governments that do not deserve the confidence of the people and they in a short period will lose the confidence of the people because the people <Col N="1133" /> are sensitive, and rightly so, to the burden of taxation.</P>
    <P>While people will accept moderate increases over a period of time if they are aware that the money is being put to good use, there is a limit to their endurance because if the rate growth is accelerated to such a degree that it becomes intolerable to people, this has a double effect, one which I welcome, which is that it diminishes credibility in the Government concerned but the other I do not welcome because it creates pressures against social welfare, against housing and against all those things on which money should be spent. The people become so obsessed by the increased burden of taxation that they are pushed to the right in the political spectrum.  This may be one of the consequences of the mismanagement of the economy by the present Government.</P>
    <P>That, then, is my interim report on the Third Programme.  Bearing in mind the terms of what I have had to say I suppose it is not surprising that a frightened and divided Government should hesitate to disclose the facts that I have disclosed.  In doing so, I have not been either selective or partial but I have emphasised the features which I considered it necessary to emphasise but no matter how objective I was being, I found it very difficult to have anything constructive or cheerful or creditable to say about the performance of the Government during the first two years of the Third Programme. In fact, I have adverted to almost all of the economic aggregates that are mentioned.  I have not picked the particular items that went wrong or others that went right because none of them went right.  All I omitted were the figures for population and employment not because they reflect any particular credit on Fianna Fáil but because I concentrated on the financial figures. However, now that I mentioned these factors, I suppose I should complete the job and give the figures.</P>
    <P>The Government planned for an increase in population of 74,000 people between 1968 and 1970 but we are told now that the increase was 34,000 people.  I suppose the others have had to emigrate or maybe they have not <Col N="1134" /> been born yet.  That is a large discrepancy in the Government's population plans&mdash;the target in population growth has been achieved only to the extent of 40 per cent&mdash;even for Fianna Fáil that is a rather wide margin.</P>
    <P>The labour force is also short of the target level and employment under each of the different headings is short of the target.  None of the targets for employment has been reached either in agriculture, industry or other sectors. However, one target has been overachieved, like the one with regard to reducing milk output, and that is the unemployment target.</P>
    <P>The plan was that in 1970 unemployment would be reduced from 61,000 in 1968 to 48,000.  Instead of that the figure has been increased by 7,000 so that unemployment stands at more than 40 per cent above the planned level.</P>

      <P>What is the Government's solution to all this?  How have they tackled this in their Budget? First of all, the Budget, on the face of it, is open to criticism as being unrealistic because the increase in revenue from buoyancy has been totally discounted and there is no provision for an unexpected expenditure. I do not think that can be challenged. Last year the Government planned for a buoyancy of £50 million but they got £54 million and this year they will probably get something around the same figure.  If the Budget of last year was wholly that of Deputy Haughey, he set an unfortunate precedent of discounting the whole increase in revenue and leaving nothing over to cope with increasing expenditure and thereby creating the danger of a large deficit. It is surprising that the present Minister for Finance should adopt the unusual practice of following Deputy Haughey.  However, we should not be premature in this and it may well be that it is the Government's intention this year, for the first time in history, to keep Government expenditure at the level planned and not to allow any excess expenditure whatsoever. Such good intentions have been enunciated in the past but maybe the intention now is real.</P>

    <P>I want to put it to the House that there are two alternative interpretations of the Budget in this respect&mdash; I am willing to accept either one&mdash; either the Government are not going to hold down expenditure and, as past experience would indicate, there will <Col N="1136" /> be a deficit in the Budget of £10 million or £15 million, or they are going to hold down expenditure and avoid a deficit in which case this would be the tightest year that Government Departments have ever faced, a year in which there will be no supplementary estimates whatever apart from those introduced and implemented in the Budget itself.  Perhaps the Budget will balance, but if it balances at the expense of an extraordinary tightness in expenditure under which no matter what happens or what crises arise be it in agriculture or some other sector&mdash; can anyone remember a year in which there was not the unexpected in agriculture?&mdash;there will be no more money for anyone.</P>

      <P>It is not for me to judge the Government.  I am merely putting the alternatives to the House. If the Government hold down expenditure and if, say, Deputy Dowling comes along looking for money for his constituents because of an increase in unemployment in his area, or if he finds that the agricultural population are not getting as much for the milk they produce on the farms in his area, he will not get any money or, if he does get it, there will be a Budget deficit.  As was the case last year, the Government have completely discounted the increase in Government revenue.  We look forward to the result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;about his agricultural constituents but he is apparently silent on the subject.  I am sorry about that.  Now, what shape has the Budget taken?  The crucial feature of the Budget, of course, is the increase in income tax and it is a very unusual <Col N="1137" /> increase in income tax in that it is a poll tax.  The amount charged is virtually the same for everybody.  There are a few people at the bottom end who will pay £9, £10 or £11 while everybody else pays £12, regardless of wealth.  Of course it can be argued that that is not a lot of money and it is not a lot of money for some people but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is a lot of money for other people.  For a Government at this stage of our history to introduce this regressive form of taxation, which will take the same amount of money from everybody regardless of income, is certainly a novel development. Once again it shows the extraordinary attitude of Fianna Fáil at this stage in their history and I say at this stage in their history advisedly. I would not hold that Fianna Fáil were always the party of the rich and were not concerned with the poor.  Fianna Fáil had an honourable tradition in the past but that was a long time ago and a long time in government corrupts and corrodes a Government and cuts them off from their roots.  Even if they have able Deputies like Deputy Dowling pressing on them the needs of constituents in his area a Government long in power may not be as sensitive to the claims of the poor, even as put to them by Deputy Dowling, as a Government newer to office may be, or as a party in their earlier years may have been.  Certainly the form of taxation chosen does not suggest much of a social conscience on the part of the party which chose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other alternatives were open to the party; some of them were canvassed in the papers and we were told that this great social reformer, the Minister, Deputy Colley, might perhaps introduce a capital gains tax or a wealth tax, that here was a man who would fearlessly attack the rich.  He very seriously attacked companies' profits last year thinking that that was the rich, so innocent is he of the distinction between company profits on the one hand and the money derived from dividends by wealthy shareholders on the other. <Col N="1138" /> However, when it comes to actually attacking the incomes of the rich, as distinct from attacking company profits, the Minister, Deputy Colley, was not so brave or noble.  No, a capital gains tax might hit certain people; a wealth tax might hit other people and the best kind of tax is a poll tax that hits everybody and takes a bigger chunk or proportion or share of the incomes of the poor than of the rich.  So much for the social conscience of the Government and of the Minister, Deputy Colley.</P>
    <P>The sum of £5 million is to come from that source and £2 million is to come from tightening up on tax avoidance. We will see.  I am always sceptical of measures to achieve increased income by tightening up on tax avoidance. Some of these will produce some results because they involve increasing interest charges on taxpayers, in the usual one-way process which the Revenue Commissioners are prone to adopt, but I doubt if £2 million will come out of it.  However, the Budget, as every Budget does, contains features which are to be welcomed and it would be wrong for us on this side of the House not to refer to them.  It is evident that the agitation on behalf of women's rights has had its first minimal victory. The Budget does show signs of responding to these claims.  The amount given is negligible but there is a sign of sensitivity to the rightful demands of those women's organisations which complained that women had been unfairly treated in matters of taxation and social welfare.  The Minister has shown some sensitivity here.  One may doubt whether this sensitivity would have been as great if the voices raised on this subject had not been so loud.</P>
    <P>The lesson here, as it has been throughout Fianna Fáil's period of office since 1958, is that if you want to get anything out of this Government you must shout pretty loudly and you must be prepared, if you are going to demand your rights, and willing to march and shout for them, for very repressive tactics but eventually if you are prepared to face these tactics, which of course are never directed against people who carry guns but only against peaceful demonstrators, if you are prepared to put up with these tactics, you <Col N="1139" /> may eventually get some concession. However, it is necessary to shout very loudly because this is a very deaf Government and they do not easily hear the demands of the poor or the demands of those who are treated unjustly. The women's organisations and Women's Lib. have achieved some small concessions which are useful and are to be welcomed.  One of these shows a certain enlightenment, the allowance for a housekeeper in the case of an unmarried mother.  It is right that, when the Government do show a sensitivity for just claims of this kind, they should be commended and should be encouraged to proceed further because they have a long way to go. The path for justice for women in this country is a long one.  There is the whole issue of equal pay for equal work, an issue which involves both social justice and economic good sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It has a long way to go even before it starts with this Government, never mind finishing, but it is something which fortunately, and Deputy O'Donovan may not agree with my adverb, will be forced on this Government when we join the EEC because whatever demerits Deputy O'Donovan may feel the EEC has, and I understand he has some reservations about it, nevertheless at least he will have to admit the EEC does enforce a measure of equal pay in participating countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>A measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is more than we might get from this Government if that pressure were not there.  Equal pay for equal work is something for which there is a strong economic case.  Of course I accept, as everybody must, that if overnight you are going to right injustices of this kind by raising the pay of all women to the level of the pay of men this would involve a very large sum of money&mdash;in the Public Service alone about £9 million&mdash;and done in a single year and accompanied, as it might well be, by equivalent pay claims for men seeking to maintain <Col N="1140" /> their unfair higher pay it might have considerable inflationary effects.  It would be necessary, economically, to spread the process over several years. It would be wrong and misleading to say that this matter could be resolved in one year or to say that any Government would resolve it in one year but it can be resolved in a relatively short period.</P>
      <P>There would always remain the problem arising from the fact that much of the work done by men and women is not the same work.  There is a self-segregation process involved and in all too many cases, even where the two kinds of work are not substantially different as regards the particular skills needed, or as regards one being heavy work and the other being light work, even when no such differences exist men have a tendency to segregate certain jobs to themselves to avoid what they have felt was the humiliation of doing the same work as women.  Anybody familiar with factory life will know what I mean.  Because of that and because in so many cases in industry men and women are doing different work there is room for evasion, all too much room for claiming that &ldquo;Oh, well, the work that men do is more productive or heavier in some way and should be paid more.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not suggest that it would be easy to introduce complete justice in this sphere.  It will be easy to do it technically in spheres like banking and the Public Service where men and women work side by side doing the same work and where the argument that there is some difference in the work does not apply.  There will be technical difficulties in industry particularly.  But from the economic point of view the problem could be resolved in a short space of years if the will were there, at least up to the point where people actually doing the same type of work would get the same pay.  Moreover, I believe that this is economically desirable and could have very beneficial social effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an observed fact and anybody familiar with our demographic statistics will know that the emigration of women in any given period is broadly and approximately similar to that of the emigration of men in a period some <Col N="1141" /> years earlier, that there is a process by which the number of the two sexes balance themselves up.  If there is a large emigration of men, and there still is today&mdash;something approaching one-third, or certainly one-quarter, of our younger men have had to emigrate even during the past decade of relative economic progress&mdash;where you get that situation you are not going, even if you provide jobs for them, to keep women in the country because instinctively they feel that their prospects of marriage are greatly reduced by the departure of a large proportion of men and they will follow them in substantial numbers.  That has been the position here decade after decade.  Therefore if in this country you have, as you have at the moment, a situation far removed from full employment for men, but something close to full employment for women, because women's wages are kept artificially low and there is an artificial attraction to employers to take them on rather than employ men, you then find that although you have created, rather artificially, full employment for women the women will not remain even though there are jobs for them because if the men go they will, some years later, instinctively follow them. So you will get a situation where you have over-full employment for women in many cases and where there is pressure for married women to come into work because there are not enough single women.  While I am against any discrimination against married women working, I think an economic system where the job situation eventually is one in which married women are called into work ultimately replacing men, is a mad and lunatic system. That is the effect of our present system because, by having artificially low wage rates for women, you encourage employers to employ women to such an extent that there is over-full employment; the single women then have to emigrate because of the imbalance of the sexes in the population and you are left with a shortage of women and married women are pulled into work and each one of them is effectively replacing a man.</P>
    <P>If we could bounce up wages, if the artificial incentive to employ women <Col N="1142" /> by making them artificially cheap to employ were eliminated by equal pay for equal work, then we would have a situation in which women would be replaced by men in employment and each man in employment would, as to nine out of ten of them in any case, get married within a few years and would keep in the country a woman who otherwise would have to emigrate. Consequently, equal pay for equal work would achieve more in this country to reduce emigration than any other single thing we could do.  It is a short run solution, a partial solution to emigration; it does not solve it completely but it will eliminate a lot of unnecessary emigration because every extra man employed in lieu of a woman through eliminating the artificial incentives to employ women that we have at present will in time, because nine out of ten of them get married, keep two people in the country for one job shifted from woman to man.  That is why, as somebody concerned with society as well as the economy, it seems to me that even if there are costs&mdash;and there are costs involved in achieving equal pay for equal work&mdash; this should be a high priority here. It would perceptibly reduce the level of emigration in this country, even if the net number of people employed were not increased, because of the increase in men employed as against women.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, fully endorse the move towards equal pay for equal work.  I find on examining the proposals put forward by the women's organisations which are active at the present time that there is virtually nothing in them that one cannot endorse.  There may be problems in some cases as to the cost of implementing justice in a single year because if a society is very unjust, remedying those injustices can be expensive. It may take several years to sort out these problems.  The claims they make are just and well argued claims and I commend to everybody who has the opportunity of doing so the documents they have produced in which they have brought to our attention things to which we have not paid sufficient attention in the past.  I believe the pressures they are creating will, as this Budget shows, for the first time, <Col N="1143" /> change the situation radically and that this agitation is well worth while although it is a sad commentary on this House and this Government that pressures of this kind are needed to achieve simple justice.</P>
    <P>This is only one of many injustices. We have injustices involving our pensioners. The Budget makes another little step forward towards remedying this but still leaves pensioners who retired earlier two years behind the pensioners who retired more recently.  A difference I think of the order of 17 per cent remains and this cannot be justified on any grounds.  On what possible ground can it be justified that somebody who retired, or whose husband retired if it is a widow, two years ago should have a lesser pension than one retiring now?  We have the aspiration to look after all children of the country equally and I do not think &ldquo;children&rdquo; there was meant to apply to those under 14 only; it meant all the people of our country and there is no ground for discriminating between people because of the particular dates they retired.  I am glad the Budget has done a little in this direction.  That leaves us with the point that it is little and that even at this stage the Minister is not able or willing to implement full pension parity.  I hope the next Budget will see that done.</P>
    <P>Where are we going from here?  I ask this question because nothing I have heard from the Government suggests that they have any idea of where we are going from here.  All they can say is that if there was not a Budget the economy would grow by 3 per cent and now that there is a Budget it will still grow by 3 per cent in 1971.  Beyond that there is a blank.  Have the Government looked beyond that?  Have they thought of the problems and prospects in the years ahead?  What is their vision of the future?  Where is the full employment report now, the challenge that was put up to them?  Do they accept its implications?  Are they planning to achieve the&mdash;I shall not say targets&mdash;results it was suggested in that document could be achieved if certain policies were implemented? Have the Government the courage to do the things that need to be done to <Col N="1144" /> achieve full employment in the next decade?  Do they believe full employment can be achieved in the next decade or do they completely reject this concept?  We do not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed it was.  We do not know because the Government have nothing to say beyond that in the year ahead the economy will grow at 3 per cent.  Beyond that they have no vision.  They do not offer us any prospects in 1971, any plans as to where we will be in 1980: they do not seem to know or care.  Yet, in the years ahead we face problems which are now in many cases foreseeable.  We know that the freeing of trade under the Free Trade Agreement will pose acute problems for many industries.  We know that the next three years will see the main brunt of the agreement borne by Irish industry.  We know that so far the effects have been fairly minimal, that much of the redundancy that has occurred so far has been for other reasons&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect.  If the Deputy would wonder more quietly I could get on with my speech.  We know that in the footwear industry unemployment has been caused by the reduction in tariffs and it is quite clear that what has happened there has been an erosion of the home market as a result of tariff reductions not compensated for by an equivalent increase in exports.  In other industries, however, where there has been some erosion of the home market, as in the clothing industries, this has been, on an industry basis, compensated for by increasing exports.  This does not mean that individual firms may not have suffered: one firm may be expanding its exports while another is being hit in the home market.  Therefore, there may be and are cases where clothing firms are facing redundancy even though the clothing industry as a whole is maintaining its position because of the growth in exports by certain firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> Certainly, in the footwear industry I would agree with Deputy O'Donovan that there free trade is beginning to take its toll but the other cases of redundancy are rather recent and I say this not because I want to diminish the impact of the Free Trade Area Agreement on industry and redundancy but because I want to warn that these effects have yet to come and will be superimposed upon the redundancy coming for other reasons at the moment&mdash;partly because of the Government's mismanagement of the economy, partly because of excessive increases in wages and salaries that have made Irish goods uncompetitive at home and abroad and other reasons. But the redundancy yet to come from the freeing of trade will be superimposed on these and we shall face a significant level of redundancy in the year ahead.  There is, as yet, no sign of the Government facing this problem realistically.  It is now ten years since CIO put it to the Government that they should face up to this problem, that there should be an attempt to assess where redundancy would hit, that from the private reports on individual firms carried out by the CIO team it would be possible to assess which towns were likely to suffer redundancy and that something should be done to establish new industries in these places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What has been done about that?  Nothing.  No steps have been taken.  If redundancy occurs the Government rushes in too late to do anything about it and by the time new industries are established half or most of the workers are gone.  But this is foreseeable.  One could say, for example, that ten years ago when these discussions took place that whenever a question arose about the impact of redundancy on a particular town, one town jumped to everybody's lips.  I recall no discussion of this in which Clara was not mentioned.  It was such an obvious case that it was the example given of a town in Ireland which would suffer redundancy under free trade conditions.  Nothing was done about it.  Everybody knew that Clara would be the first town to be <Col N="1146" /> hit.  Any Government that had human compassion or concern or had any wit or ability to plan would have diverted industries to Clara which, through their expansion, would take up this slack of employment when the town was hit.  It cannot be that the Government alone was unaware that Clara would be the town to be hit, that none of the civil servants mentioned Clara was the town on everybody's lips.  The Government must have known about it yet they did not care enough to do anything.  There is no industrial location policy and there has been no attempt to plan new industry in the places likely to be hit.  There has been no foresight and no attempt to look ahead.  The next three years will be difficult and they will be much more difficult in human terms for many people because of the Government's neglect.</P>
      <P>The problems of redundancy are remediable to a large degree; certainly the blow could be cushioned and in many cases workers could be retrained. How many people have been trained so far?  Is it eight?  We just do not have retraining at this stage and nothing has been done about it either.  This could have been done; after all we have had ten years of preparation.  It is no good saying a longer transitional period is needed.  We have known since the late fifties that free trade was coming; it is now 1971.  What have the Government done?  They have made no real preparations and have shown no sign of concern for the people who are going to lose their jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that free trade has to come and as far as the EEC is concerned I accept the gains from membership will be so much greater than the losses that these losses have to be accepted, but if they have to be accepted it is because there will be great gains to the economy and the farming community and others who will benefit through membership of the EEC must be prepared to set aside some of these gains to help those people who are going to suffer hardship through redundancy brought about by the EEC.  Those who are going to benefit have a duty to ensure that the hardship brought about for some people will be remedied, yet <Col N="1147" /> we have no such scheme and no such attempt being made.  The Government lack the imagination, the concern or the determination to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>One can see a brighter prospect when one looks beyond the mid-seventies, certainly within the EEC, and I believe it could be possible to have something like full employment in 1980 if, in the years ahead, we have a Government which will really attempt to plan the economy and a Government concerned to achieve results and know how to achieve results.  I am not pessimistic but I see grave difficulties in the years immediately ahead.  I am, however, pessimistic about achieving anything with a Government which have shown themselves incapable of facing any of the problems.</P>
    <P>The <i>Review of 1970 and Outlook for 1971</i> from which I have been reading reviews a number of Government policies in regard to the Third Programme. It tells us about manpower policy but nobody reading it would get the same impression that the OECD got.  It tells us about all kinds of little things which are being done, 200 people trained there&mdash;not retrained but trained&mdash;so many other people trained somewhere else but it does not tell us what it should have told us that there has been a complete failure to develop this programme rapidly.  It took the OECD to tell us that and when the OECD Report showed up the Government's deficiencies in training even in this stringent Budget the Government have made available another £200,000 for the purpose because they were shown up internationally for their failure in this respect.  It is not enough for the Opposition to say it.  We can put it across the House to the Government year after year and they will pay no attention to it; it is only when a foreigner comments on the economy that the Government jump to action, because that is the gospel from outside.  Something has at last been done; an extra £200,000 has been made available and I hope it will be well spent.  It is a drop in the ocean for the job that has to be done if we are to prepare for EEC membership but, thank goodness, somebody, even <Col N="1148" /> if it is the OECD, has galvanised the Government into some kind of action in an area where the pace of progress has been so incredibly slow over the past few years.</P>
    <P>I shall pass over the incomes policy in silence.  Nothing I could say would add anything to this subject because there is not the glimmer of an idea of an incomes policy on the Government's part.  All they have done is sabotage any attempts at an incomes policy in the past few years.</P>
    <P>With regard to regional policy, there is nothing because all the Government have done is to sabotage regional policy since the idea of a regional policy was first mooted in 1962.  They have referred the idea from one committee to another.  They have postponed decisions indefinitely so that today we are still at the stage where committees are reporting to other committees and reports are going to be produced as a result of which somebody, some time, somewhere in some decade will take a decision, but not now&mdash;never now. It has been postponed indefinitely in the hope, perhaps, that another Government will have to take the decisions that Fianna Fáil are afraid to take.</P>
    <P>Dublin continues to grow because there is no counter-attraction.  The Government have not the guts to choose where they are going to put industry and not having chosen anywhere there is no infrastructure anywhere for industry on an adequate scale and so industry continues to come to Dublin. Dublin grows and the country withers through lack of decision by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>How many years is it since we were told that restrictive practices were to be reformed and changed and legislation was to be introduced to extend the powers to deal with restrictive practices and speed up the process?  It is here in the Third Programme and year after year we are promised that legislation will be brought in.  Legislation was promised in the first and second annual programmes, but where is it?  Like so much other legislation it has not reached this House.  The Government have other things to do than to be bothered with legislation in the interests of the public.  These are the <Col N="1149" /> policies which are advocated in this report and while there are a few pages on each there is nothing to be said because nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>All I can say in conclusion is that as between this Government and their performance and any alternative Government I do not think the public need be in much doubt as to which would yield the results.  The contrast between the Government we see before us at Question Time and the kind of Government which could exist in this country, if faces were changed, is one the public are becoming conscious of. I do not think anybody listening to the inept attempt to cover up inaction and indecision from the Government side of the House and listening to the criticism that we on our side of the House make could doubt which side of the House knows what needs to be done and has the competence to do it.  I hope, perhaps following a Fianna Fáil Party meeting in the near future, the Government will give the country the opportunity of making the change which needs to be made in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>One becomes so accustomed to the wailing of Fine Gael and Labour Deputies that their wails have become monotonous.  No matter how they try they will not push the Fianna Fáil Party to the right. Fianna Fáil in this and past Budgets have been conscious of the lot of people who are in need of assistance. The Minister's brief, and the documents circulated with it, make it easy for the Opposition to understand what is being done in this Budget.  A number of things have not been done. Some of the things I should have liked to have seen done have not been done but, so far as I am concerned, I will always ensure that this party is more than conscious of the weaker sections in our community and of the needs of the community in general in the realm of housing, improved educational facilities, better health services, better social welfare benefits and a more intensified industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like all the members of my party, I am concerned about the things that really matter.  Last year was a dismal year in many respects.  We had two <Col N="1150" /> prolonged strikes.  We had the bank strike, which lasted for six months; it drove some people into mental institutions and others into bankruptcy. Industrialists who were trying to keep the country ticking over were, literally speaking, put up against the wall by the bank managers at the behest of their superiors.  Great credit is due to those industrialists who kept their factories and their workshops going. The bank strike seriously damaged the economy.  It impeded progress and increased unemployment.  I trust the Minister will ensure that the necessary means will be found to prevent any recurrence of this type of nonsensical dispute.</P>
    <P>We had the cement strike which deprived families of accommodation, increased unemployment, delayed the completion of new factories and deprived people of opportunities of employment.  There was a valid case for additional benefits by way of pay increases.  It would seem to me that some kind of madness has set in, a madness which engenders prolonged strikes, strikes which disrupt the whole economy.  The <i>Review of 1970 and the Outlook for 1971</i> records the fact that, as a result of the six months closure of the banks and the 21 weeks cement strike, 786,000 and 88,000 man days respectively were lost.  The total loss for the whole year was actually 1,008,000 man days lost.  This is a serious situation and I hope it will be tackled at some stage by both industrialists and trade unions.</P>
    <P>The trade unions have made efforts recently in the national agreement.  A better system of industrial relations will have to be evolved, a system which will eradicate this type of madness from our economy.  No strike should last over a period of six months. Workers must make their protest but the necessary machinery should be there to ensure that the economy is not disrupted.  The workers have ultimately shown their entitlement to the benefits that were being withheld from them.  Serious consideration will have to be given to that particular aspect. The choice is between a prosperous, viable economy or a stagnant economy, such as we had last year.  It is depressing <Col N="1151" /> to discover that the growth rate was only 1¼ per cent.  I appeal to industrialists and trade unions to take steps to ensure that the necessary machinery is evolved to prevent prolonged disputes, disputes which drive people into mental institutions and into bankruptcy, disputes which impede the progress of the nation.</P>
    <P>We have agitators in our community, people who are only too happy to engender strikes.  They have openly stated that this is their aim.  Their ambition is to disrupt the economy.  If these are weeded out this kind of national sabotage will cease.  I am quite certain that responsible trade union officials and employers will be able to sit down together and work out some scheme designed to prevent prolonged strikes.  These strikes do not benefit the weaker sections of our community.</P>
    <P>There would be no need for additional taxation if we all pulled our weight because we would then have a satisfactory growth rate, a growth rate which would provide the necessary finance to make more benefits available to those who need them.  Increases in social welfare benefits have been susbtantial.  These increases were, of course, given by Fianna Fáil Governments. Following the pattern of former years there is a further increase this year.  The increases are not what I would like them to be, but they will go some of the way to help those in need of assistance.  If we all pulled our weight there would be no need for additional taxation because we would have the growth rate essential to produce the finances required.</P>

If all pay their due share of taxation the burden on those who have no option will not be so heavy.</P>

      <P>I am speaking now of the dodgers and the fiddlers.  I may deal with the Deputy's point before I finish.  All these people must be dealt with to ensure an equitable system of taxation.  I welcome the steps the Minister has taken and I trust that those concerned and others who are dodging their responsibilities will be dealt with summarily.  There is dodging, too, in relation to differential rents.  There are people with two and three jobs who are dodging their tax responsibilities while those who are honourable and measure up to their responsibilities have to pay more in order to subsidise these dodgers.  They must go.  We must ensure that there is an equitable distribution of taxation, that everyone meets his responsibilities fully.  The longer we leave the situation unchecked the greater will be the difficulty in weeding out the parasites that are there at present.</P>
      <P>In relation to social welfare, I and other members of my party are conscious of the efforts made by Fianna Fáil over the years to ensure that the sections of the community which need attention get it.  Last year the new social insurance scheme for retirement at the age of 65 and pensions for invalids were introduced and a large number of people have taken these up. We now have a further development of these and the other schemes that were announced last year and the year before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see the old age contributory pension rate increased for a person with an adult dependant to <Col N="1153" /> £9.35.  This is a substantial increase on the rate which obtained some years ago.  We still think it is not enough and I and other members of my party will endeavour to ensure that the Government will continue to increase the allowances given each year to the old age pensioners, the people who have given so much to this nation and whose efforts in the dark days were very substantial.  They get all too little attention now from the community as a whole.  I am glad to say that the Government, conscious of this situation, have endeavoured to relieve it. I should like to see a greater sum given but the capacity of the purse is a vital factor.  The contributory personal rate of £5.50 is a substantial increase also on what was given a few years ago.  The widows' contributory pension has been increased and the allowance for each child made uniform. This was long overdue and I am glad the Minister has taken this step.  In regard to disability and unemployment benefit the personal rate and the rate for adult dependants have also been increased as also have the maternity allowance and the orphans' contributory pension.</P>
    <P>One would think, listening to the Opposition, that no increases were given in this year's Budget to anybody. The old age non-contributory pension and the blind pension have been increased, the widows' non-contributory pension, the deserted wives' allowance, the orphans' non-contributory pension and the unemployment assistance.  This is just a continuation of the services that have been provided and I am glad to say that every advance in the social welfare code has come from one Government and one Government alone and that is the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>The free travel for hardship cases to ensure a limited number of visits to children in institutions and hospitals, schools for mentally handicapped, reformatories and industrial schools, is a very creditable effort and shows the forward-thinking of the Minister for Finance in relation to a problem that was overlooked for too long.</P>
    <P>Public Service pensions have been increased. The increases will benefit <Col N="1154" /> civil servants, gardaí, teachers, members of the Defence Forces, local authority staffs and their widows.</P>
    <P>The new training centre for AnCo which is planned for the Donegal Gaeltacht and the provision of a new centre in Cork for training up to fully-skilled level is an important advance together with the immediate retraining facilities for workers who are disemployed due to closure of industries. Nobody can grumble about the amounts that have been made available there.</P>
    <P>The anti-evasion measures taken by the Minister are long overdue and I hope that, as time goes on, the other matters I mentioned will get the same attention and so ensure that the people who are dodging their responsibilities will meet them fully in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>In relation to housing development I am glad that additional moneys have been made available.  The figures for the past year have not been as satisfactory as one would have hoped but that was due to the prolonged cement strike.  It is heartening to see that there has been an upsurge in the number of houses that have been completed since the strike ended. I hope this trend will continue and that we will reach the high level we reached a year or so ago when we had a record number of dwellings completed. I am glad to see that the schemes being developed by the National Building Agency at Tallaght and at other centres are progressing in a very satisfactory manner.  I hope that at no stage will we have any tapering off in the development of housing.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government, who has many new ideas, is endeavouring to ensure a greater co-operative housing drive, to ensure that housing for industry is developed at a faster pace.  He has suggested the initiation of long-term contracts to ensure that contractors will be in a position to plan over a long period for a given number of houses.  This will help to ensure that we will meet the targets which were announced some years ago.  I am glad that the necessary finances have been made available to ensure that additional building land and additional services will be available so that the <Col N="1155" /> housing pressures which exist in this city at the moment can be eliminated in time.  The Dodder Valley drainage scheme will make quite a lot of land available for housing, and the Greater Dublin scheme will make 11,000 acres available.  These are in the planning stage and show clearly the Government's intention to ensure that the necessary lands are available for housing development in the city.  The necessary money has always been available for housing.</P>
    <P>There is now full employment in the building industry.  Workers can get employment in it if they are prepared to work.  We have seen advertisements in English newspapers recently from Irish contractors seeking semi-skilled personnel from abroad because they are unable to get workers here. This is a heartening sign.  I have spoken to workers who came back recently. Some of them are satisfied and others are not, but some of the problems here can be ironed out.  The important thing is that the demand is there for building workers and it is difficult to understand why those who are signing on at employment exchanges are not willing to take these jobs.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to try to ensure that no obstacle is placed in the way of the building construction programme.  We are well aware of the housing shortage in the city which is being aggravated by the increasing population.  There has been a drop in emigration, partly contributed to, I suppose, by the situation in Britain where employment is not as readily available as it was.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister that if there is any money available he should channel it into this sector of the economy to ensure that people who have no houses at the moment will have them in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Review of 1970 and Outlook for 1971,</i> it is regrettable to see that negotiations with representatives of the medical profession on the choice of doctor, which had reached an advanced stage, have not brought agreement on the scale of fees.  It is sad that because representatives of the Minister and the doctors cannot reach agreement people <Col N="1156" /> are being denied free choice of doctor and still must be content with the dispensary system.  I hope this will soon be resolved to the satisfaction of everybody so that this service can come into operation.  It is a pity that when the Minister and the Government were prepared to introduce the new scheme this breakdown should occur at the last moment.  I hope the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health will see that this difficulty will be resolved and that it will not drag on like the bank strike and the cement strike.  This, to me, is a type of strike.  It is a refusal to implement a scheme.  If the scheme were implemented the problem of fees could be discussed later on.</P>
    <P>The regional hospital boards have been referred to in the review.  I am a member of one of them and I can tell the House the system will work well for the betterment of patients and the whole community.  In the Eastern Regional Board we have a very effective group who have shown themselves to be deeply interested in the many problems.  The personnel may not measure up to the requirements of everybody but I accompanied them last week on a number of inspections and I am satisfied they are genuine in their desire to make the best possible services available.  I would ask the Minister quickly to iron out any impediments that may arise.</P>
    <P>I dealt earlier with the bank dispute and I mentioned the cement strike.  At this stage I should like to compliment the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on their efforts to end those major disputes. I also compliment them on the national wage agreement.  I trust we have entered a new period of industial peace when we can get down to tackling the problem of industrial development, to make industry more efficient so as to benefit both workers and employers.  We have reached a stage of maturity now to enable us to see that injustices and long strikes are eliminated.</P>
    <P>The question of professional fees, prices and profits must be tackled as soon as possible.  It is rather regrettable that during the changeover to decimal <Col N="1157" /> currency some shopkeepers availed of that opportunity to increase prices.  I was in touch with the Department of Industry and Commerce and they claim that they received few complaints, but there were many complaints from the housewife about the extra ½p or the extra 1p added on here and there.  We have heard no outcry from the shopkeepers such as we heard on previous occasions.  This is an indication that they are fully satisfied with the system.  The Department of Industry and Commerce have a responsibility in this matter and I would ask them to tackle it more forcefully.  There have been many price increases and they were visible to anyone who made a round-up of the shops during the changeover period. Some examination should be made of prices before decimalisation and prices today.  Despite the tags showing the dual prices, prices have gone up.  In some cases shopkeepers said they were confused by the new system.  The Department of Industry and Commerce should deal with the matter fully and fairly.</P>
    <P>The profit factor I mentioned is also mentioned in the booklet <i>Review of 1970 and Outlook for 1971</i>.  This is an important factor.  As a trade unionist, in common with other trade unionists I look forward to hearing more about it.  I hope we will get a full and comprehensive report on the question of profits.  Otherwise the workers will not be satisfied with statements so often made by employers about profits. As I said before, an important factor is the fiddling that is going on in relation to profits and hidden profits by people who are availing of devices to put more money in their pockets.  I hope this matter will be broughts to a conclusion at an early date and that we will be told the exact extent of the profits being made.  There is also the question of the control of professional fees.  Difficulties arise here because, instead of one visit being sufficient, people are brought back for two visits and charged at the same rate.  This is a delicate field.  It affects doctors, dentists and other professional people.  I hope we will hear something about this matter in the future.</P>
    <P>Once again I should like to congratulate the Minister for making available <Col N="1158" /> the money for the reliefs mentioned in the Budget.  So long as the party continue to carry out a policy of making improvements in the health services, in social welfare payments and industrial development, the party will retain the confidence of the people. Over the years we have pursued this policy and we will not be pushed to the right by Fine Gael or Labour.  We will not be intimidated by some of the cries we have heard.</P>
    <P>Some of these increases were possible only because of the taxation increases introduced in the Budget.  One of the taxation increases which yielded quite a substantial sum was opposed in the Division Lobbies by Fine Gael and Labour.  If they were successful in their opposition many of the benefits that the aged, the widow, the orphan, the deserted wife and other sections got under the Budget could not have been given to them.  This is in keeping with the outlook of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties over the years.  In the Division Lobbies they opposed the measures making financial provision for these increases.</P>
    <P>Once again I should like to stress to the Minister the question of the free choice of doctor.  I would ask him to ensure that this matter is rectified at the earliest possible moment so that people will have a free choice of doctor. We want to get away from the dispensary system which we have condemned so often and for so long in some parts of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrigidHoganOHiggins" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it this is a Budget of very little change.  Some weeks ago I read a speech by the Taoiseach in Cork in which he said that this was a pretty bad year economically for the country, and that we might expect a hard or though Budget.  I suppose after all the years I have been in this House I should not be naive enough to believe speeches that I read, but I did.  After the Budget which was introduced last week, one wonders when will we have the tough Budget?  Is this the first of many Budgets this year?  If this is not a tough Budget, will the next one be tough or will we have a further Budget in <Col N="1159" /> October which will certainly be tough?</P>
      <P>To my mind this is simply a wait-and-see Budget&mdash;wait and see how the internal situation in the Fianna Fáil Party develops and whether it will be necessary to go to the country.  If the Taoiseach finds that he has to go to the country then this is a reasonably easy Budget on which to face the people. The Fianna Fáil Cabinet must be examining the position but it behoves them to forget the good of the Fianna Fáil Party and for once think of the good of the country.  In trying to close the widening gaps in the party and trying to shore up the desertions from the party, they are neglecting to run the country.  They are running the Fianna Fáil Party.  This is not good enough.  This is not the job they were elected to do.  They were elected to run the country and not just to organise the Fianna Fáil Party.  I accept that there is internal strife in every political party at some stage of its career or existence.  It should not be fought out on the Cabinet benches. It should be fought out in Opposition. If the Taoiseach had any interest in the good of the country he would go to the people and let them decide.  I am quite sure that, as things are now, the people would decide that a term in opposition would do Fianna Fáil the world of good, and I agree with them on that.</P>
      <P>It cannot be said that this is a good Budget.  It is just, as we say in the West, mixed-middling.  Some concessions have been made and I would be the first to praise the Minister for making them, notably in the social welfare field.  Pensions to non-contributory and contributory pensioners have been increased.  There has been a sharp rise in the cost of living and this rise has led to the necessity for such increases. The introduction of the turnover tax caused a sharp rise also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told that the effects of the turnover tax would not be noticeable. The turnover tax was then doubled and this afforded shopkeepers an opportunity of increasing prices yet again. Decimalisation resulted in further increases. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has told us that there have <Col N="1160" /> been 400-odd complaints of overcharging, but anyone shopping in this country can see the increased prices in every shop.  Even in this House we must note the effects of decimalisation.  The prices in the restaurant have gone up but neither the food nor the service has improved.  The shopkeepers have rounded up prices and this has meant an increase in cost to the housewife. I shop in Dublin during the week and in my constituency at the weekends. Living in rural Ireland is more expensive than living in Dublin.  All commodities, except milk and meat, are dearer in the country than in Dublin. In supermarkets there are cut-prices to lure the housewives.  There are very few supermarkets in my constituency and the unfortunate housewives in Clare-South Galway are paying more for their commodities than the Dublin housewives are.</P>
    <P>Last year pensions for deserted wives were introduced for the first time.  We had been advocating this move for a considerable time.  Widows with contributory pensions get their pensions whether they are working or not.  They qualify for pension purposes because their husbands had insurance stamps or they themselves had insurance stamps. Deserted wives should qualify for pensions whether they work or not.  Surely their husbands had insurance stamps before they left.  These women work quietly and pay for stamps.  In some ways the deserted wife is in a worse position than the widow because she cannot marry again.  There cannot be many deserted wives in this category. It would not cost the State much to give them pensions.  They deserve them. They work quietly rather than admit that they have been deserted.</P>
    <P>There was a time when one could look forward to some items coming down in price as a result of the Budget. The price of butter or flour might be reduced.  Nowadays this is not so.  The Government say that social welfare recipients are getting more and that this compensates for the increases in the cost of living.  Many people are living on fixed incomes.  There are many men who provided for an income of about £1,000 ten years ago in preparation for their old age.  That sum was considered an adequate income then.  Nowadays a <Col N="1161" /> man living in his own house, paying his rates and supporting his wife would be very badly off on such a sum.  Many people in this city live on fixed incomes. Such people are badly off but they never look for assistance; they will not admit they are badly off and they do not know where to look for help.  No Budget ever helped these people.  At one time it was a good thing to own one's house but nowadays it is only a penalty.  The rates all over the country are very high.  Something should be done about the rates of people living on fixed incomes.  I am sure the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance could think of a scheme to help these people who are hard hit by the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>This Budget gave only small concessions. People with children in hospital were granted a concession to enable them to visit the children free of cost.  How often will such people have to write to their local Deputies and have representations made to the various Departments in this matter? How is the &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; to be decided? I have become sceptical of this form of vague concession.</P>
    <P>The new income tax provisions are unfair.  People in the low scale will pay the same rate as wealthy people. The Minister has said that 20,000 people will escape the net, but I feel that 80,000 extra people will be trapped.  The extra £12 per annum will bring in a considerable amount of money to the State.  I promised various women's organisations that I would raise the question of the working wives who pay enormous income tax.  Two types of married women work.  There are those who work to help their families and there are those who work because they feel that running a home and minding small children is not enough for them.  There is the male idea that once a girl is married, overnight she becomes a perfect wife.  This is not true.  Many clever girls cannot get satisfaction from running a home and I feel that such people should be allowed to work if they have somebody competent to run the home.  I do not see why they should pay enormous income tax.  The unfortunate woman who works to supplement <Col N="1162" /> her husband's income should not be taxed so heavily.  Many firms are glad to employ these women but they pay them ridiculously low wages. We should be ashamed to admit that female employees are still regarded as cheap labour.  Some firms are making an effort to adjust their thinking and value the services of male and female in business.  This must come, and in terms of income tax it must come also. You should not have to pay a penal tax just because you are a female. I suppose if we say this often enough we will get somewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister seemed to be vague in what he said with regard to the health insurance scheme.  As far as I understand it, all those who are now eligible to pay 10s a day will have to be insured compulsorily for hospital services only.  This is a good thing in theory but I look with trepidation on the brave man who will face the farmer in the hills of Clare or the hills of Clare-South Galway and say to him: &ldquo;We want £X per week for hospital services.&rdquo;  He will say: &ldquo;Very good. sir, but I was never in hospital in my life and why should I pay for it now.&rdquo; All people who cannot obviously insure themselves under the voluntary health insurance scheme should be in some sort of scheme which will pay for all medical services.  Thank God, most of us do not have to end up in hospital but many people at some stage during the year have to have recourse to their dispensary doctor or to the hospital dispensary and find afterwards they might even have to go to hospital.  An insurance scheme to cover all medical services would be of enormous benefit to those people.  An insurance scheme to cover hospitalisation compulsorily will be a difficult thing to work.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister said that this will net about £2 million to the Exchequer. I would like him when he replies to tell the House how much of that £2 million will go to the local authorities to relieve the burden on the rates.  The hospital services are the main burden on the rates at the moment and it seems to me that the people caught in this bracket will still have to pay enormous rates as well as insurance for hospitalisation.  This <Col N="1163" /> needs to be clarified for everybody before we go much further.</P>
    <P>This Budget had some concessions for farmers.  It looked good on paper. On the night of the Budget I met a friend of mine who said: &ldquo;Those soand-so farmers get something in every Budget and nobody else gets anything.&rdquo; This is the thought of people in urban areas.  They think that the farming community get everything for nothing and that the rest of the country is paying for them but this is not so. The income of farmers has fallen well below that of other sections in the community.  It is rather fashionable for those in urban areas to say that the farmers do not pay income tax, that they get away with murder.  If the farmers had to pay income tax those living in urban areas would be horrified to see how few of them are eligible to pay income tax.  The farming income in many cases is much lower than that of working people in urban areas and allows them to escape the income tax net.  I have heard it argued that a farm worker on the average farm in rural Ireland is much better off than the small or medium sized farmer today.</P>
    <P>The milkmen got a slight increase.  I can understand this because we rushed madly into milk, then we had a surplus in butter and now we have a scarcity of butter and having lured people out of milk with the beef incentive scheme they have to be lured back into milk now.  I would say that, and the agitation of the ICMSA, got this extra money on the price of milk. The housewife feels that when she is paying a high price for a pint of milk the farmer producing the milk is a multimillionaire.  She forgets that the middleman gets much more than the farmer producing the milk.  We say in my part of the country that the man driving the truck to the creamery gets much more than the farmer producing the milk.</P>
    <P>There was an increase given to the farmers for hogget ewes.  This scheme was introduced a few years ago.  I viewed this with concern although I was glad to see some of my sheep farmer friends getting something.  Before this year is out this House will <Col N="1164" /> view this scheme with concern.  This headage payment per hogget naturally lures people into breeding extra sheep. Now we have a situation where as a result of a very mild winter lamb numbers in this country are enormous and the sheep trade is very sluggish.  The French market was well opened at this time last year but if it does not open soon there will be a surplus of lamb in the country.  We budget for increased production but we do not budget for increased markets.  There is no use in farmers producing extra if they cannot get rid of the surplus lambs.  The Government will have to think of ways and means of financing organisations to go out and look for markets for those surplus lambs.  We did the same as this in milk production.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Connell, speaking this evening, had a good swipe at the Tynagh Mines in my constituency.  His argument was that the Government were allowing all those royalties to slip out of the country.  With due respects to the learned doctor, he was talking through his hat.  Tynagh is located in my constituency and I have known, as well as nearly everybody in County Galway, that there were minerals in Tynagh.  When I was a very young child a woman came to our house with a most unusual wedding ring.  She explained that this was her grandmother's and that the gold for it was mined in Tynagh during the last century.  I also knew that the people of Tynagh could not rear geese or ducks because there was too much metal in the soil.  I presume the Government were aware there were minerals there but they did not feel justified in taking the risk of spending enormous sums of money, which people are required to do when they go into mining, which is a very speculative concern.</P>
    <P>I regret, as Deputy O'Connell did, that all this money goes out of the country but I will say this in favour of the set-up in Tynagh.  It is mostly Canadian money that is in it.  Most of the people are Irish and there is a lot of Canadian money but they give big employment and they are paying very good wages.  Far be it from me or the 400 people employed there to say: &ldquo;We will not take your money because it is Canadian money&rdquo;. when <Col N="1165" /> our own Government cannot provide us with the money.  Thank God somebody is providing a decent wage and a decent standard of living in that area.  As far as I am concerned if the Government are not prepared to risk money on those ventures anybody who is prepared to risk money, to pay decent wages and to give good terms of employment is very welcome in Clare-South Galway or anywhere else in the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>At one time there were some hardy annuals for taxation.  However, cigarettes are no longer in this category.  It appears there has been a considerable decrease in the number of smokers and probably taxation in this instance has reached saturation point.  Few can grumble at the increased taxation on beer and spirits.  I know the publicans and brewers will but the figure of £1¼ million per week spent on alcohol is very startling.  If people are prepared to pay such a large amount for luxuries they can pay a little extra tax in order to provide a few concessions for the weaker sections of the community.</P>
    <P>This is very much a &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; Budget.  It does not do much one way or the other, although it has given the usual few increase to social welfare. The prime cause of most of our ills is the enormous problem of inflation but the budget has done nothing to try to correct this.  All the experts say we are now reaching the stage of &ldquo;galloping inflation&rdquo;.  Ministers regularly repeat this at public function and in this House the Taoiseach warns us about it, but nothing is done to tackle the problem. It is time the Government did their job, namely, to govern.  It will not be an easy job to arrest inflation and obviously the Government are not prepared to take the tough measures that are necessary.  We all know the reason but the state of the Fianna Fáil Party should not take precedence over the job of running the country.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Browne this evening.  The Deputy's cure for everything appears to be a doctrinaire socialism. I admit I do not understand the various shades of socialism.  Deputy Browne has a 19th century concept of the social condition where working men are very badly off and are not treated <Col N="1166" /> fairly by management and the management are as wealthy as Croesus.  In a small country like this there is no distinction in the class structure.  I admit there are a few wealthy men in this country, mostly in big business, but in rural Ireland there is little distinction between the working man and the average country solicitor, doctor or teacher. I imagine Dr. Browne would consider the latter as the middle and upper income groups.  There are very many working people who are better off than those whom the Deputy would regard as the &ldquo;other class&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The people in the managerial or executive classes have made money because they have worked hard.  It is no good to say that there are workers and drones and that the management are the drones.  We are all workers, whether white collar or any other class.  If we want this country to prosper we must get rid of the notion that the workers are out to get all they can for as little work as possible&mdash;which I do not think is true&mdash;and that the management are out to fleece the workers.  This is nonsense. The time has come for us to realise that if we want to do something for the good of the country all of us, whether workers or management, must do an honest day's work for an honest day's pay.  It is fashionable at the moment to be patriotic.  There are those who say it is patriotic to rush to the north with guns and to die for Ireland. To be really patriotic let us do our work diligently.  When everybody is working for the one objective&mdash;the good of the country&mdash;in the long run it will improve relations between workers and management, it will improve conditions and we will have more money in future Budgets to allocate to the needy.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand this theory that socialism would cure all.  Neither socialism nor capitalism will do this. We must realise that we live in a society where we will always be faced with difficulties.  The Government's attitude of doing nothing in the hope that things will change&mdash;perhaps that there will be an election in the near future and Fianna Fáil will not have to bring in the next Budget to tackle the problems &mdash;is bad policy.</P>
    <P>This Budget gave a few concessions <Col N="1167" /> and we are grateful for them.  However, it did nothing to keep down the cost of living, to increase employment or to reduce emigration.  Will we get a Budget in July or October that will make a serious attempt to tackle all our problems?  We need to budget for a full year and to budget for a surplus, not a deficit.  As I read it, the present Budget will produce a deficit next year.  This is not good government and in the long run it will militate against Fianna Fáil. Until the Cabinet take courage in hand and bring in tough measures we must sit and wonder when we will have another Budget.</P>

      <P>The theme of this Budget is set out in one sentence: &ldquo;The concessions and the tax increases which I have announced bring revenue and current expenditure into balance at £551 million which is £61 million or 12½ per cent greater than the outturn in 1970-71.&rdquo;  It is the oldest trick in the game, to compare the position at the beginning of this year with what it was at 31st March, 1970.</P>

      <P>I understand that Dublin Corporation propose to provide 60 dwellings, comprising 24 four-roomed and 26 five-roomed, houses, at St. Patrick's Cottages, Rathfarnham.  As I have not yet received the corporation's <Col N="1046" /> proposals for the acceptance of a tender for building the houses, I am not in a position to say what the total cost of the scheme will be or when it will be completed or let to tenants. The allocation of tenancies of these dwellings will be made by the corporation in accordance with their approved scheme of letting priorities.  This scheme provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that &ldquo;in the allocation of dwellings preference shall be given to local applicants, other things being equal, subject to the priorities set out in the scheme&rdquo;.  I have received no petition regarding this matter, and I understand that no such petition has been received by the corporation.</P>

In so far as I am aware, planning authorities are notifying these prescribed bodies in appropriate cases and I do not consider any reminder in this regard is required from me.  Development which is proposed by a planning authority to be carried out in its own district is exempted development for the purpose of the Act provided of course that it does not materially contravene the development plan for the area.</P>
