      <P>I have not got my brief with me, but I can tell the Deputy that, as I indicated some time back to the House, the Minister was having another look at the Bill and, in the light of his experience of the planning procedures, since he became Minister, he has decided to introduce some new provisions which, in the first instance, will have to be discussed with other Departments that might be affected and may possibly have to come before the Government. It is unlikely the Bill will be introduced before the end of this session but the Minister hopes to introduce it early next session.</P>

      <P>Targaim: Go léafar an Bille don Dara Uair.</P>
      <P>Bille gearr teicniciúil é seo.  Sé aidhm an Bhille ná na h-aimhrialtachtaí agus na h-éigeartaí a tharlaíonn i gcás rátaí ar oidhreachtáin a úsáidtear le h-aghaidh gnóthaí poiblí, eolaíochta nó carthanachta a chur ar ceal.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to terminate the rating of certain rents, under the system known as the rating of half rents, with effect from the 1st April, 1971.  Under the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, 1849, a person receiving rent from property, the occupier of which was exempt from normal rating because of its being used for public, scientific or charitable purposes, was to be rated on a valuation equal to half of the rent.  At that time rates were, in effect, shared by the owner and occupier of rented property and the provision in the 1849 Act ensured that the owner would still be liable for his share of the rates where the occupier secured exemption by reason of his occupying the property for public, scientific or charitable purposes.</P>
      <P>In modern times, when rates are ordinarily a charge on the occupation of property, the levying of rates under the half-rent system on the owner of property on the basis of a fraction of the rent he receives is anomalous. Furthermore, the system may give rise to hardship in individual cases as it may result in an owner paying more in rates than he receives in rent.  The purpose of the legislation, therefore, is to discontinue the system of half-rent rating altogether from the current financial year.  The exemption from rates of the occupiers of property is not affected in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State, as occupier of property subject to half-rents, is affected by the proposal.  The State pays a bounty-in-lieu of rates to the local authority in <Col N="2155" /> respect of premises it occupies.  Where the owner of State property is subject to rates on the &ldquo;half-rent&rdquo;, the State bounty-in-lieu of rates is reduced by the amount which the owner pays in rates.  The State bounty-in-lieu of rates must now be increased to offset the amount the owner will no longer pay. It is estimated that in the current year the extra cost to the Exchequer will come to approximately £30,000.  This sum will, of course, go to the local authorities.  Some authorities themselves will have to face a slight additional charge also in respect of rates on half-rents which will not be offset by the State.  Despite the fact that the proposal will involve these relatively small extra charges on public funds, the proposal is a sound one in that it removes an obvious anomaly in the rating system, one that can involve injustice and can be dealt with without affecting the overall rating system, which must remain.  The abolition of the half-rent system was recommended by the interdepartmental committee on local finance and taxation in their second interim report.  The rating system as a whole will be dealt with in the forthcoming White Paper on local finance.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill, which removes the original liability of persons to be rated on rents received by them from property which is otherwise exempt from rating, taken together with section 3, which provides for the repeal of the various legislative provisions relating to the rating of rents set out in the Schedule, terminates the system of half-rent rating.</P>
    <P>The fraction of the rent on which rates are leviable was reduced below the original one-half by permanent legislation in relation to affected property in areas other than county health districts.  In the case of county health districts the reduction&mdash;from one-half to one-quarter of the rent&mdash; was continued in temporary legislation which expired on the 31st March, 1970. The reduction was continued administratively in 1970-71; section 2 of the Bill provides for the extension of the relevant statutory provisions in respect of that year.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather technical Bill and I do not profess to know all the angles, particularly the legislative angles, and the ancient legislation relating to these half-rents.  I know that, when this was being considered about ten years ago, the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Blaney, expressed the hope that some finality would be arrived at in respect of this rather archaic system of half-rents.  I should like to ask the Minister why his proposals now appear to be rather tentative.  I am quoting from what he said: &ldquo;The purpose of the legislation therefore is to discontinue the system of half-rent rating altogether from the current financial year.&rdquo;  After ten years they should be able to make up their minds definitely instead of suggesting that the system be abolished for a period of ten years.  What the Minister says is true, that the report of the interdepartmental committee on local finance and taxation in their second report entitled <i>Exemptions From and Remissions of Rates</i> states as follows at page 23, paragraph 58:</P>
      <P>The system of half-rent rating gives rise to anomalies and inequities. In some cases rates are assessed on small head rents under leases while in other cases the basis of assessment is the current commercial rent.  The abolition of the system has been recommended from time to time by representative bodies on the grounds that it gives rise to hardship, especially in cases where a lessee's interest is owned by a private individual or body corporate which is not entitled to exemption from rates and the lessee's interest is subsequently sold to a charity or public body.  The rent received by the landlord is thus reduced by an amount equal to the rates on the appropriate fraction of the half-rent by the operation of events outside the landlord's control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House should accept the proposals suggested by the Minister.  The amount involved is quite small.  Ten years ago it was only £16,000.  He now gives a sum of £30,000 as the extra cost to the Exchequer.  He says this sum will go to local authorities.  They will not get much one way or another out of this but so far as the system seems <Col N="2157" /> to be based on rather archaic legislation the Bill is to be welcomed.  When replying, I should like the Minister to explain why he is so hesitant and why he has introduced this change for only a year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems rational.  In the past the peculiar half-rent system has meant, in effect, that the rates were higher than the half-rent.  This created an anomalous situation.  Various adjustments were made from time to time such as lowering the valuation on which this half-rent was placed. Even here there were anomalies because there were different ratios laid down.  The county councils were 50 per cent, Cork Corporation 33 per cent, Dún Laoghaire and Dublin 22 per cent.  In general one can welcome the Bill.  I see nothing in it to which one can really object.  There may be points that have escaped me but on Second Reading I see no objection to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know to what extent this measure affects a very large number of people.  Perhaps the Minister will say how important and urgent a measure it is and how many people will be affected by it.  It strikes me, as a representative of the ordinary people, that the proposal is rather innocuous, especially when one considers the overall burden of the rating system and the need for reform of a radical kind.  The Minister mentions that the rating system as a whole will be dealt with in the forthcoming White Paper on local finance but it would be better to have the overall legislation dealing with the rating system in general than to deal with it in this rather piecemeal fashion.  Mention of rates or the rating system is sufficient to send the ordinary citizen's blood pressure soaring.  Clearly it is imposing a crushing burden which has reached the stage when very many local authorities are prepared to go the way of Dublin Corporation and abolish themselves rather than impose what they believe to be an impossible financial burden on their people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot <Col N="2158" /> discuss the rating system as a whole. As the Minister pointed out, the House will get an opportunity of doing so. This is a limited measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and that is why I am rather critical of this measure, in view of the immense burden rates are on the people and the need for reform.  The measure purports to remove what the Minister calls an obvious anomaly in our rating system.  There are so many anomalies in the system that I could spend a long time enumerating them and perhaps be ruled out of order.  The whole approach of the rating system is cock-eyed and archaic.  One never knows what yardstick is applied in determining valuation.  It is shrouded in mystery but to refer to one small anomaly as is done in this Bill and ignore altogether the larger issue is to treat the people with something like contempt.</P>
      <P>Personally, I am not aware of the urgency or importance of this measure.  A figure of £30,000 has been mentioned for the cost to the Exchequer in the current year.  That is rather a drop in the ocean in relation to rates revenue.  I should be more impressed by hearing the Minister say precisely when we shall have a White Paper on local finance.  This has become urgent and compelling, especially having regard to the proposed reconstruction of local authorities. Therefore, I am far more interested in hearing when the Minister will face up to his responsibilities, tackle the whole rates problem effectively and issue his White Paper so that we may get down to a debate here on this very important issue and so that we may find a substitute for the present system which is proving such a great hardship for so many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are so many things that one could say but they would probably be out of order on this small measure.  I would be grateful if the Minister would refer to the larger issue of the change in our present rating system and tell us when we can hope legislation will be introduced which will give our people a fairer, more just and more equitable system of rating which will <Col N="2159" /> permit local authorities to face up to their responsibilities with heart and courage and maintain essential services instead of proceeding, as they are now, in a state of pessimism prepared to go the same road as Dublin Corporation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> When discussing any Bill dealing with rates or exemption from rates one is prompted to remind the Minister that it is a great pity the Government have not got down to dealing with the rating system in general, particularly at a time when the Government are asking public representatives all over the country to deal with reform in local government.  The Minister has been told several times since his White Paper on the Reorganisation of Local Government was published that it is simply not possible to deal with it until we have his proposals for the financing of local services.  I join with Deputy Treacy in saying that it is a great pity we do not have the White Paper before us.  We should like to hear from the <Col N="2160" /> Minister when he proposes to circulate that White Paper.</P>
      <P>There is just one point in connection with this measure about which I candidly admit I am not clear and I should like the Minister to deal with it. I understand if a person rents or leases office accommodation or storage accommodation to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Board of Works or some other Department, for public purposes, at £100 a year that property is then rated on the half-rent which is £50.  The owner pays the rates to the local authorities but is forthwith refunded the amount of rates paid by the Board of Works acting as agent for the public office concerned.  I want to know first, if the Minister agrees that this is the case and second, if the Minister does agree that this is the case, is it proposed to abolish those half-rates on half-rent in this Bill?  If that is the case it would seem that while this Bill means nothing by way of savings to the ordinary owner of property it will transfer a very considerable burden from the Exchequer to the local authority and it will at least relieve the various Departments from making the payments I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have never understood this bounty-in-lieu of rates.  I find it very hard to believe if the Minister concedes what I am saying is right about the rates terminating on these half-rents that £30,000 would cover the whole country.  The rate in the £ is now in the region of £5 and £6 and with rents being what they are it would be much more than £30,000.  I should like the Minister to clear this up before the Committee Stage.  I hope the understands my point.  I am saying if a person leases an office to the engineers in the post office for £100 a year that is rated on £50 a year.  The owner pays the rates to the local authority and then recovers them from the Department <Col N="2161" /> of Posts and Telegraphs, the Board of Works or whoever pays the rent.  Is that being abolished in this Bill?  If it is the Bill is neither as simple nor as harmless as it looks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This seemingly innocuous Bill has me a little puzzled. It seems we are tackling the problem the wrong way round.  We are talking about buildings used for public, scientific or charitable purposes, but we should be introducing a Bill compelling such bodies, which are enjoying freedom from rates, to pay full rates and thereby alleviate the burden on other members of the community such as people living in flats who have recently had their rates increased.</P>
      <P>The Corn Exchange Building is being used for office purposes.  It was originally granted freedom from rates under the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852 and it still enjoys that freedom from rates.  The Minister is now saying to the owner he does not have to pay rates because the occupiers do not pay rates.  This applies to the Royal College of Physicians and some other buildings in Dublin.  People are enjoying freedom from rates while others are being over-burdened with rates.  I should much prefer the Minister to say that we are not going to allow special concessions, we are going to make everyone pay. A Bill which would bring the rating system up-to-date and the valuation of some of the premises in Dublin up-to-date could then be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In bringing in a Bill like this we have got our priorities wrong.  I wonder if this will solve the problem in a place like the Corn Exchange Building which is being used as an office block and in respect of which permission has been granted for the erection of a multistorey office block which, to my knowledge, will still enjoy freedom from rates. I should like the Minister to tell me what can be done to alter the present law whereby these buildings enjoy freedom from rates.  All we are doing here is saying that their owners should not be compelled to pay rates on the half-rent. We have it the wrong way around. This is very annoying when one sees poor people who are paying maximum rates in corporation flats and who are <Col N="2162" /> not living normal lives.  Apart from their rents being pushed up time and time again, they now have an increase in their rates and the Minister is not concerned about that.  If these are subsidised buildings, should they not enjoy freedom from rates in the same way as buildings used for scientific or charitable purposes?  I should like the Minister to spell out the particular buildings which are used for charitable purposes. I do not think we should gloss over it without going into detail.  Perhaps he would give us details of the buildings that enjoy these concessions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this Bill has anything to do with valuations in general or the rating system in general. I think Deputy O'Connell was completely out of joint when he referred to this.  There will be a time for this. Perhaps the right time would be on the Estimate for Local Government.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced to do a specific thing&mdash;to relieve the position of an owner who would be unfortunate enough to have his farm or his premises occupied by, for example, a semi-State company in respect of which, I think, there is no bounty repayable to the local authority on the rating equal to half the rent.  The only regret I have is that the Minister or his advisers were not able to make the provisions of this Bill retrospective for a period of at least five years.  I shall give an example.  Suppose a person had a bad farm of land in Cavan, Leitrim or North Longford and that this farm was selected by a semi-State company to carry out experiments in scientific soil testing or land cultivation.  Suppose that before that the valuation of this holding was £50 or £75 or maybe less. The owner might be getting £300 or £500 a year rent.  Under our present rating system the unfortunate owner would be obliged to pay the rates on half the rent and he would find himself, as some owners have done, paying much more in rates than he could ever hope to receive by way of rent. As I understand it in the case of semi-State companies there is not any refund as there is in the case of Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a short Bill to relieve certain <Col N="2163" /> anomalies in this system.  The system is archaic and should not have been carried into this century at all having regard to the scope of our rating system at present.  I welcome the Bill for what it does.  It does it merely from 1st April, 1971.  My only regret is that the Minister did not see fit to make retrospective an order to compensate some of those unfortunate owners who were caught out under this system for the hardship, for the anguish and for the amount they are out of pocket at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose when any measure comes before the House in which rates are mentioned there is a temptation for Deputies, especially on the Opposition side, to have a &ldquo;go&rdquo; at the whole rating structure.  Being of a generous nature, I forgive some of the Deputies who started on that road because I should not like to detract in any way from the main purpose of this Bill which is really a very simple measure to remedy an archaic and anomalous situation.  It is only with us because of legislation introduced in olden times and the opportunity arises now to abolish it altogether.  The legislation under which half-renting operates in county health districts, in particular the legislation under which the half-renting was reduced to quarter, terminated on 31st March, 1970.  We have now availed of the opportunity to abolish it altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether some of the Deputies really understand what is involved in this.  Deputy Carter made, I think, the best effort to explain it to the House.  I had a case where a constituent was left property.  I shall give this brief explanation because it is the easiest way to understand what is involved. She was left very substantial property in the city of Galway.  Like everybody who is left something in a will she thought this was her lucky day but subsequently discovered that there was a 900-year lease on the property to the State.  It was being used as a Garda barracks.  Because it was used for public purposes the half-renting which, in effect, is quarterrenting, applied.  This means that the <Col N="2164" /> premises are valued on quarter of the rent received.  Of course, once the rate in the town went over £4 in the £ the owner found herself in the position where she had to pay more in rates to the local authority than she was in receipt of from the State to whom she was leasing the premises.  This particular constituent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was not refunded. The only provision was that it was reduced from the half to the quarter.  When it went over £4 the quarter concession was no use because the person was then paying more than the amount she was getting in rent from the lessor.  So the position is very anomalous.  I think it is right that we should bring in this short Bill to clear up the situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not done for my constituent.  I am only giving that as my personal experience.  This was recommended by the interdepartmental committee.  There have been representations from several organisations to the Department in recent years to have this half renting abolished altogether. I may mention the Incorporated Law Society who have been on to the Department on a number of occasions. We are pleased that we now have the opportunity of introducing this legislation to remove this anachronistic legislation which is well out-of-date and causing some hardship and concern, to very few people actually.  As I have explained, the number of people involved is very small and the amount of additional bounty which the State will have to pay in lieu of these rates comes to £30,000 only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very few.  I have not got the exact number but there are not <Col N="2165" /> very many persons involved because it is not an uncommon practice nowadays, when the State is making an arrangement with the landlord, to arrange to pay the full rates as part of the lease.  These are old leases in the main.  This clause operated in long leases which were made some time ago. The net effect of the Bill will, of course, be nil in cases where the State has made an arrangement in leasing the building to pay the rates for the owner.</P>

      <P>It will not because the half renting system only applies to owners of property whose property is occupied by the State and who have not made an arrangement with the State in the original lease that the State would pay the rates in full.  There are old leases where this arrangement was not made.  In the case which I came up against individually, the Office of Public Works saw no reason why they should increase their rent when they had a legitimate lease.  They were acting in the best interests of the taxpayers.  The Dáil is now rightly correcting this situation.</P>

In my opinion subsection (2) should read: &ldquo;The Currency Act, 1927 and the Central Bank Acts, 1942 and 1964 and this Act shall be construed together as one Act and may be cited together as the Currency and Central Bank Acts, 1927 to 1970.&rdquo; The Currency Act has literally nothing to do with the Central Bank Act of 1942.  Therefore, for the purpose of <Col N="2169" /> precision, it would be better that the wording be as I have indicated.

      <P>Not at all.  The point is that there is really no close connection between the Currency Act of 1927 and the subsequent Currency Act of 1930.  They should be separated in the first place in which they are mentioned as follows: &ldquo;The Currency Acts, 1927 and 1930 and the Central Bank Acts, 1927 and 1964 and this Act shall be construed together as one Act and may be cited together as the Currency and Central Bank Acts, 1927 to 1970.&rdquo;  In the wording as it appears, two Acts are being put together which, strictly, are not the same.

      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;the orderly and proper regulation of banking&rsquo; shall be construed to include the necessity for a regular, constant and efficient banking service for the public.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment which I seek to put in in the definition section is really referable to subsequent sections of the Bill but, perhaps, I should move it now since it comes in this place.  There should be a definition as to what is meant by the words &ldquo;the orderly and proper regulation of banking&rdquo; because these words describe the use of the power by the Central Bank in relation to the imposition of conditions and the making of regulations as to the transaction of banking business.  As it stands, there is no guide as to what that should mean or what it should cover or what the policy should be.  I am suggesting that it &ldquo;shall be construed to include the necessity for regular, constant and efficient banking service for the public.&rdquo;  I would urge the Minister to accept some sort of detailing of what policy should be aimed at by orderly and proper regulation of banking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Higgins has indicated, this phrase is a key phrase in this Bill.  It applies to many other important sections of the Bill.  Therefore the amendment he proposes relates to the kernel of the Bill.  It should be clear that the phrase already in the Bill covers efficient banking and also the provision by the bank concerned of a reasonable banking service for the public.  Having regard to that type of business and to local circumstances, I do not think it would cover a regular, constant banking service as proposed by the amendment.  &ldquo;Constant&rdquo; could <Col N="2172" /> be held to mean 24 hours a day for seven days a week and &ldquo;regular&rdquo; might not allow for reasonable variation in the services provided by different types of banks and different types of branch banks.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, in various towns where small branch banks may operate, they operate in many cases for a limited number of hours or for a limited number of days in a week.  This is required by local circumstances and I think it is necessary that the Bill should not interfere with this kind of practice.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, there are differences as between, say, the Associated Banks, the merchant banks and industrial banks as to the kind of services they would give and I think the Bill must recognise this and allow for the necessary flexibility.  While it may be reasonable normally to expect the associated banks to provide a regular service on the main working days and during certain hours on these days, this may not be necessarily so for the other banks.  I think small banks&mdash;and I am not referring now to small branches of big banks but small banks &mdash;might find it quite onerous to provide an extended service.  I think the difficulty about giving a more precise meaning to the phrase is that a narrower definition would result in the Central Bank having to operate in a very rigid framework and this could well work to the detriment of the public.  I think, therefore, flexibility is necessary.  The Central Bank are a responsible public body with long experience and we can and must rely on them to take all the relevant factors into account in relation to the particular operations of a particular type of bank, where they are operating and the kind of business they are doing.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, one other aspect of this amendment.  Deputy O'Higgins did not mention it and I do not know if he had it in mind but I think it is better to deal with it as it is bound to come up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be sure of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the amendment is aimed at compelling the banks to stay <Col N="2173" /> open during a dispute such as we had last year, I think this would be quite an illogical approach.  If the basis of the argument for this is that banking service is a vital service to the community and should therefore be maintained at all times then logically the provision should be something on the lines of providing for compulsory arbitration because you cannot ensure a constant regular availability of the banking service if either the banks or their staffs refuse to give it.  So that, if you want to ensure that, you have logically to ensure that both parties give it and you must provide a framework which will deal with disputes and so on.  If, on the other hand, what you say is that the staffs can go on strike but the banks have a legal obligation to provide a service under this Bill, what you are saying is that whatever demands are made by the staff must be met by the banks, no matter how ridiculous they may be.  I do not think anybody could reasonably accept that position.  It seems to me that, as I say, if you are arguing that the service provided by the banks is so essential to the community that it must not be interrupted under any circumstances then you have to face up to the logic of that and apply whatever restrictions you are applying to all parties concerned. You cannot just apply them to one party.  It would be unrealistic to do it if you really want to ensure non-interruption of banking service.</P>
      <P>I feel that on consideration of this matter it will be agreed that this cannot be done, certainly by this amendment.  I am not at all sure that it would be desirable to provide something on the lines I have outlined but certainly if one wants to ensure under all circumstances a constant and regular banking service one has to provide some kind of framework that will ensure that matters in dispute, ordinary industrial disputes, are dealt with and that the findings of whatever tribunal is concerned are binding and compulsory on all the parties concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that this Bill, which is the first banking Bill introduced in the House following the disastrous lock-out last year, does not refer in any way, except in the amendment <Col N="2174" /> put in here, to an effort to prevent something like that happening again.  It is all right for the Minister to say that you cannot force the banks to stay open if you are going to allow the officials to go on strike but I think there is a very big difference.  In fact, the banks are legally bound to give a service to the public.  They are bound to stay open.  Deputy O'Donovan asked a number of questions which, I must say, the Minister fielded pretty well but a couple of them did go through the sticks.</P>
      <P>The trouble about it is that we had a situation here last year which was disastrous for the community, disastrous for the economy, disastrous, it appeared to me, for the people concerned at the start but when the Minister says that, if this is accepted, that the banks must stay open, unreasonable demands could be forced by the employees, is the Minister not aware that, in effect, the bank lock-out which occurred last was settled on better terms than would have been accepted by the employees the first day the bank dispute occurred?  Is he not aware that in the end it actually cost the banks more in hard cash to settle the dispute than if the dispute had not taken place at all?  This is not confined to the banks.  There are other organisations doing the same thing.  They seem to take delight in causing as much trouble as they can and eventually agreeing that what was originally asked for by the workers is reasonable, and paying it.  This in effect is what is happening in this case and I think the amendment is quite reasonable.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt about it that the banks, who have a responsibility and who look for protection from the State when it suits themselves, cannot have it all one way and give nothing at all in the other direction.  The onus is on the banks to stay open and give a service to the public and this amendment, if carried, will make them do exactly that.  For that reason, the Minister has either to accept the amendment or, if the movers agree, agree to have another look at it.  He cannot write off last year's dispute as if it never occurred and say, &ldquo;It is all right. Next time we will think of something else.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In former times it was legally incumbent on the commercial banks to remain open for specified hours and, as has been said, it is very important that we should have a constant and regular banking service and that a dispute such as occurred last year, which was of a most unfortunate nature, should never occur again.  It is incumbent on the Minister for Finance to take whatever steps he feels necessary to ensure that there is a harmonious industrial relations policy as between the banks and their employees. Whether that can be done within this Bill or not remains open to question.  Perhaps it could be dealt with under section 10 where conditions can be imposed by the Central Bank on the issue of licences to banks.  One of the conditions which could be included by the Central Bank would be that there would have to be a proper industrial relations set-up as between the staffs and the banks.  Certainly there must be some method laid down which will ensure that a dispute such as occurred last year will never occur again in this country.  The Fine Gael amendment is both important and relevant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a decided move by the directors of the commercial banks when the second inter-Party Government were in office to get the Government to agree that they could do what they did last year. Instead of that, the Government pointed out to the banks that they could open for two hours a day, from 10 o'clock to 12 o'clock, and that situation was got over in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the arbitrators appointed by the present Government in 1969 and 1970 were incompletent.  Their interpretation of the agreement was flagrantly wrong.  There was a condition about deteriorating circumstances between the banks and their staffs and nobody can suggest that increases in the cost of living of 8 per cent one year and 9 per cent the next did not represent seriously worsening conditions. The Government played ball with the arbitrators by allowing the commercial banks to close illegally by making an order enabling them to close on St. Stephen's Day or on <Col N="2176" /> January 1st, I do not know which. Having made a special order, the Government allowed them to close without interfering at all, the Government adopting the attitude that they would be intruding in the dispute, avoiding their responsibility in that way.  The first inter-Party Government made an order in, I think, 1950 authorising the banks to close.  I do not think that what happened last year is good Government. I will leave it at that.  I said it last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a few words to what Deputies have been saying.  As the Minister pointed out, the phrase &ldquo;the orderly and proper regulation of banking&rdquo; is a key phrase which applies in particular to the grant of licences.  I do not wish to anticipate sections which we will come to deal with later, but in order to understand the effect of the amendment, Deputies must appreciate that after the passing of this Bill and of a transition period, all banks and bankers, in order to continue to transact banking business, will require to have a licence from the Central Bank and that will include, in addition to whichever new banks or bankers that may be recognised, existing banks and bankers.  In relation to the grant of a licence, the Central Bank, under the sections we will come to deal with, are given power to impose conditions which in the opinion of the bank are calculated to promote &ldquo;the orderly and proper regulation of banking&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of my amendment is to say by legislation to the Central Bank that when they are about to impose conditions calculated to promote &ldquo;the orderly and proper regulation of banking&rdquo; that these may include conditions providing for a regular, constant and efficient banking service for the public. I do not think the people whom we represent in the Oireachtas would understand our legislating at this stage, in the aftermath of a serious and dislocating bank stoppage, if we did not in that legislation advert in some way to the necessity for avoiding in future what occurred in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is correct for the Minister to suggest that the adoption of my amendment would achieve <Col N="2177" /> situation through which the Central Bank and the banks have an obligation to remain open though nobody is working in them.  That may be the law but it certainly does not follow from this amendment.  I do not want to go into the past or present situation in regard to the banks involved in the recent dispute.  There is sufficient reading in the Fogarty Report on that. However, one can imagine an entirely new bank applying for a licence.  It might be very clear to anybody who examined the structure, servicing and personnel of that bank that the industrial relations set-up was as bad as could be.  In these circumstances, the Central Bank very well might provide for proper arbitration, proper ventilation of difficulties from staff point of view, because that would be designed to achieve a regular, efficient and constant banking service.</P>
    <P>These conditions may not always operate successfully but all I am concerned with is that under the new banking structure provided for by this Bill it should be the policy and the aim to provide a constant, regular and efficient banking service.  I have said this before and I urge it now by way of this amendment: if things continue as they have been, with a bank strike five years ago and another last year, we will have another strike unless there is a radical reappraisal of what has been going on, and I do not think that in the case of the next bank strike traders will finance business.  They will not accept cheques, and this would mean that a repetition of last year's bank stoppage next year or the year after would bring about a very serious dislocation of the economy.  It is for that reason&mdash;I am not married to the words of the amendment&mdash;that some special element of policy should be included in what is meant by &ldquo;the orderly and proper regulation of banking.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have suggested in the House that there should be a 60-day cooling off period in essential industries threatened by disputes and I would recommend such an approach to industrial relations in banking.  I do not think compulsory arbitration would be acceptable and I am not sure it would be desirable.  We have <Col N="2178" /> had always a system of free bargaining and I think what we should have not only in relation to banking but to other essential industries is a contract agreement in relation to wages and conditions governing periods of from two to three years.  That would be one way of tackling this problem and it would be successful if adhered to in the banking system.</P>
      <P>I am surprised the Minister did not put in an amendment to deal with the position in relation to future bank disputes. He should have tabled some amendment to allow proper discussion of it.  I feel the words &ldquo;regular, constant, and efficient&rdquo; in our amendment are very important to the public and I recommend the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> We all fully agree about the hardship the last strike brought about but I am not fully sure that the amendment as I see it would solve the situation.  I would be afraid that by inserting this amendment we might worsen relations with the banks.  We must remember that, in effect, banks are a private enterprise and we would by inserting this make it very difficult for them to negotiate.  We might be weakening the hand of the negotiators on one side and strengthening their hand on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must try to get away from this type of legislation and create proper staff relationships.  This is about the best way to help any labour relations. It would be unfair to the banks to direct that they must open.  After the last bank strike there was such a backlog of business that the banks opened for only two hours a day and it became utterly impossible for them to carry on.  We could run into complete chaos by inserting this amendment. I hope we never again have a bank strike such as we experienced on the last occasion.  We should see that the Central Bank get proper powers and that they give directions that they expect the commercial banks to give service to the community without spelling it out in legislation.  If we inserted this the Central Bank would always be able to point to this Bill <Col N="2179" /> and say: &ldquo;It is there in the legislation and you must stay open whether you like it or not&rdquo;.  The Central Bank, in co-operation with the commercial banks may be able to set up proper staff relationships whereby we may never again see a strike such as we witnessed on the last occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with and accept Deputy Fitzpatrick's point of view but I think he is under a misapprehension in relation to the effect of the amendment.  If the amendment were accepted by the House the effect of it would be to include amongst the purposes which the Central Bank must think of in making conditions is the necessity for a regular, constant and efficient banking service.  Under section 10 the Central Bank is empowered to impose conditions on a bank or all banks or it may impose none.  If it decides to impose a condition it may or may not have a condition in relation to industrial relations or in relation to providing a constant, efficient and regular service.  If it imposes conditions under section 10 (2) the conditions of a licence may be amended, revoked or added to at any time.  In fact, if a situation arose whereby there was a condition in the licence aimed at a provision explicitly of a regular, constant and efficient banking service and if, in fact, by reason of frustration or matters which could not be foreseen it became impossible for the bank so to do, then the Central Bank would have power to amend or revoke that particular condition.</P>
      <P>That is what has happened in the past in another way when the Government gave permission to the banks to close.  The banks were under a statutory obligation to remain open but, of course, once the difficulties arose they could not maintain the service and the Government, in effect, gave them permission to close.  From the point of view of a statutory obligation there is no problem.  The concern is that under the licence the necessity should be pointed out to everybody engaged in banking of providing a constant and efficient service to the public. I hope that meets Deputy Fitzpatrick's problem.</P>

      <P>We must clearly distinguish here between the legal obligation a bank to its customer and the obligation of a bank or the banking system to the community.  In so far as the legal obligation of a bank to its customer is concerned in the recent dispute there was no interference whatsoever with that.  In so far as banks were legally liable to their customers it was open to customers to sue them if they lost money and to recover damages if the bank was, in fact, in breach of its contract with the customer.  I would point out that the banks do not require the authority of the Government to close.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to this. It also has this effect.  In certain other respects the bank might have a legal obligation to its customers and it is relieved of that legal obligation in respect of that particular day where it is authorised to close on a Bank Holiday. However, during the bank dispute the banks were not relieved of that obligation at all nor did they seek to be relieved of it.  They did not ask either in the recent dispute or in the 1966 dispute any permission from the Government nor did they get it.  Their legal position in relation to their customers was not interfered with at all. The position there depended on the contract between the customer and the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly, my advice in relation to the incident referred to by Deputy O'Donovan is that legally that condition was not necessary but, in fact, it was given under a Supplies and Temporary Provisions Act which has now lapsed and does not now operate. I am not purporting to speak with <Col N="2181" /> absolute authority on this but I think the effect of that permission was to relieve the banks of legal obligations to their customers.  This Government did not relieve the banks of their legal obligations.  I just draw the Deputy's attention to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, this is water under the bridge.  We are concerned here with what is likely to happen in <Col N="2182" /> the future.  Again I want to stress that we are talking now about the obligation of the banking system to the community. In effect, that is what is involved in this amendment.  If we lay down a legal obligation on the banking system to remain open within all reasonable business hours, we will have to keep our eyes open as to what we are doing.  In relation to what was said by Deputy O'Higgins, I do not visualise the Central Bank, under other provisions in this Bill, laying down conditions in a licence which would pertain to the industrial relations of the bank.  I do not think this would be appropriate.  It would involve the Central Bank in matters which are far outside its ken.  The Business of the Central Bank is to deal with banking, with such matters as deposits, rations, liquidity and so on, not with industrial relations.  I do not think we should anticipate anything, because it is very unlikely that the Central Bank would involve itself in industrial relations.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies who have spoken on this are not facing up to the realities. I deplore the last bank closure.  It did enormous damage to our economy, and this has emerged since.  There were other factors, but this was a big factor in the low rate of growth of our economy, and I would be very anxious to ensure that such a thing did not occur again.  There has been, as Deputy O'Higgins has mentioned, the Report by Professor Fogarty and there are certain other inquiries which have gone on, some of which have been conducted by the Central Bank; and the Economic and Social Research Institute are conducting inquiries into the causes and effects of the last dispute.  In that regard there seem to be some moves towards ensuring a better and more rational approach to industrial relations in the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this does not solve the problem which has been posed here by Deputies, and I would ask Deputies to face up realistically to what they are suggesting.  They are suggesting that one party to an industrial dispute should have their hands tied behind their back.  The only possible consequence of that is what was pointed out by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  We cannot reasonably <Col N="2183" /> expect this.  To bring it home very strongly to Deputy Tully I might suggest that he would consider this situation, extreme, I admit, but it illustrates the difficulty.  Supposing the view were to be taken&mdash;and it is not an unreasonable view&mdash;that the operation of the trade unions is essential to the ordinary life of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential.  That is generally accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.  If that is accepted, supposing on that basis legislation were to provide that no matter what happened the trade unions were to continue to operate.  Could Deputy Tully visualise the position in which a trade union would be if their members made unreasonable demands and the trade unions were bound by law to continue to carry on?  Let us face up to what is involved.  There is only one possible approach to take, that is, that if you say that because a certain service such as banking or electricity supply is essential to the lives of the community, that the ordinary system of collective bargaining will not apply, and that a new structure to deal with it should be provided, it has to be acceptable to both sides in the particular industry if it is to work.  You can approach it that way, but to approach it on the basis of saying that one side must accept a legal obligation but the other side are free to do what they like&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying it does achieve, all I am concerned with is that policy should aim at providing at all times a constant, efficient banking service.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that the aim would be certainly as indicated by Deputy O'Higgins.  The aim of this Bill and the aim of the Central Bank would be to provide a regular and efficient banking service.  However, to put in, for instance, the word &ldquo;constant&rdquo;, as admitted by Deputy O'Higgins, means that in the event of a dispute such as we had last year the Central Bank would have to revoke that condition, because otherwise the banks would be in breach of this legal obligation.  If one accepts the present position, it seems to me that nothing is achieved by putting in this condition, considering it has to be withdrawn if there is a dispute.  It does not help us in dealing with an industrial dispute in the banks if there is such a condition and it has to be taken out again once a breach occurs. Maybe Deputy O'Higgins does not have this in mind, but I understood from what Deputy Tully and Deputy O'Donovan said that what they had in mind&mdash;and maybe I will be corrected afterwards&mdash;was that the banks, because of their importance to the <Col N="2185" /> community, should not be allowed to close in any circumstances.  If that is what they had in mind, I am saying it does not work under our system of free collective bargaining.  You would have to suspend free collective bargaining for the banks if you wanted to ensure they would continue in all circumstances. If that is not what Deputy Tully and Deputy O'Donovan had in mind, and if it is simply something like what Deputy O'Higgins indicated, I do not think anything is achieved by applying a condition which you have to withdraw the moment it comes under test when there is a dispute.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that the banking system should be informed that it is the opinion of this House that it is essential for the country to have a constant and efficient banking system.  If it fails, the regulations under subsection (2) of section 10 can alter the practical end, but surely the policy should be made known to the Central Bank and the commercial banks, and that is the purpose of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being very native, because what he appears to be doing is forgetting the fact that last year there was a prolonged dispute, a dispute which was caused by the banks which have been described here as a private enterprise organisation or group of organisations who for profit motives refused to pay a just demand.  Not alone did they close the banks and get away with it, but they made fantastic profits on the overdrafts of unfortunate people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister has been dealing with people who never had an overdraft, but I have been dealing with people who had overdrafts and I know what happened.  Not alone were the small business people told, but big firms also, that either they paid the overdrafts which were due or eventually some kind of deal would be done with them by which they would pay a certain portion of it.  No matter what way one looks at it, the banks did made very substantial profits as a result of the <Col N="2186" /> bank strike.  What made matters a lot worse was that when the strike, or the lock-out, which more correctly describes it, was over the banks settled with their employees on better terms than would have been accepted before the lock-out occurred, which goes to prove that, in fact, there was no need for this dispute. The amendment which has been proposed here this morning would mean that before the banks could again lock-out their employees they would have to justify such action to the Central Bank.  That is where the catch comes in.  The Minister has been ignoring that aspect of it, deliberately or otherwise.  If the Central Bank agreed that they were entitled to disrupt the whole economy as they did last year the banks would have great justification for strike action.  There is no doubt that if this clause had been in legislation last year the bank lock-out would not have occurred.  It is evident to everybody that the cause of the dispute was not what the banks had claimed it to be at the beginning.  In effect, by paying out sums which exceeded the original demands the banks showed that there was no reason for the lock-out.</P>
      <P>I do not agree that this proposal interferes in any way with free collective bargaining.  If it did I would oppose it, but it puts the onus on the banks to satisfy the Central Bank that they are justified in taking action of this sort.  There are people in this country who had overdrafts during the bank strike but who would not have had them under normal conditions. When the bank strike was over many people were able to clear their overdrafts. Some people were unable to do so because they had not estimated properly whether cheques which they were receiving were creditworthy. Many people had cheques which were not worth the paper they were written on.  Many firms had to close.  Some of the banks, whether at local or national level, put firms out of business by telling them that there was no future for their business and that, having cleared their overdrafts, they should close down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the wording of the amendment is exactly as the <Col N="2187" /> Minister feels it ought to be in order to do the job.  It is not just good enough to say that it is not the correct type of thing to do, and that, therefore, the amendment should not be accepted.  Unless the Minister is prepared to accept the amendment, or to agree to bring in something similar before the next Stage, I would suggest that this amendment should be put to the House.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> It is only a matter of clarification. Deputy O'Higgins mentioned that this is only a guideline which should be included in the Bill.  The amendment states that a constant and efficient banking service for the public should be provided.  Deputy O'Higgins's point is that if a situation arose, as happened on the last occasion, where a backlog was built up and where it became impossible for the banks to carry on the Central Bank could possibly withdraw this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

      <P>Power is given under section 10 (2).  I do not want to keep on discussing this point.  The Minister seems to have adopted a position, but I am never without hope that argument can succeed.  None of us wishes to take sides in relation to a past dispute. Banking is a very sensitive area in the economy.  It affects each one of us.  During the last bank strike people learned certain facts.  Five years ago the banks were closed.  Cheques were drawn, but everything went smoothly and when the strike was over all the cheques were cashed and there was no great difficulty.  This time, however, people were in a state of euphoria. They became their own bank managers and allowed themselves vast credit. People were seriously hurt.  As the Minister has shown now in retrospect it is quite clear that serious damage was done to the economy.  Looking at that background it is evident that we must point to policy.  We must try to ensure so far as possible that there will not be a repetition.  The Central Bank by this legislation are being put into a position of overlordship in relation to the banking system by having the right to supervise, to take deposits, to <Col N="2188" /> impose conditions and to make sure that the system works.  In the interests of the economy I am concerned that we should include something to provide for an efficient and regular banking service.  Nobody can ensure success.  It is important that an attempt should be made.  I am disturbed because the Minister said quite clearly that as things are now the Central Bank would not advert to industrial relations in the slightest under its powers in order to provide for the orderly and proper regulation of banking.  The Central Bank are to be concerned with liquidity and ratios, <i>et cetera</i>.  Who else should be thinking about the proper, harmonious provision of banking service through the banks with the staff and personnel working together, unless it is the Central Bank?  The Central Bank under this Bill are being made the supervising, licensing body.  Surely they should be concerned, whatever may be in the Fogarty Report which points out areas which could be improved, with such matters?  I am not taking sides one way or the other.  There may have been fault on both sides.  A similar situation may arise in the future.  I understand that despite the best intentions another dispute could arise and industrial relations between the banks and staffs could break down. Whatever policy has been put into operation, whatever conditions have been imposed and whatever good intentions have been expressed they might not succeed.  I can understand that the Central Bank would have to act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully asked why in those conditions should not the licensing bank have to go to the Central Bank and explain that they cannot continue to provide the service necessary.  The Central Bank would have to act responsibly and look carefully at section 10 (2) of this Bill.  Common sense eventually prevailed at the end of the long bank dispute, which possibly should have prevailed from the very beginning.  If an amendment on the lines proposed were accepted there would be greater concern, and those engaged in the banking system would realise that whatever disagreements they have there is a third party involved, and that is the ordinary public <Col N="2189" /> of this country.  The people have no power except the power they exercise through their representatives in the Dáil.  During the banking dispute there was no concern shown for the public and they were the people who had to suffer.  When legislation dealing with banking is being passed the point of view of the ordinary citizen should be made known.  It can only be made known by somebody having a concern imposed on him by statute to provide a constant and efficient banking service. That is the purpose of this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The other point I wish to mention is that to the best of my knowledge any person who had an overdraft which he would have discharged at a particular date if the banks had been open, and if he was able to prove this, did not have to pay interest after that date.  If he had to pay interest he has only himself to blame.  He should not have paid it.</P>

      <P>A valid point is that one of the services a bank provides is to ensure that cheques are cleared quickly and promptly.  They charge for this service as they are entitled to charge.

      <P>At any rate this is irrelevant to discussion on the amendment. One point that has emerged from the debate is either I misunderstood the purpose of this&mdash;although I think I was construing it as it would operate legally&mdash;or else Deputies opposite have changed their arguments somewhat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is unfair.  Our arguments were set out straight and fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy listened to what I said.  I said either I misunderstood or Deputies have changed their arguments.  What is clear is that so far as Fine Gael speakers are concerned they are saying that what they want is to lay down policy in this Bill, to make it clear that the banks remain open.  However, they agree that if a situation is reached in which there is a dispute then at that stage this condition must be withdrawn because otherwise the legal effects would be impossible.  What is involved is laying down policy.</P>
      <P>So far as Deputy Tully is concerned, what he wants to see is that if there should be a dispute as we had before, the Central Bank would have to say yes or no to the banks closing before they actually closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take the Fine Gael view first, it seems to me self-evident that what everyone requires is an orderly and efficient system of banking and that clearly implies there will not be <Col N="2193" /> closures of the kind we have been subjected to heretofore.  I do not think a single thing is gained by putting this phrase in as a directive of policy which would be withdrawn when difficulties are encountered.  On the point raised by Deputy Tully where the Central Bank would say yes or no to the banks' closure, on the face of it this seems a reasonably attractive proposition but we should examine it further.  If we examine it we find that we are saying (a) the Central Bank must involve themselves in the industrial relations of the commercial banks, and (b) in the event of a dispute the Central Bank will, in effect, have to arbitrate and say to the banks:&ldquo;You are justified in resisting this claim&rdquo;, or &ldquo;You are not justified in resisting this claim.&rdquo;  I do not think the Central Bank are qualified to make such a judgement.</P>
    <P>Take, then, a third possibility&mdash;(c) : suppose, having examined the situation, the Central Bank say to the banks: &ldquo;You are justified in resisting this claim and, therefore, you can close,&rdquo; will this be something acceptable to the bank employees?  Will it help settle the dispute?  I do not think it will.  The fallacy here is to imagine that the Central Bank have or could have any kind of effective role in the field of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>It is true, as Deputy O'Higgins said, that under this Bill the Central Bank are being given overlordship of the banking system.  They will operate as the licensing authority.  They will be watching over the normal operations of the banking system.  They will have considerable powers enabling them to interfere but it does not follow from that, as it does in other cases in which you have licensing and supervisory authorities, that that means that such licensing body should be involved in all aspects, including industrial relations, because, when you come to the field of industrial relations, there are many other bodies, such as the Labour Court, concerned with industrial relations. To give this power or impose this obligation on the Central Bank seems to me to be not only cutting across the bodies responsible in this regard but to be imposing on the <Col N="2194" /> banks an obligation quite foreign to them and to their qualifications. Frankly, I do not see any advantage whatever in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, it must be remembered that people paid their full overdrafts.  They got no allowance. If they lodged per week or per month and there was a 10 per cent or a 15 per cent profit they did not get the benefit of that.  That is not the point. The ordinary employer when a strike occurs makes no profit of any kind. He must pay his bills.  The banks, on the other hand, go on making money, possibly as much as they were making before the strike.  Overdrafts are paid and they have no wages to meet.  Any other business in similar circumstances can make no money of any kind.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned industrial relations.  Thinking today is in the direction of having a strong trade union group to speak for workers in general and an employers' group.  If this is the evolution there will be an end to a great many unofficial strikes which very often result in putting a great many workers out of employment. Latterly the banks have appointed some of the staff as directors. One man is appointed, at a very high salary, to deal with industrial relations where the banks are concerned.  If he advises that the workers are looking for too much his advice will be taken by the other directors.  He has an almost dictatorial power.  Surely it should be possible to appoint some authority, not necessarily the Central Bank, to act in a situation like that. Up to four or five years ago the banks, unlike ordinary business, had no competitors.  There is an odd competitor now and some of them allowed people during the bank strike to open limited accounts.  The banks can go on strike any time they like and they lose nothing.  I dislike either side having a sanction which it is almost impossible to break.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a good deal of what the Minister and Deputy Belton have said about a comparison between the trade unions and the banks <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Central Bank.  Everybody knows the drill with regard to disputes. <Col N="2195" /> If a union branch serves a demand on an employer and fails to get agreement and it is then decided to have a strike that decision must be referred to the executive of the union.  The executive will discuss the matter, taking all the merits into account, and two things will eventually come out of that discussion. First of all, the question will be whether it is in the interests of those concerned to have a strike and, secondly, will it improve or disimprove conditions on a long range estimate? There is a third one: what effect will the strike have on the finances of the union?</P>
      <P>Here we have a group of individual banks and they can act together without referring to anybody and they can decide to close their doors, as they did last year.  A number of speakers here have said they were not taking sides one way or the other.  As far as last year's dispute is concerned, I am making it quite clear I took sides at the start and those are the sides I would take if a similar situation occurred.  I believed the workers were right.  I still believe they were right.  Is there any good reason why the Central Bank, like the executive of the union who must look at the effect of the strike on the people employed, on the economy of the country and on its financial position, should not have a say as to whether or not a dispute should continue or a lock-out allowed to go ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody suggests that the governer of the Central Bank or any of the directors should decide wages and conditions for the employees nor has it been suggested here, but what has been suggested is very sensible.  No matter what the Minister says, the banks have found that closing their doors to employees and the public for an extended period has allowed them to make profits.  Nobody can deny that although the Minister attempted to do it today. Is it not reasonable to imagine that those people, having got away with it not once but twice or three times, will be tempted to do it again and for that reason should there not be some body or group who can say finally: &ldquo;We consider this reasonable&rdquo; or &ldquo;We do <Col N="2196" /> not consider it reasonable&rdquo;?  I am particularly referring to a lock-out because if the dispute goes to the extent that the employees decide to serve strike notice because they want to take strike action that is a different matter.  On the question of the banks threatening to close as they closed before there should surely be some way for somebody to say: &ldquo;This is unreasonable; it will do the economy too much harm.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot see how any Minister for Finance should attempt to defend a group of people who, no matter what we say, are only interested in profit making.  Finally, neither can I see why the commercial banks should be allowed to continue with this because as Deputy Belton says up to now there has been little or no opposition to them from like organisations.  Is it not only reasonable to expect that if they do something like this again, banking, as we know it, will fall into such disrepute that the whole system will be changed?  It is not a Bill like this to fill small loopholes that will be brought in but somebody will bring in a Bill setting up an entirely new monetary system because it is not possible for any country to carry on as we did last year.  There was a group of Swedish bankers here last year and they could not understand how the country could continue for six months without the banks.</P>

The Central Bank should know quite clearly the position in this respect.

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The more I look at the section the more complicated appears what will happen as regards the Central Bank. We know banking cannot operate unless industrial relations work properly. We are inserting a section in the belief that we can cure the ills of industrial relations in the banking sector.  We are inserting something in this section and taking it out under section 10.  Here, we are placing the Central Bank in the position in which it will become practically the Labour Court for the employees and employers of the commercial banks because what the commercial banks will automatically say when a claim comes before them is: &ldquo;We will resist it and refer it to the Central Bank.&rdquo;  They will say to the Central Bank: &ldquo;We must resist this claim.&rdquo;  We would put the Central Bank in the place of the Labour Court.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> This section is in the Bill and the negotiators at this point will look at this section and see that the Central Bank have made no statement as to whether the commercial banks may open or close.  Naturally, the section negotiating have their hands tied by virtue of the fact that the Central Bank have not said anything.  It would be normal procedure that the employees would keep this in mind in their negotiations and eventually I think the commercial banks would put the onus on the Central Bank of making a decision as to whether they should close or not.</P>
      <P>I fear you would complicate the situation more than you would simplify it by putting in this section because under section 10 they can take it out again and tell the commercial banks to close.  I do not think it will serve any purpose.  As Deputy O'Higgins said, it is just a guideline for the commercial banks.  We all agree that closing the banks is detrimental to the economy and I would be the last to make a case for the banks.  I know the trouble that was caused to unfortunate shopkeepers and others and if I thought for a moment that by putting in that section we could avoid a repetition of what took place in the past I would welcome it.  I doubt very much if this will solve labour relations problems with the banks as you expect it to do. I do not believe it will work.</P>

      <P>I do not think anybody is suggesting that it will solve labour relations.  I think they can go through the normal channels.  They can <Col N="2199" /> go to the Labour Court and at the stage when they are at  that is when the Central Bank look at it and that is the point when they can go one way or the other.  Let me take up the Minister: he said there were other banks open.  There were, but they had an agreement with the Irish banks not to take new customers and would not facilitate other customers except those who had been dealing with them before a certain date.</P>

      <P>The merchant banks took deposits and many people took their money, brought it across the Border and put it into banks.  It was not the foreign banks who kept the economy going, it was the merchants and business people who cashed cheques for big employers who could not get large sums of cash.  These people did not get any recognition for the service they provided and if they cashed any dud cheques they had to suffer the loss themselves.  The Revenue Commissioners are likely to tax people who cashed dud cheques because they treat the money as profits.  This means that people who kept the country going are going to be taxed on money they never got.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They are in a better position, admittedly, than other people. The Deputy said that an ordinary business with a strike on its hands not alone does not make a profit but is likely to lose business and this was a very big factor with the commercial banks.  They lost a great deal of business and the extent to which they have got it back will not be known for quite <Col N="2200" /> some time.  Anybody who thinks the commercial banks can contemplate a dispute in the way of a strike, lock-out or anything else with equanimity and feel they are going to hold on to their business is mistaken.</P>

      <P>The banks know that they will get interest on their short and long term loans even if they close and they will also save on wages.  The banks make their money on overdrafts, which is one of their main functions. Banks are one of the few businesses which can make money while their staffs are on strike.  I know that people who collect rent make money in that they eventually collect the arrears but there are very few trading firms able to make money while they are on strike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain the phrase: &ldquo;but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done hereunder&rdquo;?  It seems peculiar to me, if an order is to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, that nothing should be done until that order is effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a usual provision in regard to orders of this nature. If one did not have this provision one could have chaos because action taken on foot of it could be set aside and the consequences of that could not be measured.  The alternative suggested by the Deputy of no action being taken until after it had been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas could also lead to very considerable difficulty.  This is in accordance with the usual provisions of this nature in any Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that something has appeared previously in a Bill does not mean that it is correct, as the Minister knows.  I was intrigued to read that, while the Bill cannot become law until it has been passed by the Oireachtas and signed by the President, and cannot be operated until the House has approved an order made under it, something may be done with no authority and, even though there is an annulment of the order, what has been done without authority is not to be interfered with&mdash;if that is a proper interpretation of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in effect, although the Deputy has perhaps overstressed one aspect of it.  As I have said, this is normal.  Deputy Tully is correct in saying that the fact that it exists in other statutes does not mean that it is right, but he will agree that the fact that it exists in many other Acts and has not led to difficulty is a fair argument that it is a workable arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I take that point but I suggest that we should not accept something just because it has appeared previously especially if it appears to be a bit stupid.  The Minister is correct in saying that it does not appear to have caused any trouble but it is still dangerous because if the Minister wants to do something which <Col N="2204" /> would be strongly objected to by the House he can do it before it comes before the House and this is making it legal.  This makes it look a bit peculiar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The wording used here is:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this Act a person shall (save as is otherwise provided by this Act) be deemed to hold himself out as a banker&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>That is open to two interpretations.  It could be that these are the only activities which involve holding oneself out as a banker or it could be what it is intended specifically to catch, but there may be other ways of holding oneself out as a banker which, if it could be established before the courts dealt with the phrase, would come within the section.  Either it is or it is not a well-established legal interpretation of the use of words of this kind in an Act which, if used in this way, are exclusive and constitute a complete list to which nothing else can be added.  We should know one way or the other.  If this is not an exclusive list the question arises as to what is a banker and that is not defined in the Bill.  It seems to me that what happened was that in the drafting of the Bill some trouble was taken to avoid having to define the word &ldquo;banker&rdquo; but the trouble taken may not have been sufficient if these four are not excluded and if it is possible for a court to hold that the wording used does not exclude the possibility of certain other actions constituting the act of holding oneself out as a banker.</P>

      <P>That is true but it is covered.  This section must be read in <Col N="2210" /> conjunction with section 2 which defines banking business as business which consists of:</P>
      <P>(a) the business of accepting deposits payable on demand or on notice or at a fixed or determinable future date, but excluding deposits with a trader from persons employed by him in his trading business or from his customers in the normal course of his trading business and deposits or instalments in respect of the letting or selling of goods under a hire-purchase agreement or a credit-sale agreement, or</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the next phrase that is likely to help the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
      <P>and &ldquo;banking&rdquo; and words cognate thereto shall be construed accordingly.</P>
      <P>One must read these two together. Section 2 defines what is meant by banking business and section 7, subsection (2) defines what is meant by holding oneself out as a banker.  They are different concepts but in regard to subsection (2) of section 7, my advice is that these items set out, (a), (b), (c) and (d) are exclusive.  That is that other matters not described therein do not constitute holding oneself out as a banker but such activities which might not come within that might well come within the definition of banking business in section (2), in which event such activity would be banking business subject to this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that subsection (1) of section 7 goes to some trouble to make a clear distinction between the carrying on of banking <Col N="2211" /> business and representing oneself as a banker.  The only purpose of including the phrase &ldquo;or holding himself out as a banker&rdquo; is because that includes something not covered by &ldquo;carry on banking business or holds himself out or represents himself as carrying on banking business&rdquo;. Clearly, there is a distinction intended. The words &ldquo;representing himself as a banker&rdquo; would not have been put in unless it was intended to catch something not covered by banking business. That being the case, there are two categories of activities being tackled here. It is legitimate to ask for an assurance, with respect to the exclusive character of (a), (b), (c) and (d), when &ldquo;banker&rdquo; is not defined.  The Minister might have argued that the use of the words and &lsquo;banking&rsquo; and words cognate there to shall be construed accordingly&rdquo; would warrant a failure to define the word &ldquo;banker&rdquo;.  I would have thought that it does not and that the words &ldquo;cognate thereto&rdquo; could not apply to other words that happen to begin with &ldquo;bank...&rdquo;  Therefore, had the Minister argued that, I was about to rebut him but happily for me he did not make the argument so I had to make the argument in order to rebut it. Having done that I have made the case that the Bill tackles the activity of holding oneself out as a banker separately from the other activity and that it is not sufficient for the Minister to say that he is advised that the effect of subsection (2) of section 1 is exclusive. We need to be told what is the basis of that advice.  Is there a well established legal principle and, if so, established in what case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot do that.  It is a well established legal principle but I certainly cannot undertake on every section here to bring up the particular legal authority for it.  This is not a function of the Dáil.  It is a function of the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  This is where I am afraid we disagree.  Our job is to make legislation so clear that even the courts cannot construe it differently from our intention.  That is what we are here for.  If there is a <Col N="2212" /> doubt as to whether a certain interpretation could be put by the courts on something and this doubt leads to ambiguity which could frustrate the intentions of the Oireachtas it is our job to remove that ambiguity.  The only way we can discover if there is an ambiguity is to ask the Minister, whose job it is to tell us, whether in fact there is a firm legal interpretation of this type of phraseology in an Act which precludes the courts from deciding, as the phraseology here is, other than exclusive.  I think we are entitled to be told more than &ldquo;I think&rdquo; or &ldquo;we must interpret it in that way&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am advised that it has that meaning&rdquo;.  The very use of these three phrases implies on the Minister's part a certain doubt or hesitation or lack of information on something on which we are entitled to information because if, in fact, those doubts on his part, reflected in the language he has chosen to use, are well-founded it would be necessary for us on the following stage of the Bill to incorporate some appropriate amendment.  I would ask the Minister&mdash;perhaps he cannot do it at the moment&mdash;if he could at a later stage give us the information that we need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated why I used the words &ldquo;I think&rdquo; because whatever I may say I cannot guarantee that on every possible case that comes before the courts the court will interpret the matter in the way that it would normally be interpreted on the basic principle involved.  That is the reason for the hesitation, and the only reason.  I have said quite specifically that I am advised that the phrasing that is used here precludes any other activity being brought in and that this is a settled legal principle but I cannot undertake, in relation to this and various other matters that will come up, to produce the legal authority for each such statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are settled principles of interpretation of Acts.  If there are settled principles then it is open to us to use a phraseology which to a layman may appear ambiguous in the knowledge that the courts will and must interpret in a particular way. But if there is not such a settled legal principle we should avoid ambiguity and this could be done, I suggest, by inserting the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;banker&rdquo; in line 12.  That would eliminate the ambiguity.  If there is an ambiguity, let us get rid of it.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> It is putting the Minister a very difficult proposition to try to define &ldquo;banker&rdquo;.  This section would remind me of part of a Finance Act in regard to income tax.  I see the problem that you are trying to get around in trying to define what exactly a banker is. When this becomes law you will get people trying to get around it and we may have to come back to the House when we see that there are certain loopholes in the section.

It seems to me that in order to complete that and make it certain it is necessary to change the phraseology so that in line 12 it would read &ldquo;to hold himself out as a banker if and only if&rdquo; and delete the &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; under (a), (b), (c) and (d).

      <P>In the case of insurance companies the normal insurance company are not carrying on activities which would come within either the definition of a banking business in section <Col N="2215" /> 2 or holding themselves out as bankers in this section.  There can be, perhaps, some insurance companies carrying on business which would come within either of these definitions, in which case they become subject to the provisions of the Bill but, as I say, the normal activity of insurance companies would not be deemed to come within either section 2 or section 7.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of an insurance company who lend money on life expectancy surely there should be some way to define whether or not they are in or they are out.  There was the famous chips scheme and all this sort of thing which were operating with some insurance companies.  I do not know whether this will be necessary or not but it does appear that if we are writing something into it we should be very definite about it so that there would be no misinterpretation.  I quite agree on that.</P>
      <P>There is just one question I might ask the Minister.  Does he consider, in fact, that section 7 (2) is necessary because, in fact, I am quite sure people will succeed in inventing a new name and words cease to have the same meaning?  That applies to this House particularly.  Would the Minister not agree that people will use a different name and invent a name to get around this, even though he refers to derivations of the word?  Section 2 seems to have tied it up very tightly.  Does he consider that section 7 (2) is necessary?</P>

You see, it is possible that people might hold themselves out to be bankers but not come within section 2 and would thereby get such benefits as accrue from holding themselves out to be bankers but, because they would not come within the definition in section 2, would not become subject to any control at all.</P>

      <P>It is to exempt from the licence any person holding himself out as a banker within the meaning of subsection (2) but who is not actually carrying on a banking business.  The exemption is to apply to such period as may be determined by the Central Bank.  It would apply to a banker who might decide not to carry on in business, a person who already has a licence, and also to a licence holder whose licence was revoked under section 11.  It is to give such people time to wind up their business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 26 and 27, to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) when the Minister decides to withhold his consent he shall so notify the applicant who shall thereupon have the right of appeal to the High Court within twenty-one days of such notification, the decision of which Court shall be final.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section deals with the granting of licences and as Deputies will see the procedure is there set out that whenever the Central Bank propose to refuse to grant a licence to a person they must notify the person in writing and representations in writing by the applicant to the Minister may be made within 21 days and the Minister is asked to decide whether he will allow a licence despite the Central Bank's refusal.  This Bill is dealing with the very important industry of banking, with a very important right, the right to engage in banking, and in relation to matters as important as these I think there should be some procedure whereby the courts set up under the Constitution should have a general supervisory position.  That would be good in the sense of appearing to be right and I think it would remove any suggestion that a particular group or syndicate secured a licence from the Minister when the securing of such a licence might be open to suggestions of one kind or another.  The amendment seeks to have procedure enacted under which the High Court could decide a matter of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will see that section 9 confines the Central Bank to refusal of a banking licence only if the Central Bank are satisfied that the granting of the licence would not be in the interest of the orderly and proper regulation of banking.  In the event, the applicant must be notified of the refusal and the applicant is then given 21 days in which to make representations to the Minister for Finance and the Minister must consider the representations.  An application could not be refused until <Col N="2220" /> this has been done.  The Central Bank cannot issue a refusal without the formal consent of the Minister.</P>
      <P>There is a specific appeal and review procedure laid down.  There cannot be any question of a licence being refused without good reason.  It is thought that the main type of case in which the question of refusal of a licence would arise is the kind of case in which the applicant's financial bona fides would not be satisfactory.  Information bearing on a matter of that nature could well be of quite a confidential nature, perhaps obtained from abroad, and it might be such that it could not be proved in court to meet the full degree of the requirements of legal evidence. In such a case the court might well find it would have to give the benefit of the doubt to the applicant who would then commence business with a serious loss not only to the depositors but may be reaction in confidence in the whole banking system and the other banks.</P>
      <P>In view of the particular nature of banking and the importance of ensuring that depositors do not suffer loss it is probably reasonable to allow the Central Bank to determine the applications with the right of appeal to the Minister.  I say probably because I have a good deal of sympathy with this particular amendment.  Like Deputy O'Higgins I would prefer, where it is possible, that an applicant should feel that it should be seen that he has a right of appeal to the courts. My main hesitation in accepting this amendment is the point I have made that there could well be a situation in which the information that would justify the Central Bank in refusing the application is such that it would not meet the required test of evidence in court in which case the court would find itself having to grant the licence with all the ill consequences that would flow for depositors and perhaps, as I say, for the banking system.  This is my difficulty in accepting this amendment. My mind is not closed on it.  If Deputy O'Higgins wishes I will have another look at this before the next stage to see if we can overcome it.</P>

This reminds me of an argument we had here in the House over the Planning Bill when something similar was introduced where the Minister had the last word.  God knows the mess made of that should have been enough to scare any other Minister from ever attempting to do the like again.  I am not saying we will have, as we had in the Planning Bill, hundreds of appellants waiting for 12 months or longer for a decision.  I feel in any case the Minister should be very careful before he takes to himself a decision which though he says he feels the courts might not be in a position to decide fairly I would question the right of a Minister, not just the present Minister but any Minister for Finance, being the correct person to decide on something like this.  We must give the courts the right to decide matters which are very important.  The courts would be just as interested in protecting the interests of the investors as the Minister or we in the House would be.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy indicated, we have had something on this. I indicated earlier that I do not wish to have this phrase &ldquo;the orderly and proper regulation of banking&rdquo; defined too narrowly and I have indicated the reasons for that.  In general, one may take it that financial instability or doubt in regard to the standing of the applicant would clearly be one matter that would lead to a refusal. An undue concentration of banking companies in a particular field or in a particular area leading to wasteful duplication but bearing in mind the value of competition would be factors that the Central Bank would want to take into account.  The degree to which the economy is served at the moment by a particular specialised kind of banking applicant would be another factor.  I certainly could not purport to give an exhaustive definition of what would or would not be deemed to come within the definition of the phrase &ldquo;the orderly and proper regulation of banking&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Is there not a serious objection to a matter I raised <Col N="2223" /> the last time, that is, the secretary of the Minister's Department being a director of the Central Bank will be telling the Minister all the views of the Central Bank?  Who will advise the Minister otherwise?  Who will be the advocate to the Minister on behalf of the person who is appealing to the Minister?  This is a most serious matter. Here we have a serious reason in relation to what I objected to the last day. I said that the Minister for Finance is entitled to the sole advice of the head of his Department.  It is quite common that the best secretaries in Government Departments have always refused to go on outside bodies and companies.  I am not referring in this case to the Department of Finance in particular. There are much worse cases than the Department of Finance in this respect&mdash; the Department of Industry and Commerce was notorious in this regard.  I take it that, when this comes to the Department, the man through whom it will go to the Minister will be a person who is a director of the Central Bank. This is wrong.</P>

      <P>I know of no case in which there is this kind of provision. There are numerous statutes in which it operates, in which such cases do not come personally to the Minister.  I might be able to throw a little more light on the question asked by Deputy O'Higgins regarding what is meant by the orderly and proper regulation of banking.  It is intended to mean&mdash;and it means, depending on the point of view one takes&mdash;the regulation of banking activity in a way that ensures so far as possible that it is carried on and develops in an orderly way and in accord with the national interest. This means ensuring that only competent and responsible people who can <Col N="2225" /> command adequate capital and appreciate national economic needs and aspirations would be permitted to engage in banking and that the ownership, control, operation and management of banks should be consistent with the common good.</P>
      <P>Obviously that is a fairly generalised definition but the phrase itself is fairly general.  I understand from the Central Bank that they intend when it is vested with the authority to grant or refuse a licence under this Bill to apply certain criteria in granting or refusing a licence.  Regard would be had to the following factors: (1) the standing and personal suitability of the directors and chief executives, their financial standing and record, and their experience in banking and related fields; (2) the competence, integrity and experience of the proposed management; (3) evidence of adequate provision for management succession, particularly important in the smaller banks; (4) adequate fidelity guarantee insurance for all staff; (5) evidence that the proposed business was soundly based and planned with clearly defined and adquately researched objectives; (6) the Central Bank would require to be satisfied that the objectives of the business would be consistent with economic and monetary policy, the safety of depositors' funds and fair trading in banking; (7) satisfactory projections over a three-to five-year period of services to be provided, employment, balance sheet and profits.  There would require to be paid up share capital of at least £500,000.  There would also be suitable requirements regarding commencing capital, free resources and secured loan capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These proposed requirements are necessary if the Central Bank are to carry out properly their functions as proposed under this legislation, namely, of protecting the public and ensuring the orderly and proper regulation of banking.  In addition, the bank are anxious to apply criteria bearing on the control of banking businesses, in relation to the content of external shareholding, to the extent of shareholding by a particular individual or group&mdash; except where the business is a subsidiary of a bank&mdash;and the nationality <Col N="2226" /> of the directors.  I cannot commit the Central Bank to specific criteria on this but I am trying to indicate to the House the general factors the bank will bear in mind in operating this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Minister.  From what the Minister has read out&mdash;which I realise is merely advice or an indication from the Central Bank&mdash;it appears that there is going to be involved to some extent consideration of how an applicant for a licence will be circumstanced from the point of view of staff in providing the services indicated, and there will have to be a consideration as to the relationship between staff and management. I have forgotten the words used by the Minister but satisfactory projection of the provision of services over a stated period taken in conjunction with management succession indicates some consideration of what the internal set-up will be as between management and staff in order to assume that the projection in relation to services will be carried out.</P>

      <P>Suppose the Minister is short of money and some foreign bank, the Bank of Nova Scotia, for example, makes an offer to provide the Government with a certain amount of money and the Central Bank does not regard that as being &ldquo;in the interest of the orderly and proper regulation of banking&rdquo;&mdash;that phrase appears twice in the same paragraph; to put it mildly, that is rather unusual in legislation&mdash;and the Minister is appealed to by the Central Bank and, having made a deal with the Bank of Nova Scotia, he says: &ldquo;You are all out in the wet.  I have allowed these fellows in.  They are giving us £5 million or £10 million and I am afraid your banking, economic and policy regulations <Col N="2227" /> must take a back seat because I am very badly in need of the money and I propose to allow these people to come in and set up their bank&rdquo; what check is there in this section against that kind of operation?</P>

There is the question as to whether or not they can participate in the scheme for the clearing of cheques and so on.  That is another factor. Coming in as banks, as a number of <Col N="2228" /> them have, they are not controlled at the moment.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister explain the need for subsection (5)?  I accept that the granting of a licence would not be an indication of the solvency of a person or a company, but surely a licence would not be issued to an insolvent person or company. This subsection appears to be superfluous. I was wondering if there was anything behind it.</P>

      <P>It is possible that such claims could not arise, but this may be just making assurance doubly sure.  I can visualise two cases, one in which a company gets a licence and is solvent, and then becomes insolvent, I think this would be a bit remote, but it is possible that a creditor or a depositor with that company might claim that the Central Bank should not have given a licence and thereby has incurred a legal liability.  This is remote.  The more likely case is if the Central Bank were to give a licence to people who, as a result of all investigations, appeared to be solvent but subsequently turned out to have been insolvent at the time of the granting of the licence; it is a very unlikely possibility, but it is something that could happen.  In that case someone might think he had a right of action against the Central Bank.  The subsection is designed to guard against that kind of possibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 6, line 34, to delete &ldquo;conditions (if any)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;conditions (which expression in <Col N="2230" /> this and the next following subsection does not include a condition of the kind specified in subsection (4) of this section), if any,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give power to the Minister, at the request of the Central Bank, to make an order providing that it should be a pre-condition of the granting of a licence that the applicant should be a company.  Any order so made may be amended or revoked.  Following a review of the licensing position, in conjunction with the Central Bank, we decided it was desirable that these powers should be available as individuals should not in future be accepted as eligible for banking licences.  In the case of individuals there is no guarantee of continuity and that could be a disadvantage from the point of view of depositors. It is only by having a corporate body that assets and liabilities can be positively identified.  Moreover, banking nowadays is so complex as to require a broadly based organisation with a number of persons having different skills taking responsibility.  At present all banking businesses holding licences are companies so that no great hardship should be involved for individuals by confining future licences to companies.  However, in the past few months some licences have been taken out by individuals, who are not, in fact, carrying on a banking business.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 6, after line 42, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() Whenever the Bank proposes to impose a condition in relation to a licence or to amend or add to the conditions of a licence&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  it shall notify in writing the person who holds the licence or to whom the licence is intended to be granted that it intends to impose a condition in relation to the licence or to amend or add to the conditions of the licence, as the case may be, and of its reasons for so doing and that the person may, within twenty-one days after the date of the giving of the notification, make representations in writing to the Bank in relation to the imposition, amendment, or addition, as the case may be, and shall specify in the notification, the condition or the amendment or addition, as the case may be,</P>
      <P>(b)  the person may make such representations to the Bank within the time aforesaid, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  the Bank shall, before deciding to impose the condition or amend or add to the conditions of the licence, as the case may be, consider any representations <Col N="2232" /> duly made to it under this subsection in relation to the imposition, amendment or addition, as the case may be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This requires the Central Bank to give prior notice to the banks of any intention to attach a new condition to banking licences or to vary existing conditions and to consider any representations made by the banks.  The intention is to ensure that the banks will get a full hearing when any change in conditions might make difficulties for them.  I think it is a reasonable requirement and, in relation to a Supreme Court decision some time ago, it may be necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that these licences have to be renewed periodically?  It is some time since I read this Bill but my recollection is that, once you had a licence, you had it, and it was not renewable.  When the Minister talks about new conditions does he mean conditions for newcomers?</P>

Once granted they are there unless revoked but there is provision for the Central Bank to lay down conditions connected with the granting of a licence and also from time to time to vary those conditions.  It is in relation to the procedure for varying or amending the conditions that I propose this amendment.</P>

      <P>They will vary depending on the size and nature of the banking business but they will certainly include, in the case of major banks, conditions about the proportion of deposits which must be deposited with the Central Bank for the purpose of controlling the degree of liquidity and also conditions which will enable the Central Bank to enforce policy on credit.  I speak in very general terms. These will be applicable to major banks.  In the case of merchant banks and others different conditions would apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the control which the Central Bank will exercise over the commercial banks will not be subject to conditions laid down in the licences.  The control we are giving here to the Central Bank will be broadly within this Bill, and will not need to be and should not be included in the licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a section in the Bill which deals specifically with requirements in relation to monetary policy but the method of enforcement arises because of the conditions under the licence.  One of the conditions that I imagine would be in every licence would be that the banks would comply with general directives issued from time to time by the Central Bank in regard to, say, credit.  The method of enforcement is under the licence and the conditions attaching to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

      <P>The real difficulty about this is in relation to the gentlemen who impinge on the banks&mdash;not that I have much sympathy with commercial banks.  The real nigger in the woodpile is the Minister for Finance, <Col N="2234" /> not the ordinary banks and their customers: they are the people who are being pushed around.  If we have this kind of joining of forces there is no use in talking about the control of credit because the people who do not control credit and who are demanding more credit all the time are, in fact, the Government.  They want more and more.  I see no provision in the Bill to control the Government or the amount of credit to be made available to them.  Going back to a major policy declaration of the Minister we will have more and more inflation so long as there is no control over the amount of money made available to the Government, or the amount of money the Government can demand.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it can hand over certain powers to the Central Bank if it so wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It can, but it certainly will not hand over to the Central Bank power to control the Government. Further, I must point out that at present the demands on credit being made and to be made this year by the Government are considerably less than most people, probably including Deputy O'Donovan, anticipate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree at all because this year particularly with what I see looming up in connection with transport organisations there will be most serious demands by the Government for additional credit.  The losses of the three major transport companies are going to run to about £20 million.  If the money cannot be found by the Government raising a national loan&mdash;and there is no evidence that it can be found&mdash;the Government will either borrow the money from abroad or obtain it from the commercial banks by the creation of credit or through the Central Bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I still disagree with what the Minister says about the different clauses which can be imposed within the licences.  I would prefer to see that each licensee is equally subject to the Central Bank in relation to matters of monetary policy rather than have the clauses within the licences varying and the Central Bank not having equal powers over different banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not have made myself quite clear when I said that the conditions would be different.  I did not mean there would be less power vested in the Central Bank in relation to them but rather that the conditions which would be applied to normal commercial banking would not be appropriate to an investment bank or merchant bank.  That is all I meant.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should add that some examples of the matters which might be covered by the conditions attached to the licences are a time limit within which certain requirements, say, capital structure of the company, should be met; conditions designed to secure the prudent conduct of the business&mdash; these might relate to such matters as the period of notice required for repayment of deposits; a limitation on the deposit liability to any one depositor; a similar limitation on advances to any one borrower; restrictions on advances to directors or to firms with which they might be connected; conditions designed to prevent an undue concentration of assets in any one category; a general condition that the licence holder will comply with the directives and requirements of the Central Bank.  As I indicated earlier I would anticipate this being in every licence.</P>
      <P>The section would also enable the Central Bank to regulate the opening of branches by banks should it be considered desirable to exercise supervision in this regard.  It might be achieved by imposing a condition that the prior consent of the Central Bank would be obtained before the opening of any branch office.  These are some examples of the kind of things which might be covered by the conditions attached to licences.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 13 and 14, to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(j)  on demand made by a majority of the depositors.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is quite clear.  The first duty of any bank must be to their depositors.  If depositors are not satisfied with the activities of the bank they should be entitled to demand the revocation of a licence and the winding up of the firm.  It is a reasonable situation for any bank to find themselves subject to their depositors. I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few objections to this amendment.  First of all, in practice it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for the majority of depositors to come together for the purpose envisaged in this amendment since the depositors' names and addresses are confidential to their banks.  Attempts by depositors to come together for this purpose would very likely become known and could seriously damage their own interest by causing a run on the banks and at the <Col N="2238" /> same time they might not even succeed in getting a majority together because of the practical difficulties of finding out the names and addresses.  Furthermore, I doubt whether depositors are people qualified to initiate action in regard to the revocation of a licence. This is a matter much more for a body such as the Central Bank who are skilled in the complex activities which make up modern banking.  The loss of a licence is a heavy penalty and it should be confined to serious, specific reasons as are set out in the Bill.  Of course, depositors are creditors of a bank and if the bank should fail to make due repayment of money due to them they are covered as creditors by section 11 (1) (f) under which a licence may be revoked if a bank becomes unable to meet its obligations to creditors.  Deputies can take it that with the powers being provided in this Bill the Central Bank will keep a close watch on the activities of all banks and get detailed returns from them quite regularly.  This will enable the bank to take action at an early stage if any bank should show any signs of becoming unsound.  I would expect the revocation powers to be used only rarely.  Because this would not in practice help depositors and also because I have grave doubts in theory as to whether depositors should have the right to initiate the action to revoke a licence, I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 48, after &ldquo;cent&rdquo; to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or such other percentage not being greater than five as may be determined by the bank&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to allow a variation in the percentage on the total deposits which must be deposited by the bank.  In certain circumstances 5 per cent could be a <Col N="2239" /> penal rate on commercial banks to deposit with the bank.  In certain circumstances it may be, in the interest of the orderly pursuance of banking policy, that a lesser percentage would be more satisfactory.  I think this is a fair point to make and I would ask the Minister to consider it favourably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt very much if it can be said that 5 per cent, a minimum of £20,000, is a hardship even for a small bank.  The figure of £20,000, which is the minimum, already exists under the Central Bank Act, 1942.  Of course, at that time £20,000 was worth a great deal more than it is today so there could well be a case for a higher figure than £20,000.  Substantially it could be said that a bank which cannot afford to make the deposit of 5 per cent is probably a doubtful proposition and maybe ought not to be encouraged anyway and one should remember that the deposit is not simply dead money as far as the bank is concerned but will be earning the current rate of interest.  I am afraid I cannot see that there is a very strong case for this.  It seems to me that to accept it would simply be opening the door to encouraging people to enter into banking who are not financially equipped to do it and that is not in their interests or in the interests of the people with whom they deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is not to allow that type of situation to develop.  The purpose of the amendment is quite simple.  If, say, in a reflationary position you wanted to revamp the economy it might be a good thing to release 1, 2 or 3 per cent of these deposits back to the commercial banks to allow them to increase credit.  This might be desirable in certain circumstances.  The purpose of the amendment is to allow a certain amount of flexibility to the Central Bank in the matter of monetary policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should distinguish between the deposit envisaged here, which is the sum that is to be available for creditors, particularly depositors, on the one hand, and on the other the deposits which are provided <Col N="2240" /> for in another section which have to be made from time to time to the Central Bank in conformity with monetary policy.  In those cases certainly this could vary from time to time and it is envisaged that it would vary but the particular deposit that is involved in this section is in the nature of the deposit or guarantee that is entered into by, say, an auctioneer on taking out a licence.  It is not the kind of deposit that is going to operate to any noticeable degree in relation to control of credit or monetary policy. It is too small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree in so far as the difference between a commercial bank and an auctioneer is that an auctioneer can put up a bond in relation to his deposit but this is hard cash and, in fact, a figure of £500,000 in cash if released could lead to a credit expansion in the region of £5 million which could be desirable in certain inflationary circumstances.  I wish to emphasise that it could be used as a weapon of monetary policy and the Central Bank should, if necessary, have the flexibility in the operation of this deposit to use it if and when necessary.</P>

      <P>or such other percentage not being greater than five as may be determined by the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it, I would ask the Minister to confirm this, that the two big commercial banking groups in this country are now legally Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland.  Judging by the notices I see on the outside of banks, that is the position.  Therefore, each of these big groups will only have to deposit £500,000, about one-tenth of 1 per cent, but an unfortunate group of people starting up a bank may have <Col N="2241" /> the minimum amount to deposit. Before you go into the banking business you are supposed to have a minimum amount available for carrying on your business.  Speaking from recollection, that minimum amount is £200,000.  Am I right?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It will operate in practice as £1/2 million but there will be a special provision in section 13 for small banks whose capital does not exceed £15,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is that if you take the bank which has a capital of £1/2 million it will have to put up 5 per cent, £25,000, but these great colossi will only have to put up £500,000, which is one-tenth of 1 per cent of £500 million.  With the inflation which the Minister is so fond of defending the day will come very shortly when £500,000 will be very small cheese.  The assets of these two big groups are now four times what they were even ten years ago and in another ten years they will probably be ten times what they are today.  This pandering to the existing commercial banks runs through the Bill a bit.  The Minister may not realise this but an outsider like myself reading the Bill as a whole&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true that the proportion of deposits required from a big bank is smaller than the proportion required from a small bank but we must remember that we are dealing here with what might be called the deposits to qualify a bank which will be held and used if necessary in ease of depositors if the bank gets into difficulty.  We must distinguish between that and the other deposits which are dealt with later which are required in relation to monetary policy.  In this case I think it is clear enough that there is normally a higher margin of safety when banks have much greater resources and a much wider spread of investments.  Consequently, the proportion <Col N="2242" /> required is not unreasonable. Furthermore, I would say that the actual amount required and the minimum figure is very small in relation to small banks.  In fact, the minimum figure is the same as it was in 1942. In so far as the compulsory depositing of money with the Central Bank is concerned for purposes of monetary policy, the bigger the bank the bigger the deposits they will have to make. That will cancel out the apparent anomaly that has been pointed out in relation to this section.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(5) The deposit shall carry interest at a rate equivalent to the rediscount rate of the Central Bank of Ireland and shall be payable at such periods not being greater than six month intervals.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to note that the Minister has taken account of our amendment in relation to the declaration of the rate of interest on deposits.  In amendment No. 12 he has not taken account of the dates of payment of the interest. Because of that, perhaps, amendment No. 11 is more appropriate than the Minister's amendment.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy says, the principle involved in amendment No. 11 has been accepted by me. However, it would appear that the wording of amendment No. 11 is not very satisfactory.  Amendment No. 12 has been drafted by the parliamentary draftsman and agreed with the Central Bank.  The reason for the omission of the reference to payment at six-monthly intervals is that it might well not suit some banks.  The amendment submitted by me leaves it open to the payment being made at intervals which will suit the bank.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister really dealt with the point which I made.  As I said, £500,000 is negligible in relation to a group of banks which are now one legal entity with assets of £500 million. On the other hand, a sum of £25,000 would be a sizeable amount to a bank with assets of £1/2 million. The Minister and I did first year economics at some time or other and we know the theory that a bank lends nine times as much as its assets.  The Minister is taking away a great deal of power from incoming competitors of the giants that have now been created, doubtless because they had notice and knew what was coming.  They might have done it anyway.  I am not saying they would not.  Presumably they knew what was coming from the influx of American banks and others.</P>
      <P>The section provides that the amount of a deposit maintained by a holder shall be 5 per cent of the total deposits at offices in the State of the holder but shall not be less than £20,000 nor more than £500,000.  What is the point of including &ldquo;nor more than £500,000&rdquo;? I am giving the Minister a hint as to how he might lay his hands on some money and I have not the slightest doubt that he is in dire need of money. This is not my purpose in querying him on this section.  There are references to equality of competition in the Bill.  We should attempt to create conditions that are even for all comers. This is not an even condition by any means.  This is an uneven condition.  It has nothing to do with what the Minister says about banks being required to make deposits for reasons related to monetary policy.  This is a different thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I was pointing out.  I am not disagreeing with what the Deputy has said.  In fact, I <Col N="2245" /> agreed already that it is uneven under this section.  I drew attention to the fact that under this section the deposits are not the kind of deposits involved in later sections required by monetary policy.  These are deposits which are required in the form of some kind of protection for depositors.  I pointed out that the larger the bank and the wider the spread of its investments, the less risk there is for depositors, and that the risk in the case of small banks is higher for the depositors than in the case of big banks.  That does not mean that every small bank is a bad risk and every big bank is a good risk. I am not saying that.</P>
      <P>I am saying that the risk is higher in the case of small banks.  Therefore, in this section which is dealing with that risk situation for depositors the deposit is higher.  I am not suggesting that it is realistically sufficient to protect all depositors.  Of course, it cannot be.  I am saying that in so far as one is talking about equality of treatment, then one can have regard to other deposits which are made for the purpose of monetary policy, in which case the deposits from the big banks will be far greater than the deposits from the small banks and, in proportion, may well be higher than in the case of the small banks.  We make the provision, particularly for the small banks, that they do not have to make the deposit in cash if they are below a certain size. I think that, taking the whole thing on balance, one finds that the balance is not against the small bank.</P>

      <P>Between February, 1969 and February, 1970 the consumer price index rose by 5.9 per cent.  The percentage increase between February, 1970 and February, 1971 was 10.0.</P>

      <P>Would not the Taoiseach agree that to describe a change from 5.9 per cent to 10 per cent as a flattening out of the curve, as was done here last week by the Minister for Finance, is a little misleading?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the way in which you look at it.  If the Deputy would take other figures, say quarterly figures from February, 1970, he would see that not only is there a flattening out of the curve but that there is a trend in the other way.  Also, if the Deputy would refer to paragraph 9 of the recent publication&mdash;&ldquo;Present Policies Against Inflation&rdquo;&mdash;published by a working party of the Economic Policy Committee of the OECD, he will find such a statement made.</P>

      <P>No specific decision regarding a consultant grade general practitioner has been taken.  The Deputy will be aware that so far as the official health services are concerned general practice is in a transitional phase.  My Department have been primarily concerned with the prospective replacement of the dispensary medical system by a choice of doctor scheme.  The Deputy will probably be aware, too, that I am in the <Col N="2249" /> process of setting up an advisory body on general medical practice, broadly representative of interests concerned or affected, with wide ranging terms of reference which would include the post-graduate training of general practitioners.

      <P>I think I should first of all make the point before entering upon the detail of my reply that my Department's anti-smoking campaigns concentrate upon cigarettes and are aimed at the young.  The present campaigns do not lay the emphasis on the diseases associated with the smoking of cigarettes, but rather concentrate on producing a climate, among the young particularly, in which the cigarette is neither the &ldquo;in thing&rdquo; nor a symbol of maturity.</P>
      <P>So far as the expenditure on advertising by my Department in the years ending on the 31st March, 1968, 1969 and 1970 in the media to which the Deputy refers is concerned, I would draw his attention to the reply which I gave to him in response to a somewhat similar question which was reported in Volume 251, column 856 of the Official Report for Tuesday, 9th February, 1971.</P>

    <P>which gives a total of £17,136 out of the total sum of £24,444.15 expended on the anti-cigarette smoking campaign during the year 1970-71.  The main item upon which the balance was expended was the anti-smoking poster design competition for children.</P>
    <P>So far as the figure for television is concerned, as I indicated in February, the showing of the &ldquo;Smoking Kills your Taste for Life&rdquo; series of filmlets was not charged for by Radio Telefís Éireann.  They were shown free of charge during commercial time as part of the RTE Authority's public service contribution.  I estimated, at that time, that if the showings had to be paid for at the going commercial rates they would have cost my Department about £17,500 in the period between October, 1970 and January, 1971.  The final figure for the year would be, I estimate, about £22,000-£23,000.</P>
    <P>I would again emphasise that in the school film shows, of which more than 1,000 a year are given, a special emphasis is laid on showing the film &ldquo;Smoking and You&rdquo; which has a strong anti-smoking message.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>A White Paper setting out the proposed terms of Ireland's accession to the Communities will be published when the negotiations are concluded. The present indications are that it will be possible to conclude the negotiations by the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister in view of the fact that the British White Paper is expected out quite shortly&mdash;within ten days or a fortnight&mdash;is there no prospect of getting ours a bit earlier than the end of this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get out a report on the progress up to July.  I have a meeting on 12th July and there is a meeting of officials next week.  So, I think after the July 12th meeting I will circulate a position paper to Deputies but it may not be the final position because we have certain matters which concern us as negotiators which would not concern the British.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the doubts that exist about the kind of status of these position papers and the uses they may be put to, would the Minister not consider an interim White <Col N="2257" /> Paper because I think previously when we received papers from the Minister there was some doubt as to whether they are free of confidentiality and can be freely used.  The important thing is to get across to the public, not only to Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the main part of the negotiations should be covered by then but certain problems which arise only for Ireland perhaps, and the fishery problem, may not be settled by that time.  These will have to be dealt with by us before accession.  So that what can be reported to the Dáil I will report but there would be a Government White Paper at the end to put to the Dáil in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to the fact that progress in the case of Britain seems to have been made much faster than anticipated&mdash;it is rumoured today that Britain is in&mdash;could the dates for your negotiations not be brought forward? Does the Minister not think that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter of the time.  We have a meeting on the 29th at official level.  I have a meeting on the 13th.  There is another meeting now on fisheries.  The Deputy will be aware, we have a multilateral meeting.  So, it is a matter of getting times when the Six Foreign Ministers and the Minister of the applicant countries are all free to be in Brussels at the same time but, no matter what speed we do, I think you can take it that the negotiations will finish this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider if there is a significant amount of progress to report by mid-July on a number of issues, actually producing an interim White Paper and not merely a verbal report to the Dáil from the point of view of the public having something to get their hands on, perhaps in conjunction with the assessment of the effects of membership, which we also expect from the Minister in July? It would be useful to have that to <Col N="2258" /> browse through during the hot summer months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if his attention has been drawn to the statement by the Parliamentary <Col N="2259" /> Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries regarding the retention of this country's 12 mile fishing limit as a member of the EEC; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether his attention has been drawn to the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, on his return from his recent EEC visit, that he believed the Republic would be successful in holding the present 12 mile fishery limit within the EEC; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's remarks were, I understand, concerned with the proposals on fisheries which we have made to the Communities.  As Deputies are aware, we have proposed that we should, after we join the Communities, continue our existing regime of access to fishery waters and that the ten member States of the enlarged Community should formulate a revised fisheries policy which would be equitable for all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did state quite confidently that we would retain our 12 mile limit.  Is the Minister in agreement with this because in the interest of accurate up-to-date information being given to the people who will ultimately decide as to whether or not we will enter Europe, this is very important?  I want to know if the Minister is in full agreement with the remarks made by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to take it that I am in full agreement with what motivated the Parliamentary Secretary and that is to insist that the 12 mile limit should be retained.  To move any degree from that at this time is to invite charges of weakening your position and I think the Parliamentary Secretary was very right to make a very strong positive statement <Col N="2260" /> that could not be misinterpreted by opponents of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary had made, as we understood it, a rather important tour of Common Market countries and, allowing for a certain amount of exuberance on his return to native soil once more, his remarks were a trifle surprising and I put down this question because I took it he was the bearer of important news to the Minister for Foreign Affairs since he could make such an important and confident-sounding statement.  Is the Minister, in fact, telling us that the Parliamentary Secretary was, in effect, talking through his hat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I have said what I wanted to say on it and I think I am quite clear.  I referred to statements from Government benches because people very quickly attack us for weakening our position in regard to the 12 mile limit.</P>

What I would like to ask the Minister is if before statements are made by such people as the Parliamentary Secretary, he is consulted so that contradictory statements would not be issued on important matters such as entry into the EEC, or is the collective responsibility gone by the board?</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>The Commission proposals, which were unacceptable to us, have not been adopted by the Council of Ministers as the Community position and they have been overtaken by developments in the last 24 hours.  The Community has now agreed that there should be a multilateral meeting on fisheries with all the applicant countries next month. At the same time the Community has formally presented to us the text of a declaration on fisheries which was agreed at the meeting with Britain. This declaration does not contain specific proposals but it does recognise the great importance, economically, socially and regionally, of the fisheries regime for the enlarged Community and recognises the need to reconsider the access provisions of the Community's fisheries regulations.  The declaration is being studied here in the light of the proposals which we put to the Community on 7th June and which we still maintain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it appears that the Norwegians at this stage have gained solid negotiating advantages and that <Col N="2262" /> it appears we are still awaiting a change of heart on the part of the Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has no reason to think that the Norwegians have gained any advantage up to now. What has happened is that the Communities have agreed to re-examine the fisheries common access proposal. They have agreed to have a multilateral meeting; that means the Norwegians, the British, the Danes and ourselves. I do not see how the Deputy can say the Norwegians have gained an advantage.  They had negotiations on Monday and this explains why they made a statement but the same statement has been made by us through the diplomatic channels available because we did not have a meeting at which to make it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware from repeated statements in the press in the last 48 hours that the change in the attitude of the Council of Ministers and their rejection of the Commission's proposals arises from the Norwegian position and the desire to make special concessions to Norway because of that country's indented coastline?  There was no reference to Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case, as reported, that this led to an urgent telex message from him to Luxembourg or Brussels and what was the purport of that?  Can the Minister state where we stand <i>vis-à-vis</i> Norway?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Immediately after the fisheries regulation was brought in we had negotiations and I protested about the regulation at the time.  This means that Ireland, because it had negotiations on that day, were the first to speak on the matter.  The Norwegians had negotiations after Ireland.  There was then, and there has been since, newspaper speculation that because of the importance of the fishing industry to Norway that country would, or should &mdash;according to the commentator&mdash;get special treatment.  The recent reports in <Col N="2263" /> the newspapers are not new.  The initiatives I have taken have been taken on the basis of getting consideration for the Irish position as a separate negotiation, distinct from the British and Norwegians.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been in all the papers.  How secret can it be?  I want to know if it is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, and as far as those with whom I can communicate know, it is not correct that the Council made any such decision. The Council decided to issue a statement, from which I quoted.  There will be a multilateral meeting in July. There have been persistent comments by certain commentators in Brussels from the beginning that Norway should, and would, get special treatment, and these comments have appeared again.  That is the present position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I pressed for a multilateral meeting because our negotiations were due in July and the British and Norwegian negotiations were held last Monday.  Through the channels available to me I pressed very hard for a multilateral meeting and this request was granted.  It would lose sight of the main target to enter into competition with the other applicants as to who said what first or who was the loudest.  The other applicant countries can be assured of praise from the Opposition in Dáil Éireann and, presumably, I will get praise from the Opposition parties in their Parliaments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister <Col N="2264" /> will accept in the light of developments in the past 48 hours that prospects are remote for the Irish Government's proposals being accepted at meetings held at the end of this month or in July. Would the Minister not accept that this is so, particularly in the light of the special consideration which seems to be emanating in favour of the Norwegian proposals?  The Minister should accept that it is high time we faced up to this fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Community proposal comes nearer to mine than to any of the other proposals.  I do not think it is helpful for Deputies to say we have not a chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not accept that the whole basis of his argument in relation to fisheries policy is the hope that once he gets into the EEC bed&mdash;if one might draw the analogy&mdash;he will then ask the bride whether he is going to be loved by her? In that context one might ask the Minister if he has any prospects whatever.</P>

    <P>19.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if the tentative estimate made in April 1970 that the Irish contribution to the EEC would be £19 million per annum in the post-transitional period has been revised on the basis of the Community system of own resources being fully applied.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimate in the Government's White Paper of April 1970 was that Ireland's contribution to the financing <Col N="2265" /> of the Communities when the Community system of &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; was being fully applied by us could be as high as £19 million a year and might well be less.  Given the qualifications emphasised in the White Paper to which this estimate is subject, it is not possible at this stage to make a more precise calculation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the percentage agreements reached yesterday between the British and the Council of Ministers, has any estimate been made of a revision of the figure of £19 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained this before to the House.  What is being negotiated has nothing to do with what a country pays in the &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; system.  Each country would pay what it collects in levies, customs duties and a percentage of the value-added tax&mdash; not more than 1 per cent.  This would be an automatic payment after the transitional period.  What is being negotiated at the moment is how to phase in from the present position to payment of the full amount.  It will be a graded sum; I have given the House the formula for this.  The amount will gradually increase each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state what kind of phase-in arrangement is expected in our case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the House about this before.  It is a formula related to the GNP and the proportion of the GNP of an applicant country related to the total GNP of the Ten. A percentage rebate is payable, the percentage reducing each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us the result of the calculation? Is the formula on the records of the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only a few weeks ago since I said this and I circulated the formula.  It is possible to make a calculation on what has been offered to the British but we must wait to see what rebate percentages will be negotiated by us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>An agreement on dumping was <Col N="2269" /> reached at my meeting with the Communities on 7th June.  This is summarised in the note on the outcome of the meeting which was circulated to Deputies immediately after the meeting and, as will be seen, it relates to dumping during the transitional period.</P>
    <P>The question of dumping or practices of a dumping nature after the transitional period was dealt with earlier in our negotiations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says this matter was dealt with earlier but I have failed to elicit from him what conclusion was reached.  Have we a reasonably firm assurance on this matter?  Have we a reasonably firm assurance that, when the transitional period is over, goods cannot be sold below cost to this country, a practice which would constitute dumping in real terms, though it will not be called dumping really?  Have we some provision under which we can take action to deal with that kind of situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had this before.  When we are full members there will be a common market and dumping will not arise.  Unfair trading could arise or the use of a monopoly or discrimination.  There are articles in the Treaty of Rome, Articles 7, 85, 86 and 92, under which action can be taken.  We have been assured by the Community that protection against such practices will be given after accession. During the transitional period we sought to get our own control over anti-dumping measures and we succeeded in getting those.  It was a precedent, but the Community agreed to give us this on the basis of the arguments we put up</P>

      <P>Against third countries &mdash;the Communities second and ourselves first&mdash;we would have power to take action.  As regards dumping from member countries, that would not be regarded as dumping actually, but it can be protected against under some <Col N="2270" /> other articles of the Treaty of Rome and we would have the assistance of the Community in taking steps to stop that.  It will be the Community's business to make sure such a practice does not succeed.  We will have, of course, the experience of the transitional period.</P>

Protection against dumping would be a function normally taken over by the Community on the day of the signing of the Treaty, but we have agreed with the Community that we can continue our own legislation during the transitional period. After that it will be Community protection and Community action.</P>

      <P>The Treaty articles are in many respects rather vague in terms of protection against dumping into this country.  Surely the Minister accepts that this issue is very serious <Col N="2271" /> and relatively more serious, for example, than that of fisheries in view of the peculiar sensitiveness of many Irish industries to dumping.  Will he, therefore, not accept that there is grave need to mount an even stronger campaign than is being attempted on the fisheries issue to ensure that our industries are protected?</P>

      <P>There is fairly widespread belief that there has been pretty low behaviour in recruiting people who are not able to take care of themselves, bullying them and so on.  These people are unwilling to give evidence and are, perhaps, afraid of being beaten up.  They are probably unwilling to give information about those for whom they work.  Certainly, it is not easy to get evidence but it is generally believed by those who have inspected the areas and those who live there that there are people who are not, perhaps, mentally capable of taking care of themselves being thoroughly blackguarded by subcontractors.</P>

I have heard these reports and I have gone to see for myself.  I do not want to denigrate any person but I ask that what is to be done should be done and let the book be closed.  My suggestion is that the Minister for Foreign Affairs with the Minister for Labour should see to it that all those who have been exploited and intimidated&mdash;that is beyond yea and nay and the Minister has admitted it; I know it has happened despite what the Scottish police say: exploitation and intimidation have taken place and the Minister knows this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

From what I <Col N="2276" /> have seen these people are living in botháin, cow houses, byres, bothies, or whatever you like to call them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers (for the Minister for Transport and Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a considerable amount of transport legislation in the Dáil in recent months. The Road Transport Act, 1971, has introduced significant changes in the road haulage regime which should affect the future pattern of internal and international haulage of goods by road. We have also had the British and Irish Steam Packet Company Limited (Acquisition) (Amendment) Bill, 1970 which provided the occasion for a discussion not only on the affairs of the B &amp; I Company but also on more general aspects of the cross-Channel trade and the relationships between the various undertakings involved in it both here and in Britain.  Following the interim legislation to deal with the CIE deficit situation last year, a comprehensive review of the financial affairs of CIE is at present being <Col N="2279" /> carried out and I envisage that further legislation may be necessary arising from this.</P>
      <P>All these measures have been framed within the general policy of achieving adequate and efficient transport services to meet the needs of communication, trade and tourism both internal and international.  Transport is going through a period of great change at present and the courses which we adopt in specific sectors and at particular times must take account not only of our own needs and circumstances but also of developments on the international front.  Consequently, we must retain a degree of flexibility in the formulation of future policy and avoid the rigidity of specific formal plans.  Moreover, our transport situation would be affected by our entry into the European Economic Community and the development of the Community's common transport policy.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the normal practice, when there are substantial changes in policy, is to publish a White Paper, and his concept of avoiding the rigidity of formal plans and therefore not telling us what the policy is is one that is not acceptable to Parliament?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy completely. I have not only the experience of my colleagues but my own experience and the changes in methods and utilisation of transport have been so rapid and the predictions in regard to them have been so inaccurate in many cases that the idea that the Minister could present a White Paper indicating what he thought was to be the policy for sea, land and air transport, and stick to that policy, is absolutely ludicrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in view of the rapid developments in transport to which he has referred it is essential the Government should have some overall plan for transport development?  We should not have had haphazard legislation which is unco-ordinated and unconnected. As the basis for developing an overall plan would the Minister not <Col N="2280" /> agree that a White Paper indicating Government thinking on transport is desirable?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The road freight legislation was linked with what was regarded as the possible effect on CIE of the present trend in regard to CIE road traffic.  The B &amp; I legislation was also linked with the report presented by a firm of consultants on methods by which there could be some collaboration and rationalisation in regard to cross-Channel transport. As far as Irish Shipping are concerned the policy is quite clear and determined.  It does not need to be related to sea and inland transport.  In regard to air traffic the pattern is constantly changing and at this moment the Government have already approved plans up to 1973 and the matter is being examined again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely disagree with the Deputy on that.  May I make it clear that, perhaps, the House has not had the benefit of looking at all the predictions in regard to the changes in traffic.  Some of the predictions have been correct and some of them have been widely short of the mark.  There have been changes in the volume of rail passenger traffic, changes in the volume of rail/road traffic, changes in air traffic.  There has been an explosion in the use of container traffic <Col N="2281" /> and unitised traffic which was predicted by nobody and, whatever figures there were, nobody could have guessed the ultimate result.  This has in turn created a change in the utilisation of certain harbours and a growth in road freight traffic in some harbours with a decline in others.  The whole of this has taken place in the past five years. I do not believe that before entering the EEC when we will have again to look at the EEC traffic, it would be really advisable for the Minister, unless he discovers he can do it and at the moment he cannot do it, to predict the likely changes in all these various types of transport so that he can commit himself to a co-ordinated policy.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that you do not need to be able to predict the exact flow of traffic five years hence in particular areas to have a transport policy?  Would he not agree that he apparently misconceives what a transport policy is and would he tell us whether the total abandonment of planning in the Department of Transport and Power, which he has just announced, is to extend to the other Departments also and whether the concept of planning has been totally abandoned by this Government since the Third Programme?</P>

      <P>I have already indicated that the Minister has taken a number of serious decisions in regard to various aspects of transport policy in the past two or three years and I took decisions before him and they relate to sea, inland and air transport. They relate to airport development and to air traffic development and I cannot see any evidence that separate decisions in which every effort was made to co-ordinate one decision with another has done any harm to the general traffic pattern in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Strictly speaking, of course, we cannot control by Statute here what happens <Col N="2283" /> outside the jurisdiction but in particular where the head office of a banking company is located within the jurisdiction we can probably go a long way to meeting this in the manner in which the Central Bank prescribes the information to be furnished.  It may be that in the event of a refusal to do so, which I think is a very unlikely situation, some other action would have to be taken but, in general, I would not anticipate that that would arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It will vary, of course, for different licence holders because different information will be required. I cannot say when precisely it would operate but I should imagine that in the case certainly of the larger banks <Col N="2284" /> it would be likely to be an annual statement.  It might be more frequent. As the Deputy will see, it is not specified here because the requirements of different banks would be different.  I think it can be taken that in the case of the larger banks it would not be at greater intervals than annually.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume it will include investment companies who have been <Col N="2285" /> attached to building firms and who have been financing the building of houses out of their funds and charging interest on money which is loaned, or interest on money which has been be-spoken but which has not been loaned. Will this be rather difficult because of the fact that there will be an interplay of interest between the building construction and the loaning of the money?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure that the Minister will include in this companies that have been set up by some of the bigger building firms to finance the purchase of houses erected by them. Naturally, there will be two separate companies but both of them will be depending on the building of the houses.  Will they be included for the purposes of this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as they set up a company which is, say, taking deposits from the public&mdash;and I presume this is the type of thing the Deputy envisages&mdash;for the purpose of financing their own building operations, they will come within the definition of carrying on a banking business.  The company, that is the banking company, will be subject to all the provisions of this Bill, including the production of the information required in this section.  That would not necessarily extend to the other company which would be a construction company.</P>

      <P>So far as having to pay tax is concerned, it will not help them to switch from one to the other.  So far as the information is concerned, all I can say on that is that the Central Bank would have to be satisfied that the information being furnished under <Col N="2286" /> this section was accurate.

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first section in the Bill which gives recognition to the associated banks.  They have become a rather monopolistic association.  Is it the Minister's intention to allow to the associated banks any special privileges over the other non-associated banks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am not sure that I can deal with this adequately on this section.  It comes up on some later sections to which amendments are proposed about fair competition, and so on.  It applies, of course, across the whole field of the operations of the banks.  It is inevitable that the associated banks which exist here, and which have a wide network of banks throughout the country, because of the very nature of the business they are carrying on, and the facilities which they already have, and have provided for themselves, will have certain advantages over other banks.  This does not necessarily mean that they are being favoured.  They will have earned them. For instance, a bank which comes in from abroad and has one branch is not incurring anything like the same overheads and thereby does not earn for itself certain facilities which the associated banks earn.  It will be the function of the Central Bank to take account of these different factors and, at the same time, to ensure that there is fair competition.</P>

      <P>This is something I referred to earlier.  This would not necessarily be in our interest.  An unnecessary duplication of facilities in theory might be providing competition, but, in fact, might simply be adding to the cost of banking.  This is one of the things the Central Bank must weigh up in relation to the kind of conditions it applies to licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, right of establishment is a theory which does not operate in the EEC at the moment in regard to certain sectors and, in my view, will not operate for a very long time.  Banking is one of them and insurance is another.  It is certainly not operating there at the moment and, as I say, is not likely to operate for quite some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be advised by the Minister on this.  This section deals with a possible situation in which trouble or difficulty is arising in relation to the holder of a licence.  It provides:</P>
      <P>Where the Bank is of opinion that the holder of a licence has become, or is likely to become, unable to meet his obligations to his creditors, the bank may give a direction in writing...</P>
      <P>I query that &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  Surely in those circumstances the bank shall give a direction in writing to the holder.  It would seem to me to be highly inimical to the credibility of the banking system if, after it became likely or apparent that the holder of a licence was unable to meet his obligations, he could in any circumstances continue to operate. If &ldquo;may&rdquo; is to be interpreted in this section as meaning &ldquo;shall&rdquo; I am quite satisfied but I wonder is it?  It is not a case in which there should be discretion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the likelihood of this section operating is extremely remote when one has regard to the provisions we are making for the making available of information to the Central Bank at regular intervals and the general supervisory powers we are giving to the Central Bank.  It is more than likely that the signs of difficulty appearing would be such as to alert the Central Bank and, in turn, the Central Bank would take action to prevent the situation deteriorating without invoking this section.  I would visualise that the occasions on which this section would be operated would be very few and far between.  On the particular point as to whether &ldquo;may&rdquo; in this section means &ldquo;shall&rdquo; I am afraid all I can say at the moment is that I believe it does mean &ldquo;shall&rdquo; but I will have to check that and I will inform the House at the next Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will remember a certain insurance company that submitted their returns and very successfully showed that they were solvent when, in fact, they were not.  I should imagine that no matter how tight the control exercised by the Central Bank something similar could happen.  I agree that &ldquo;may&rdquo; is almost certainly intended to be interpreted as &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, but is there any type of guarantee which the Central Bank could give to investors that if something like this happens they will not be at a loss?</P>
      <P>Surely it would be sensible for the Minister to try to write into the Bill something which would ensure that people who invest money in a banking organisation on a non-commercial basis would not lose money, because a bank which was licensed by the Central Bank, and, therefore, by the Government, collapsed.  I know this is very unlikely in this day and age, but one never knows what is likely to happen. Is there any way of dealing with this, particularly when a deposit is being paid?</P>

      <P>The point being made now by Deputy Tully illustrates the necessity for a certain subsection that we dealt with earlier.  We agreed it was most unlikely that this would <Col N="2289" /> happen but we were making assurances doubly sure.  There is a subsection in an earlier section which says that no claim can arise against the Central Bank by reason of loss and so on.  The fact that Deputy Tully is making this case now confirms the view I expressed which was that it was no harm to have that subsection.</P>

      <P>There are certain snags to that.  On the other hand, we have been dealing also with the sections which provide for deposits by banks on getting a licence.  That money will be available to depositors and there are provisions later in the Bill where-by, in the event of a winding up of a banking company, those moneys will go to meeting depositors' claims and will not simply go into the general fund and be available to all creditors. To that extent this Bill is making special provision for depositors but an absolute guarantee that they would not lose their money would be going further than what is contemplated.</P>

      <P>The wording of this amendment arises from the Supreme Court's decision in the Mart's Act case.  The effect of it will be to restrict the Central Bank's power to give a direction to a bank as to the material that may be included in advertisements or a direction to cease advertising for deposits and to restrict that specifically in cases in which the direction is deemed to be necessary in the interest of the orderly and proper regulation of banking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which, in effect, enables the Central Bank to embark on a credit policy in whatever direction it desires.  In order to do that, the bank requires the holder of the licence to provide a specified ratio between his assets and liabilities.  I am concerned to know what exactly is meant by assets there. Does it mean assets within the State or the total assets of the holder both within and outside the State?  Secondly, is it envisaged that there might be or could be different ratios established, defined or designated as between different banks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section was put into the Bill subsequent to its first preparation.  It was not in the original 1968 draft of the Bill.  With respect to all concerned, this Bill is the greatest load of rubbish that I have ever read.  The section says that the banks may from time to time require a holder to maintain a ratio between his assets and his liabilities.  The assets and the liabilities of everybody are always equal.  Therefore, this section is completely wrongly drafted.  In every balance sheet that is made out the assets side is equal to the liabilities side.  The whole of this long new section is just a lot of nonsense.</P>
      <P>Apart from that serious objection to it, there is another objection to it and that is the words &ldquo;a specified ratio&rdquo;; &ldquo;a ratio which does not exceed a specified ratio&rdquo;; &ldquo;a ratio which is not less than a specified ratio&rdquo;; &ldquo;the specified ratio may be expressed as a percentage of the assets or liabilities concerned&rdquo;&mdash;this kind of thing.  When this was put into the Bill it was obviously put together without proper consideration at all.  Subsection (2) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2293" /> (2) A requisition under this section may be expressed to apply&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in relation to all holders of licences or to holders of a specified category or specified categories,</P>
    <P>(b)  in relation to the total assets or total liabilities of the holders of licences concerned or to specified assets or assets of a specified kind or specified liabilities or liabilities of a specified kind of those holders,</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  It is most amusing really.  The thing is just ludicrous.  I know, of course, what is being attempted here or what the purpose of this is but it is really an outrageous attempt at totalitarian legislation. It is a total effort to give a kind of overall power to the Central Bank and I do not believe that it has done what the Central Bank thought they wanted done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donovan is, of course, correct in saying that in any balance sheet the total assets will equal the total liabilities but the phrases to which he objected, I think on aesthetic grounds rather than anything else, are, in fact, the answer to that objection.  Where the section refers to specified assets or assets of a specified kind or specified liabilities or liabilities of a specified kind, this means that the Central Bank can specify the particular kind of assets or particular kind of liabilities which are to be taken into account and by that means can exercise effective control and the objection which was made by Deputy O'Donovan and which would otherwise be valid is not valid because of that particular wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general principal of this kind of control, I am not too clear whether Deputy O'Donovan is objecting to it but certainly I think that it is not alone desirable but necessary.  The power conferred by this section should enable the Central Bank to ensure two things: first that licensed bankers conform with what might be described as good <Col N="2294" /> banking practice and, secondly, by utilising the power in this section to enforce credit policy.  In particular, because of the wording I have referred to, it is open to the Central Bank by specifying the kind of assets or the kind of liabilities to be taken into account in determining the ratio, to exercise effective control in this regard.</P>
    <P>In answer to one of the queries raised by Deputy O'Higgins as to whether different ratios would be applied to different licence holders, the answer is yes, they could.  Primarily what is intended is that the kind of ratios that would apply to, say, normal commercial banks would differ from those applied to investment banks or merchant banks.  I think Deputy O'Higgins raised some other query.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It means assets of all kinds whether inside or outside the State but it may not be generally known that developments in recent years have resulted in virtually all the assets of the commercial banks being domestic assets and that the external assets are held, in fact, by the Central Bank on deposits from the commercial banks.  Despite that, the section does not preclude the taking into account, for the purpose of determining ratios, of external assets which might be held by licensed bankers.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins is correct in saying that this section should be read in conjunction with section 23.  Section 23 will give a new tool for the control of credit creation. It is expected that this section will normally be used when it is desired to control or regulate credit creation formally as part of monetary or credit policy.  The power provided for in section 24 is intended to be supplementary to that contained in section 23.  As the section stands it can be used for credit policy purposes as a back-up to section 23.  In particular, it is intended to deal with banks which might move rapidly a large volume of funds out of the country, with consequent serious reaction on the domestic credit pattern. Sections 23 and 24 taken together cover adequately what Deputy O'Higgins has in mind and I do not think the amendment is necessary.</P>

      <P>The power in this section is the power contained in section 50 of the 1942 Central Bank Act.  One part of the 1942 Act is being repealed under this Bill and is being replaced by section 24.  Deputy Collins has said that it does not provide for payment of interest on deposits and that this marks it as a provision of a penal nature and the Deputy is quite correct.  In the circumstances I have described I think the action which might be taken by a bank, and which this is designed to <Col N="2298" /> remedy, could only be regarded as reprehensible and liable to treatment in a penal manner.  On the other hand, the normal deposits, whether by way of those payable on taking out a licence or those on foot of directions connected with credit and monetary policy will bear normal interest rates.</P>
      <P>The non-payment of interest in this case marks out the seriousness of what is contemplated.  Incidentally, I do not think that this power has ever been used and I hope it will not be used in the future.  When it was enacted in the 1942 Act it was intended primarily to provide a means of inducing the associated banks to repatriate some of their external assets for investment at home.  However, as I have indicated already, almost all of the assets of the associated banks are domestic assets and almost all of our external assets are held by the Central Bank.</P>

      <P>It is formalised in the section we were dealing with a short time ago which provides that the Central Bank may direct that certain ratios be maintained in deposits and, in doing so, may specify the kinds of assets that must be deposited.  It would be open for the Central Bank to specify in a particular case, if this is necessary, that the ratio should be maintained by the deposit of so much in proportion to the total assets of the bank but that <Col N="2299" /> the deposit should consist of external assets.

      <P>The object of this amendment is to strengthen the section.  The section, as drafted, reads: &ldquo;If at any time it should appear to the Bank that it is expedient so to do, the Bank may, with the consent of the Minister, make regulations ...&rdquo; I believe the section should be changed to read: &ldquo;If at any time it should appear to the Bank that it is expedient so to do, the Bank shall, with the consent of the Minister, make regulations requiring every holder of a licence to settle all or such particular class or particular classes of its clearances as may be specified in the regulations by cheques drawn,&rdquo;<i>et cetera.</i> The object is to strengthen the section.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should like to make clear is that the section relates to balances to be held by the <Col N="2301" /> banks in the Central Bank for use in settling inter-bank debts arising from the processing of cheques, <i>et cetera,</i> in the clearing system.  It is not concerned with the clearing system as it affects the banks' customers which is, in fact, operated through the associated banks clearing house.  That being so, the amendment would make it obligatory for the Central Bank, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to require all banks to settle all or, at least, some classes of clearances through the Central Bank.  While it is true that, under the existing practice, all banks are required to settle through the Central Bank their clearances arising in the Dublin bankers' clearing system, circumstances might arise in which this might not be convenient or even possible&mdash;for instance, if there was an interruption in payments through the Central Bank.  It is necessary, therefore, to have the section more flexible than it would be if this amendment were adopted and to allow the Central Bank to determine, as circumstances dictate, to what extent this section should be applied.  The adoption of the amendment would only make the position too rigid.  It would leave the Central Bank no flexibility in dealing with these particular balances.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 12, after line 29, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() If at any time it should appear to the Bank that it is expedient so to do, the Bank may, with the consent of the Minister, make regulations requiring every holder of a licence to lodge with the Bank for clearance all such instruments payable outside the State and lodged for clearance at an office in the State of the holder as may be specified in the regulations.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is intended to give power to the Central Bank, with the consent of the Minister, to make regulations requiring banks to lodge with the Central Bank instruments, cheques, drafts, <i>et cetera,</i> drawn outside the State and presented for clearance within the State.  Similar power was available <Col N="2302" /> in section 51 (2) of Part VI of the Central Bank Act, 1942; this section is being repealed <i>in toto</i> and here we are really only re-enacting a power which was there before.  This power was never, in fact, used but it is considered advisable that the power should be retained in case there should be need to use it in the future.  The power would enable the Central Bank as and when necessary to exercise control over the collection of external negotiable instruments coming into the State and the control would be exercised mainly through the banks; in the event of a bank dispute, for example, it would be operated mainly through the banks which would remain in operation.  By exercising this power it would be possible to ensure that incoming payments would be brought to credit, the proceeds being added to our external assets, as appropriate.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3) Such regulations shall be designed to ensure free and fair competition amongst all licensed banks.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment refers to this section and the following section, section 26. There was an amendment in somewhat similar terms tabled by Deputy O'Donovan and Deputy Donegan.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that whatever regulations are made shall have regard to what is in my view and, I am sure, in the view of most Deputies, the desirable situation, namely, that banking, as far as possible, should be open, free and competitive. At the moment the manner in which clearance facilities are granted to the non-associated banks is, in fact, inimical of competition.  It is an uneven situation and if it were frozen into the new licensed banking system we are setting up under this Bill it would, I think, be quite wrong.  The Central Bank will have power to make regulations dealing with the clearance and collection of cheques, and all the rest of it, and I think the Central Bank should have the obligation of ensuring <Col N="2303" /> that such regulations are designed to ensure free and fair competition between all licensed banks.

They will be subject to approval by the Central Bank.  To go back to something I mentioned earlier, it is argued on the one hand that all banks will be charged exactly the same for the same facilities.  On the other hand, it is argued that banks which have branches all over the country should, because of this and forming part of a system which enables the clearing system to operate, be able to get these services at a lower rate than those who do not incur these overheads.  The Central Bank must determine in relation to the charges proposed for non-clearing house banks whether these charges are unreasonable or fair and take account of the opposing viewpoints.</P>

      <P>In relation to the facilitating of transfers of banks this Bill gives legal sanction to the increased monopolisation of the banking system.  I am not in favour of that. I am in favour of more competition in the commercial banking sphere, more competition in regard to deposits, interest rates and overdraft rates.  In the past few years we have seen the amalgamation of the banks into two large groups, the AIB and the Bank of Ireland group.  I doubt very much if this amalgamation has been to the betterment of the economy.  The newly established banks, especially the North American banks, have brought a new approach to banking in Ireland and rather than encourage the amalgamation of banks I feel we should be trying to encourage more competition within the banking sphere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Time will tell whether the amalgamations which have taken place are in the interests of the economy or not; it is my own belief they are.  First, there are two groups and, secondly, competition from other sources is growing.  It is necessary, especially when one looks at the size of our banking groups as compared with many banking groups as compared they are going to survive to ensure that they get the benefits of greater strength through mergers and amalgamations. It is not by any means generally accepted that competition, say, in relation to interest rates is necessarily for the benefit of the community as a whole.  First of all, competition in regard to interest on deposits will almost certainly shove up interest on overdrafts.  It may be that this could benefit a small section of the community but more likely a big section will lose out on it.  One can over-value considerably what is to be gained by competition in interest rates.  Competition in other areas, does, in fact, <Col N="2308" /> exist, as we all know, and it will tend to grow in the future.  Certainly this section and this part of the Bill does not by any means compel or oblige mergers of banks or banking groups but it does facilitate them, if it should be thought by the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Central Bank, that a particular merger scheme is desirable.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Minister was for reasons I hope I shall be able to state sufficiently clearly so that we will both understand. In the early 'Fifties I am informed that nobody with an overdraft could transfer his account from one bank to another because the Irish Banks Standing Committee brought out certain regulations to keep banks in order.  This was a most retrogressive step on their part because it meant if a man was dissatisfied, and he might very well have good reasons to be dissatisfied, he could not transfer his account from one bank to another.  I am not saying that everybody behaved well.  They did, however, think up the answer which was not to make any more deposits.  It was a very effective answer to this kind of totalitarianism.</P>

    <P>The rate of interest on an ordinary overdraft is 9½ per cent at present.  I do not see how anybody could imagine a higher rate than that lasting through time.  When the Bank of England was monarch of all it surveyed, apart from the occasional crisis in 1891 and 1907, a 7 per cent bank rate would last about two or three weeks and then the whole situation would be cleaned up.  In the 'Fifties a 5 per cent bank rate was first imposed in the belief in very low rates of interest, which, if it were not for inflation might have continued. There is no question about it high rates of interest are very objectionable.  In 1955 the Bank of England rate was made 5 per cent and I remember considerable discussion about it at the time and it was suggested it would not last very long.  I felt it would last a <Col N="2309" /> long time but even I was astonished at what happened because two years later it was made 7 per cent, which was completely contrary to what had happened in history.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that competition is growing but there is only one form of competition in ordinary matters&mdash;of course, the Minister can say that banking is different but it is not&mdash;and that is price competition.  In recent times, presumably with the approval of the Government, we have to the best of my knowledge had the highest rate in Western Europe and despite the fact that interest rates have been going down for a considerable time all over the world ours have not altered at all. I do not know what purpose is supposed to be served by their being kept in this way but certainly the existence of only two banking groups must undoubtedly have helped.  There is a well known word, &ldquo;duopoly&rdquo;, and the perfect system of duopoly is where there are two giants; there is no difficulty in shaking hands across the lunch table or anything like that.</P>
    <P>If I thought the section would normally not be operated at all and has been put in merely in case something happened, it is desirable that this kind of provision should be in the Bill.  I hope we have seen the last of these amalgamations.  I agree with my colleagues on this side of the House that were it not for the foreign banks coming in conditions would be very difficult for people.  There is no question about it they are already difficult at the moment.  There has been a serious credit squeeze in operation for the past two or three months since the banks got information about their positions.</P>
    <P>Nothing enables that to happen so easily as a situation which might come about under this section.  I take it that if this duopoly were to attempt to amalgamate the Government would intrude for the first time.  I think no take-over bid would be allowed.  Our Government here have been slow.  They believe in freedom of enterprise in a way that it has not been believed in since Carnegie and John P. Morgan used to look after the steel industry in the United States.  One would like to see <Col N="2310" /> some curb put on this kind of massive operation.  The community does not necessarily benefit from this kind of situation.  Obviously, the people who benefit are the people who by saving on overheads and so on get greatly increased profits.</P>
    <P>Subject to these considerations I think the section has of necessity to be included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>In relation to competition within the bank I should like to point out something which the Central Bank has failed to do.  In relating the rediscount rate of the Central Bank to the actual overdraft interest rates charged in the last few years the overdraft rate has not kept in line with the rediscount rate of the Central Bank of Ireland.  This is wrong and it is wrong that the Central Bank should have allowed that position to develop and that the Minister should have allowed it.  If we are to have competition there must be some control from the Central Bank in relation to the rediscount rate and there must be some direct relationship between the overdraft interest rates charged by the commercial banks and the rediscount rates.  This has not been done in the past few years and unless the Central Bank is going to force its will on the commercial banks we will not have competition of any type.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that this is the Minister's view from his replies to questions here over the past 12 months but let us look at it from the angle of the ratio of the rates of interest allowed by commercial banks on deposits to what they charge for overdraft accommodation.  In relation to these kinds of operations they are the only people in the community who make over 100 per cent profit. Even to take it in the simplest fashion, the way the late Senator Sir John Keane used to do, the margins are just fabulous.  I asked the late Joseph Kelly when he was Secretary of the Agricultural Credit Corporation what margin they would need to carry on their business.  He said: &ldquo;If we got enough business we could do it on a ½ per cent.&rdquo;  As far as I know there is still only about 1 per cent difference between the rate at which they are lending to the farmers and the rate they allow on deposits.  I think they allow 6 per cent on deposits and charge 7 per cent to the farmers.</P>
      <P>The fact is that all Governments, until the present Government, have been extremely tentative in the way they have approached the problem of the commercial banks.  The present Government have been extremely tentative except that they have pushed them around to get plenty of accommodation from them.  The Minister's explanation of why the external assets of the commercial banks disappeared did not tell the whole story.</P>

I think they allow 4½ per cent on large deposits at present and they charge 9½ per cent on overdrafts.  On small deposits I think they allow 3½ per cent.  Now there is a marked difference between 3½ and 9½ per cent. I would not mind being in the business. I wish I had my hands on some business of that sort.  Even a careless fellow like myself would do quite well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donovan may be overlooking one point and that is that fairly recently the overdraft rate was reduced by 1 per cent in relation to a substantial sector of overdrafts, that is, those provided for manufacturing industry and productive investment generally.  The categories are more precisely defined, I am just speaking off the cuff.  There was an adjustment also in deposits.  I do not dispute, despite that, that the margin between interest on deposits and interest on overdrafts is very large.  However, the deduction from those facts which is made by Deputy O'Donovan to the effect that the banks are making money hand over fist is one that I think will not stand up.  This is probably the last year in which it will be possible for people to say that because the full facts and figures will be issued at the end of this year for the first time.  It may be that when these figures come out people will take a somewhat different view of the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some years ago I became interested in this subject. Deputy FitzGerald was consulted about certain figures at the time the National Bank was taken over by the Bank of Ireland.  Some years before that I became interested in the Bank of Ireland group who declared gross profits, prior to tax, of £2 million.  It was not all that difficult for a person like myself with a great deal of experience over a long period of time in making estimates to make out what were, in fact, their gross profits.  All I had to do was to get the number of branches they had in the country and the amount of money they were getting from the State for keeping the national books and so on.  I estimated at that time that their gross profits were £6 million a year.  By a lucky accident they had about £150 million on deposit and this made the calculation very easy.  They had £100 million out by way of overdraft, investments and so on.  I did the calculation with some care.  It was not all that difficult.  I came to the conclusion that they were declaring to the public only one-third of the actual profits they were making.  This was done in accordance with the law.  There was nothing illegal about it, but it was an extraordinary law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier on in this debate the Minister used the phrase &ldquo;because of a run on the banks&rdquo;.  That law was passed to enable the banks to protect themselves against the possibility of a run but, of course, that day is long gone. If there were any chance of a run nowadays it would be all hands to the pumps; full approval for the printing press; it is only paper anyway.  The Minister may be right when he says that next year they will not show such <Col N="2314" /> large profits&mdash;even when they declare them fully.  It may be partly their own fault.  They must have got a bad knock last year.  They must have lost a lot of business.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I was wondering if the Minister could give us any indication of how closely related the commercial banks are to their investment banks.  I know it has been the policy of bank managers, when a person looks for the ordinary overdraft, to transfer him to one of their investment banks.  I sometimes get the feeling that maybe some of the assets in the commercial banks are being transferred to their investment banks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> We know that the interest charged by the investment banks is about 4 per cent more than that charged by the commercial banks.  This is a factor which has probably contributed to the cost of manufacturing and the cost of business also, because business people have to go to the investment banks to get an overdraft.  The normal practise of the commercial banks is to say: &ldquo;We have not got this money but we would advise you to go to one of our investment banks.&rdquo;  I was wondering are the same assets tied up or are they completely distinct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The assets in question are distinct as between the investment banks on the one hand and the commercial or associated banks on the other.  I am glancing quickly at a list of the various investment banks and, at a quick glance, it seems to me that in all cases where the associated banks have a share in the investment banks there are also other people involved.  In one or two cases two of the associated banks are involved but in most cases there are some merchant banks, some home and some foreign, and some insurance companies involved, but in general that is the ownership of the investment banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that it is intended later this year to introduce <Col N="2315" /> the term loan system which will have some bearing on the matter mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  Under this system the length of the loan, that is, the term for repayment, the interest rate and the amount of the loan will vary, depending on the project and the standing of the borrower.  This should mean better terms for people who earn better terms, and a higher rate of interest for those who are a much bigger risk.  What effect this will have on the business of the investment banks I am not too clear on, but it should mean that loans given by the banks after that will be given on a more rational basis and there should be a more efficient use of the resources available.</P>
    <P>I cannot say with certainly whether there is any truth in what Deputy Fitzpatrick says as a general proposition. I have certainly heard that bank managers do recommend their clients to go to their own bank's investment bank and I know that some customers have a great deal of suspicion about this.  Whether that suspicion is justified I am afraid I cannot say.</P>

      <P>In page 20, subsection (3), line 51, to delete &ldquo;by the transferee on that date&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;on that date by the transferee or under a corresponding pension or superannuation scheme of the transferee&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a minor technical amendment. It relates to pension or other benefit payable by a bank to the estate of a former employee at the time the bank was taken over by another bank.  As the Bill stands, the benefit payable becomes a direct charge on the bank taking over the other business.  The amendment will give the bank taking over the option of paying the benefit itself or of allowing the payment to be made from an appropriate pension or superannuation scheme where such exists.  This should make for more flexibility in such transfers.</P>

This is, in effect, charging duty on what might be described as the genuine transfer of property but there are similar provisions in relation to other such operations where, in certain aspects, a merger is not a genuine transfer of property.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that under subsection (5) every order made by the Government shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made.  This is one of the subsections, I may tell you, that I object to, because it means nothing.  I take it the intention is that it is laid before each House of the Oireachtas for approval or disapproval but it does not say that and in fact that section from the point of view of the validity of the order or its countermanding or repeal has no effect at all.  I would just like to ask the Minister is this the wording that is intended because it seems to me if that is the purpose of it it merely ends up in a non-event because the Dáil can do nothing about it, but if it is to be laid before the Dáil for approval or, in the usual way, for countermanding or repeal by Dáil Éireann within a specified number of days, then there is some sense in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No. An order under this section, Deputies will notice, must be made by the Government, unlike the other orders under the Bill which are made by the Minister and, secondly, Deputies will notice that there is no mention in the subsection of its being laid before both houses and being subject <Col N="2325" /> to annulment as applies in the case of other orders.  The wording of the subsection is quite deliberate because in any such case, if it were to arise, in practice it would be quite impossible to revise or amend at short notice an order changing the parity of the Irish £.  In practice it would not be possible to do this.  Also, if you had the normal provisions applying to this, in certain circumstances, such as something happening during the summer recess, you could have a period of maybe four months during which it would not be known whether or not the order might or might not be anulled.  In the meantime one could only expect chaos to ensue.  It is because of the nature of the particular order provided for in this subsection that it is proposed to do it in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to talk about cases but I am familiar with litigation which is before the High Court at the moment in which there was a similar section to this.  The Minister concerned made a regulation but somebody forgot to put it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The matter at issue is whether the direction to place it before each House of the Oireachtas was a mandatory direction affecting the validity of the order or otherwise.  Here the Government make an order.  Section 43 states:</P>
      <P>Every order under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a period during which the House is not sitting, does this mean that on the first day of the next session if the order is not laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas the order is invalidated? When we are dealing with the question of the standard of value for the Irish £ we should be very careful in relation to mandatory sections of this kind.  In fact, I should prefer to see it deleted. I do not see what purpose it serves if the Dáil can neither rescind nor approve it.  It seems an unnecessary, mechanical operation on behalf of some section of the Department of Finance or the Central Bank to make sure that on the opening day of the <Col N="2326" /> coming session this order should arrive at the Library for placing before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>It can be said that it is on the back of the Order Paper and that we can find it out in that way.  In fact, most of us do not even look at this part of the Order Paper.  Incidentally, when I looked at the back of the Order Paper to find out if I was correct, I discovered a matter about which I had been concerned for some time&mdash;the Local Government (Change of Name of Non-Municipal Town) Order, 1971.  At least this section has done some good in that it has brought this matter to my attention.

It is relevant to note from the Central Bank Report for 1969-70 that in 1952 the amount of currency outstanding was £58.6 million and in 1969 it had jumped to £141.5 million.  This is a reflection of the inflation which is taking place.  As a backing for my argument I can quote the Radcliffe Report which was published in England in 1959.  That report dealt with the working of the monetary system.  It was a well-founded argument that it was wrong to have currency on tap and I suggest that the determination of the proper amount of currency within the community should be left to the Central Bank.</P>

      <P>Deputy Collins has a good point but I do not think it would work because the banks must have money in their tills to pay depositors who are entitled to get their money on demand.  This is the real snag and if the Minister could think of a method of implementing this he would have dealt with the problem in which he professes to have such interest &mdash;the problem of inflation.  I do not think the suggestion of Deputy Collins is feasible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could put it this way.  The Central Bank should become a proper lender of last resort. That would solve the problem the Deputy has mentioned in relation to the necessity to have cash to pay depositors.  As matters stand, there would be currency on tap which is a bad monetary principle.</P>

      <P>The words &ldquo;on demand&rdquo; have been included in the section <Col N="2328" /> because it is desirable to have a formal request from the person who wishes to obtain legal tender notes.  It is similar to the existing arrangement under the 1927 Currency Act, whereby a person wishing to get legal tender notes was required to apply for them.  In the absence of a demand, a request or application, there can be doubt about the situation.  The inclusion of the words &ldquo;on demand&rdquo; is a protection to the person or the bank wishing to acquire legal tender notes as the Central Bank is required to meet the demand immediately.  If these words were omitted there could be delay on the part of the Central Bank which would be to the disadvantage of the customer.  It appears to me that we are dealing here with what is a technical situation, rather than one met every day of the week.  In fact, the average man never comes up against this problem.  That being so, it is necessary to have it clearly defined legally and the inclusion of the words &ldquo;on demand&rdquo; help to clarify the situation. I think, therefore, that I should not accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I will not push the amendment, but I think there should be some discretionary powers allowed to the Central Bank in relation to the supply of cash to the community or, in other words, to the banks.  That is not the position at present, and this militates against fighting inflation.  It has done that in the past few years, as can be seen from the tables in the reports of the Central Bank.  Perhaps an amendment which would control the printing of notes and the supply of these notes to the commercial banks and others would be acceptable.  There should be more control than there is at present.  The system is far too loose.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with this section.  It is wrong to grant to the Central Bank powers and functions of a kind which, in accordance with normal banking practice, may be exercised and carried out by banks and bankers. This is a very dangerous provision to write into this Bill.  If the Central Bank embark on commercial activities similar to those of the commercial banks and if there is a dispute in the commercial banks it is quite possible that dispute would spread to the Central Bank.  That would not be desirable and it should be avoided at all costs.  One could find a picket on the Central Bank.  That should also be avoided.</P>

      <P>No, but it was held by the Currency Commission.

No such transactions would be undertaken without full regard to the objectives of monetary policy.  That is the purpose of this.  There is no intention that the bank should engage in normal commercial banking activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 23, before section 48, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  There shall be appointed an advisory committee consisting of eight members.</P>
      <P>(2)  The members shall be appointed by the Minister upon the advice of the Governor.</P>
      <P>(3)  The committee shall be representative of the following interests:</P>
      <P>(a)  the merchant banks,</P>
      <P>(b)  the non-associated commercial banks,</P>
      <P>(c)  the savings and trustee savings banks,</P>
      <P>(d)  the building societies,</P>
      <P>(e)  the finance companies,</P>
      <P>(f)  credit unions.</P>
      <P>(4)  The committee shall have the following rights and duties:</P>
      <P>(a)  to be informed of any matters relating to business of the bodies mentioned in the previous subsection, appearing on the agenda for discussion by the Board, and to make representations to the Board thereon.</P>
      <P>(b)  to make representations to the Board on any matter which they think fit.</P>
      <P>(5)  The Minister, the Governor and the Board shall be entitled to refer any matter which they think fit to the committee for their consideration and advice thereon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2334" /> (6)  Nothing herein before contained shall be construed as imposing any obligation on the Board to accept the representations or advice of the committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been very good about accepting suggestions from this side of the House.  The Minister may or may not make a certain point on this: if he is accepting the amendment he will not make it but if he is not accepting it, he will make it.  The Minister is aware of the purpose of the amendment.  It is an attempt to give &ldquo;a say&rdquo;&mdash;a phrase much used on the Government benches at present in relation to the Common Market&mdash;to non-associated banks, merchant banks, trustee saving banks, building societies, finance companies and credit unions in matters relating to themselves.  The suggestion was made that this committee should be sent the whole agenda for every meeting of the Central Bank.  I did not think there was any chance of that being accepted. Therefore, when Deputy Tully and myself were drafting this we decided to word it</P>
    <P>... to be informed of any matters relating to business of the bodies mentioned in the previous subsection, appearing on the agenda for discussion by the Board, and to make representations to the Board thereon.</P>
    <P>That is, if they want to do so.  I think it is reasonable that this big group of people&mdash;the Minister knows that credit unions are growing apace&mdash;when something affecting their interests is up for decision by the board of directors of the Central Bank should have an advisory committee representative of them.  It is so long since this amendment was put down that I cannot recollect exactly why we put in eight members.  On the face of it, it would seem it should be six but, perhaps, it is because non-associated commercial banks might require two since there are separate groups, or something of that sort.  I should like to know the Minister's view of this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it is not very favourable.  I do not think an advisory committee of this kind would be very practicable or, indeed, necessary. The savings and trustee savings bank do not come within the scope of <Col N="2335" /> this Bill.  They are subject to separate legislation as I indicated earlier, coming under the supervision of the Departments of Posts and Telegraphs and Finance.  The position is similar in regard to building societies which are subject to supervision by the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Local Government. As regards credit unions, they are subject to supervision by the Department of Industry and Commerce. Under section 18 of this Bill building societies and credit unions will be required to furnish information regarding their business to the Central Bank so that the bank may have appropriate statistical information but I do not think this minor requirement is sufficient to justify setting up special consultation machinery.</P>
      <P>Apart from this, various confidential questions relating to banking and associated matters must be discussed by the board of the Central Bank from time to time and I think it would be inappropriate that matters should be disclosed widely if at all.  In banking there are many matters that must remain confidential and there might be very weighty objections to disclosing certain matters in relation to, say, merchant banks to representatives of building societies, credit unions or finance companies.  This kind of consultation with this type of committee could also unduly hold up matters in which immediate action might be required.  This would not be true of all items but could well be true in some cases.  In anticipation of a point that might be made I should, perhaps, mention that the representatives of the associated banks who are on the board of the Central Bank are required to take a formal oath of secrecy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point is that the Central Bank does, in fact, have frequent consultations with banking interests so far as this is necessary or desirable and representations which are made to it by any of the type of interests mentioned in the amendment are always very carefully considered.  It is the practice of the Central Bank to proceed by way of discussion and agreement as far as possible and to <Col N="2336" /> avoid the formal use of its powers in any arbitrary way.  It is the intention that this type of proceeding will continue as far as the bank is concerned in exercising these new powers given under this Bill.  I think Deputies will agree that this is the way the Central Bank has operated.  It can be taken that any matters affecting the interests of various bodies mentioned in the amendment would be dealt with similarly by consultation and persuasion unless, having gone through that machinery, a head-on collision should happen in which case the Central Bank, of course, would have to carry out its functions.  That situation has not arisen so far and there is no reason to expect it to occur with any frequency in the future.  In all these circumstances I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might meet the situation if the Minister were to state now that when something affecting each of these groups was being considered by the board of the Central Bank they would consult formally or otherwise and seek the views of the group concerned. It has been the custom if the Minister gives a specific promise to do something, to accept it and this would meet the main point of the amendment. In spite of the reference to the oath of secrecy, this belief which came out during the bank rate inquiry in England that a man can split his mind, that he can leave home as a trade unionist wearing a cloth cap and arrive as a bank director with a hard hat, is not borne out in practice.  Would the Minister be inclined to go that far?  If there was a guarantee, that would meet it. The people who are naturally most closely concerned are the non-associated commercial banks.  They are being left out in the cold.  There is a section in the Bill providing for fair competition and that kind of thing and this would help that idea.</P>

      <P>I would be prepared to give an undertaking as suggested by Deputy O'Donovan that the Central Bank seek the views of the bodies mentioned in this amendment in relation to matters in which such bodies would be concerned.  I think I must <Col N="2337" /> add the qualification that if in any particular case the Board of the Central Bank were of the view that for reasons of urgency or secrecy they were unable to do so then they would be exempt from this undertaking but subject to that they would consult.</P>

      <P>In relation to the issue of the Central Bank reserve fund what authorisation has the Minister to issue these bonds to persons other than holders of licences?  I see no objection to a wider circulation of these reserve bonds.  We have already discussed this on subsection 7.  No stamp duty is to be charged on the issue, assignment, negotiation or redemption of bonds.  The more important issue which I should like the Minister to comment on is that in relation to the restriction of the issuing of the <Col N="2338" /> reserve fund to holders with licences. This could possibly militate against the development of the money market which is so desirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 24, before section 50, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Notwithstanding anything in the Land Purchase Acts or in any order under those Acts the registers of land bonds kept by the Bank of Ireland shall be transferred to the Bank.</P>
      <P>(2) This section shall come into operation on such day as the Minister appoints by order under this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to insert a new section in the Bill to enable the land bond registers to be transferred from the Bank of Ireland to the Central Bank.  Legislation is necessary as section 3 of the Land Bond Act, 1969, provides that the register be kept at the Bank of Ireland. This transfer is part of the general transfer of Government business to the Central Bank which will include the registers for national loans and prize bonds also held in the Bank of Ireland. I do not know if I need say any more about it.  I assume the House would favour in general this policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the change of residence of the land bonds do anything to stabilise the purchase price?  I am sure the Minister is aware that the most detested type of payment for land which the farmers can get is land bonds because unless a farmer can get some gullible person to take them from him almost immediately upon issue he finds he has lost at least 20 per cent of their value within a week.  If he keeps them any time at all he is likely to find that a farm which he may think he is very lucky to have got £60,000 for has dropped to £30,000 or less.  Most of the people selling farms to the Land Commission are <Col N="2341" /> older farmers and very few of them can afford to wait to allow the bonds to mature.  Perhaps it may not be relevant to this section but could the Minister try to do something to stabilise the price of land bonds because they are a very bad investment at present?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, the Minister could ask the Central Bank to review the situation concerning the redemption of land bonds when it comes under the auspices of the Central Bank?  Perhaps they would devise a system where they could redeem more of them or else convert them into a higher earning security. I know this would be very problematical but the first holder of a land bond should not be at a loss.  Perhaps, some system could be devised which would allow a fair redeemable value to the first holder of a land bond and this could be done through the Central Bank.</P>

The amendment arises from the fact that the trustee savings banks provide limited loan facilities for some of their customers.  They might be regarded as moneylenders were it not for this amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;( ) At least one of the six appointed under subsection (1) (b) shall be representative of the non-associated banks.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The present position in relation to the directors of the Central Bank is that there are eight directors appointed by the Minister for Finance from a panel on which there are three bank directors and five general directors. Three are selected from a panel put forward by the associated banks.  Now the proposal is to reduce the three bank directors to two and to increase the five general directors to six and the panel, in effect, is abolished.  Leaving aside the question of reducing the number of banks directors, the purpose of this amendment is to suggest that at least one of the five should be representative of the non-associated banking interests, that is, if bank directors are going to go on at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Reading we expressed the view, and we still hold it, that the representatives of the commercial banks will be looking after their own interests in this but if the Minister is determined to put on two, and I assume the reason is to have one from each group, then, of course, the non-associated banks should be represented also because it puts them in an awkward position particularly as it would appear from some statements <Col N="2344" /> made recently by Government Ministers that there is going to be a lot more dependence on the non-associated banks.  As a matter of fact, they have nearly become respectable now as far as the Government are concerned.  If the Minister is determined to put on those two why should he not also give representation to the non-associated banks?</P>
      <P>With reference to the other people, I suppose they will be decent people who will know their job but always when something like this happens the strange person finds himself on, the person who has no real claim to be put on except that he was useful to the Government at some time.</P>

I do not know what the Minister has in mind but I have an idea that almost certainly it is somebody who is, perhaps, retired from business and who would agree himself that he is not in a position to carry on business any longer who will find his way on to the Central Bank to advise the Government and the country how they should do their business.  I am not anti-old, I am getting old myself like everybody else, but in an important thing like this I think every effort should be made by the Minister to ensure that the right people are appointed and the right people are those who can do the job properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  I mentioned earlier in another connection that I do not regard this as a <Col N="2345" /> static situation.  I think that banking in this country is still in a state of flux and, until it is stabilised to a greater degree, I do not think that this question of the widening of bank representation on the Central Bank board should be considered.</P>
      <P>In any case, most of the main non-associated banks, that is the merchant banks, already have indirect representation on the board as they are subsidiaries of or are closely associated with the associated banks.  They form the main bulk of the non-associated banks.  So far as the purely external banks are concerned the majority of them have been in business here for a short time only.  I do not think there is a good case, yet at any rate, for giving them representation on the board of the Central Bank.  There is another factor which we have to consider and that is that when banks are entirely foreign-owned they may be subject to external influences and considerations that could, in some circumstances, run counter to the desirable pattern of Irish banking.</P>
      <P>Another difficulty is that the non-associated banks are a very diverse group and it would be quite difficult if not impossible to get agreement on one representative for the whole group. There is no one association which is representative of the entire group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there are a number of clerical staff who may have to be transferred to other areas and the point I am making is that great hardship can result to <Col N="2349" /> staff because of transfers when such transfers involve travelling long distances to and from work.  For instance, a person who may be employed now in Letterkenny might have to travel 30 miles if he is transferred.  In such cases special travel concessions should be granted. An example I have in mind is that of staff who were employed formerly on the old West Clare railway at Ennis but who were transferred to Limerick.  As a result of this there are three people who travel from Ennis to Limerick and back each day.  This results in quite substantial travelling costs.  Representations were made to the Minister and the matter was taken up with the trade unions but, apparently, nothing could be done.  These people were transferred because of the cessation of the particular operation. Where people such as these must avail of public transport, they should be eligible for free travel concessions. Would the Minister bear this in mind in so far as any transfers arising from this measure are concerned?</P>

      <P>Certainly, I shall look into the suggestion made by the Deputy.  Such transfers as may result from the amalgamation will be governed by the same principle as is applicable to CIE staffs generally who are subject to such transfers in every other part of the country.  It is the practice and will be the continuing practice that the fullest consultation takes place between CIE and the trade unions concerned in advance of any such proposed transfer.  Certainly I shall bring the Deputy's suggestion to the attention of CIE.</P>

      <P>This particular section relates to level crossings and the question arises as to what is to be the future policy in relation to these level crossings.  Is it the intention to have all automatic crossings?  My <Col N="2350" /> reason for asking this is that it has been drawn to my attention that a tragedy occurred at the level crossing at Oranmore within the past 24 hours. This is the second tragedy to occur at this crossing in 12 months.  Are there to be no manned crossings in the future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section relates only to level crossings at which the board are not required to provide attendants.  It does not apply to level crossings on roads where the board are required to provide attendants. The purpose of the section is to enable CIE to substitute automatic warning devices and controls for gates at public level crossings at which the board are at present obliged to provide and maintain gates but not required to provide attendants.</P>
      <P>During the last century when the rail system was established, the obligation was placed on the railway companies to provide attendants at carriageways that were in existence at that time.  That obligation is continuing but this refers to roads that were not public roads at that time&mdash;small roads such as those going through farms where there are gates which CIE are obliged to attend but not to provide attendants.  It is at that sort of gate that this section enables them to provide automatic devices.  It is purely an enabling section and each case will be judged on its merits.  Similarly, they can, if they wish, do so in the case of the other type of roads but that section under an earlier Transport Act is also an enabling section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this is obvious.  It is to provide for a medical appeal tribunal. It seems to me that it is reasonable. The real objection of the locomotive drivers was not that new drivers should be made subject to these requirements but, naturally enough, men who already were and are locomotive drivers for some years do not like at a certain stage, so to speak, that their remuneration is put in jeopardy by having a section brought into a Bill, which fundamentally deals with other matters. <Col N="2354" /> Therefore, it does seem to me that this proposal by Deputy O'Leary is reasonable. I commend it to the Minister.  I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is concerned with the matter discussed on the earlier amendment which has been withdrawn.  I have discussed it as I have said with the trade unions concerned.  Their concern was to ensure that no arbitrary decision by the chief medical officer would deprive a railway driver of his livelihood and prejudice it in some way.  For that reason I agreed with them; I recognised that injustice might be caused in this matter; and, therefore, I suggested to the trade unions that the regulations, that are the important aspect&mdash;the regulations by which an engine driver for medical reasons might be relieved of his employment as engine driver and transferred to another employment&mdash;would be brought in by me under the section only after consultation with the trade unions.  It was to meet this point of view that they expressed to me.  I feel in the interest of the railway drivers themselves and in the interest of the trade union point of view, it is better to do this by way of regulation rather than by way of section.</P>
      <P>I can give the House an assurance here, and I have done so with the trade unions as well, that it will be my intention to incorporate a second opinion procedure in the regulations, in other words, that the chief medical officer of CIE cannot stand down any railway driver arbitrarily but would be obliged under the regulations to seek a second specialist opinion.  I feel that type of arrangement is better made by way of regulations.</P>
      <P>Whatever regulations we devise may not function properly.  The trade unions may have an objection; CIE may have an objection; I may have an objection.  It is better that we devise regulations that can be amended from time to time as we see how they operate and that this be done, as incorporated in the earlier Seanad amendment, after consultation by me with the trade unions.  This is a better approach in the matter and this approach commended itself to the trade unions when I met them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a snag in this as I see it.  The Minister stated that the medical officer who first examined the driver would have to consult and get a second opinion.  The Minister may not have meant it that way but, in fact, this is a formal appeal and I think the regulations should incorporate procedure for a formal appeal over the decision of which the original medical officer would have no influence whatever and he should not be allowed to make a special case or anything else about it.  This business is all very fine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The point here is not simply the point made by Deputy O'Donovan, that the CMO, in fact, must employ a consultant because in, say, a question of eyesight I do not think he would pretend that he himself could give an expert opinion, without any imputation in regard to his skill whatsoever.  It is a specialist function. He would in any case have to employ a specialist to tell him about the quality of the eyesight of the driver. So, he must bring in a consultant.  This consultant is the employee of the company. That is the way it should be looked at.  While I am sure he would give a good professional opinion, it is to some extent a question of justice being seen to be done.  In this very serious situation, where for health or sight reasons the possibilities of being disqualified are very wide indeed, there should be a body outside the company, outside the unions, but representative of both, reasonably balanced and likely to give an objective opinion <Col N="2356" /> on whether the person is fit to continue in the responsible job of locomotive driver.  There is a case for a right of appeal to a board which is seen clearly to be independent and which would satisfy the man if he is faced with the possibility of being retired, with its attendant stress.  There should be the right of appeal to a board of the kind suggested by Deputy O'Leary, with reference to the Department of Health, the trade union and the board of the company.</P>
      <P>This is the only way it would be reasonably certain that the man concerned would be assured of a fair hearing of his case.  We all know the simple truth that doctors differ on many things and, therefore, I should not be inclined to leave this matter simply to medical opinion.  Frequently we see an insurance company employing a doctor who gives one opinion and the doctor employed by the other company gives a different opinion&mdash; probably <i>bona fide</i> opinions, nevertheless differing opinions.  It is desirable that medical people be called in to give opinions but they should be supported by the lay members of the trade union movement, by the board and anyone else the Minister considers should be involved in the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The real trouble about writing in an appeal procedure into the section is that we would then be derogating from the ultimate legal responsibility of CIE, or any such railway company.  In British Railways and other companies the same stand has been taken.  Under section 7 of the Transport Act, 1958, CIE have an obligation to have due regard to safety of operation.  The chief medical officer is the person whose responsibility it is to ensure that the public are safeguarded.</P>

    <P>If an appeal procedure is written in and responsibility is taken from the chief medical officer, we would have to start considering what provision there would be in regard to the board's liability in respect of an accident to a member of the public.  That is why I do not like the appeal procedure which would be a mandatory business so far as the chief medical officer is concerned. <Col N="2357" /> I can see the merit in the amendment and the real hardship that might be caused but I think a better way to deal with this matter is to devise flexible regulations which can be amended from time to time in consultation between the trade unions, myself and CIE.  Regulations might be devised whereby the engine driver who considers he has been wronged can ask for a second medical opinion from a panel of specialists.  The man can choose the specialist he wants and the chief medical officer would have to take that second opinion into account when making his decision.</P>
    <P>This is a broad outline of what I have in mind.  I think this would be an appropriate type of regulation to cover this kind of case.  I am certain if the specialist of the driver's choice had in a definite opinion favoured the driver it would go a long way towards inducing a responsible chief medical officer to adjust his point of view.  I should like to tease out the problem on these lines, with the trade unions and the company.  I have obligated myself under the earlier Seanad amendment I spoke about to do this, namely, to bring in such regulations only after consultation with the trade unions.  It is a better way to go about it rather than writing in any hard and fast appeal procedure into the section.</P>

      <P>The section states that locomotive drivers and persons whom the board wish to train as locomotive drivers shall be medically examined from time to time.  As I understand it, no one objects to the careful selection of people for training as locomotive drivers.  Why would the Minister not change this around and simply say that persons who may wish to train as locomotive drivers shall be medically examined and leave it at that.  There is considerable concern about this matter among the men involved. I take it that at present if a driver finds that his sight is going or he is not in good health, or something like that, certain action is taken.  Some years ago a woman medical officer in England said that once the platemen became drivers and could afford enough beer she never saw them again. They became different men.  We will have to tease this out on the Report Stage.  Would the Minister agree to that since he is not prepared to accept this amendment?  No one has any objection to people who are going to be trained being medically examined, but it is unusual to have periodic medical examinations after they have trained. May I ask the Minister a question: <Col N="2359" /> are the CIE bus drivers subject to periodic medical examinations?  I am not aware that they are.</P>

It was a quite unofficial group of representatives from my own town who happened to read the Bill who first brought this to my notice.  After that I met a trade union delegation.  It is a sign of public interest in our proceedings that the Bill was read in such detail by people outside the Oireachtas.  As a result of the delegation I brought in the provision whereby I cannot regulate without consultation with the trade unions.  I believe we can work out the regulations better through consultation with the trade unions rather than by writing something specific into the section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 11, to add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a driver during routine medical examination is found to be unfit to drive for medical reasons but otherwise medically fit for employment with the company he shall continue to be employed with the company on financial considerations at least equal to those under which he was employed as a driver.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody must agree that in a job as responsible as that of locomotive driver the company has not only the right but the responsibility to set very high standards because a locomotive driver is responsible for the lives of, I suppose, several hundred people in a day in an enormous range of situations and circumstances.  For that reason the Minister and the company have the right to expect the highest possible standards in this particular job.  But, as <Col N="2363" /> with bus driving, and even more so with locomotive driving, it is a job which is emotionally and physically very stressful.  Even though a man may be passed as fit as a trainee in the ordinary case of an employee of CIE and go through his whole life to retirement without any fear of finding himself, for medical or other reasons, out of a job, that is not so with the locomotive driver in particular. Because the physical standards are so high and, in particular, the standards relating to eyesight with increasing age and as part of the ageing process, eyesight standards are likely to deteriorate if only to the extent that makes the man unsuitable as a driver of a locomotive although otherwise a perfectly healthy person, perfectly able to lead a normal life but simply because of this defect of age not fit for the job of a locomotive driver.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what the Minister's proposals are for a driver of this kind when it is found in the first instance by the chief medical officer that the man, due to reasons of sight, is unsuitable to be retained as a driver and even if there is an appeal and that decision is upheld by the specialist to whom the driver appeals and the driver is faced with the inevitability of having to discontinue his job as driver.  No responsible man driving a train would care to be kept on in this particular job if it was established to his satisfaction that he could thereby jeopardise the lives of people in the train he was driving, including his own life.  So I have put down this amendment and I support Deputy O'Donnell's amendment in order to find out if the Minister could incorporate in legislation the power to ensure that a driver who is displaced shall be offered alternative, suitable, acceptable employment for which he is found to be medically fit with the company or, if it is found that he has deteriorated either in health or in eyesight so that he is not suitable to continue in the employment of the company, that he be compensated for loss of employment to the extent of some figure such as two-thirds of his then salary, conditions certainly as generous as possible, because a man who <Col N="2364" /> is disabled and must retire will clearly find himself at that stage unlikely to get employment to which he could readily adapt.</P>
    <P>Because this job is one in which there is such a high stress factor and quite a risk that a man either because of these emotional stress factors or for some other reason develops one or other of these psychosomatic diseases, heart disease or gastric trouble, or because of the deterioration in his eyesight to a standard which, though normal for another person is not of a sufficient standard to permit him to continue as a locomotive driver, we should ensure that he is treated with the greatest possible generosity by the company.  Is it permissible for a driver with CIE, if spectacles would make it possible for him to continue to drive a train, to do so under those circumstances? Is that acceptable to the company?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <P>Amendments Nos. 6 and 7, except for very minor differences, relate to the same thing.  Section 29 of the Bill has been a cause of considerable worry and anxiety to locomotive drivers all over the country. Not merely has the Minister received representations and had meetings with the union representing the drivers but strong representations have also been made to every Deputy on the drivers' behalf.  The introduction of more stringent medical tests has frightened many of these drivers, some of whom have given long and efficient service to the company.  Suddenly these men are faced with the prospect of being shot down in a medical examination with no real provisions made for their future livelihood except vague talk of alternative employment.  The Minister should seriously consider the suggestion put forward in amendment No. 6 by Deputy Dr. Browne and amendment No. 7 by Deputy Cooney and myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a driver is found to be unfit to drive a train on medical grounds definite provisions should be incorporated in the Bill safeguarding the future livelihood of these men, many of whom are married men with young <Col N="2365" /> families.  The logical suggestion is that alternative employment be provided for these men within the company at the same rate of remuneration as they received as drivers and at the same depot to which they have been attached as drivers.  If a driver based at the Limerick depot is offered alternative employment in Athlone, Cork or elsewhere it could impose the serious domestic hardship of moving to another area or else commute daily to his new place of work.</P>
    <P>Taking everything into account, there is a very strong case in favour of writing into this Bill some basic safeguards in relation to the livelihood of drivers who may be found unfit to drive but who would be medically fit for other employment in the company.  Amendment No. 7 suggests that they should not only be employed at the same rate of remuneration but at not less favourable conditions and at the same depot.</P>
    <P>The drivers are not satisfied with the Bill as it stands at the moment. They feel the suggestion that the company would try to secure alternative employment for them is far too vague. I would urge on the Minister the importance of allaying the fears of the drivers by doing something tangible and practical in this Bill along the lines suggested in amendments Nos. 6 and 7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support these two amendments.  It appears to me that the logic of the situation demands that rather exacting medical standards would have to be set because the basis of setting them at all is one of safety.  There is no point in setting them unless a standard which is going to ensure public safety is reached.  Consequently, as the standard may be rather exacting, it will be exacting in relation to the job of locomotive driver only.  They might be too exacting for many other categories of employment in CIE.  It is important it be written into the Bill that a person who might not meet these exacting standards so as to be able to continue as a locomotive driver would be assured of continued employment with CIE at a rate and at a place <Col N="2366" /> similar to that which he held as a locomotive driver.</P>
      <P>With regard to a remark Deputy O'Donovan made I would not have any apprehension about the attitude of the medical staff of CIE in relation to the locomotive drivers.  I have had experience professionally on both sides of the fence and my experience is that the medical people in CIE have no bias in favour of the company and, in fact, the opposite has been my experience. They have been inclined to lean over backwards in favour of the employees so I would not have any apprehension there.  Nevertheless, the regulations will have to provide exacting standards.</P>
      <P>The Minister lives in the same town as I live in and he will be aware that locomotive drivers represent a very long and honourable railway tradition. There is a considerable <i>esprit de corps</i> among locomotive drivers.  Their contribution to the well-being and morale of CIE is of the utmost importance.  It is very important that this morale be preserved by writing into the Bill safeguards for them.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise the point Deputy O'Donnell made that while one could provide employment of equivalent financial benefit it is equally important, if not more so, that it be provided at the same place.  If a man does not come up to these new medical standards he is almost certain to be a man in his mid-40s with a family in their teens and it would be an exceedingly serious hardship to ask him to move home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again speaking from experience, although my experience does not take in a locomotive driver, but a driver in another capacity who sustained an accident was extremely apprehensive that if he returned to work an excuse would be found to transfer him from driving to another category and eventually he would find himself out of employment altogether.  I know this is a real apprehension and how serious it is is something I cannot express an opinion on.  My experience of dealing with semi-State bodies, who should be inclined to lean over backwards towards employees, is that in matters of dismissing workers who may be slightly disabled, or not quite up to <Col N="2367" /> scratch that they are inclined to be harsher than the private employer.  I know employees are conscious of this and feel it.  If this section is enacted without having the safeguards suggested in these amendments it will be a serious blow to the morale of the workers in CIE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is accepted that locomotive drivers have very important duties to perform and must be exceptionally fit men.  The railways have been with us now for more than 100 years and, fortunately, accidents have been few and far between.  Up to the present time I have not heard of any accident attributable to the unsuitability of a locomotive driver or attributable to his medical condition.  Deputy Dr. Browne said that a locomotive driver is responsible for more than 100 lives when he is driving a train but all of us are responsible for a number of lives on the roads.  As far as I know the demand for this did not come from anybody apart from the Government.</P>
      <P>One would think that when a CIE driver or a driver with any private company because of failing eyesight or something was unfit for his job the thing to do would be to transfer him to alternative employment within the company without loss of remuneration if a suitable job could be found for him.  I am sure that will happen in most cases.  A man may not be fit to drive a train but he will possibly be fit to do other work.  I have read these amendments.  I know we must plan ahead but this type of legislation is not built on experience.  This is leading the way.  When this is passed it can be used as a precedent for subjecting truck drivers, motor drivers, anyone who drives on the public highway to this test.  We are travelling too fast here.  I do not know how it came about that in a Bill dealing with County Donegal Railways these few sections were injected.</P>

      <P>We should be very thankful that in this country we have not had any serious accidents involving <Col N="2368" /> locomotive drivers.  There may have been accidents due to shunting at stations and so on but we have no fears.  The men employed on this work must measure up to a very high standard on their first day when they are examined for personal fitness and suitability. I do not know that it is necessary to have a man called for examination every now and then.  Our locomotive drivers are an intelligent body of men and I am sure that if one of them felt he was not fit for his job he would apply for examination himself. While I accept that it is a very important task, I do not like the idea of the State interfering and saying that you must submit yourself to medical tests of one kind or another.  I am not in favour of the State intervening in the private lives of people.  If locomotive drivers are to be tested, lorry and motor drivers will have to be tested and where does this all lead?</P>
      <P>There is much more urgent legislation to put on the Statute Book than this. I am not taking from its importance and I am not taking from the apprehension that seems to be about the House and in the Department of Transport and Power but I should like to keep this kind of thing at a minimum, this interfering with people and subjecting them to tests.  The same could apply to any driver on the road today.  The locomotive driver may have 100, 80 or 70 lives and the other man possibly would have four or five but the principle is the same.</P>

    <P>I am in sympathy with these amendments but I do not think they are appropriate amendments for legislation. The main concern of the trade unions when they came to me last March was to ensure that there was nothing in this section to prejudice, hinder or impede in any way the trade unions' right to negotiate to the fullest extent possible within their power and resources to achieve the sort of objective embodied here in the amendments. Once they were assured from a reading of the relevant sections and received my assurance to them that there would be no regulation that would prejudice them in any way in this respect they were quite happy.  The trade unions were totally happy and content to rely on their own power and resources of negotiations to achieve what the House by these amendments is seeking to incorporate in the legislation. These negotiations are in progress at the moment between CIE and the trade unions concerned.  The whole matter is just now in the melting pot.  I think it should be left at that level rather than written into legislation.</P>

      <P>The Minister says the trade unions are quite happy.  I want to put on record that I have had the strongest possible representations made to me even within the past week regarding the subject matter of these amendments.  As late as a week ago I received a deputation of the drivers in this House.  They expressed serious concern about the possibility of this Bill getting through the House without some safeguards being written into the Bill in relation to drivers who might fail the test and become unfit to drive.  I want to get this matter clarified and to put on record that individual drivers, a group of drivers, came here to the House to me and I have had correspondence from them, too, from different parts of the country. There appears to be a clash here.  What I am amazed at is, and it seems to be an extraordinary situation, that the Minister met the unions and had prolonged discussions with them and <Col N="2370" /> despite all this no acceptable formula appears to have been hammered out. Is the Minister now saying that the unions representing the drivers are perfectly happy with the Bill as it is and that they are not looking for the safeguards in the amendments tabled by Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy Cooney and myself?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is in a dilemma.  A new provision has been written into this Bill for a not very clear reason, this whole business of the definition of the conditions under which a man will be discharged from his job, removed from his employment as locomotive driver.</P>
      <P>I am not particularly concerned with the beginner who is found to be unfit. If he is unfit, he is unfit.  He is beginning his life and he has not got used to a pattern of life over a number of years.  He can start at something else and he is young enough to be well able to do that.  I am talking about the person who has been working for many years with CIE and who finds himself, through no fault of his own, in the position that it is decided on his behalf by the CMO, with the help of an arbitration board, if you like, that he is not fit to carry on as a locomotive driver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the Minister introduced this provision into the Bill it seems to me that in logic he must now go on and say what happens to this person about whom he has asked us to take a decision by accepting this section.  He is asking us to take a decision which we have a right to take.  We share the Minister's belief that the standards of the company cannot be too high, that they must be kept at a very high level indeed.  Train accidents are happening from time to time all over Europe and when they happen they really make the headlines.  They are very grim and very terrible in their consequences.  Therefore, anything that is designed to reduce the incidence of accidents on the railways must be supported by this House, and has got the support of the <Col N="2371" /> House.  The consequence of the accidents is one reason why we support the Minister in his desire to try to establish certain standards.</P>
    <P>We must pursue the matter to the consequences to the individual driver. The individual driver has trained and has become very highly skilled.  His responsibilities are on a par with those of an airline pilot.  A person of that kind can now find that he is no longer acceptable as a locomotive driver and that we have decided in this House that he must be removed from that post.  This House then has the right and the responsibility to go on and say that in these circumstances this man shall be treated in this way.  When asked why this section was in the Bill, the Minister said that it is a miscellaneous provisions Bill.  It is an umbrella Bill in which strange provisions which would not normally be in a Transport Bill can be included. There is no reason in the world why some provision for the drivers should not be included.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that men now driving trains, and young men who are about to go into training as locomotive drivers, will be disturbed by the realisation that they may be in a job, or may be going into a job in which, added to the anxieties of driving a locomotive, the very tight timetables they have to keep to, the night driving, the knowledge that there are a number of people, men, women and children sitting behind them completely uncaring about what is going on because they know they are safe and they trust the drivers, they are now faced with the prospects of finding that for one reason or another&mdash;quite often because of the demands of the job itself which lead to heart conditions or gastric conditions&mdash;they may be considered to be unfit to continue as locomotive drivers. These conditions arise from the emotional stresses of driving a locomotive.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is the completely-impossible-to-predict deterioration in eyesight which can happen at any time.  Therefore, the drivers must be very concerned, indeed, at the fact that this provision is being included in this Bill and that we have stopped <Col N="2372" /> there and left it there.  The Minister says he can arrive at a decision, presumably based on the merits of each case, in consultation with the trade union movement.  While the drivers have a reasonable degree of faith in the trade union movement, in the responsibility of their leaders, and the likelihood of their defending them or fighting their case as well as they can, the general impression I get is that this House having interfered, if you like&mdash;perfectly legitimately; we have a perfect right to do so&mdash;and having laid down a law in this House for the chief medical officer&mdash;must now make it possible for men to become locomotive drivers knowing that if the accident which nobody can predict of ill health or prematurely failing eyesight happens to them, they will be protected by the company and that this is incorporated in law.  Just as we have incorporated subsection (2) which directs the chief medical officer as to what he is to do with the driver in certain circumstances, we should include a subsection telling the company what they should do with the driver if the chief medical officer decides that he should be removed from his post.  The Minister should reconsider this in the interests of the peace of mind of these men who are doing a very demanding job and who, when this Bill becomes law, will simply know one thing, that is, that if they are found to be medically unfit they will lose their jobs, without knowing what else we wanted to happen to them after they had lost their jobs.</P>
    <P>I suspect that this is the kind of provision which will lead to men becoming so apprehensive, so anxious, so concerned and worried about symptoms, or signs, or physical conditions, that they will tend to conceal them rather than admit to them lest they find themselves deprived of their jobs because the medical officer decides their condition is such that it would render them dangerous as locomotive drivers. Therefore, they will not come forward for medical tests to see whether they are well enough to carry on in their jobs, which is all very well in theory but is asking rather a lot of a man <Col N="2373" /> with four, five or six children who has no other training.  If he knows that if he is found to be medically unfit he will be offered an alternative job at the same rate of remuneration, or if the medical officer decides that he is so badly disabled that he cannot be kept on in the company he will be compensated in a reasonably generous way, he will be more inclined to come forward for a medical test.  The Minister should make some such provision in this Bill. There is no reason in the world why that should not be done in this miscellaneous provisions Bill.  We should show that we in this House are not concerned for the safety of the public only and that we are not prepared to sacrifice a man's peace of mind or to sacrifice his livelihood and then do nothing about it.  The Minister has indicated that it is the wish of everybody here to protect the interests of those who may be displaced in their employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's case for not accepting this amendment is made on the ground that what is sought by the amendment can be obtained equally effectively by the trade unions. He mentions that the trade unions have muscle enough to obtain what they believe their members should have. There is no doubt about that but very often the exercise of that muscle can lead to serious industrial conflict.  I imagine that the position up to now with regard to the fitness of a locomotive driver to continue his work is a matter for negotiation between the union and the driver, between the driver and the board and, perhaps, between the union and the board on behalf of the driver, and that something must have been found lacking in that arrangement which caused the board to request statutory authority for these medical tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If statutory authority for medical tests is brought into operation, it is only fair and proper that on the other side of the coin there should be statutory authority to safeguard the people subjected to these tests.  It is not enough to say that the trade unions will look after these men because, as I have already said, there is within that situation seeds of industrial conflict. Particularly in regard to a semi-State <Col N="2374" /> body which so oftern sets the pattern, anything which contains such seed should be discouraged.  It would be preferable that a clear and unequivocal position should result from legislation.  This would also be very important towards ensuring that the morale of the men involved would be left undamaged as a result of this legislation. I would go so far as to say that CIE could be described as sick.  One of the reasons why they are sick and one of the results of their being sick is the rather poor morale that exists among many grades of workers.  It would be a pity if the locomotive drivers should be affected in the same way but that is very likely to happen unless this amendment is accepted and a driver who might be affected should be guaranteed the same financial position.</P>
    <P>It would be unrealistic to leave this entirely between the unions and the board.  One could imagine a situation where a driver might be found, medically, to be inadequate.  The union would then make representations on his behalf so that he would be given some other job, at the same wage, in the same depot.  However, for a wide number of reasons this might not suit CIE.  There might not be a vacancy or this might entail transferring somebody else.  It could lead to a precedent that CIE would wish to avoid.  In certain cases they could possibly say to the union: &ldquo;We cannot go that far with this man.  We believe that his present state of health was contributed to by his own negligence.&rdquo; I do not intend specifying what that should be. Deputy Browne has mentioned that that particular job is one of a very high stress factor.  Some people, when burdened with such a job, take refuge in undesirable means of alleviating that stress and this could affect a man's health.  If for some such reason, a driver damaged his health and this was used against him in argument with the union as a reason why the board would not give him equivalent employment, there could arise a very difficult and unfair situation.  Therefore, the two principal reasons I have mentioned why the Minister should accept the amendment are, first, the danger of industrial conflict and, secondly, the danger to the morale of <Col N="2375" /> these men who are very important to CIE.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 11, to add to the section a new subsection as follows: &mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the case of a driver found to be unfit to drive or unfit for any other duty for medical reasons, or where no suitable alternative employment is available in the company compensation shall be paid by the Board in accordance with the provisions of the 4th Schedule to the Transport Act, 1950&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Among the questions I have been asked by various drivers was a very logical one: what would happen if they should fail the medical test and if the company could not provide suitable alternative employment for them. If, on the other hand, the result of a medical test indicates that not only is a man unfit to drive but he is also unfit for any other employment within the company, what happens?  Such person may have given 20 or 30 years driving service to the company.  From discussions I have had and from reading the Transport Acts, it appears to me that a means of meeting this type of situation would be by compensation. There may be a better way but that is the way I would suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In such cases the amount of compensation might be determined in accordance with the lines of the Fourth Schedule to the Transport Act of 1950. <Col N="2376" /> Under that Act a person would receive approximately two-thirds of his wages. I would ask the Minister to consider this.  I am informed that the number of drivers who, during the past decade, have fallen into ill-health has been relatively small.  Therefore, I do not think that the acceptance of this amendment would impose any great financial burden on CIE.  In the unlikely event of a driver failing the medical test and being found unfit also for any other employment, safeguards should be provided for him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy O'Donnell's amendment and to support in particular the point he made that cases of this type must happen only relatively rarely.  Another point that has always struck me in this House is that on any occasion when there has been amalgamation of different authorities&mdash;health authorities or hospital authorities or any others&mdash; there was unanimity here in so far as we would not wish anyone to suffer as a result of any legislation that we should enact for the purpose of making an organisation more efficient or increasing safety standards.  This principle is, in fact, included in this Bill. There are clearly defined compensatory terms laid down for shareholders and others.  We could regard these people in much the same light&mdash;people who would require compensation either by way of another job or in money terms&mdash;and they should be treated sympathetically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion that this Estimate was before the House I had covered most of the items that I had in mind but one cannot conclude without referring to the last part of the Minister's statement dealing with road safety propaganda and education. While I appreciate that attention has been called by the Department and all other authorities to the necessity for road safety, I am amazed that the number of fatal road accidents seems to increase steadily.  The year 1970 brought us to the staggering figure of 532 dead and 70,000 injured.  That number of fatal accidents would represent three deaths every two days.  As one who drives thousands of miles annually and who has a reasonably good knowledge of the roads, I think that should not be happening.  We have a relatively small population of less than three million and except in the <Col N="2378" /> major centres the roads are not too congested.  There is evidence of carelessness on the part of many drivers.</P>
      <P>What steps are to be taken?  The Minister has set down a number of subheads in his statement.  He has appointed road safety officers and junior school wardens.  He has provided charts, leaflets and warnings.  He has devoted a paragraph to the wearing of arm bands.</P>
      <P>Despite all the warnings and all the statements made by the Department of Local Government and the local authorities, more definite action must be taken.  As one who possibly drives as much as anyone in this country, seeing that the propaganda used has not brought about the desired result of reducing the number of fatal road accidents and making the roads safer for the travelling public, I have no hesitation in saying that there is need to increase the punishment in some cases for driving offences.  Every man who takes a vehicle on the public highway has a duty not only to himself and his family but to the general public and must realise that he has the right only to use the road and that his driving must be such that other users of the road can drive safely so far as he is concerned.  The Minister has some work to do there.  He must do some rethinking on this problem.  Since his appointment as Minister for Local Government he has made a number of statements but what has been the outcome? The fatal accident chart is steadily moving upwards.</P>

      <P>Last year the number of fatal road accidents was 532, a marked increase on the previous year. I am glad to learn that there has been a reduction.  If that is the position it shows an improvement for this year. The Minister is confining his statement to one month.  What is the position for the year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the 532 people killed many were bread-winners and we must consider the consequences to their families.  We must continue our efforts to bring about a reduction in this figure.  There are thousands of people involved in road accidents.  As a result of such accidents many are absent from work for months or even years, and some may be incapacitated for life.  Let us consider the imposition on our hospitals who provide care for people injured in road accidents.  I am glad to see that the Minister is fully aware of the problem and I welcome the measures set out in the latter part of his statement.  As Minister for Local Government, he is entitled to the co-operation of all in his effort to reduce the numbers killed and injured on our roads.</P>
      <P>The provision of swimming pools is desirable but I consider that preferential treatment should be given to inland towns and villages rather than to seaside resorts.  People who live near the sea have nothing to complain about but in some such areas there is agitation for swimming pools.  I think all will agree it is only fair that the inland towns and villages should get preferential treatment when the provision of swimming pools is being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that parking regulations are a source of contention.  I know the problem that exists in Dublin, Cork and the larger towns but the problem exists also in every town in Ireland. Some people maintain, with some justification, that it is a good sign to have to cope with such a problem.  I realise that parking regulations are necessary but I should like to impress on the authorities here that such regulations should be drawn up in co-operation with the local residents.  This should be done in a friendly way and the viewpoints of the people concerned should be considered.  This has been done in most cases but my reason for referring to the matter is that in a certain street in Skibbereen there is some trouble regarding this matter.  I had hoped that during the past year or two a suitable arrangement would be worked out.  There should not be friction between the authorities and the local traders.  So far as possible the <Col N="2380" /> traders should be facilitated and in every case where regulations are being considered the views of the local people should be sought.</P>
    <P>The problem of water pollution has been dealt with at some length in the Minister's statement.  Some of our beaches are not as clean as they might be and this is harmful to our tourist trade.  It is regrettable that such pollution is more frequent now than in previous years and we should take some steps to deal with the matter.  We should be watchful and ensure that pollution is dealt with quickly.  We are fortunate in south west Cork that there is very little of this kind of pollution but I have had representations from some districts about this matter.  I am sure the Department of Local Government will co-operate with the local authority in dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>I have been travelling regularly to Dublin for more than 20 years and I have wondered frequently at the patience of Dublin people with regard to the way the problem of pollution is being tackled in this city.  I know if the people in west Cork suffered to the same extent as do the people in Dublin we would hear much more about it. Recently I read a great deal about the rivers Dodder and Tolka but the river I know best in Dublin is the Liffey. Speaking as a non-resident of Dublin I think it is strange that nothing has been done to deal with the pollution of this river.  It is peculiar that this situation should obtain in our capital city.  I would support without hesitation the provision of funds for the purpose of eliminating this altogether.  I am satisfied that the demands made from many quarters are well justified. Over the years I have had great sympathy with the people.  There is a sufficiency of Deputies in Dublin to make representations here and this is the first time I have raised this matter, not because of an insufficiency of representation but in order to bring home to the authorities the desirability of spending money on this kind of work, work designed to reduce harassment on those living in adjacent areas.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister knows what I have in mind.  I am referring to the replacement of the bridge in Kinsale.  We have had repeated meetings and we are very pleased now that everything is in order. Plans, specifications and all the incidentals have been dealt with.  Everything is in order except the cheque.  I know there are many demands on the Minister, but Kinsale is one of the oldest towns in the country.  The bridge is an exceptionally dangerous structure and the people in Kinsale and those who visit Kinsale would be very grateful if the Minister could see his way to making the moneys necessary for the replacement of the bridge available without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken up perhaps more than my fair share of the time.  I do not like using more time than is absolutely necessary, but I feel strongly about the matters I have raised.  In the reorganisation and restructuring of the local government system I hope there will be no great urgency in formulating policy and drafting a Bill.  A White Paper has been issued presumably so that people may study it and make suggestions.  I hope any suggestions made will receive a sympathetic hearing. <Col N="2382" /> I take it there are no pre-determined, unchangeable policies.</P>
    <P>All we ask in south-west Cork is our fair share of the loaf.  The general feeling is that we are not getting that.  That feeling is not confined to Labour and Fine Gael; it is shared by the Minister's own party members as well.  We have been frustrated in schemes for housing, water, sanitary services, <i>et cetera</i>.  We would like more co-operation from the Department.  We would like the excessive red tape in the Custom House and down at O'Connell Bridge cut.  It is more of a hindrance than a help.  I understand the Minister has accepted the idea of giving more autonomy to local bodies.</P>
    <P>I have been critical of the Minister and his Department, but these matters must be viewed objectively.  I am well aware that the Minister is a relatively young man and not too long in the job; I know it takes time to acquire knowledge and experience in any job, not to mind the job the Minister has in the Department of Local Government.  I know that the Parliamentary Secretary is a very understanding public representative. Both of us came into the House at the same time.  He is most suitable for the job he has.  I believe he is as good as any on the benches over there and he is an ideal second-in-command to the Minister.  I wish the Minister well.  This country is small enough and we have had differences enough for too long.  No matter who occupies this position he must bear with criticisms and protests made in this House and in public bodies where people have the right to make protests. I do not accept street protests to any great extent.  I believe the Minister has an obligation to listen to and deal with protests and criticisms as fairly as possible.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the current year and for whatever time the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary are in office, their work will be fruitful and that we shall have more co-operation from them than we have had in the past from their colleagues in Cork County Council and its public administration departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like every other <Col N="2383" /> Deputy I believe it is only right and proper that we should all have our say in local government.  Although the previous speaker is a Deputy from my own constituency we may see things through different glasses and have different views.  Local government is a very big undertaking now.  When I was first elected to the council many years ago the number of officials in our own department in Cork County Council was very small.  It has grown a good deal since.  In the time of the last four or five county managers we occupied three rooms in the courthouse in Cork. The furniture and equipment was not very elaborate but the quality of the men there was very high.  We built a very elaborate county hall, one of the largest in the country, I suppose, which when first built would, we thought, house all our officials in the foreseeable future but which is already bursting at the seams after a few years.  Like the Custom House which had to branch out to O'Connell Bridge House and other parts of this city we shall soon have to seek more accommodation.  But while we have men and houses the work being done is not increasing.  We were very foolish, I think, to build that county hall because the power and control over the work down in Cork is held in the Custom House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the youthful Minister opposite luck in his authority and in the work he is doing.  He has more power now than Hitler had in Germany.  He has complete control of everything, as I hope to explain to the House.  In the first place, we cannot build a scheme of houses without first getting his sanction. We have engineers and inspectors and qualified tradesmen to build houses; we have a very big number of engineers, highly qualified, who should be able not only to run Cork county but run the Department itself.  Yet, this is no good; a letter must go to the Custom House and in some cases there is no room to write the addresses because they have gone up and down so often seeking sanction for this or for that.  What is happening?  I know cases where applicants are waiting four or five years for sanction for the building of a scheme of cottages.  Outside Clonakilty people have been waiting for <Col N="2384" /> county council cottages for four or five years.  When we first submitted the scheme the contract price was too high and we were advised to re-advertise and get tenders at prices acceptable to the Department.  The scheme has gone up and down so often that these houses could have been built £500 cheaper five years ago than they could be built now.  These are the things that matter.</P>
    <P>There is a small farmer living outside Clonakilty, a man who fought at Kilmichael and Crossbarry, who could not afford to build a house himself.  We agreed to build it for him but he has now been waiting at least seven years. One part of his house fell down and he is now living under a few sheets of corrugated iron.  Although we hear of patriotism, of republican parties and so on, here is a man who stood by his country in the hour of need living under corrugated iron outside Clonakilty. This is the tragic thing, as has often been said.  Every member of every party on the western committee of Cork County Council has referred to this case.  We have done our best to get this man, with others, housed but he is still there after five or six years. Although we had tenders to build the house they were not accepted by the Department and we are now as far away as ever from housing that man, and others also.</P>
    <P>The Minister or his predecessor introduced a scheme whereby higher grants were made available to persons who should be housed by the council but who were so long waiting that they built for themselves.  I asked a question recently in the House and the Minister admitted that it is he who must decide who will get the higher housing grants.  He asked me to give him a few names and I gave him three or four or five but I never heard about them since.  One of the applicants did get a reply but the Minister or his officials did not think it worthwhile to let the representative from the area know what was happening to these people, whether they were getting houses or not.  This is treating Deputies with disdain and it is disgraceful that the Minister or his officials should not inform elected representatives whether a man is to get a higher grant for his <Col N="2385" /> house or not.  The letter he received was as follows:</P>
    <P>A Chara,</P>
    <P>With reference to your application for an increased rate of new house grant please note that at present you do not qualify for this grant but when you are married and in occupation of the house you should notify the Department when your case for a higher rate of grant will be further considered.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Mise, le meas.</P>
    <P>For the information of the Minister and the officers of his Department that man and his mother have been living in the house for the past 12 months. He was a young man very badly housed who built this house for himself. I do not know whether the others received any answer or not, but there is not even a reference number on the letter this young man got which he could quote if he rang up the Department. I cannot make out the name of the person who signed the letter.</P>

      <P>I mentioned these three cases in order to prove the Minister's power is so great that even to get the higher grant for a small cottage in West Cork the Minister himself must give the authority.  In the case of planning authority if the Minister decides that the county council were <Col N="2386" /> wrong in refusing planning permission to an applicant he can grant an applicant planning permission.  The Minister's sanction must even be got for sanitary services.  The Minister must have his hands full looking up all these files on all these subjects.  Surely the Minister cannot do them all himself. If he does he must work very hard.</P>
      <P>Cork is a very big county and many people are paying £1,000 for sites which were not worth a bob ten years ago.  Many people who have survived on very small incomes are getting a good sum of money for their land now but the planning restrictions are very strict.  I agree we must have planning and probably we should have started to make plans earlier than we did but when we eventually made plans we were too rigid.  I know of many houses in the West Cork area which are locked up because the people have gone away.  Many of these people will never return and the houses will remain derelict.  With a coastline of hundreds of miles I would prefer to see a nice house, with somebody living in it and paying rates and in West Cork we certainly want a bigger population. People who have lived on small means are able to sell the land which was useless a few years ago for a good price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there have been improvements in the plant and machinery for widening and improving roads, work on our roads is going very slowly.  The road running from Cork city to Castletownbere is, I suppose, one of the busiest tourist roads in the country but the road from Cork city to Innishannon, a distance of 12 or 13 miles, is one of the worst primary roads in the country.  When the West Cork railway lines were pulled up, I do not know who bought them or where they went.  I asked a question the other day and I was told it was a State-sponsored body.  State-sponsored bodies can do what they like.  They do not have to answer to anybody.  The miles upon miles of steel rails, equipment, <i>et cetera,</i> must have fetched a considerable sum but very little of the money went towards improving roads in the county.  Traffic on the roads increases day by day and year by year. <Col N="2387" /> If the people who made the order to sell the West Cork railway could take that order back today they would do so because at that time we thought CIE would be paying its way by now and that they would be well able to take care of the remaining traffic but we find that we are paying just as much to them now as we were paying before they took away our railways.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and to his Parliamentary Secretary to grant us a primary road out of Cork city for the 100 miles that faces west.  Even if it went as far as Bandon for the first year we would be satisfied.  Surely something must be done about it.  I am sure the Minister's officials could tell him that the patching that is going on there is not suitable.  A good deal of money will have to be spent on it to make it even a second class primary road.  When Deputy Blaney was Minister for Local Government we had him down to open a bridge at Skibbereen. He promised at that time to give us a primary road.  However, he is gone from the office.  If he was there now we would have a better chance because he would live up to his promise and give us that road.</P>
    <P>I see he opened a road recently in your own constituency, a Cheann Comhairle.  It was described as a very high class road serving the highlands of West Donegal.  More power to them; more luck to them; they deserve it all. They are keeping in touch with the seat of power.  The Ceann Comhairle is laughing.  He is benefiting, too, because when he goes home he has a fine road on which to travel.  Think of the poor men in West Cork who fought for freedom and made it possible for you all to come up here and enjoy it.  Think of the people who are living under sheets of corrugated iron.</P>
    <P>This year for the first time we are getting an increase in our rural improvements scheme grant.  How it came about I do not know.  However, the Government, in spite of the scarcity of money, agreed to give us an additional £19,000.  So well they might.  Last year we had 500 applications for rural improvements schemes and the amount <Col N="2388" /> of money we had would not provide for one-twentieth of that number.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary but he should also take into consideration the fact that £27,000 last year would do nearly as much as the £19,000 and the £27,000 this year having regard to the increase in the cost of materials and everything. The increase would be a lot more if we were in County Sligo, in County Galway or in County Donegal.  The Parliamentary Secretary must have the figure for what they are getting in Donegal.  It has increased considerably and not by £19,000 but by nearly £100,000.  The same applies to Sligo and Galway.  Of course, the Minister is from Galway and why should he not throw a little bit out to the boys in Galway and get them roads out to Connemara, Moycullen and other places?  Of course, the money of Ireland has gone into Salthill already. However, they got a good bit extra this year.  Now think of West Cork.  Maybe there is still something in the kitty and it is not too late to rectify the position. Maybe the Minister would send us down another instalment so that we could do 40 or 50 more.</P>

      <P>They would not survive down there.  Our grant from the Road Fund was cut this year by £68,500.  Imagine that when there is an <Col N="2389" /> increase of nearly £1 million from road tax and from petrol.  Our manager has stated that it will mean 40 to 50 of our road workers out of employment.  I suppose we got the biggest cut in our road grant of any county in Ireland. Even if we got the £68,000 extra we still could not do the work we have been doing over the years because of the increased price of materials and services of all kinds.  It will also mean a big reduction in the mileage of the roads to be improved.  Our engineers were sure we would get it.  Our county manager stated when we were asked to vote an increase on the estimates for the county: &ldquo;I am sure I can tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that we will get at least the same grant.  They cannot reduce it.&rdquo;  The Department reduced our grant by that sum.  Surely they will not be responsible for throwing 30 or 40 of our staff out of work after we voted the extra money and taxed the already over-taxed ratepayers in the county.  Surely they will not reduce our road grant by that much money.</P>
      <P>Water schemes are very important especially in tourist areas.  They are vitally important to us in West Cork. We have the scenery and we have the beaches.  People are anxious to come there.  Every year they are coming in increasing numbers.  We have been pressing for a water scheme in one of the finest tourist resorts in the country, Inchidoney.  At last we succeeded in getting one, but we still cannot supply the extra amount of water needed there. The pipes are laid but the scheme dragged on because of lack of finance, and probably because of the cement strike last year.</P>

      <P>It is so long ago that I hardly remember it.  That is the only money that has been spent on our tourist resorts.  We never got an amenity grant.  We never got what has been handed out in thousands to other parts of the country.  I am now drawing this to the attention of the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary and the officials of the Department.  It is about time they thought of us.</P>
      <P>The same thing applies to sewerage schemes.  We have a big concentration of new housing and caravan sites and we badly need sewerage schemes.  They should be given the first priority.  If the tourists find that water and sewerage schemes are not available in these resorts they are not anxious to come there again</P>
      <P>There is another matter which is causing a lot of hardship and a lot of expense to the ratepayers of Cork county, that is, oil pollution.  This year we had to make three or four attempts to clean the beaches before the tourist season started.  Miles upon miles of beaches were covered with the residue of oil.  The county council workers had to be sent out to clean these beaches. The House knows how big a job it is to clean a beach a mile long and to get the skin of oil off it and bury it.  It cost the council a lot of money.  We applied to the Department for extra money to deal with this menace, and menace I call it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2391" /> We have an oil refinery in the area but I would not say it is entirely responsible for this pollution.  Many people who have studied this matter say that before the big tankers come in to take a load, or when they are cleaning out their holds, they dump not only their crude oil but also their waste oil.  Some effort must be made at a national or international level to ensure that this pollution does not occur year after year.  Not only is it harmful to our beaches but it is also very detrimental to offshore fishing.  We are told that many miles out this pollution is lying on top of the ocean and some of it is drifting in to our coast.  Something must be done about this.  We have got to try to get the money to clean up our beaches.</P>
    <P>I come now to the very important subject of rates.  The Department seem to have an idea that we can keep on increasing the rates year after year. How long can this go on?  For the past three or four years the rates in Cork county have gone up by over £1 per annum.  Three or four years ago our rates were somewhere in the region of £3 and now they are nearer to £6, and in some cases over it.  The people in our towns and villages cannot afford to pay these rates.  When will these increases stop?  They must stop somewhere.  They cannot continue year after year.  The ratepayers can no longer foot the bill.  This question must be dealt with in the near future.  We do not like to see a cutback in any of the public services but the people cannot afford to pay increased rates year after year.</P>
    <P>As well as the rates being increased we have hordes of valuation officers scouring the country day and night to increase valuations.  The Department are pulling in the rates with one hand and doubling valuations with the other.  The position was so bad that last year members of Cork County Council asked some officials of the Valuation Office to come down to Cork County and explain to members of the council, and to the general public through the Press, what the reasons were for the increases in valuations. That was the first time we got a <Col N="2392" /> straight answer.  It was that a house valued at £5 for rateable valuation 20 years ago was valued then at its letting value but that the same house today would be worth twice that amount.  I accept that answer.  However, the valuations are increasing year by year. Officials are going through the country day and night taking with them measuring tapes, and in winter flashlamps, so as to ensure that there will be plenty of revenue from the rates next year.</P>
    <P>At this point I should mention the officials of the Department and the officials of county councils.  In Cork, we have an excellent body of men who are doing a very good job.  However, I have the idea that we are employing many more than we really need; that the number employed is out of proportion entirely to the amount of work being done.  I do not know if the position is the same in the Custom House but I see many new faces there year after year and I hear many different voices on the telephone from time to time.  I do not know whether it is a question merely of older members being replaced on retirement but it appears that the numbers there have increased considerably and, as is the case with county councils, I cannot say that the work is increasing in proportion to the increase in the number of officials.</P>
    <P>For one thing, there is too much duplication.  Our local authority engineers are as competent as any engineers to be found elsewhere but when they design a road or draw up plans for the improvement of a road, other engineers are sent from the Department and much time is lost before they finally decide to sanction the scheme. Surely when we are already paying men who are capable of doing the work, there is no necessity to send others from the Department to inspect the inspectors down there.  If the work was left to our own engineers it would be done in less time and, perhaps, it would be done better.  I am not saying anything against the Local Government engineers but it should not be necessary to have two or three groups of them following each other around the country.  This country cannot <Col N="2393" /> afford that and it is about time we realised it.  The money spent in this way would be better utilised in the improvement of roads.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I shall deal with the White Paper issued during the spare time of the Department this year to every county council.  I suppose it is irrelevant that this White Paper bore a green cover but it was described as something which would open a new era for local government.  At the first meeting of the county council held after this document had been received, I said that this was local government by remote control.  I suppose whether or not county councils accept this the Department will say to them that they can take it or leave it.  I can assure the Minister and all concerned with that document that it is the vaguest document that has ever come from any Government Department.  There is nothing in its 20 or 30 pages.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me.  It was sent to the county councils asking for their opinions but why were they not consulted before it was printed so that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is suggested that there are to be no urban councillors or town commissioners in the future.  That is only the beginning.  It would not surprise me if the next local government elections proved to be the last to be held in this country if Fianna Fáil are in power. However, I expect that they will be out of office before then.</P>

No matter which party are in power, the rates cannot continue to escalate as at present.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister and his officials will have special regard at least for County Cork, that they will increase the special employment grant and give a few extra pounds to the people who have been waiting for this for a number of years.  This has been done for such counties as Donegal, Galway and some other favoured counties.  Give Cork its rightful share and make the road from Cork to Bandon an arterial road, as it is called now, a primary road, and get to work on it as quickly as possible.  The Minister knows the volume of traffic on that road.  West Cork is one of the biggest beet producing areas and in the winter time hundreds of lorries travel this road laden with beet.  The sides of the road have gone down.  Portions of the road have been widened and improved but, generally, the whole road must be reconstructed and redesigned.  I will be awaiting the results of my speech here and I will be ready to meet the Minister and his officials if they come to the area and I will be grateful for any improvements they carry out in the coming year.</P>

      <P>The Department of Local Government has many ramifications.  It is a Department that has concerned itself with a great many matters and we in the Labour Party have been advocating that there should be a special Minister assigned to deal with the vital matter of housing.  Although there were vague promises from the Taoiseach in this regard, they did not amount to anything.</P>
      <P>My main concern now is the question of local authority rents.  This is a burning question with tenants.  When I moved a resolution on behalf of the Labour Party here some time ago urging the Minister to have an independent investigation into the question of differential rents and the anomalies that arise, he rejected it out of hand because of the fact, as he said, that the people were not dissatisfied.  He had the audacity to say that the people were fully satisfied with the differential rent system at present in operation.  The Minister will have a rude awakening because from what I hear, and I am hearing it regularly, the people are most dissatisfied and I would not be performing my duty here if I did not outline how the system is victimising persons who have been in occupation of local authority houses for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I refer to local authority houses, in my area we talk about them as Dublin Corporation houses.  We are told that the houses provided by Dublin Corporation are cheap houses intended for persons who cannot afford to purchase houses.  This was the whole basis of local authority housing.  It was to provide houses at economic rents.  I mentioned the anomalies that exist and the Minister refused to listen.  I shall mention them again in the hope that the Minister may see reason.  There are persons who have been on fixed rents for many years.  They have been in occupation of these houses for, perhaps, over 30 years.  Their families have grown up in these houses.  As the <Col N="2396" /> parents grew old the children were paying the rent.  The rents of these houses have been paid for years by their children who have been growing up.  In some cases the parents have died and, naturally, the children have sought the tenancy of the houses.  They fear that if they did not seek the tenancy they might be evicted.  Knowing Dublin Corporation as I do I can say that is likely to happen at any time.  They seek permission to have the tenancy of the houses in their names.  Dublin Corporation apply special sanctions in cases like this.  They put these people on a high new rent, a new differential rent.</P>

Some of these people work so many hours.  There is one case where a poor girl was ill for 115 hours in a year. She is told by Dublin Corporation that she must submit medical certificates for a day out in order that she can have her rent adjusted for that week.

      <P>And I am telling you some of the facts about it.  Let us get back to where we started.  When you talk about a tenancy you do not necessarily envisage the parent as being the tenant.  The tenant is the family.  That is what is forgotten.  The tenant is the complete family.  It is not just the parent who is the tenant, it is the family, a fact that is often forgotten.  All the names of the family are entered on the tenancy list.  A former Minister tried to alter the situation when he <Col N="2399" /> imposed a penalty of 7s 6d on people because he said they were subtenants in these houses.  This was an unjust penalty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see that the Minister is present now.  I want him to hear some of the things I have to say.  When I spoke on behalf of the Labour Party on the motion in connection with housing I asked the Minister to consider the setting up of an independent body to investigate the injustices and anomalies that exist in regard to the differential renting system as operated by Dublin Corporation and other local authorities.  People are agreed about the injustices and if the Minister does not do something about the matter he will be inundated with letters from people who are the victims of the system.  The idea was good but the way the system has been manipulated by the Government imposes a dreadful penalty on people.</P>
      <P>The tenant of a house is not just the parent of the family; in many cases members of the family have contributed for many years to the payment of the rent and they have a certain right of succession to the tenancy on the same terms as applied to their parents. This is particularly applicable in regard to houses of the older type, many of which have been occupied by the same families for more than 30 years.  It is difficult for these people to realise that they must pay a high rent and I am repeating this point as the Minister is present in the House now. Incidentally, the houses have the basic fundamental amenities&mdash;nothing more.</P>
      <P>The Minister should alter the differential system to ensure that when the immediate family, the son or daughter, succeeds to the tenancy, he or she should be permitted to have it at the same rent as applied in the case of parents. That slight adjustment to the differential renting system would give satisfaction to a considerable number of tenants and occupiers of corporation houses.  This is their biggest grievance at the moment and it would help matters if the Minister would consider adjusting the differential renting system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2401" /> Time and again the Minister has said that the present system is equitable, fair and just.  I have here a rent receipt belonging to a disabled man of 70 years.  He is awaiting the old age pension and the total weekly income of his wife and himself is £7.35.  Out of that amount the couple must pay £1.39 rent, plus a 13p rates increase.  I brought up a similar case some time ago in the Dáil and Deputy Dowling said it was impossible.  The case I have just mentioned sets out the facts&mdash;out of an income of £7.35 they are paying £1.52 for rent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the facts were as stated on that occasion then the Deputy should advise the individual now concerned to opt for the 70 scale with the hardship clause and the rent could be reduced as low as 7s 6d a week.  The Deputy is now doing a very underhand thing in introducing a similar case in which, if the person has the right to opt for the 70 scale, and does so, he can improve his position by having his rent related to his income.  Did the Deputy advise him of that?</P>

      <P>I shall just mention another anomaly in the system.  I believe people in corporation houses have a right to transfer or intertransfer for many reasons.  There may be incompatibility with the neighbours, differences of opinion; they may have to move closer to parents who are ill or disabled to nurse them.  Their children may be attending schools too far away. They must have this right.  It is inherent in the system.  A further injustice arises here because if they intertransfer with another tenant both are victimised and both are put on a new rent scale.  I see no justification for this.  Unless the transfer is approved by the city medical officer on medical grounds decided by him they will go on new rent scales.  This is unjust.  If you deny a right to which they are entitled and victimise them because they want to transfer or intertransfer, that is unjust.  It is morally wrong and another anomaly in the system.  Now, if the Minister wishes to interrupt and tell me I am a liar or that I am wrong I should like to hear him.  They are very quiet now that I have given the facts.</P>

      <P>Obviously the rent relates to the income of the tenant and it must also relate to the standard of accommodation.  If a tenant wishes to transfer to a house which is on a different scale then he must agree to pay the rent on the scale operating for that house.  The transfer is a matter solely for his own discretion.  It is a personal choice of the tenant and nobody forces him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he should be told about it.  The present differential system is unjust and includes many anomalies.  If I want to prove that it is not operating properly this is the only way I can do it and bring it to the Minister's attention.  We may get the Minister to see reason and have an independent investigation into it.  The system is wrong when it assesses the rent on the gross income of the tenant. If a person is assessed on a £25 income when he has already paid a portion of that in tax, the system is wrong.  It is what comes home in the pay packet that counts.  It is morally wrong to assess somebody on income he does not bring home.  This is double taxation and it is wrong.  It is another example of injustice in this system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody is paying income tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Not double tax. These people are also subject to deductions for social insurance and other things.  To assess the rent on the gross income is morally wrong and could be challenged.  These are anomalies in the differential rents system which the Minister says is so fair, with which nobody is dissatisfied.  He had the audacity to say that in this House.  If we are to get any semblance of satisfaction among tenants of local authority houses who have not got all the amenities we would wish because they are deprived of certain rights by being tenants of Dublin Corporation under the differential rents system, these injustices must be eliminated. Corporation tenants do not enjoy the freedom they would have under an <Col N="2409" /> ordinary landlord.  I cannot understand the Minister's statement to the effect that the houses need so much subsidising.  As I worked it out on the Minister's estimate these houses must be costing £10 a week with the subsidies given by the State.  It is inconceivable that these houses and flats should cost so much in rent.  There must be something wrong with the system.  I could not get a satisfactory answer from the Minister or his predecessor when I asked about the cost of the flats in Ballymun or the high rise flats in St. Michael's estate.  I could not get a figure for individual flats but it would seem to me, judging by other flats, that the cost of these flats must be about £6,000 or £7,000 each.  It seems wrong that they should cost so much and that so much of a subsidy should be required from the State.  There is something radically wrong with the system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>My decision to take up the time of the House to raise the subject matter of Question No. 32 on last Thursday's Order Paper was not taken lightly.  During my membership of this House I have only raised questions on the Adjournment on very few occasions but I feel compelled to raise this question here tonight.</P>
      <P>In the course of our work as public representatives we have many pleasant duties to perform and at times some rather unpleasant ones.  We would all like to avoid the unpleasant ones if we could possibly do so, particularly such a matter as I am now raising here.  I have brought here on the Adjournment the Minister for Education and the Secretary of the Department for both of whom I have the highest respect.  Indeed, it did not strike me that the occasion for levelling the charge which I am going to level against the Minister tonight would ever arise.  My charge is that it seems to me beyond reasonable doubt that the Department's activities so far as the administration of the higher education grants in the year 1969-70 are, to put it mildly, shady.  It also seems to me that the only possible answer to the assertions I shall make here in the course of my contribution is that the Department is guilty of gross incompetence and stupidity.</P>
      <P>While Question No. 32 relates to the recommendations from the Cork County Council, the position does not relate to Cork county alone.  It is a national question.  In the Higher Education Act, 1968, grants were provided for pupils who attained a certain standard in the leaving certificate examination provided other conditions were fulfilled.  In the first year 1969-70 one of the conditions was that applications should be tendered to the respective local authorities not later than the 31st May of that year.  Subsequently, it was decided by local authorities on a national scale and by the Department, that this date should be set at 31st August each year, which would be the final date for the receipt of applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with other local authorities Cork County Council was quite <Col N="2411" /> satisfied that this regulation, so far as applications were concerned, was fair, reasonable and just.  In common with other local authorities it advertised extensively the availability of the grants and the conditions attached to them with particular reference to the fact that the latest date for the receipt of applications was 31st August, 1970. If candidates did not have sufficient interest to aply before that date it was their own look-out.  They could not make a claim for a scholarship subsequent to the final date set down for the receipt of applications and I think that was generally acceptable to everybody.</P>
    <P>It transpired that a number of applicants in County Cork and throughout the country, who possibly did not intend to pursue a university course and did not make application within the prescribed period, were subsequently anxious to make applications and this is where my statement comes in.  Subsequent to the 31st August, 1970 an indefinite number, at least I cannot determine the number throughout the country, particularly in the first week in September, inquired from councils, public representatives, possibly the Department and from any other sources they thought could provide the information, whether they could now apply for these higher education grants.</P>
    <P>At this time a higher education grant is a grant worth £300 per year spread over a period of at least five years, which equals £1,500 in all, which is a sum not to be sneered at. Cork County Council in common with other councils on the 9th September, 1970, were surprised to get a communication from the Department informing them that the latest date for applications had been changed to the 11th September, 1970.  This meant that applications for grants should be received by the authorities by 11th September, two days after.  Was that a reasonable, fair or justifiable period?</P>
    <P>First of all, it was impossible for any local authority to acquaint applicants who were interested subsequent to the 31st August that the grants were now restored and applicants could apply. Many of the communications were of <Col N="2412" /> a verbal nature and the names of the people involved were not even known to the officials.  It could be said that in the two days at their disposal Cork county was more favoured than other counties so far as advertising the scheme was concerned because officials were able to advertise in a local evening paper with a reasonably wide circulation, the Cork <i>Evening Echo</i>, on the date the communication was received, 9th September, advising people in Cork county that the higher education grants date had been extended, by order of the Minister, to the 11th September. On the following day the 10th September, they inserted an advertisement in the Cork daily paper, the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, which has a very wide circulation in Cork, advising people that the date was extended until the next day.</P>
    <P>That imposed the obligation on applicants to see this advertisement, having seen it to go about it straightaway so as to be in time for the evening post, to take with them a form of application which should be completed by them and countersigned by a peace commissioner and to have that forwarded to the council not later than the following day.</P>
    <P>Surely if the Minister is straight about it that was not a reasonable regulation to impose on any group of people?  The charge I made was that this announcement of the 9th September was made to facilitate special applicants who failed to forward their application before the closing date, August 31st, and that the Minister allowed two days to facilitate these special applicants.  That is my case here tonight and if that is so to my mind it is bordering on fraud. Public money is involved and every boy and girl who qualified and who did not apply prior to 31st August was just as much entitled to have his or her application considered subsequent to that date as were those who were catered for by the extension of the date over a period of two days.  That is all one could say it was.  The Minister's Department did not take up the telephone on 8th September and ring county councils or corporations and say that they were extending the date to the 11th.  Not at all.  The communication went out through the post.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2413" /> I have said and I repeat that it was to facilitate influential applicants who lost out on the application date.  I am a firm believer in adhering to application dates.  There would be no question here tonight or there would be no imposition on your time or on the time of the Minister or his Secretary or the other Deputies who are here tonight if this regulation was adhered to.  It is the Department who flouted the regulation; it is they who broke it and the reasons set down here by the Minister are rather silly.  He said:</P>
    <P>There was very considerable difficulty, as the Deputy may well remember, in relation to the marking of the leaving certificate and because the results of the leaving certificate were later than usual the Department, to facilitate all applicants, postponed the date to the 11th September.</P>
    <P>Who does the Minister think he is codding?</P>
    <P>Cork County Council had six applicants, at last three of whom applied as soon as they read the notice in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> but were unable to have it back by the following day.  The Cork County Council was of the unanimous opinion that one girl did post her application in July.  That was a case, unconnected with what I am talking about now, to which the Minister was asked to give special consideration. The county council were satisfied beyond doubt, on the word of a peace commissioner, a member of the county council and a member of the Minister's own party, who certified this applicant, that the form was posted in July.  She, too, was deprived of a £300 scholarship.</P>
    <P>There was some correspondence. The five minutes at my disposal will not allow me to read it in detail.  A number of letters were sent to the Minister.  The council felt very strongly about this.  Incidentally, the numbers do not count in this case, it is the principle, but five of the six people who were involved in Cork county are outside my constituency.  I am not acting on behalf of any constituent.  I regard this as a national question.  A letter to the council from the Department read:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2414" /> As completed application forms were not received by you before 11th September from candidates A, B, C and D these candidates are not eligible for higher grants.</P>
    <P>They did apply when they read the advertisement in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> but could not possibly have the form in having regard to the fact that they had to contact a peace commissioner and so on.</P>
    <P>I have left this question over and so have other Cork Deputies for a number of months but the new scholarships are now coming along.  We were hopeful that the Minister would change his view.  Repeated representations were made to him.  A letter sent by the council to the Minister read:</P>
    <P>It was pointed out by the council that your letter authorising the extension of the closing date for receipt of completed application forms to 11th September, 1970, did not reach the council until 9th September and as the public advertisement announcing this extension could not have appeared in the press earlier than the <i>Evening Echo</i> of the 9th September and the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of 10th September sufficient time was not available for some applicants to have their application forms obtained from the council&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>In the first instance they should write for the form.  In Kerry, in Clare, in many other counties there is no local daily paper in circulation.  They should do all this in the one day.  The letter continued:</P>
    <P>&mdash;in the first instance and then to have them completed and returned to the council all within the space of two days at the most especially as the forms incorporate a declaration to be made by the parent or guardian before a commissioner for oaths, district justice or peace commissioner regarding the accuracy of the particulars given on the particular application form.</P>
    <P>Special mention was made of the case where the council was satisfied that the application form was submitted in July, 1970.  The Minister's attitude on that case amazes me but it is not strictly relevant to the points I am making. <Col N="2415" /> The council then asked the Minister in view of the shortness of the period to review his decision.  The reply from the Department read:</P>
    <P>I am to refer your letter of 31st October, 1970, in regard to six applications for higher education grants received by your council after 11th September, 1970, the closing date for the receipt of completed applications this year, and to inform you that the Minister cannot see his way to approve your council's proposal to accept these applications.</P>

      <P>The other day Deputy Murphy had a question down here and when I gave him the answer he made a charge.  I explained the reason why I had not accepted various applications after a certain date.  I am perfectly well aware now that the Deputy knows that the explanation I gave him in relation to why the date could not be changed was a very reasonable one but, of course, rather than admit that he was in error he is now endeavouring to defend his position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it very clear that, so far as the Minister and his Department are concerned, they had no knowledge of or interest in any individual candidate. The question of there being favoured candidates is without any basis whatsoever.  There are a number of basic factors in relation to the award of higher education grants.  The first is that there must be a latest date <Col N="2416" /> for the receipt of aplications and that due notice of that date must be given. Deputy Murphy rightly said that a couple of years ago that that date was fixed as 31st May.  The reason I changed that date to 31st August was that when it was 31st May all those who had applied for a higher education grant had to apply on the basis that they were hoping to get the necessary grades in their Leaving Certificate Examination.  They would know by 31st August if they had, in fact, got the requisite number of C's in the Leaving Certificate Examination.</P>
    <P>Obviously the reason why there must be a latest date is to give sufficient time to the county and borough councils to assess the eligibility of applicants and, in the case of eligible applicants, to determine by reference to their Leaving Certificate results whether they have qualified for a grant.  All this must be done well in advance of the re-opening of the institutions of higher education after the summer holidays. It must also be done in time to enable applicants who do not qualify for a grant to make up their minds in relation to the other openings that may be available to them.</P>
    <P>On 19th February, 1970, all the local authorities concerned were notified that the latest date for the receipt of applications for grants was 31st August, 1970.  As everybody is now aware, last year there were difficulties in relation to the marking of the Leaving Certificate Papers and the results came out considerably later than was usual.  In fact, the results did not issue to the schools until 20th August.  So far as I can remember the usual date for the issue of these results was somewhere around the first week in August.</P>
    <P>Because of the fact that a considerable number of county councils and individual applicants made the plea that the inordinately late issue of the results rendered the making of applications in time impossible for a considerable number of candidates, all local authorities were given permission to accept applications received up to and including 11th September.</P>
