    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether his attention has been drawn to recent reports regarding the irresponsible attitude of some doctors in the matter of prescribing certain harmful drugs; and if he will make a statement on the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to an article on amphetamine prescribing in the current issue of the Journal of the Irish Medical Association and to the reference to the prescribing of barbiturates and tranquillisers in the recent report of the Medico-Social Research Board.  I have seen these two publications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that, with the agreement of representatives of the medical profession, I made regulations in 1969 and 1970 controlling rigidly the availability of amphetamines.  The <Col N="1613" /> article in the Journal of the Irish Medical Association reviews the operation of the regulations following a meeting which I had with the representatives of the profession on 1st March last.  While, as the article points out, a very limited number of practitioners may be over-liberal in their prescribing of these substances the position is incomparably better than it was before the regulations were made. The matter is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>As regards the reference in the report of the Medico-Social Research Board I indicated previously in reply to a question by the Deputy on 17th November, 1970, that I had taken a considerable interest in the question of the use of tranquillisers and anti-depressants in medicine and that I had spoken publicly on the matter on appropriate occasions.</P>
    <P>The Working Party on Drug Abuse in their recently published report refer to the position regarding the prescribing, administering and supply of drugs liable to abuse and make certain recommendations in this regard.  I am having these recommendations examined and consultation with the appropriate professional and other bodies will follow, as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree there is no irresponsible prescribing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is no irresponsible prescribing.  If there is any it is a matter for the Medical Association to examine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>When a duly qualified medical practitioner is prescribing tranquillisers, who is to determine whether he is prescribing them in excess or otherwise?  Surely this question is a libel on the profession and nothing else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has misunderstood the terms of the Medico-Social Research Board Report.  What they suggested was that there might be consultation with the medical profession in regard to the length of time for which a person was given a prescription for certain types of barbiturates <Col N="1614" /> and tranquillisers, and that was not necessarily a reflection on the medical profession at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with the Minister, but who could determine the length of time for which it is necessary to prescribe barbiturates except the person who is actually prescribing them and treating the person concerned?  How can any outside body or commission decide whether the administering of the drugs should be stopped or continued?  This is just nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I think the Deputy has misunderstood the position. This matter of the extent to which barbiturates and tranquillisers are prescribed is being raised not by people outside the medical profession but by men and women in the medical profession. Sir Derrick Dunlop, who is the Chairman of the Drug Advisory Board in Great Britain, and a most eminent physician whose word is universally respected, drew attention to the fact that one hour's sleep out of every ten in England and Wales was drug-induced. He said the doctors should begin to think about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree&mdash;he has said it himself&mdash; that the reduction in the numbers being admitted to mental hospitals is, perhaps, due to the prescribing of antidepressants and tranquillisers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is a matter of argument.  As the Deputy will know from Sir Derrick Dunlop's report, there were delivered to the population of England and Wales, some 50 million&mdash;14 million prescriptions in one year solely for two mild tranquillisers&mdash;librium and valium. The Deputy's explanation may be a partial one but it still is in the mind of the medical profession that they should start thinking about this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the undue delay experienced by patients requiring treatment at the Dental Hospital, Dublin; and, if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy's question relates to the services provided at the Dublin Dental Hospital for adults and children from the Dublin area who are eligible for services under the Health Acts.</P>
      <P>I am informed that there is no undue delay in providing treatment for patients, except in the case of adult patients who require dentures and children who have been referred under the School Health Service for orthodontic treatment.  The hospital and the Eastern Health Board are taking action to try to reduce the delay in providing dentures.  The possibility of reducing the waiting time for orthodontic treatment is also under examination but the shortage of orthodontists suggests that an early solution to this problem is unlikely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be in a position to say what is the present delay for orthodontic treatment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the delay for that.  For dental treatment and dentures, as a result of a number of wholetime dental officers holding evening sessions the waiting list has been reduced from 900 to 500 in a recent period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister have any figures for time?  Would it be six months, 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point is that orthodontists are difficult to get. <Col N="1616" /> Even though proper salaries have been offered, orthodontists do not apply for the positions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained to the House that there are certain areas where we have advertised for permanent medical officers where we think that the choice of doctor principle would not alter the situation in the area.  There are other areas where the advertising of posts is being suspended pending new negotiations with the IMA and the Medical Union. These negotiations will end shortly and I hope that we can agree on matters with the profession and that then there will be a referendum among the members of the IMA and the Irish Medical Union.  If the referendum shows approval of the revised proposals, then there will be a known date for the introduction of a choice of doctor system some time next year and then it will be possible for us to go through the list of areas where there may be still some doubt as to whether with the choice of doctor system there is an adequate coverage of medical card patients in the area.</P>

      <P>I have seen the reports referred to by the Deputy.  I am informed by the Electricity Supply Board that it has always been their policy to request a contribution to the cost of an extension of their supply lines if expected revenue appeared inadequate to remunerate the cost of the extension.  In the case of extensions to new housing schemes the decisive factor in assessing the economics is the expected degree of utilisation of electricity in the houses.  Thus, if houses are insufficiently wired, or equipped with non-electric means of cooking, water heating, <i>et cetera,</i> the board must make the correspondingly lower estimates of revenue which, in turn, reduces the amount of capital the board can economically invest in the extension.</P>

      <P>It is quite incorrect to say that my Department has refused to carry out its obligation in this matter.  The legal authorities were, in fact, instructed by the Department to take any necessary action for recovery from the employer concerned of the amount of unemployment benefit lost by the insured person in question. Judgment by default was obtained in August last and an execution order is in the hands of the sheriff.  The chief State solicitor is making inquiries from the sheriff as to the present position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 to 15 together.</P>
      <P>It is assumed that the reference in all three questions is to persons disallowed since 14th April, 1971 under the Unemployment Assistance (Employment Period) (No. 2) Order, 1971, the scope of which has been further restricted since 28th April by an amending order.  Considerable numbers of men without dependants will, as a result, have title to unemployment assistance restored to them from 28th April because they are residing on specified coastal islands or are aged 50 upwards.</P>
      <P>Until this restoration has been completed and the relevant returns from local offices have been processed, it is not feasible to state the number of men under age 50 who have incurred disallowance.</P>
      <P>I circulated with the Official Report for 5th May a statement of the number of disallowances at each local office up to 23rd April, which was only a few days before the effective date of the amending order, and informed the House then that the statistics are not maintained on the basis of constituencies or of country of residence.  I hope to communicate to the Deputy within the next three weeks, on a local office basis, the additional figures he now seeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" /> With regard to the other matters raised, I wish to point out that, in association with the Government decision to reintroduce an employment period, provision was made for an extra half million pounds, bringing the total provision up to one million this year, for local improvement schemes in rural areas, particularly in the west. These extra moneys, taken in conjunction with the restoration of unemployment assistance to islanders and to men of 50 and upwards, release from the effect of the order the category likely to suffer hardships from the operation of the employment period.  The Minister for Local Government has asked county managers to make a special effort to increase the number of schemes in operation during the employment period.  In view of these measures, I find it difficult to accept that the present restricted scope of the order is a source of grave hardship and I am not aware that many men affected by it have been refused home assistance and are destitute.</P>

      <P>As I stated in the House on 30th March last, special financial provision was made to enable university fees of holders of higher education grants in the academic year 1970-71 to be kept at the level obtaining in 1969-70.  I do not propose at present to make any further increase in the grants in question.  Post-primary education is available free of charge to all pupils together with free transport where needed, and free books and accessories are provided for necessitous pupils.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not accept that many secondary school authorities and many families are experiencing growing financial difficulties because of the failure to revise upwards the £25 <i>per capita</i> grant fixed in 1966-67?  Surely the Minister will accept that this figure should be revised to an amount of £33 or £35 at least in the light of the increase in the cost of living alone since the £25 grant was fixed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy says.  In 1966-67 the grant in very many cases was much lower than £25.  In fact, the grant was gradually increased over a couple of years. I think the grant being made available at the present time is reasonable.</P>

      <P>I said &ldquo;Surely the Minister will accept&rdquo;&mdash;that is a rhetorical question.  Does the Minister accept that the level of £25 fixed in 1966-67 is now completely inadequate? Many of the schools which opted into the scheme would not have done so had they known that they would have to wait for at least five or ten years before any revision was made regarding grants. Surely the Minister will accept the logic of keeping in step with the cost of living?</P>

I have pointed out that in very many of the schools in 1966-67, the fee being charged prior to the introduction of free education was very much lower than £25. In fact, in the following years the grant in the case of these schools was raised until finally it became £25.</P>

A classic example is the Christian Brothers' Oatlands College where the fee in 1966-67 was £39.

        <i>(Cavan)</i> asked the Minister for Education if it is a fact that, whereas county councils can make grants available to students who wish to attend a university and who have secured four honours in university subjects in their leaving certificate, subject to a means test, a vocational education committee cannot award similar grants to students who wish to pursue third level studies at regional colleges; and, if so, whether in order to terminate this unfair discrimination against vocational education, he will take steps to bring the law applicable to vocational students, who wish to pursue studies at regional colleges, into line with secondary school students who wish to attend universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to grants for higher education is that they are available for courses leading to a university degree or equivalent qualification in the case of students who reach a certain standard at the leaving certificate examination and satisfy a means test.  They are available to students attending either secondary or vocational schools.  In order that a student might hold one of these grants in a regional technical college it would be necessary that the course which he would be following be recognised as leading to a qualification equivalent to a university degree.  Provision for any such recognition could be made only after the national council for educational awards had been set up.</P>
      <P>I might mention, however, that many vocational education committees have established scholarship schemes to the regional technical colleges.  In fact, expenditure amounting to over £3,600 has been authorised in respect of such schemes during the current financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will make a statement on the outcome of the representations made to him by members of the Dáil that he should meet a representative deputation from the staff and students of the National College of Art; and if he will state the date on which the new governing body for this College is likely to come into being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recollect that I indicated my willingness to meet deputations from the staff and students provided such deputations were balanced and representative. An officer of my Department indicated to the students the type of deputation which I would regard as fulfilling these conditions.  A meeting of students on the 5th of this month purported to elect representatives.  I was not prepared to accept the manner of election or that the deputation proposed by the students as a result thereof was either balanced or representative.  I had this information conveyed to the students who have now proposed a deputation of a more representative nature.  I am prepared to meet this deputation.  I am awaiting a list of the names of the proposed deputation from the teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated on 29th April last, I hope to be in a position to seek approval for the introduction of legislation in the current session setting up <Col N="1637" /> a governing body for the college.  Until this legislation has been passed by the Oireachtas I cannot say when it is likely that the new governing body will be established.  It is my intention to have it established as soon as possible after I am empowered to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In arriving at the decision in relation to the balance or otherwise of this deputation which the Minister has purported to judge himself, did he receive a report from his senior representative who is now in the college?  Further, would the Minister please inform us what criteria were used in deciding whether the composition of that originally proposed deputation was balanced?  Surely we are entitled to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I was concerned with having a deputation from which I would be likely to get various views and not one particular type of view. When I saw the composition of the original deputation it was obvious to me that it would be very much like the deputation I met on a previous occasion and from which nothing of any worth resulted.  I had suggested and, I think, with some reason, that the various schools in the College of Art should have representation on this deputation so that I would have the views of those in each of the various schools.  Ultimately this was what the students agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that the Minister does not propose to give representation on this deputation to night students.  Night students constitute a considerable proportion of the students attending this college and, therefore, are as much entitled to representation on any deputation as are any other students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it is not a matter for me to propose whether the students on this deputation be day students or night students but if the night students would like to meet me I certainly would be willing to meet them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to this deputation, would the Minister not <Col N="1638" /> agree that the method of election chosen by the students was a perfectly normal and straightforward one?  Ten people were selected by 60 per cent of the students attending and they were selected by a democratic process. Would the Minister not agree also that his proposal for equal representation for each department would involve a distortion because some departments have seven members while others have 45?  I ask these questions merely to clarify the position because the Minister would appear to have reflected on the method of election.  The students have gone to great trouble to meet his requirements even at the expense of rendering less democratic their method of choosing their representatives. Would the Minister not agree further that the original method chosen was a democratic method and that he has forced the students to modify it so that it is less democratic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree that it is less democratic.  It will give me the views of the students from the various schools and I might say also that the result of the original election appeared to me to be lopsided when, in fact, we got a very high proportion from one particular school and a very small number from each of the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that many election results appear to be lopsided?  We thought the last election was very lopsided but we accepted it as being democratic.  It is for the students to choose representatives and not for the Minister to impose his view as to whom they ought to choose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that his attitude to this matter is both extraordinary and highhanded and, I might say, not conducive to bringing about a lessening of the cynicism of such students towards the Department and ministerial involvement in this question?  Surely the Minister should have accepted that when a large body of students get together and use the one-man-one-vote system in democratically electing  deputation, he should not come to Parliament and say that it was obvious to him that the deputation was unbalanced <Col N="1639" /> and would serve no useful purpose? The Minister promised to meet them but he has not met them yet&mdash;he did not meet the original deputation&mdash; but he says it is unbalanced.  I must confess that the situation appears to me to be quite extraordinary.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that the plaster casts allegedly destroyed recently by students in the National College of Art were donated by the Somerset School of Design in 1848; that a three-man French committee <Col N="1640" /> headed by Monsieur Druot and commissioned by the Department of Education in 1927 to report upon the College of Art reported that the casts were covered over with numerous layers of paint and that the successive layers of paint had caused the relief to disappear and that it was erroneous to paint plaster models; and if he is aware that these casts have been painted annually ever since; and, if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a fact that the plaster casts of the statues to which the Deputy refers have been painted over annually.  Any painting over of the figures in recent years was done to obliterate the daubings and the vulgarisms and obscenities painted on them.</P>
      <P>There is not in the records of the Department any copy of the report to which the Deputy refers and, therefore, I am unable to comment on it.</P>
      <P>Lest, however, it should be thought that the estimate which I gave of the cost over the past year of making good the damage caused by students in the National College of Art related to the destruction of plaster casts I wish to give the Deputy a break-down of the cost:</P>

    <P>NOTE: Provision was made in the 1970-71 estimates for additional staff.  Because of the decision to transfer the control of the College to an independent governing board it was decided not to proceed with any additional permanent teaching appointments.  A number of technical assistants for whom provision was made in 1970-71 did not take up duty until after the end of the financial year. Furthermore, the demand for part-time classes was not as great as had been expected.</P>

      <P>The flour millers are not required to consult me in relation to the closing of individual mills.  I am informed, however, that the closing of the mill at Clara arises from the continuing decline in the consumption of flour which has resulted in Messrs.  Ranks having sufficient milling capacity at their other mills to meet their flour trade.  I understand that the employees will be compensated in accordance with a redundancy scheme organised within the industry which has been agreed with the union concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say that crawfish are merely being fished along the coast incidentally in conjunction with the fishing of lobster.  The value of the crawfish catch by Irish fishermen in 1970 at over £207,000 indicates that the fishery is being vigorously prosecuted.  However, some fishermen use the same gear with the express intention of catching lobster and crawfish at the same time and the scientific officers of my Department are satisfied that this is not the best technique.  They feel that the crawfish catch could be increased substantially if the use of specialised gear was more widespread and if more of the larger vessels using the specialised gear were to take part in the fishery.  They also hold that it is not necessary to carry <Col N="1650" /> out experimental fishing to establish the validity of this view which has already been fully dealt with in a number of fishery leaflets issued by my Department on the subject.</P>
      <P>Exploratory fishing designed to locate new stocks or to investigate the strength of stocks in particular areas is, however, always useful and for these purposes it is proposed later this year to carry out, with the aid of the Department's exploratory fishing vessel <i>Cu na Mara,</i> fishing for crawfish off Killala Bay.  The location and timing of similar work elsewhere will depend on the requirements of the programme of research and exploratory work from time to time.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will comment on the statement made by the chairman of a major Cork company (name supplied) on April 30th that the Government had failed to take any action to protect the Irish hosiery and knitwear industry against an unprecedented level of dumping in the current year by British, American, Dutch and Belgian firms and that employment is being affected by this development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Action to counteract dumping must be taken in accordance with the Imposition of Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act, 1968.  The Act provides for a special commission, An Coimisiún Dumpála, to investigate complaints of dumping, whenever the commission considers it probable that the goods in question have been or are being dumped and that the dumping caused or threatens to cause material injury to the Irish industry. The Act further provides that anti-dumping duties may be imposed by the Government if the commission, following an investigation of a complaint, so recommends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the beginning of 1970, An Coimisiún Dumpála has received four complaints of dumping of hosiery and knitwear.  All of these related to imports from the United Kingdom.  The commission could not obtain sufficient evidence of injurious dumping to <Col N="1653" /> justify a formal investigation in the case of two of these complaints, one of which was from the company in question; the commission is pursuing its inquiries into the other two complaints.</P>
    <P>If the firm in question has any further evidence or information that dumping is taking place by British, American, Dutch or Belgian firms, they should take the matter up with An Coimisiún Dumpála.</P>

      <P>Article I (5) of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement provides that, following a review to be undertaken by the Irish Government during the year commencing 1st July, 1970, consultations must take place with the British Government to consider what measures are appropriate to deal with the difficulties which have occurred, or are threatened in certain industries, as a result of the reduction of protection under the agreement.  The British Government have been requested to enter into the necessary consultations at an early date.  Until this precedure is completed I think it would not be desirable to indicate which industries are to be the subject of the consultations.</P>

    <P>Garda strength in Cork City North is 103.  Two cars, as well as two motor cycles, are allocated exclusively to the district.  In addition, four other cars attached to Cork divisional headquarters assist in the prevention and investigation of crime there.  It would not be in the public interest to give details of <Col N="1658" /> the allocation of gardaí or of Garda cars at any particular time or on any particular type of duty.</P>
    <P>The commissioner informs me that the incidence of crime in Cork City North is no greater than in other residential areas in other cities which have a high proportion of children or juveniles.

    <P>Sufficiently detailed information is not available to enable anything like <Col N="1660" /> an accurate assessment to be made of the annual expenditure necessary to establish a scheme on the lines of that operating in England.  The best estimate that can be made is that the cost of such a scheme would be of the order of £200,000 a year.</P>
    <P>While I would welcome the provision of free legal aid in civil cases for persons of insufficient means, the cost of such a system could not at present be undertaken having regard to other and more pressing calls on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I think it is only right that I should take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the work being done by those law students in Dublin who are operating the voluntary free legal advice centres. While it is well-known that many members of the profession often give their services to badly-off clients at reduced fees or entirely free, a specific centre to which needy persons could go for at least preliminary advice on a problem would be a most worthwhile additional service and I would appeal to both branches of the profession to consider whether such centres could be opened on a voluntary basis, perhaps in the evenings, in the larger centres of population.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 74-77 together.</P>
      <P>Three coastal minesweepers were purchased from the British Ministry of Defence earlier this year.  Delivery of the first, <i>L.E. Grainne</i>, was taken at Portsmouth and it was sailed to Haulbowline in February.  The other two vessels were collected at Gibraltar in March and they travelled to Haulbowline under their own power.  The process of assimilating the three minesweepers into the Naval Service is proceeding but as they had been in reserve for some years it is only to be expected that some minor defects would be revealed, e.g. deterioration of the sacrificial and nylon sheathing.  These defects do not, however, detract from the vessels' seaworthiness.  All underwent harbour and sea acceptance trials under British Ministry of Defence supervision before they were sailed to Haulbowline.</P>
      <P>However base spares are essential for normal day-to-day maintenance and until these have been received the operation of the vessels is curtailed to some extent.  <i>L.E. Grainne</i> is non-operational at the moment for this reason.  <i>L.E. Fola</i> is operational and <i>L.E. Banba</i> is about to undergo dry-docking for repairs to the nylon sheathing which was damaged on the voyage from Gibraltar.</P>
      <P>The range of a coastal minesweeper with a full fuel load is 3,500 nautical miles, i.e. 270 hours at 13 knots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1666" /> The expenditure to date on repairs other than alterations is £3,344.</P>
    <P>The amount allocated to my Department during the four years ended 31st March, 1971, for the purchase of coastal minesweepers and a fishery protection vessel was £745,000 and of this amount, 639,000 was spent.</P>
    <P>No foreign trawlers have been arrested since the commissioning of the coastal minesweepers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate if these mine sweepers recently purchased by the Irish Government were refitted before they were taken over? I do not think I need ask if they are fully operational because, quite obviously from the reply, they are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely whoever is responsible for buying naval vessels on behalf of the Government and the Department of Defence should have seen that they were refitted and in full operational order?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>The vessels were subjected to extensive trials by the British Ministry of Defence and the officials of our own Naval Service.  They were bought &ldquo;as lying&rdquo; and it was not unexpected that when they would resume operations some defects would appear. It did not come as any surprise when defects did appear, but we are quite satisfied that the vessels are sound.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Deputy Davern's Question No. 76 of the 30th March, 1971, on the subject.  Since then the housing authority has proposed that <Col N="1679" /> a scheme of about 40 houses should be built in Cashel by a local firm, on the basis of proposals which they have submitted to me under the low cost housing project.  It is intended to provide four houses in the first instance as prototypes.  If these are found to be satisfactory in all respects, the remaining 36 houses will probably be built on the same basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will sanction tenders submitted by Cork County Council for the erection of houses at Leap and Drinagh, County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sanctioned the acceptance of a tender for the houses at Drinagh.  The submission by the council of additional technical information regarding their proposal to accept a tender for four houses at Leap is awaited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that Cork County Council have been frustrated again and again in their attempts to build houses by his attitude and by the attitude of his Department?  Is he aware that the tender submitted for the erection of the four houses at Leap&mdash;involving a sum of £11,617, I think&mdash;is deemed by the council to be reasonable?  Unless it is sanctioned in the not too distant future that tender is likely to be withdrawn. Having regard to those facts, why is the Minister continuously holding up housing proposals from Cork County Council?  What is wrong with the tender?  We are told that it is approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not altogether correct in his allegation that the Department have been holding things up.  In relation to the Drinagh area, the proposal to accept the tender for the provision of the two houses was received in the Department on 1st March, 1971, and appoved on 7th May, 1971.  In the case of Leap, following an initial examination of the proposal, the housing authority were asked on 11th February, 1971, for a report on the incidence of rock on the site.  This <Col N="1682" /> report is awaited.  The housing authority were asked for it also on 30th June, 1970, when the plans were being approved, but it has not been received yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the engineers attached to the local authority should be able to determine whether a site is suitable? It is wanton waste of public money, and the time of public officials, to have to send lay-out plans for small groups of houses, groups of two, three and four, to the Department for sanction. Is the Minister aware that the Cork County Council engineering staff are satisfied that the lay-out plan is quite suitable and acceptable?  Is the Minister also aware that the opinion I expressed about frustration so far as housing in West Cork is concerned is not only my personal opinion but the unanimous opinion of the committee of the council?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that it is necessary for a local authority to submit a lay-out plan for one house, or two houses, or four houses in this case, to the Department for sanction?  Will he not accept the assurance of the local councillors that the site is suitable?  Why should public money be expended on sending lay-out plans for relatively small schemes up and down to the Department?  That is the greatest nonsense and the biggest waste of time and money that you could think of.  Is it not about time that this system was reviewed?  Is it not about time that the local authorities got some power or some autonomy&mdash; or else abolish them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the reason why the Leap housing scheme is being held up according to the Minister.  I do not think it is the reason.  My view is that it is because of a shortage of cash and we in West Cork are suffering.  This is only a tactic on the part of the Minister. He talks about the lay-out plan. <Col N="1683" /> I know the site quite well.  We have information that everything is in order and we are waiting to get the green light from the Department and approval for the money so that we can advertise the houses.  I am asserting as a Member of this House that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there is grave discrimination against us by the Department and that we in West Cork have suffered, but we will not suffer much longer in silence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Murphy is as sincere as he claims to be about this whole matter, all he has to do is to bring pressure on his own local authority to submit the report to the Department which his local authority were asked for first in June of last year and again on 11th February of this year. This report relates to the incidence of rock on the site, a rather minor matter. When it is received I can assure him the proposal will be processed immediately.</P>

      <P>No proposals are before my Department at present for the provision of houses in Kinsale, Skibbereen, or Dunmanway.

Is he further aware that that shortage cannot be relieved unless and until the money is made available by the Department?

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that overtime working would involve a tenant in some extra expenses and, for that reason, I am prepared to approve a proposal by a local authority to disregard up to one-fifth of such earnings in computing rent under a differential rent scheme in which the maximum rent represents the full economic cost of the house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that when a tenant of a local authority house works overtime, 7s in the £ is deducted for income tax and 2s 6d in the £ for additional rent and the tenant has only 10s 6d out of the £ he earns?

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not when the maximum rent is applicable to the tenant but when he is paying rent under a scheme to which the economic rent applies.  In other words, when the maximum economic rent applies under the differential rent scheme the deduction of one-fifth overtime can be applied.</P>

      <P>Last year I made regulations providing for the use of the Irish version only of the names of places in the Gaeltacht on signs within Gaeltacht areas.  Bord Fáilte, who provide such signs, are at present surveying these areas preparatory to preparing a programme for the implementation of the regulations.  I understand that it is hoped to commence work on the replacement of signs in the Connemara Gaeltacht some time in the autumn.  In the meantime the maintenance of existing signs is a matter for the local authority concerned.</P>

As he saw today, one of his colleagues helped along the Minister for Labour when replying to a question from me in which he stated &ldquo;It would not happen in Navan&rdquo;.  Obviously he accepted what the majority of the people of Navan voted for.  This is not a question <Col N="1688" /> of being for or against the Irish language as I am sure the Minister will appreciate.  The original name of the town is nearer to Navan than An Uaimh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I had begun to speak about the injustice that had been caused to people who are deprived of social welfare benefits. Since the order was made there has been a good deal of talk but no Deputies from the West got an opportunity of speaking on the subject during <Col N="1693" /> the short debate when time was limited.</P>
      <P>As a Deputy representing people from a western area, I take this opportunity of speaking on behalf of those who are being deprived of social assistance.  In this country today many people are earning substantial salaries. Most of these are well organised so that when they decide that they deserve an increase in salary, they can go on strike if their demand is not met.  This is not the case in so far as the people about whom I am speaking are concerned.  These unfortunate people were receiving assistance of £3.25 at the maximum but yet it was decided to deprive them of this assistance. It was only after the Minister had made the order that many of us realised how important this assistance is to so many.  All public representatives received many letters inquiring as to what could be done and those Deputies who spoke on the matter here put the case for those people very strongly.  The Minister backpedalled a little and tried to tell us that a mistake had been made but, under pressure, he decided to water down the order a little and to continue the assistance to those more than 50 years of age.  At no time should the Minister have deprived or attempted to deprive the weakest section of our community who certainly are not in any position to organise a very strong protest and who depend on those of us whom they elected to speak for them.  Therefore, it is for us both here and in the council chambers to speak on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admire Deputy Foley for the courage he displayed, as a member of Fianna Fáil, in condemning this action on the part of the Government.  What Deputy Foley said was very true.  This country is being run at an expenditure of about £560 million a year yet we decided to take £3 a week from a few thousand people instead of taking a few pounds from those who are well paid, including ourselves, because if the Department had told us that we would have to make a sacrifice in this case, we would have had to agree to do so in preference to taking the few pounds from those people who have no comeback. However, if we were told that <Col N="1694" /> our salaries and the salaries of highly paid officials were to be reduced, I am sure we would hear quite a lot about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made his decision and I do not suppose there is much he can do about it now but I would ask him to do everything possible to help those who have been deprived.  Until such time as this money is restored to them, they will have to endure great deprivation.  Not so very long ago the Minister for Social Welfare toured my area and, at a church gate meeting, he thanked the people for their support and spoke of the social welfare benefits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but he will not be back for a long time.  During the by-election campaign the platform speeches of the Minister were centred on social welfare benefits.  In introducing the Budget, the Minister for Finance told us that expenditure was down by £76 million.  It is very difficult to get that across to the people of the country when, at the same time, taxation is being increased all round and the price of everything we buy is being increased.  Everybody complains of a shortage of money but we have the Fianna Fáil Administration telling us about the great work they are doing and saying that no other party could possibly do better.</P>
      <P>I have here a letter from a bishop who returned to this country after being away for 38 years.  He says that the first thing he noticed in rural Ireland is that the population is declining rapidly and that it is now too late to do anything about this particular problem.  He says also that our educational system is not geared towards country living and that no training is given to those who wish to remain in rural areas.  It is a pity, he says, that the problem was not tackled 30 or 40 years ago.  There is a lot of talk about saving the West but anybody who travels to a rural area will realise that it is now too late to try to save the West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Lands made a statement in this House which hit the headlines in regard to what <Col N="1695" /> he was going to do about land.  The bishop had no need to tell the people what he was going to do about the taking over of land.  He has only to wait patiently and land will fall into the hands of the Forestry Division without any pressure from the Minister for Lands.  That is where Fianna Fáil fails: in not moving more quickly. Emphasis now is on the towns and country areas which are being depopulated. This makes the villages quieter and the youth are going.  They are not geared for country living while we have this kind of administration.</P>
    <P>We are told about the amount of money allocated to various Departments for different schemes, but I have before me a document from the vocational schools committee which shows what we are up against when we are asked about grants.  This document, in the case of one school requiring renovation, says &ldquo;Under review&rdquo;; &ldquo;Community school idea&mdash;discussions awaited&rdquo;.  In the case of another schools it says &ldquo;Sanction to go to tender awaited from the Department of Education&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not question your ruling but there should not be so much delay in giving out money, especially when we hear of the millions being spent.  We are still going to the various Departments asking when grants will be paid.  All over the country there are calls for renovations and extensions and the response is as I have indicated, &ldquo;Sanction awaited,&rdquo;&ldquo;Drawings awaited,&rdquo;&ldquo;Discussions awaited&rdquo; and so on.  The same applies in every county.  Surely, with £550 million and a population of 2,800,000 money should be available without having to wait so long and let so much that is necessary go by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We still have a long way to go in providing accommodation for the mentally handicapped.  It is very disappointing, for parents particularly, to be waiting and hoping that something will be done.  I ask the Department to speed up the provision of the accommodation <Col N="1696" /> that is required.  There is only one institute to cater for Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim.  That is not in keeping with modern requirements.</P>
    <P>We are invited to attend meetings about the care of geriatric patients. The Department is not spending sufficient money in this field and while some large sums may be spent they could be better used in other directions.</P>
    <P>The grant of 55s per week by the Department of Social Welfare to those who care for the aged was generally welcomed but the scope of the scheme is too limited.  It applies to about four classes of relatives and persons outside those classes are not considered.  If the scope of the scheme were widened we would not have so great a demand on the Department of Health because more old people would be kept at home, and institutions which are costing so much would not be so heavily strained if the Department made it easier to qualify under the scheme.  It made a great difference to many people to have £4.25 plus £2.75 coming into a home, almost £7.  This helps to run a home that might otherwise be very hard to maintain.  Many more pensioners should get the extra 55s and if it were granted the Department would not be called on to support so many elderly people; they would be kept at home.</P>
    <P>The Government should be able to run the country without paying £91 million annually to service the national debt.  This is really an enormous waste of money.  We have borrowed money from Germany and other countries at very high rates of interest.  One cannot believe everything one sees in the papers but I did read that a loan raised in Germany cost almost 50 per cent.  There is something very wrong with a country that has to borrow in those circumstances.  We should have tackled the problem 20 or 30 years ago and so be in a position now to solve our problems without having to borrow at such high rates of interest. We should copy some of our neighbouring countries where every acre of land is made productive.  Many parts of this country, even where there is good land, are neglected.  It would certainly be a different country if the land were properly managed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1697" /> Many people anxious to enlarge their holdings have been hoping the Land Commission would increase its staff so that the land near their holdings, which they have been looking at for the last 20 years, can be divided. Representations to the Department in Merrion Street can be made time and again and after the third time one will be told that the Department are looking into the matter.  The Department of Lands should spend more money and get the machinery going so that land can be divided.  This is what taxation is for and this is what revenue should be spent on.  A clause in the Department's regulations states that no single man is eligible for land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Taxation on a pint of stout is at the rate of 7½p, which means the price of a pint of stout is beyond the reach of many people.  The one consolation people had when the day's work was over was to go and have a pint but taxation has made it too expensive.</P>
      <P>Farmers were hoping they would be given an increase in the price of milk, but the price of milk has been increased by only half an old penny which is not enough to entice people to go into milk production.  Farmers have to work seven days a week in milk production and they need greater encouragement to do so.  People in the west should be given greater consideration than those living on good land elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I mentioned that there are five million cattle in the country but only £250,000 has been allocated for the warble fly eradication scheme which should get under way in the autumn.  This scheme was far from being successful last year and the Department should ensure that the same thing does not happen again next year because if it does all the money which has been spent in the past will be wasted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be a larger allocation for the local improvements scheme. Even at this stage more industry should <Col N="1698" /> be established in the West of Ireland. Employment is necessary there because with ever-increasing costs people are not able to live on their small holdings. Finally I would once again ask that farmers be given a higher price for milk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an economist and I do not pretend to know much about high finance but I should like to make a few remarks on some of the things which did strike me in regard to this Budget.  As we had a new Minister for Finance introducing the Budget this year many people hoped there would be a new outlook in financial thinking which would give the people an uplift.  I am afraid we did not get anything new in this Budget.  I had felt the Minister might create a climate for investment and bring in new foreign investment by his Budget and I had thought he might put a stop to the Irish money which is going out in increasing amounts year by year to foreign money markets.</P>
      <P>People have become cynical and this fact was brought home to me when I spoke on Budget day to people who did not even know that the Budget was being brought in on that day.  On the day after the Budget had been announced I spoke to people who did not know much about the Budget and could not have cared less anyway.  This sorry state of affairs has been brought about to some extent by high taxation. People no longer worry about increases in income tax and all the other taxes which are levied on them from the central authority and from the local authority through the rates.  They merely took for increases in their wages to compensate for the higher taxes they have to pay.  This brings about inflation which has been talked about so much over the last few years and to which the Minister devoted a fair amount of his Budget Statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not grappled with the problem of inflation in this Budget.  He is obviously hoping it will right itself but every person of common sense&mdash;one need not be very clever or an economist&mdash;knows that one cannot wish away inflation.  Measures must be taken to control the finances of the <Col N="1699" /> State.  The Minister has failed to do this and that is the biggest fault in this Budget.  It is a standstill Budget.  It does not do very much for anyone. There are a few increases in social welfare and there are taxes levied, taxes which some people feel should not have been levied.  Some taxes may be justifiable.  Others are not.</P>
    <P>The increases given to social welfare recipients are far from adequate.  They will not bring the benefits up to the spending power they had 12 months ago.  Social welfare benefits generally are not high enough.  The Minister really should make a better effort to give the recipients a living.  They do not get that at the moment.  Prices increased by 12 per cent in the last 12 months.  Contributory pensions will be increased by 10 per cent.  There will be a smaller increase in the case of non-contributory pensions.  I suppose those on non-contributory pensions do not eat as much or drink as much as those who get contributory pensions.  Invariably these increases come into operation from four to six months after the Budget.  Invariably there is also an increase in the price of the stamp.  The Minister should tell us in his Budget by how much he proposes to increase the price of the stamp to compensate for these increased payments.  I suppose we can take it that the increase this year will be of the order of 3s&mdash;2s from the employer and 1s from the employee.</P>
    <P>A new stamp is being introduced this year.  The information given about this has been very vague and the Minister for Health yesterday gave literally no information in reply to questions on this matter.  It is my opinion he did not want to give information.  According to the Minister for Finance this new stamp will raise some £2 million in the period in which it will operate this year.  We can, I suppose, take it that in a full year the figure will be £5 million.  This stamp is introduced to cover hospitalisation.  It will be a new tax on those who up to this had free hospitalisation.  According to surveys carried out.  30 per cent of the population have medical cards; 15 per cent are in the higher income group.  This leaves 55 per cent on whom will fall the cost of this new stamp.  As a result <Col N="1700" /> of inquiries I know that 50 per cent of these are at the moment geting free hospitalisation.  There are borderline cases; there are small farmers and businessmen who have to put someone in to look after their affairs if they are hospitalised and local health boards up to this have always taken this into consideration and refrained from charging these people the 10s per day for hospitalisation.  Henceforth these people will not receive free hospitalisation. They will have to pay this tax, for that is what it is.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it would be in or about 15 or 16 new pence.  That would be 3s in pre-decimalisation currency. The Minister may be right.  I do not say he is not right.  All of us can throw our minds back to the time when we were told that the Health Act would not cost local authorities any more than 2s in the £.  I do not think any of us ever thought it would remain at that figure.  Neither did we think that it should remain at that figure.  Naturally it would have to increase with increased costs.  But no one ever expected that health charges would reach the astronomical figure they have reached from the point of view of rates at the moment.  Indeed, the time has come when some new source of income will have to be found.  Local authorities will have to shed this burden.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister this new stamp will bring in £5 million in a full year.  There are people who are already paying something in the region of 32s a week for the stamp.  The Minister says the figure will be 3s; in five years time it could well be 10s, 15s or £1 on top of the cost of the present stamp.  The Minister should have given us a better analysis when he introduced this.</P>
    <P>The price of spirits will be increased as a result of the Budget.  Spirits are a luxury.  If people want to drink spirits they can pay for them.  I have no complaint against the Minister on that score.  However, the pint is a different matter.  Everyone from the highest to the lowest drinks a pint. The man with the well-lined pocket can pay for it.  Unfortunately we cannot charge him more than we charge <Col N="1701" /> the ordinary working man and, from that point of view, where the working man is concerned, this is a tax on leisure.  To a great many people this leisure is essential, the drinking of a pint or two at night and a chat in pleasant company.  The Minister should have left the pint as it was.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in connection with drink and, perhaps, this is what influenced the Minister in raising the price of drink.  There are many young people around the country, from 15 years up, consuming large amounts of drink and then, perhaps under the influence of drink, driving cars to a dance.  This problem is causing great concern to parents, church authorities and to the public in general.  Young people can go into lounge bars and I have never seen them challenged with regard to their age.  I wonder have the gardaí ever checked on this or are they told to turn the blind eye to it in view of the amount of revenue being derived from drink?  Bars are springing up all over the country. Premises nearly as big as aircraft hangars are being converted into lounge bars.  This is bringing in tremendous revenue to the Exchequer. However, if we are to damage the moral wellbeing of our young people this is revenue the Minister could well do without.</P>
    <P>It strikes me that the Garda force is not adequate to deal with the situation. The Minister, in his Budget, did not provide sufficient funds for the Justice Estimate in respect of the Garda force. He increased it by £1,500,000, which will provide 200 extra gardaí in the next year.  I believe that if the Minister raised another £1,500,000 through some tax or other and told the people he was providing another 200 gardaí, they would not criticise the Minister but would congratulate him.  If there is one thing people do not mind paying for it is protection, to know that they themselves and their families are secure, that their property is safe, that the gardaí are only around the corner from them and are ready to assist them when necessary.</P>
    <P>Anyone who takes note of the Garda strength throughout the country&mdash;I do not know much about the city&mdash;will <Col N="1702" /> tell you that there are no gardaí readily available.  They are trying to cover the same territory as before with half the numbers, racing around trying to give proper protection to the citizens. Another thing I noticed in the Estimate was that the provision for overtime for the gardaí is the same as last year.  The gardaí are now working shorter hours and will not be able to cover the same amount of ground as they did before. With a small increase of 200 gardaí and only the same amount of money provided for overtime we will get less protection than we had heretofore.  This is a very unhappy situation and I regret that the Minister did very little in the Budget to improve it.</P>
    <P>I was also disappointed that the Minister did not reduce the very heavy company tax.  From talking to people I am convinced that this tax is holding back the expansion of our industries. The British Government realised the threat to expansion of their industries and reduced the company tax to 40 per cent.  The British Budget was introduced before the Irish Budget.  It gave a lead to our Minister and I cannot understand why he did not take the lead and reduce this taxation.  An English company might think Ireland was a good place to set up a factory having regard to the availability of labour and essential services, but having studied the company tax they would probably decide to establish the industry in Scotland, Wales or in the North of England where they would not get exactly what they wanted but at least they would not be taxed out of existence.</P>
    <P>Companies must be left profits to expand.  &ldquo;Profits&rdquo; is not a dirty word, and the Minister has missed an opportunity of giving the encouragement he should give to Irish companies to expand. They need extra money for stock and so on.  The banks are very restrictive at the moment with regard to credit.  I suppose the Government are taking too much out of the commercial and other banks who lend money.  This means there is not enough money available for industry that needs it so badly to provide more jobs for the people who are leaving the land and for all the new people who are <Col N="1703" /> coming on to the labour market.  We must either give these people jobs at home or export them to England or America.  I can only take it from this Budget that the Minister is interested in exporting them.</P>
    <P>The Minister provided extra money for the IDA.  That is a very good thing, but it will be agreed that it is cheaper to provide new jobs by expanding existing industry.  Then we know the kind of industries we have already. We have &ldquo;fly-by-night&rdquo; men coming in, men who even after the screening of the IDA and the various Departments go flop and cod the poor gullible Irish.  In the long run I think the Minister would have done a better job if he had cut the IDA grant and given some relief to these factories.</P>
    <P>The unemployment situation was brought home forcibly to me this week when a new fire station was opened in a small village in my county.  I was flooded with applications for jobs as part-time firemen.  It is only a small station and they would not be called out very often.  When I asked them for their credentials I was shocked to hear they were all unemployed.  It was disheartening to see so many able-bodied young married men unemployed.  This is a serious situation and unless we tackle it rural Ireland will be depopulated. It would be a pity to see the fine young men who came to me during the week leaving rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister did not provide more money for housing. He has provided about the same amount as last year, taking into consideration the increase in the cost of materials.  There was a shortfall in housing last year.  There were only 3,900 local authority houses built.  Of course we had the cement strike.  The Department would not allow the house building anyway.  Plans were sent back and forward so often that houses could not be built.  I think every local authority had experience of this.  The Minister must face up to facts and get down to providing houses.</P>
    <P>There were a fair number of houses provided under the Small Dwellings Acts.  This type of house was stepped up considerably.  I can see that the <Col N="1704" /> Minister wants more of these houses built.  Local councils are co-operating with the Department on this and it is a great exercise, but with the increase in the loan charges and repayments in the last two years even this type of house is going out of the reach of people for whom it was intended, people earning £20 to £25 a week. With the large increase in rates, and repayments having increased from 50 to 75 per cent over the last two years &mdash;this is our experience in Kilkenny&mdash; these houses are being put out of the reach of the people for whom they were intended.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest drawbacks is the deposit which these people have to find.  I often wonder why the Minister did not work out some method by which the young people who do all this drinking and spend all their money in the bars and dance halls could be encouraged to save.  I know the Minister is taking money from them by way of drink tax but it would be much better if he encouraged them to save so that on marriage they could pay a deposit on a house and perhaps some of the capital.  I wonder why the Minister did not establish house bonds which these people could buy at so much a week.  These could be tax free and interest could be paid on them. The Government would have the use of the money.  These things should be investigated.  If we do not encourage young people to save for some specific purpose, they will not put their money in the post office, no matter how attractive the terms may be.  These are things that should have been done and that have not been done.  It is no harm for ordinary Deputies to say these things and let the people know we have views on these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage of the Budget debate it is difficult to be original.  My first comment is in relation to the Minister's reference to the control of expenditure where he states:</P>
      <P>It is essential therefore to slow down the rate of growth of Government current expenditure to something more closely approaching the automatic growth in revenues at existing rates of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1705" /> He goes on to deal with a new system of block allocations to the various Departments and later on he talks about programme budgeting and says:</P>
    <P>Experimental studies in programme budgeting have been proceeding in the Department of Education....</P>
    <P>If the control of public expenditure and the new system of programming is to be introduced, surely a realistic sense of priorities in Government expenditure must be the guideline.</P>
    <P>The people in my constituency have been the first victims of this new curtailment of Government expenditure and particularly of the new budgeting system introduced in the Department of Education when out of the blue, last Friday, we received the bombshell news that the third level educational institute which was promised to us not merely by the present Minister but by the previous Minister had been axed. Hundreds of secondary school students waiting to go into this college in September, 1972, have been disappointed. They may not be able to get into other university institutions and their parents may not be able to <Col N="1706" /> afford to send them there.  This decision is a disgraceful one and a grave injustice to the hundreds of students who are now in their final year at secondary school.  This decision has been taken for purely financial reasons and the message that has come from the Department of Education and the Minister for Justice over the weekend that it was taken on educational grounds is codology.  It was made on financial grounds.  If this is the type of curtailment of public expenditure we are to have, God knows what else will be axed.  Education should be a top priority in Government expenditure.  We have been campaigning for over a decade for this institute.  We have been promised it.  We had the building ready to start first-year classes.  All that was necessary was to appoint the staff.  This is a disgraceful decision which is strongly resented by the people of my constituency.  I want to place on record my condemnation of the Government for what has happened.  It is something I believe the Government will rue.</P>
