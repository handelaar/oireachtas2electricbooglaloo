      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he had seen newspaper accounts and received (a) a documented report from a barrister and (b) a statement from Catholic clergy, regarding alleged torture of prisoners in Palace Street Barracks, Belfast and elsewhere in the Six Counties, carried out under the direction of a British Army officer (name supplied) against whom similar allegations were made when he was serving in Kenya; and what action at international level he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to newspaper photographs (details supplied) of a man (name supplied) whose wife was shot dead by British troops recently; if he is aware that this man was brutally assaulted by British soldiers; and what action, if any, he intends taking in the matter.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen newspaper accounts and <Col N="1400" /> received reports privately about allegations of torture and of inhuman and degrading treatment in Northern Ireland.  As indicated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Dáil Éireann on the 21st October, we were collecting evidence on this subject even before the introduction of internment. Information continues to come in and is being closely examined with a view to considering whether recourse may be had to the European Commission on Human Rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder has the Taoiseach had an opportunity of reading the report of Amnesty International and does he propose to make any representations to international bodies with which this country is associated and ensure effective inquiry into the Amnesty International findings?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a copy of it on my brief but I did not have a chance to read through it yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not much good on the Taoiseach's brief if he has not read through it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not admit that there is now a mounting file of evidence and allegations of such a nature as to provide a <i>prima facie</i> case of brutality and torture in contravention of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights?  Why the delay?  Why is it taking so long?  Is it because the Government are beset with internal troubles and have not time to attend to this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us any reason for the delay?  We were told last June that an arbitrator would be appointed.  Then when we referred it to the Department of Health the committee were told to try again among themselves to come to an agreement. When they could not, it was again referred to the Minister.  This question has now been in abeyance for six to eight months.  What is the delay and when will the Minister be in a position to do it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the relevant legislation if agreement fails to be made in a period of six months or such longer period as to be decided by the Minister then action is taken to appoint an arbitrator.  In any event, officers of my Department are meeting officers of the Department of Local Government in order to make arrangements for the appointment of arbitrators in these cases.  It will be done fairly soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</b> asked the Minister for Health if for both humanitarian reasons and the economic advantages he will consider encouraging the adoption of research techniques not involving living animals in fields where such techniques are already known; and if portion of the grant for medical and scientific research will be specifically allocated for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow the logic of the reference in the Deputies' question to humanitarian reasons.  It is, in fact, for such reasons that medical research involving animals is undertaken in that the results obtained are applied for the benefit of human beings.  If, in the course of such experiments, it is necessary to use living animals the position is adequately covered in the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876.  I am satisfied that, in such research undertaken in this country, the most humane standards possible are observed.  I am afraid that I do not understand the Deputies' reference to economic advantages.</P>
      <P>I do not think, therefore, that there is a case for spending any of the resources made available to the Medical Research Council for the purposes the Deputies have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware expert opinion has it that alternative techniques not involving the use of living animals have been proved to be cheaper and in some cases the results have proved more dependable than those involving living animals?  For that reason alone, if not for other reasons, would the Minister not consider it necessary to ensure that a certain <Col N="1404" /> amount of the grant made available is used to pursue those techniques instead of using animals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree with the Deputy on that matter.  I do not think the economic considerations are relevant to the general observation of the proper rules.  If the Deputy would like I will send him a brief summary of the rules attaching to experiments on living animals under the Cruelty to Animals Act.  The Deputy will see from them that every precaution is taken to avoid cruel treatment of the animals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no power to make such an order.  The legislation governing these schemes empowers county borough councils, urban district councils <Col N="1408" /> and town commissioners to arrange for the provision of meals for school children attending national schools in their areas.  The schools in the Ballymun estate lie outside the Dublin County Borough area and do not come within the Dublin Corporation's school meals scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any intention of changing the provision which pertains to Ballymun schools? There are a large number of children attending these schools from inside the city area and they cannot get free meals.  Will the Minister try to rectify the injustice which the children are suffering on account of the bureaucracy which his Department is ultimately responsible for?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <P>Does the rule apply to the location of the school or to the children?  All these children live within the city boundaries.  The tenants of the Ballymun flats are all corporation tenants and I cannot therefore see the logic of saying that the children cannot get school meals.</P>

      <P>Fifty workers have been made redundant in this firm, the ownership of which has recently changed.  The firm has informed me that the redundancies are due to a reorganisation which involved transferring some processing work from Dublin to the firm's headquarters in the country.  I am also aware of a fall in the demand for the products made by the firm.  There are no prospects at present that any of the workers dismissed on redundancy will be re-employed by the firm.  Officers of the National Manpower Service will interview the workers and endeavour to find them other jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The PAYE system applies to employees irrespective of the level of their income and it would not be feasible to single out any group of State employees for inclusion in the scheme by reference to the amounts of their income.</P>
      <P>I should add that special legislation would be required to extend PAYE to State employees generally and there appears to be no substantial evidence of a desire on their part for inclusion in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that income tax paid by State employees is paid on their previous year's earnings they would in fact lose if they were put on PAYE.  The fact that earnings are known before the beginning of the tax year means that it should be possible for his Department to decide what deductions should be made from their wages for each week during the year and have those deductions made on a regular basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary what he says is certainly the commonly held view.  In regard to the second part I am not aware of any substantial difficulty in regard to the deductions which are made.  There are some occasions when there is a certain amount of difficulty but they form a very small percentage of the number of cases involved and they arise out of the circumstances of the particular individual concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the first part of my supplementary is correct and that the tax is collected on the previous year's income?  That is not a commonly held view; it is correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is advantageous for one year because if a fellow stops working in that particular year he does not get caught for the next year.  With regard to the other matter, is the <Col N="1411" /> Minister not aware that when the recent adjustment to wages took place in the Board of Works for some peculiar reason employees had as much as £7 and £8 deducted out of a week's earnings of £17?  Does he not consider that that calls for some type of change?</P>

    <P>Adult service is service rendered at 18 years of age or over.</P>
    <P>2.  The hours of attendance are such as may be fixed from time to time by the Minister for Finance.  At present they are fixed on the basis of a gross working week of 44 hours.</P>
    <P>3.  At the discretion of the head of the Department and subject to the exigencies of the Public Service and any Service regulation in regard to leave, annual leave will be allowed at the rate of 15 working days per annum. This leave is exclusive of the usual public holidays.</P>
    <P>4.  No sick pay is allowed during the first six months service (excluive of any periods of leave without pay). After six months continuous service and provided there is no evidence of permanent disability for service, sick leave on full pay (less appropriate deductions in respect of any disability benefits payable under the Social Welfare Acts) may be allowed up to a maximum of six weeks in any period of 12 months.  After 12 months continuous service, sick pay at full rate for up to nine weeks in any period of 12 months may be allowed.  The grant of sick leave, whether paid or unpaid, will be governed by any relevant regulations in force from time to time.</P>
    <P>5.  An officer may be required to wear uniform when on duty, but in the event of uniform not being supplied for any reason, he will not be eligible for any payment in lieu thereof.</P>
    <P>6.  The appointment is temporary and may be terminated at any time by one week's notice on either side and, in the event of misconduct, may be terminated without notice and without cause assigned.</P>
    <P>7.  The appointment is pensionable. (Details of the pension scheme are set out below.) The normal retiring age from the Civil Service is 65 but there is provision for retention beyond this age in certain circumstances.</P>

      <Col N="1413" />
      <i>Pension Scheme for Unestablished Messengers.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Membership:</i> Applies to full time unestablished messengers serving on or after 1 January, 1970.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Payment of pension:</i> A minimum of ten years service (five years for a Military Service Pensioner) is required to qualify for a pension and lump sum.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pension Age:</i> 70 years.  A member who retires or is required to retire on or after 65 years of age will, however, be eligible for a pension and lump sum.  In the case of Military Service Pensioners the pension age is extended to 75 years.  Where a person retires on ill-health the pension age does not apply.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Amount of award.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Pension:</i> 1/80th of pensionable pay for each year of reckonable service up to a maximum of 40/80ths. Pensionable pay means retiring pay less twice the rate of Social Welfare contributory old age or retirement pension, as appropriate, payable to a single man on the last day of reckonable service.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Lump sum:</i> 1/30th of pay for each year of reckonable service up to a maximum of 45/30ths.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Death benefit:</i> payable on death in service after at least five years reckonable service, is a year's pay or the appropriate retirement lump sum if greater.</P>
    <P>In the case of lump sum and death benefit no deduction is made from pay in respect of Social Welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Redundancy:</i> Pension and lump sum are awarded by reference to service reckonable on termination of employment.  Payment of pension is deferred to age 65 but the lump sum is payable at the time of discharge. In addition, pension is not payable until any weekly payments under the Redundancy Payments Act have ceased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Desmond's supplementary I think I have replied to the question, and with regard to Deputy French's supplementary the answer is, &ldquo;Yes, I am so aware&rdquo;.  In fact, I have seen a copy of a letter signed by the respective chairmen of the No. 2 and No. 4 branches of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union which was sent by them to the chairman of the company concerned.  In it they said:</P>
      <P>We have been instructed by the Members of the No. 2 and No. 4 Branches of the ITGWU attached to Murphy's Brewery to bring to your attention how much we deplore the irresponsible remarks made by Mr. Barry Desmond in the Dáil on Thursday, 28th October.</P>
      <P>We wish to disassociate ourselves completely from the sentiments expressed by Mr. Desmond and to assure you that we welcomed wholeheartedly the appointment of each of the new Directors.</P>
      <P>In our opinion, instead of trying to make cheap political capital out of this matter, Mr. Desmond would be better employed in encouraging his co-trade unionists in Cork to support local industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> If Deputy Desmond was in touch with the workers in Cork he would not have made that mistake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister by what stretch of imagination&mdash; whether concocted letters or otherwise &mdash;the composition of the board appointed by the Minister represents the workers' interests in this particular company in accordance with, I would inform the Minister, the policy of the National Executive Council of the ITGWU rather than inspired correspondence by Deputy French?</P>

It is clear from what I have said that the workers concerned believe that is so.  If Deputy Desmond does not believe it, it is simply further evidence that he and his colleagues are very much out of touch with the workers of the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the normal practice in all Government building contracts to require that, wherever practicable, materials of Irish manufacture are to be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not denying that what the Deputy says may be true in a particular case.  The requirements in Government contracts are quite specific regarding the provision of Irish-made products where they are available. In addition, on the matter of cost, there is preference given to Irish-made products so that with regard to competition from the point of view of price there is an advantage in favour of Irish-made products.  There may be cases where, despite both of these requirements, foreign-made products are used but the regulations are designed to try to avoid such use.</P>

      <P>This pool is being provided by a local group.  The proposal first came to the notice of my Department in 1967, when Offaly County Council applied for sanction for the raising of a loan of £20,000 which they proposed to contribute towards the cost of the pool.  The loan could not be sanctioned at that time because of other demands on capital funds and the council were informed to this effect.  I understand that subsequently the promoters went ahead with construction work but the plans <Col N="1430" /> of the pool were not submitted to my Department at that stage.</P>
      <P>In June, 1970, the capital position enabled me to approve of the making by Offaly County Council of the proposed contribution towards the cost of the pool, subject to clearance of the technical details.  Plans of the pool were received in my Department on the 11th May, 1971, and were approved on 10th June, subject to some changes affecting the superstructure.  Revised superstructure plans were received on the 21st September, 1971, and were approved on 26th October.  There was, therefore, no avoidable delay on the part of my Department in dealing with this proposal.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take the two questions together.</P>
      <P>As the two parties to this dispute&mdash; the Health Boards and the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union&mdash; failed to reach agreement at meetings of a Joint Industrial Council, the matters in dispute were referred to the Labour Court.  The court intend to investigate them on Monday next, the 15th of this month.  In these circumstances, it would be quite inappropriate that I should intervene.</P>
      <P>I very much regret that strike action was taken while the normal process of negotiations had not yet been fully completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should perhaps draw the attention of the House to the fact that the union have publicly stated that they proposed to provide a skeleton nursing service in <Col N="1432" /> each of the hospitals concerned sufficient to save patients from hardship. While some reports which have reached me would seem to indicate that the arrangements which the union made in some of the hospitals have been less than adequate, I sincerely hope that this was due to misunderstanding and that the Union will take immediate steps to honour their undertaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the nurses and their negotiating union have shown extraordinary patience in this matter in so far as some of the grievances go back as far as 1959?  Is the Minister not aware that the unions are prepared to negotiate on either of the two outstanding major grievances&mdash;the temporary appointments or the promotions question?  Is he aware that they are prepared to negotiate on the question of promotion either on the document submitted by them, which is known as the Cavan/Monaghan Agreement of which, I understand, the Minister approves but which the CEO's have failed to accept; or on the ten points put forward recently by Mr. Mulvihill on behalf of the management if the first of the ten points, which deals with the question of promotion, is not made a precondition to negotiating on the other nine points?  Alternatively, they are prepared to negotiate on the matter of temporary appointments only, which concerns approximately 1,000 persons and which is the other major source of grievance with the nurses.  In view of the grave hardship imposed on patients and also on the nurses who are on strike, may I ask the Minister whether he would be prepared not to wait for the Labour Court hearing on Monday but that he would make a decision in respect of any of these three proposals put forward here and allow the nurses to go back to work while useful negotiations could recommence between management and the nurses?</P>

      <P>I expect the unions to permit drugs to be made available to patients.  I should think it would be frightful if they did not do so.  So far as I know, in most mental hospitals adequate drugs and medical attention are being made available to deranged patients.  If there is any exception to that it is the duty of the unions, from the purely humane point of view, to permit the skeleton services to operate.  These services include the provision of food, drugs, medicine and fuel to the patients, particularly to those patients who require drugs and medicines urgently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Labour Court intend to investigate all aspects of the matter.</P>
      <P>I should inform the House that there are other matters of which the Deputies may not be aware.  Members may not be aware that negotiations take place between two unions and separately with another union in regard to the question of promotion, permanency and other matters.  At the moment one union is in dispute and has declared a strike.  Another union is not in dispute in regard to these matters.  Another union has given strike notice which will not expire until 19th November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are complexities in relation to these negotiations about which the House may not be aware.  The unions are not all in agreement about the claims being made.  That is a further complication for the chief executive <Col N="1434" /> officers and the arbitration official appointed to deal with the matters between the chief executive officers and the union.  The right to permanency in relation to a number of posts has been accepted.  I asked that agreement to this should be expedited but for the last 13 years this matter has always been linked with the question of the method of promotion on which the county managers and later the chief executive officers have always said that promotion should at least be similar to that to be found among nurses in general hospitals.  It is the linking of these two problems&mdash;the permanency of posts and the promotions&mdash;which are to be investigated by the Labour Court on the 15th November.  It is my hope that they will make a proposal which can be accepted by the unions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be certain about the legal position regarding that, but evidently they have taken the same point of view.  There is no change in the connection which has always existed between the permanency of these posts and the method of promotion.  I want to say again that Members of the House know perfectly well that I have intervened on some occasions when I felt that the authority concerned in the determination of wages and conditions should be speeded up or that regard should be had to special features concerning the dispute.  I have asked chief executive officers to expedite the examination of permanency of posts.  I believe that in an industrial dispute in the arena of sick or mentally infirm <Col N="1435" /> persons strike action should not be taken until all the resources of conciliation and settlement have been utilised. Strike action should very rarely be taken under these circumstances.  The Labour Court are holding an open hearing on the 15th November.  I trust that these matters can be settled then between the CEOs and the unions.  It would appear that in some mental hospitals drugs are not being allowed to reach the patients.  I hope that the union concerned will ensure that their members observe the clear conditions which have been pre-stated in this regard.  The only alternative will be, if old, infirm and mentally handicapped persons are suffering, to have volunteers looking after these patients for humane reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Today is Tuesday. Nothing will happen until next Monday. Does the Minister not appreciate the significance of Deputy O'Connell's interjection stating that there could be serious consequences for individuals because of the inadequacy of the staff at present available as a result of this dispute?  In relation to the question of skeleton staff, is it not a fact that the members of the nursing staff were so anxious to see that an adequate skeleton staff were provided that practically all of them volunteered for service in St. Brendan's Hospital?  If they were all permitted to take part there would be no strike, so the union asked that they might be able to define the type of skeleton staff to be maintained. This was rejected by the authorities at St. Brendan's.  Further, does the Minister realise that if the transport union are as anxious as the Minister to see that the minimum hardship should be caused they can appeal to congress, if they wish to do so and can ask for the support of the Workers' Union, the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union, and the Irish Medical Union, and can bring services completely to a halt?  It is in sympathy with their role as nurses that they have failed to do this until now.  Will the Minister not take action to see that his own ten points are reconsidered as a basis for negotiation, less the one point which <Col N="1436" /> he knows refers to the question of promotion and which is already the subject of consideration by a working party who are to advise the Minister and will not report until the end of the year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to implement, with effect from 1st March next, the proposals for a value added tax to replace the existing wholesale tax and turnover tax.</P>
      <P>Before describing the main provisions of the Bill, I shall refer briefly to the development of sales taxation in this country and indicate the reasons for changing over to a value added tax.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the sales taxes to this country&mdash;the turnover tax in 1963, followed by the wholesale tax in 1966&mdash;was one of the most significant measures in the tax field in recent years.  The increased revenue generated by these taxes has helped to finance the acceleration of the economic and social development which has taken place during the last decade.  In 1964-65, the first full year of its operation, the turnover tax yielded £13½ million, equal to about 6 per cent of total Government revenue. This year, the sales taxes combined are expected to produce about £80 million, or up to 14½ per cent of total Government revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present sales taxes are relatively simple to operate and economical to administer.  They were introduced in order to provide a broader base for indirect taxation than had been afforded by the traditional sources&mdash; mainly tobacco, beer, spirits and hydrocarbon oils&mdash;which had, up to then, provided the bulk of indirect tax revenue.  In 1962-63, the year before turnover tax was introduced, <Col N="1439" /> receipts from this narrow base accounted for over 40 per cent of total Government revenue and there was a growing danger that the Exchequer's finances could be seriously upset by a sudden fall in the yield from any of these commodities.  The turnover tax, on the other hand, applies to almost the whole range of consumer goods and services at the retail level and, since 1st May, 1970, is charged at the rate of 5 per cent on the price inclusive of tax.</P>
    <P>The selective wholesale tax was introduced in 1966 in order to give greater flexibility and a degree of progression to the system.  It does not apply, for example, to the necessaries of life such as food, fuel, clothing and medicines or to services.  The rate applicable as from 1st January, 1969, was 10 per cent on tax-inclusive wholesale prices.  However, in May, 1969, a further degree of progression was introduced by increasing to 15 per cent the rate for a narrow range of less essential items such as motor cars, television sets and yachts.  With effect from 1st November, 1970, this rate was raised to 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>While compliance by traders in the operation of these taxes has generally been very good the fact that such a large amount of revenue is now involved has raised doubts about the adequacy of the relatively simple administrative machinery of these taxes, and the Government have been considering for some time what improvements in the collection machinery could be introduced.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest disadvantages of sales taxes such as our wholesale and turnover taxes, is that the duty of paying tax to the Revenue falls on one section of the business economy only.  The value added tax, on the other hand, has, as its principal feature, the spreading of the tax over the whole process of production and distribution.  We were also aware that the European Economic Community has prescribed a common form of value added taxation for adoption by all member States and that, as members, we would be expected to introduce a similar type of tax in due course.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1440" /> The form of value added tax designed by the EEC and incorporated in two directives on the subject issued in April, 1967, was aimed at eliminating those features of existing turnover taxes in the Community which were acting as a barrier to the full implementation of the Treaty of Rome.  All the EEC countries have now adopted sales tax systems based on these directives with the exception of Italy which is due to make the changeover next year.  Among the three countries, apart from Ireland, that have applied for membership of EEC, Norway and Denmark already have a value added tax on the general lines of the EEC model and the United Kingdom has announced that it intends to adopt a value added tax as from April, 1973, in replacement of the existing purchase tax and selective employment tax.</P>
    <P>Apart from the EEC aspect the Government are satisfied that the value added tax is the form of sales taxation most suited to our needs and I shall now refer to its main advantages for us. First, with a minimum of disturbance to the existing incidence of taxation and to prices, payment of the tax can be spread over a wider sector of the business community than at present. The tax proposals represent little more than a change in the method of collection and their incidence and impact on prices should be broadly similar to the incidence and impact of the present sales taxes.</P>
    <P>Secondly, value added tax makes evasion less rewarding than does a single stage system, as the tax, as I have already stated, will be applied at all stages of production and distribution and the fractional amount which has to be paid at each stage is small thus reducing the incentive to evade liability.  Evasion will also be more difficult as the system provides a cross-check by means of the invoices which will be required for all sales between accountable persons.  As the amounts shown on these invoices will enter into the calculation of the tax liability of both the seller and the buyer it will be in the interests of both parties to ensure that correct amounts are shown. Anything that makes for better compliance is in the interest of the general body of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1441" /> Thirdly, the changeover will remove almost completely what little double taxation exists in the present system.</P>
    <P>For instance, while wholesale tax is at present borne by a firm on such requirements as office furniture and certain building materials, under the value added tax double taxation of this nature, which, in total, is estimated at £3.5 million a year, will be eliminated. Value added tax on these items, in common with virtually all other such tax charged to a firm by means of invoices, will be deductible against the firm's own liability to value added tax on its sales.</P>
    <P>The Bill follows, with certain modifications which I will refer to later, the general scheme of proposals set out in the White Paper published last March. It provides for a general sales tax to be charged at all stages of production and distribution at rates which correspond as closely as possible to the effective rates of sales tax at present in force.  The present sales taxes are chargeable on the price of an article including the addition made from tax. The rates of value added tax are, by contrast, to be applied to the price before tax, so that, if the same amount of tax is to be collected as before, the nominal rates of the new tax must be somewhat higher than the existing rates.</P>
    <P>This is the reason why the rates proposed in the Bill are 5.26 per cent, 16.37 per cent, 30.26 per cent and a special rate of 11.11 per cent for dances compared with the present rates of 5 per cent plus 10 per cent and 5 per cent plus 20 per cent respectively, and in the case of dances 10 per cent.  Exports will be completely free from the tax.  This will be achieved by applying what is described as a zero rate to exports and by refunding any tax charged at an earlier stage prior to export.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, firms whether manufacturers, wholesalers or retailers will pay tax on their sales, but in doing so can deduct the prior stage tax which they have been charged on their purchases.  Thus, although tax is charged a number of times before the goods reach the final consumer it is borne only once and so no duplication occurs.  A corresponding tax will be levied on imports to put them in the <Col N="1442" /> same position as home-produced goods.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides special arrangements for the agricultural sector whereby farmers and fishermen will not be obliged to register unless engaged in specialist activities such as market gardening, the commercial production of poultry or eggs or fish farming. Those who remain outside the system will not have to pay tax on their sales or to keep detailed records.  Such farmers will not, of course, be entitled to a refund of tax on their farm inputs, such as seeds and fertilisers, but they will be compensated for the tax element involved by increasing appropriately the selling price of their produce. This special addition to the price can be claimed as a tax credit by a registered purchaser against his liability on his own sales.  This tax credit will be at the flat rate of 3.85 per cent of the tax-inclusive price in the case of pigs and 2.68 per cent of the tax-inclusive price in the case of other agricultural and fishery produce.</P>
    <P>These rates of credit are calculated to be sufficient to recoup the average farmer for the value added tax which he will have borne on his purchases.  There have been numerous representations from farming interests to have farmers' raw materials exempted entirely from tax.  I have examined this matter very carefully but I regret that it has been found impracticable to proceed on that basis.  The arrangements I have now outlined are the best that can be devised to protect the farmers' interests, and I may add that I am seeking power in the Bill to vary the flat rates by order from time to time so as to keep them realistic.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains special provisions for the building sector and for small businesses which I will describe when dealing with the principal provisions of the Bill later.</P>
    <P>Since the publication last March of the White Paper, which invited the views of interested parties, representations have been received from over 200 bodies representing all aspects of agriculture, trade and commerce.  Following consideration of these representations certain changes have been made in the original proposals and these have been incorporated in <Col N="1443" /> the Bill now before the House.  The change of most general application is the deferring of the proposed date of commencement of the tax from 1st January to 1st March next so as to allow traders time to prepare their accounting systems for the tax.</P>
    <P>Other important changes are the reduction of the proposed rate of tax on newspapers and periodicals from 16.37 per cent to 5.26 per cent and the extension of the exemption for public transport to cover all passenger transport, including short-term car hire.</P>
    <P>The concession to the newspaper industry was made in recognition of the special difficulties being faced by that industry at present and in order to safeguard employment.  I am very conscious of the important place which the newspapers, and especially the provincial papers, have to play in the social, cultural and economic life of local communities.  The relief now granted will be of substantial benefit to them in overcoming their difficulties. The exemption of all passenger transport, including car hire, will continue the position which applies under the present sales taxes whereby passenger transport is not subject to tax.  It was inferred from the White Paper that transport other than public transport of passengers would attract tax but I want to make it clear that this is not the intention.</P>
    <P>A further modification of the White Paper proposals is the provision in the Bill of a method whereby cattle marts and cattle dealers will be relieved of accountability on their sales of livestock where they opt for arrangements analogous to the simplified scheme applicable to farmers to which I have already referred.  The mart or dealer will be entitled to pass on the appropriate flat rate credit to a registered purchaser.</P>
    <P>Another change from the White Paper to which I would like to draw attention relates to auctioneers.  The White Paper envisaged that goods sold by auction would be regarded as delivered to and subsequently by the auctioneer who would be accountable for tax.  It is now proposed that the <Col N="1444" /> auctioneer should be regarded merely as the seller's agent and, further, his commission will be exempt from tax because it will, in any event, be included in the sale price and, therefore, taxable where appropriate.</P>
    <P>This arrangement will not, however, apply to vegetables, fruit, flowers, poultry, eggs and fish sold by auction because of special conditions in these markets where the auctioneer is often also a dealer.  In these cases the auctioneer will be regarded as a purchaser of the goods for resale.</P>
    <P>Dances are at present subject to a special turnover tax rate of 10 per cent on tax-inclusive receipts, equivalent to 11.11 per cent on a tax-exclusive base. In order not to disturb this position a special rate of value added tax of 11.11 per cent applicable to dances only, has been introduced.  As this special rate will not affect the great majority of traders the value added tax remains, in essence, a three rate tax. Indeed, it is expected that, in practice, no trader will be concerned with more than two rates at the same time.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been drafted to conform, as far as possible, to the directives of the EEC.  These directives do not lay down standard rates for the tax and, in other matters also, permit of a degree of flexibility in the systems to be adopted nationally.  It may be found that some minor modifications to our system will be required to bring it fully into line with the EEC directives. The Community have agreed to our request for a transitional period of one year from the date of accession in order to effect any necessary changes.</P>
    <P>It has been stated in the Press and elsewhere that the value added tax has resulted in severe inflation in the Continental countries which have adopted it and that similar results may be expected here.  I should like to emphasise again that what we are doing is limited almost entirely to a change in the method of collecting tax. All of the countries which had unhappy experiences on the change-over were attempting to do much more.  In some cases, the incidence of the tax being replaced was being substantially altered.  For example, the rate of tax <Col N="1445" /> on food, which in some cases was very low or non-existent, was generally raised to 5 per cent or over.  In other cases, the value added tax was being used to increase substantially the revenue from indirect taxation as part of a general tax reform.  In our case the change-over will not significantly affect the revenue and, as I have already indicated, the incidence of tax will broadly remain unchanged.  There will, therefore, be no ground for an increase in prices generally, though there may be some minor changes, which will balance out in the aggregate, because of the fact that it is not possible to ensure precise alignment at all points between the old and the new systems.  The relief from the double taxation existing in the present system, to which I have referred already, will accrue to manufacturers and distributors and should help to counteract any tendency for prices to rise at the retail level.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill contains a detailed description of the various provisions. It will suffice, therefore, if I limit my remarks to the more important sections.</P>
    <P>Section 2 imposes the charge to value added tax.  With effect from 1st March, 1972, in general, deliveries of goods and rendering of services within the State will be liable.  Tax will also be charged on imports of goods into the State so as to equate the treatment of home and foreign goods.  Under section 15 (2), however, persons who are registered for the tax will not, subject to certain limited exceptions, have to pay tax on imports for the purpose of their business because such persons would, in any case, be entitled to a credit or refund of tax at the end of the month.</P>
    <P>Section 3 defines deliveries of goods to include the transfer of ownership of goods in pursuance of an agreement or contract, whether or not accompanied by a transfer of possession.  In the interest of securing the revenue, it is also provided that certain other transactions will constitute taxable deliveries.  The most important of these is the handing over of possession of goods under a hire purchase contract.  It is also necessary <Col N="1446" /> to tax, for example, goods appropriated from his business stock by a registered person for the personal use of himself or another.</P>
    <P>Section 4 contains special provisions applicable to immovable goods such as land and buildings.  Building is at present exempt from the sales taxes but, as I have mentioned already, certain building materials bear turnover and wholesale tax.  These are estimated to amount to about 3 per cent of the cost of a building.  Under the value added tax certain buildings will be brought into charge.  Briefly, it is provided that value added tax will not affect land, or buildings which are already in existence, no matter to whom or by whom they are sold, unless and until major building, re-building or demolition work, constituting a development, is carried out after 1st March next. When this happens, for example, if a house or factory is built and sold after that date, tax will be chargeable at the 5.26 per cent rate.  However, by virtue of section 10, only 60 per cent of the price will be charged so that the effective tax on buildings will remain at what it is at present&mdash;about 3 per cent. Sales of secondhand buildings will not be taxed, except where the seller is a registered person who obtained a tax credit when he acquired the building.</P>
    <P>A sale of immovable goods will be deemed to take place when an interest in them is transferred for a period of ten years or more.  Transfers of less than ten years duration will not normally be taxable as sales.  Where building work is carried out on behalf of a registered person such as a manufacturer or shopkeeper the new system will result in significant relief because, whereas no allowance is given at present for the wholesale and turnover taxes payable on materials used in the construction of factories and business premises, under value added tax full credit will be allowed for the tax charged to a registered person.</P>
    <P>Rents will continue to be exempt from tax unless the landlord elects to become registered and be accountable for tax on his rents.  He might wish to make this election if, for example, he rented office buildings to registered persons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> Section 5 defines the rendering of services in very wide terms to cover all business activities other than the delivery of goods.  Provision is also made for taxing services rendered by a person for the purposes of his own exempt business, where the service would be taxed if rendered to him by another person.</P>
    <P>Section 6 and the First Schedule provide a list of activities which will be exempt from the tax.  Persons engaged in such activities will bear tax on their purchases but will not have to pay tax on their sales.  Of the services which are exempted from turnover tax at present, those affecting the ordinary consumer, such as banking, insurance, governmental, medical and educational services, will remain exempt from the value added tax.  I will have power, as at present, to extend by order the list of exempted activities.</P>
    <P>Section 10 defines the amount on which tax is chargeable as, normally, the amount of the full consideration which becomes receivable excluding value added tax while, under section 19, tax becomes due usually on the issue of the invoice in the normal course.  There are various exceptions to these rules.  The most important is that registered persons who deal mostly with unregistered customers will be allowed, under section 14, to account for tax on the basis of cash receipts.  Where the transactions are services, the cash basis may apply even if the customers are registered.</P>
    <P>As part of the general arrangements for the livestock trade, section 10 also provides that where livestock is sold by registered farmers or registered dealers the tax will be charged only on a specified fraction of the sale price.  As a result of this arrangement livestock will have the same element of tax built into the sale price irrespective of whether the seller is registered or not.</P>
    <P>The provisions for agriculture are contained in sections 8 and 13.  As I have already explained, farmers and fishermen, with certain exceptions, need not come into the system unless they so wish and similar facilities are <Col N="1448" /> being provided for cattle marts and cattle dealers.  Section 13 enables farmers who remain outside the tax system to recover the tax borne on their inputs by issuing sales invoices which will rank for credit at the next stage.  The invoices must be made out by the purchaser and the farmer's only obligation will be to sign them on request.</P>
    <P>Section 8, which defines the persons accountable for tax, provides also that small traders will not have to pay tax on their sales or keep records unless they elect to be accountable.  The figures of turnover at which persons are obliged to register under the present sales tax system have been maintained as far as possible, but, because the 16.37 per cent rate will apply down to the retail level, it has been necessary to reduce the limit for traders, where more than 50 per cent of their goods are liable to that rate, from £1,000 turnover per month to £500 per month.  Conversely, the existing limit of £150 turnover per month for traders who purchase their supplies directly from unregistered producers, such as farmers and fishermen, is being raised to £500.  Under value added tax all inputs of such producers will have borne tax already, whereas at present they are largely exempt. The present £150 turnover limit for persons providing services, such as hairdressers, will continue.</P>
    <P>Section 11 prescribes the rates of value added tax.  The 5.26 per cent rate applies to the goods and services listed in the Third Schedule.  These are, mainly, food, drink clothing, fuel, medicine, books newspapers, building materials, agricultural goods, buildings and services.  Most of them are already charged at the equivalent rate under the present system.  The 30.26 per cent rate applies to the limited range of goods specified in the Fourth Schedule &mdash;mainly motor cars, television sets, caravans and yachts, which are at present liable to turnover tax and the higher&mdash;20 per cent&mdash;rate of wholesale tax.  Because of the problems attached to applying such a high rate at the retail stage the 30.26 per cent rate will be collected at the manufacturing <Col N="1449" /> and import stages only.  Subsequent sales of these goods at the wholesale or retail level will be charged at 5.26 per cent.  The difference between these two rates, that is 25 per cent, will be trapped in the price of the goods by reason of the fact that deduction of prior stage tax on them by wholesalers and retailers will be limited to 5.26 per cent.  As this proposal follows closely the present arrangements there will be no increase in the burden of tax on these goods.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the special rate of 11.11 per cent for dances.  This rate will also apply, as at present, to the charge for food and drink included in the admission price.  The rate of 16.37 per cent applies to the sale of all goods not specifically charged at one of the rates already mentioned.</P>
    <P>In the case of the hiring of goods the rate of tax applicable will, with minor exceptions, be the rate that would apply if the same goods were sold outright.</P>
    <P>A rate of zero per cent applies to exports of goods and to certain related services set out in the Second Schedule. The effect of a zero rate is to exempt the transaction from liability to tax and to enable all prior stage tax to be refunded.  Exporters will, therefore, get back all tax which is charged to them on their purchases.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains administrative and enforcement machinery for assessing, accounting for, and passing on the tax by means of invoices and enables the Revenue Commissioners to make regulations for the purpose of implementing the Act.  In particular, I should like to draw attention to the provision in section 32 under which the Revenue Commissioners are being empowered to accept estimates of the amount of tax payable.  This should prove helpful to the many traders selling goods some of which will be taxable at 5.26 per cent and some at 16.37 per cent, who may not find it practicable to keep precise separate records of their sales under the two different rates.</P>
    <P>Section 34 authorises a tax credit or refund to traders in respect of the element of turnover and wholesale tax included in stock-in-trade held at the <Col N="1450" /> commencement of the value-added tax. Since value added tax will be chargeable when these stocks are sold, the credit is essential to prevent double taxation.  For this reason it will be necessary for such firms to take stock at the changeover date and submit a claim for credit or refund.  The amount of tax involved is estimated to be in the region of £1 million.</P>
    <P>My description of the Bill has had, of necessity, to be confined to the main features.  It is a complex and highly technical measure and there are a number of smaller matters which I have had to omit from my description. I will be glad, however, to deal with any points on which Deputies may require further information or clarification.</P>
    <P>In commending the Bill to the House for a Second Reading, I would like to state that, since the circulation of the Bill, a number of minor changes, principally of a drafting nature, have been found to be necessary for which I propose to introduce amendments on the Committee Stage.  Furthermore, the inclusion of section 40 relating to the excise duty on betting will, I understand, require a lengthening of the long title of the Bill.  As betting is not being brought within the scope of the value added tax the excise duty rate is being increased from 10 per cent to 15 per cent to compensate.  This will leave the incidence of tax on betting unchanged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that my party may decide not to vote against the Second Reading of this Bill is to be taken as an indication that we realise it is necessary to conform with legislation in the EEC as we approach accession. That does not, however, mean we approve of the Bill as presented to the House.  The Fine Gael Party will be considering in great detail what amendments they will put down either to exclude or include portions to the Bill or to change portions of the Bill giving different effects.  It may well be that when the discussion on the Second Reading is completed Fine Gael will be voting against many provisions in the Bill.  It is therefore with a degree of responsibility in relation to our present position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Common Market <Col N="1451" /> that this party is not voting against the Second Reading.</P>
      <P>The main question mark before this Bill was circulated was whether or not the opportunity would be taken to carry out a major change in the tax structure.  This was adverted to by the Minister's predecessor, who is now out of favour, in a speech in Sligo some time ago.  On that occasion he did not make it clear which side he was on but he adverted to that at some length and received considerable publicity for so doing.  The question facing us now that we have a selective method of indirect taxation as opposed to the blunt instrument of what was called selective wholesale and turnover taxes, is whether it would be better to collect a larger portion of our revenue by indirect taxation thereby making it possible to give the small income taxpayer an increase in his primary allowance. This would stop the anomaly of a working man having to pay direct tax at something around seven guineas. This has not been done and it is something that will have to be considered by my party between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>It is now quite clear the Minister's approach was that it was right not to make any serious change.  He produces, as an argument in favour of this Bill, the fact that there was no change in taxation at all and the effect of this Bill would be to avoid double taxation in certain cases&mdash;which if it does will be a good thing because it will remove an unfairness&mdash;but that in his opinion there would be no change in the effect of this Bill on taxation.  In other words, direct taxation will be just as it has been until the next budget and indirect taxation will be as it was under the special selective wholesale and turnover taxes or very similar to what it was before the introduction of this Bill and the replacement of these two taxes by the measures contained in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth is that there is a major change.  For the first time there is a direct tax on the raw materials of the agricultural industry.  I am aware the Minister points to a global replacement of this tax by a pay out but I do not <Col N="1452" /> believe this pay out will ever equal the various taxes that will be placed upon the input of farm goods such as fertilisers and seeds.  I do not believe the high production farmer will be in the position of not paying turnover tax or any type of indirect taxation on the input of his farming activities.</P>
    <P>It is true that the farmer who is using very little fertiliser and seeds may get as much back as he put in, but the high production farmer will not get back this money.  I am not certain that the amount that has been mentioned will reach the farmers' pockets.  I know the Government will be requested to pay this amount to those who are entitled to it, but I realise also the Government will be in a position of having to pay out to the manufacturers and purchasers the amount to which the farmers are entitled.</P>
    <P>I would direct the attention of the House to the complexities of the advisory committee in relation to flour and bread which sat for some months recently.  There would be tremendous difficulty in extracting a figure of 3.8 per cent, for example, and then telling them to pay the farmers that much extra when there were about 77 other figures also involved.  The people who made the recommendations did their best, but it is obvious to me that the amount which might have been meant for the farmers could be lost in the jumble of figures.</P>
    <P>In relation to the comments that there would not be a tax on cattle sales, it is obvious from reading the Minister's speech that there is such a tax. The registered dealers will be paying sums that will not go to the farmers. Although the farmer does not pay income tax, he pays rates on his house, and if he lives at a certain level of income he will pay hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of pounds by way of rates on his land.  If this is the farmer's way of paying a form of income tax, why can he not have the zero rate that was requested by the NFA and the IAOS, with which the Minister for Ariculture has close links?</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that all the requests made to him were impractical. I agree that in a complex Bill such as this many things may be impractical <Col N="1453" /> but if it is practical to give a zero rate with regard to goods for export&mdash;as set out in the Minister's speech&mdash;why is it not possible to adopt a similar course in relation to agricultural goods?  I do not understand why the other system was used if it was not for the purpose that it is desired for the first time to have taxation on the input into agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to turnover and wholesale tax and mentioned a figure of £40 million.  The Minister did not estimate how much he intends to get in the first year of operation of VAT.  I estimate that the figure will be far higher than that mentioned by the Minister for the last available year with regard to selective wholesale tax and turnover tax.  I suggest there is added taxation and in my opinion the statement made by the Minister that we will have the same tax is basically untrue.</P>
    <P>On a new house there will be a tax of 5.6 per cent; 5 per cent on the cost of the house, leaving the 0.6 per cent for profit.  The Minister has stated that the probable tax on a house under the previous system, where certain items were taxed and others were not taxed, was 3 per cent.  I do not agree with this. The degree of taxation at the moment varies for instance, on such factors as whether doors are made on the site or elsewhere and so on.  What the Minister has done after the infamous deed of his predecessor in putting a tax on housing&mdash;a tax that must stick in the gullet of every politician who has a social conscience&mdash;is that he has increased the tax on housing by applying the 5.6 per cent added value tax.  It is not possible to go into detail on this matter at this stage but I have no doubt that the tax on houses will be far greater than was applied previously.</P>
    <P>There are various items we all agree should be taxed.  Many luxury items should bear their rate of taxation, and in many cases higher rates should be applied in order to redistribute wealth and to provide the services that the poorer section of our community need urgently.</P>
    <P>To add 2½ per cent to the cost of a £4,000 house at the moment means an extra £100.  It is a modest house I am talking about, not meant for an executive <Col N="1454" /> who has taken unto himself a wife or for a man who has worked hard for 20 years.  I do not want to worry the House on this but I should like to say this measure, which could have been a selective approach to taxation, is being used as a blunt instrument for the convenience of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance. It does not mean that extra charges will be imposed in certain cases and reductions will be given in certain other cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that in all the countries where this tax is imposed the trouble occurred when there were changes in the rate of taxation.  I want to ask the House and the country&mdash;in the House we do not seem to be interested in this measure, except on this side&mdash;whether they are satisfied with the present level of taxation and with the manner in which it is imposed. Are they satisfied in relation to the selective wholesale tax which has become a blunt instrument of 20 per cent in every case?  I am not satisfied with it.</P>
    <P>If one were to accept that the same amount of revenue is required from this new source as was collected from the old, the right approach would be to change the level of taxation.  This is not being done: the Minister said that no changes would be made.  Our spokesman on finance will deal with that later.  All I want to say is that my party will not vote on the Second Stage of this measure but we will go into it in a very detailed fashion on Committee Stage; we will submit amendments and we will divide the House if we think it is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter on which all members of all parties can agree.  It is that this is a most complicated proposal which will be extremely difficult to explain not only to the country but to the Members of this House who must be interested in it whether they like it or not.  The Minister has told us he will replace two taxes, which we know are considered to be terribly unfair and hard on the ordinary people, with one tax which, in our opinion, will be a lot worse.  We have been told this is being done because <Col N="1455" /> of our imminent accession to the EEC with whose tax structures we must conform.</P>
      <P>This is a lot of nonsense, for a number of reasons.  First, if it is necessary to apply a value added tax in order to conform with the EEC, why has Italy not done so, and she has been a member for years?  The Italians will not apply this form of taxation until next year.  The second reason is that if the value added tax is so important why is there not a uniform system throughout the EEC?  Therefore, the suggestion that value added tax is a prerequisite of our entry to the EEC is just window dressing.  Personally I believe the question of our accession to the EEC is a lot further from us than members of the Government think.  Whether that is correct or not it is ludicrous to suggest that in 1972 we must introduce this tax although Italy, already years in the EEC, has not yet introduced it and Britain does not propose to do so until January, 1973.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not give any good reason or any documentation to suggest to us that this innovation is as important as he has tried to make out. Last year when he briefly mentioned value added tax I told him I did not think it was feasible to introduce it before January, 1972.  Now he has changed the date to 1st March, 1972. This seems to me to be a sign of an early Budget.  Otherwise I do not see why he should propose to change the entire taxation system during the operation of the present Budget which does not operate under such a system. He must have it in the back of his mind that if he is still there he will introduce a new Budget early after 1st March next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the turnover tax was introduced we were told by Fianna Fáil that it would not increase the cost of living, that prices would not suffer because of it.  We were described as being alarmists for suggesting otherwise.  We know what happened when the turnover tax was doubled and later when the wholesale tax was introduced.  On the introduction of both taxes we were <Col N="1456" /> promised they would not affect the cost of living, but the cost of living has gone up and up because of the Government's introduction of these taxes. Nobody would be foolish enough to suggest a Government could run a country without taxation but the least we could expect is a Government who would see that the taxes imposed would be fairly distributed.  Nobody can say that this has happened and the present example does not lend credence to the idea that the Government will change their minds in regard to this tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that approximately the same amount of taxation will be collected as was raised by turnover and wholesale taxes.  I do not think the Minister believes that anybody in the country believes this.  When the turnover tax was introduced the amount collected was relatively small but as time went on, mainly because the supervisors of the tax collectors&mdash; the shopkeepers are the tax collectors at the moment&mdash;became adept at the game, more and more taxes were collected from the people.  Today again we have the suggestion that this new tax will not force up prices.  We know that as time goes on more and more taxes will squeeze more and more money out of a people who are not able to pay.  As Deputy Donegan pointed out, a single man pays tax after earning a little more than £7 per week. That is direct taxation and now indirect taxation is being added to that. I wonder if the Minister would care to guess how much a person who earned £20 a week would pay by way of taxation, both direct taxation and tax on the goods he purchased.  This State is collecting more per head from the ordinary people by way of taxation than is any other State in western Europe and it is disgraceful that this should continue.  Here the Minister had a chance to try to redress the situation and to give some help to those who are being overtaxed.  Instead, he let the opportunity pass and took the opportunity of adding further to the burden by taking more out of already emptying pockets.</P>
    <P>The Minister expects congratulations <Col N="1457" /> on introducing a Bill that will be fair to everybody.  While the Minister must carry the responsibility for these measures, I wonder whether the people who advised him were serious when they suggested to people who were protesting about the way the tax was to be administered that there would not be much upset.  Does the Minister not know it is only now that people have got to know the proper way to operate the wholesale tax system which has been in operation for some time and the turnover tax which has been in operation, I think, since 1963?  Does he not understand that in February last when there was a change to decimal currency the cost of living was increased considerably?  People had to convert from the system of paying for goods and being paid for goods which they had operated for years; they had to add turnover tax, then double that tax, then add wholesale tax and then they had to adjust all their methods for the purpose of changing to decimal currency.  Can anyone blame them if they laugh cynically when they are told now that they must change their system again because a new form of tax is being introduced which they must learn to operate?</P>
    <P>At a symposium the other evening, a person representing the Government said that there would be very little extra difficulty in the operation of the new tax system and that people should not be complaining since it is all in a good cause.  Since then I have been endeavouring to find out what exactly that person was talking about.  At the back of the explanatory memorandum issued with the Bill I found many appendices which refer to the various ways the tax is to be operated.  The appendices begin with a ten-column document entitled &ldquo;Particulars for Registration&rdquo;.  This has many sub-columns which have peculiar references and which most people will find it very difficult to understand.  Following that there is one entitled VAT 2 which has five columns.  Then there is the gem in Appendix B.  This tells us to: &ldquo;See chapter 00 of the Guide to VAT for fuller instructions&rdquo; and these columns begin with Purchases for <Col N="1458" /> Resale, then the date under which are the words</P>
    <P>(For invoiced purchases, the date to be entered is the date of the invoice).</P>
    <P>The next column is headed Invoice Number under which is the note:</P>
    <P>(Traders should number the invoices received by them in consecutive order).</P>
    <P>The next column is headed Name of Supplier.  Then there are two sub-columns under a heading Goods liable at 5.26 per cent and these are Cost exclusive of value-added tax and Value-added tax.  The next column&mdash; Goods liable at 16.37 per cent also has two sub-columns.  One of these reads Cost exclusive of value-added tax and the other, Value-added tax.  Then there is a bigger column which has four sub-columns. This one is headed, Purchases from unregistered farmers and fishermen at tax inclusive prices.  The subheadings are Live Pigs, Gross Price and Tax Credit @ 3.85 per cent and, under the sub-heading Other agricultural and fishery goods, Gross prices and Tax Credit @ 2.68 per cent.  The next column is headed, Imports and has the two sub-columns, one for Value exclusive of value-added tax and the other for Value-added tax.  The last column on this appendix is headed Notes.  Every trader in the country is expected to understand this simple document as he was expected to understand previous instructions that were issued by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The next page of this appendix is entitled &ldquo;Sales&rdquo; and there is an instruction to &ldquo;See chapter 00 of the Guide to VAT for fuller instructions&rdquo;. Note, in particular, paragraph 00 regarding &ldquo;self deliveries&rdquo;. This page contains 12 columns.  Again, the first one is headed &ldquo;Date&rdquo;, the next one, Invoice Number and Purchaser. Under the main heading Sales and Services there are three columns. The first of these is headed Goods, <i>et cetera</i>, liable at 5.26 per cent; the second one is headed Goods, <i>et cetera</i>, liable at 16.37 per cent and the third reads, Other sales and services: exports at zero rate and exempt services. The columns under each of these <Col N="1459" /> sub-headings are: Consideration exclusive of value-added tax, Value-added tax, Insert &ldquo;S&rdquo; if a &ldquo;self delivery&rdquo;, Consideration exclusive of value-added tax, Value-added tax, Insert &ldquo;S&rdquo; if a &ldquo;Self delivery&rdquo;, Consideration, and State whether &ldquo;zero rate&rdquo; or &ldquo;exempt services&rdquo;.  The last column is headed Notes.  The chap who owns a shop will not have much left at the end of the week after he has paid an accountant to work that system out.  Very often a shopkeeper is left in the position of wondering whether it is the Government or his accountant or himself who owns the shop because he seems to get less out of it than anybody else.  Appendix C begins:</P>
    <P>No special form of invoice is prescribed for use in relation to value-added tax but an invoice must contain the following details:&mdash;</P>
    <P>date of invoice, name, address and registration number of supplier, description of goods or services, amounts of consideration, and rate and amount of tax payable on the total consideration for each tax category.</P>
    <P>An invoice must be issued by every accountable person in respect of every taxable transaction with any other accountable person.</P>
    <P>A copy of the invoice must be retained by the seller and the actual invoice must be retained by the purchaser for six years except where a lesser period is authorised by the inspector of taxes.</P>
    <P>In spite of all this people are being told not to worry because a good guess will be accepted by the Revenue Commissioners. I should like to see the day when the Revenue Commissioners will be prepared to accept a good guess from anybody.</P>
    <P>Appendix D must be the real gem of the lot.  I shall not bore the House with all the details that are involved here but I suggest that anybody who has not seen this already, should have a look at it now and if anybody can understand it, perhaps he would <Col N="1460" /> explain it to me.  Having studied it for some time, I have considerable difficulty in making anything of it.  There are plenty of notes on the reverse side as if everybody in the country knew how to deal with such matters as import and export documents.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the types of documents that will have to be kept by traders.  The person representing the Government at the symposium to which I referred earlier said that, perhaps only ½ per cent would be added to costs in keeping these records.  I wonder where that gentleman gets his bargains from because I do not think the particular firm he represents would be able to carry an extra ½ per cent.  These, then, are the sort of proposals contained in the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan said that, while his party were opposed to certain sections of it, he could not say whether or not they would vote against the Second Reading of the Bill.  We are in the position that, so far, no clear advice has been given by the Minister or anybody else as to what is proposed to be done with the Bill.  The Bill as proposed to us, the booklet which was issued several months ago and which is now being changed, and the documents issued only make the matter more complicated.  I suggest to the Minister that if he wants this Bill to have an easy passage through the House&mdash;and as of now I do not propose to give it an easy passage unless we can be persuaded that it does not do the things which we think it does &mdash;he must when replying give us a better explanation of it than he gave us when introducing this Bill.  Otherwise, there is a pile of trouble awaiting him.  The Minister may be forced to defer the commencement of the operation of this Bill until 1st March, 1973, because it will not have passed through the House before that date.</P>
    <P>It is ludicrous that we should have such a Bill introduced in this House with a bogus backing stating that it is for the purpose of qualifying us for entry to Europe.  Europe does not seem to be in a hurry to have us, nor we to enter Europe, if one is to judge by the terms offered in relation to our fishing industry and other matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1461" /> Even if we are put into the position where we have to go into Europe, will the Minister tell us whether this is a prerequisite?  Is it not true that the taxes which we have now would be acceptable in Europe?  Is it not true that no one is forcing us to change? The only reason why this Bill is being rushed through is because the Government feel that this is another way of picking up extra taxation.  The Government feel that they can say that this extra taxation is being collected by accident.</P>
    <P>A tax of 30.26 per cent is suggested for luxuries.  Every time I hear of taxation on luxuries I remember the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy B. Lenihan, mentioning the tax on fur coats, diamond rings and expensive motor cars in his by-election speeches some years ago before the introduction of turnover tax.  Will the Minister for Finance suggest a tax on shoes and overcoats as if they were luxuries?  That is what happened after the introduction of turnover tax.  To twist Deputy P.J. Burke's statement a little, strange things have happened in our time under the present Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good point. Provision is made for pet foods which are not included for taxation purposes in this Bill.  Human medicines are included under the Bill.  Animal foods and medicines are excluded.  The Minister should have another look at this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister speaks about a three-tier system in the tax.  There are more than three tiers.  We can count &ldquo;zero&rdquo; as a fourth tier and we have another tier, which makes it a five-tier system. I do not know how the Minister proposes to have this system supervised or operated.  I do not know how the system is worked out.  It is suggested that the 30.2 per cent tax can be applied at retail level.  The Minister must have some evidence which led him to this decision.  Perhaps the Minister will let us know how the <Col N="1462" /> system should work.  The bogus taxation system at present in operation where 11.11 per cent wholesale tax is in-built into the cheap soap-powders on sale all over the country, and which the unfortunate housewives do not know they are paying, is to be continued in order to make up the 16.37 per cent tax.  There is then the extra 5.26 per cent.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest crimes which is being committed under this Bill is to suggest that the 16.37 per cent should be added on at shelf level.  Perhaps the Minister is not aware that this is the advice given to the retail grocers and traders.  If someone buys an item costing less than ten new pence and the tax is added on at shelf level the smallest unit of currency at present being one half new penny, this addition on something costing less than ten new pence results in a heavy tax.  If someone buys ten different items which cost less than ten new pence and pays one half new penny on each item he is paying excessive tax.  Do not let us have the Minister appealing to traders not to charge tax on one item while charging it on some other item.  The Minister's advisers have already told him that all items must be taxed.  When decimal currency was being introduced traders were advised to have the extra half penny added on to one item and knocked off another item.  We know the result of that advice.  An item of which perhaps five were sold had the half penny taken off while the half penny was added on to the items which were sold at the rate of 1,000 per day. The Minister is making arrangements to have this tax added on to every item.  The housewife will not be able to collect all her items and go to the checkpoint and have the tax added on. Tax must be paid on each item.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are on record as having told the RGDATA that that is the way they must do it. New taxes will be imposed and we are told there will be no increase in the cost of living.  I do not know what gimmicks will be introduced for the purpose of levelling off.  In this country we have been over-anxious to try out new ideas on the long-suffering public. There seems to be an idea that the taxpayer <Col N="1463" /> is fair game.  Those who drew up this Bill are not in the habit of fraternising with people with a small amount of money to spend.  I meet these people and I know how they feel when they go into a shop with that 50p piece to buy some items.  Sometimes they have to return items to the shelves because they are unable to pay for them at the check-out.  Any further inroads into that 50p piece will be resented and objected to very strongly by everybody concerned.  It is ridiculous that this sort of thing should be encouraged by the Government of the day, no matter what that Government may be.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been made by some of the people concerned that perhaps it would be easier to deal with this tax if we had it as a three-tier or a two-tier tax.  It has been suggested that leaving the 30.26 per cent tax on higher cost luxury items and replacing the other two with one which might be slightly more than 5.26 per cent might be a good idea.  I do not know.  I have not got the opportunity the Minister has of working out what that would cost.  The people concerned estimate that it would not cost the person buying goods very much more.  It would be a help because if taxation is being added on at shelf prices, and if those who are marking up the prices are not well acquainted with finance, as very often occurs, it could happen that items which should be marked up at the lower price of 5.26 per cent would finish up by being marked at 16.37 per cent.  Therefore a very substantial amount could be added on accidentally.</P>
    <P>Do not forget that the people sitting behind the adding machines in the retail stores and the people who go around with the stickers putting them on the packages have not all got degrees as doctors of economics. Therefore, they might not be able to work out the exact prices or the exact points.  They might not even recognise the difference, for tax purposes, between one grade of goods and another.  If this were not so serious it could be considered to be a joke&mdash;a bad joke, I grant you.  It is serious, particularly as it is generally believed that, with the new arrangement which <Col N="1464" /> the Minister is making for the purpose of collecting tax on all items, and the arrangement which the Minister is making to ensure that nobody escapes the net, as some people do at present, a very much higher amount of tax will be collected than is being collected at present.  Some people go so far as to say that the amount will be more than doubled.</P>
    <P>It amuses me when I hear the Minister trying to explain that because of the fact that the first tax will be put on the person who is wholesaling the goods, there will not be so much tax to be collected from or paid by the person who is retailing the goods; that the amount will be small.  The Minister said it would be a relatively small amount. Does he understand that it does not matter who pays the first tax?  The retailer, the final seller of the goods, will add on all the tax to the price of the article and ultimately the customer will pay the whole damn lot, as he always has to pay it.  Therefore he will not be gaining anything because of the fact that the first tax is added on at an earlier stage.  To him it is no longer tax but part and parcel of the price.</P>
    <P>The Minister must agree that it is terribly unfair that a person who wholesales goods or retails goods, whether or not he is paid for them, must pay shortly after the end of the month for anything sold in the previous month.  In Great Britain three months are allowed.  As I see it, this will result in people paying tax on goods which they have sold but for which they have not been paid and, in fact, paying tax on goods for which they may never be paid.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this is a very complicated Bill.  We will spend a lot of time on it on Committee Stage.  I do not want to go any further into the details of the Bill.  Whether we vote against all Stages of the Bill or some portions of the Bill depends on the answers which the Minister gives us when he is replying.  He can be assured that many of the 44 sections in the Bill will require drastic amendment before we will be prepared to go into the lobby to support them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been advertised for a long time.  We were aware that its introduction was contemplated and prepared for by the Minister and the Government.  I suppose any form of change in taxation, and certainly the introduction of a new tax, will be received in a very doubtful climate by those upon whom it is imposed. Obviously it would be the Minister's concern to introduce a value added tax at whatever was felt to be the best time for the economy. Therefore, it is a matter for surprise that it is brought in at this juncture. I am happy to be able to confess that I know very little about this tax but, from what I have read, I understand that in an inflationary situation a tax of this kind can be potentially dangerous. I do not know what view the Minister takes of the situation in the country at the moment.  It appears to me that we are either still in the process of inflation or just staggering out of it.  Last year we had a very intimidating increase in prices.  The rapid increase in prices was contributed to, although I am sure there will be strong official denials of this, by the change-over to decimalisation in February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly was. There is no doubt about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is the slightest doubt about that.  Why was this?  Amongst other things&mdash;no matter how often we may try to cod ourselves into thinking we have&mdash;we just have not got the kind of sophisticated price supervision and surveillance structure which is absolutely essential to deal with a change-over of that kind.  Decimalisation resulted in an increase in prices.  We are now facing another change-over, a change-over to a system of taxation which, I can see, is regarded as essential in Europe but which at the same time has been approached in European countries with the greatest care and the greatest reluctance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This taxation is a tax on consumption. I note that the Minister referred to our experience here in 1963 and 1966 in relation to the turnover and wholesale taxes.  He referred to the present sales taxes as being relatively <Col N="1466" /> simple to operate and economical to administer.  He went on to say that they had succeeded in generating an immense volume of new revenue.  That is perfectly true because these sales taxes made every shopkeeper, every businessman and everybody engaged in production in the economy a collector of taxes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>An unpaid collector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>An unpaid collector of taxes.  It was not an easy role for people to take on and to accept but that has been the position.  The result is that now, some years later, the Minister for Finance can say the present system is relatively simple to operate and economical to administer. Now it is proposed to replace these taxes by value added and value added, obviously, as anyone who attempts to read the White Paper and all the documentation involved in this legislation, apart altogether from the Bill, will appreciate straight away involves a tremendous system of accounting. People will be asked to accept a new system of taxation in the belief and in the hope that the net result at the end will be the same as the turnover tax and wholesale tax and in the belief also that there will not be an increase in prices.  I wonder is that so?  I should like to know from the Minister what steps will be taken to ensure that price increases will not take place under cover of the change in the taxation system.  I would regard an assurance in that respect as being the most urgent matter now in relation to the general consuming public.  What system, what machinery, will be introduced to prevent what has happened in the past recurring now over the entire economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this proposal there are five different rates each of which involves two decimal places and this, <i>prima facie,</i> seems to involve an undue complication in relation to the system of taxation.  The justification given for this is that the Government are undertaking to collect exactly the same amount under the new tax as is collected under the wholesale and turnover taxes but I doubt the necessity to <Col N="1467" /> have these five rates involving two decimal places in order to effect an exact conversion.  I would have thought that it should have been possible to round off the percentages and to simplify the structure in such a way that if you had the proper machinery and supervision, no individual prices would be significantly affected and, rounding off percentages in that way, you would still get the same overall revenue to the State.</P>
    <P>So, apart altogether from the lack of proper price supervision, the first criticism that I should like to offer is the unduly complicated nature of the rates of taxation and the five different headings.</P>
    <P>The next most serious grievance&mdash; and here I would agree with, I think it was Deputy Tully or perhaps it was Deputy Donegan&mdash;is the way in which the tax will have to be paid.  As I understand the Bill, it is provided that the tax will have to be paid within a month of the date of the transaction on which the particular tax is due.  This seems to involve a very serious injustice to many people concerned in the payment of tax.  They will be obliged to pay tax within the month from the transaction long before they have been paid by their own customers.  This would seem to involve that they will have to hand over to the Revenue Commissioners tax which they themselves have not yet received.  One knows that the majority &mdash;I am not saying all&mdash;of commercial transactions in this country are on a three-month or 90-day payment basis and, therefore, under the arrangement proposed, the majority of firms engaged in commercial transactions will, in effect, be lending the Revenue Commissioners, free of interest, for 60 days, money on which they themselves will probably have to be paying bank interest.  That seems to me to be unjustified.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that this same problem has been recognised elsewhere. In Britain, it is proposed to provide a 90-day period for payment.  I would suggest that this aspect certainly needs to be considered and perhaps we can consider it at a later Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" /> Another matter which was mentioned by Deputy Tully is the difficulty that will be involved for retailers in the differing rates of tax.  The position at the moment is that in grocers' and provision shops the charge for turnover tax is made at the checkout point.  Under the proposal in this Bill it will be necessary for all retailers to include the tax in the marked-up price of each item.</P>
    <P>This will involve a great deal of accounting and a great deal of difficulty, particularly in the case of low-priced items.  That is because the smallest amount by which it is possible to increase the price is one halfpenny. Here there will be very serious trouble. If the smallest price increase is one halfpenny more than the proper amount of tax in items under 10p, then there will be considerable difficulty. That is leaving aside what will be involved from a book-keeping point of view to small traders.</P>
    <P>I think they will find now that to carry out a proper conversion under this complicated system of taxation their present system of book-keeping will prove utterly inadequate.  That is all I want to say in relation to the general criticism of the Bill and it is subject to what I have said about a proper machinery for price supervision and price control.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the special position of farmers.  As Deputies are aware the National Farmers' Association have been critical of this entire proposal.  They have had discussions with the Minister and put forward counter-proposals but unfortunately no agreement has apparently been reached. This is intended to be a tax on consumption. The farmers, through the NFA, feel that it may have an impact on production and it is for that reason that they have advocated, in place of the proposals here, a zero tax for agriculture. Under the proposals in the Bill, as I understand them, taxes would be collected from farmers at the point of purchase of their inputs&mdash;fertiliser, seed and whatever else may be involved and at a later stage a corresponding amount would be repaid to farmers by means of a percentage addition at the point of sale of their produce or, in the <Col N="1469" /> case of livestock, at the point of final domestic sale.</P>
    <P>The idea that this percentage addition would compensate for the tax on input may be fair enough in theory but it is feared, and I think with justification, that any scheme of a flat rate addition must necessarily involve a compromise and that even if the total refund to agriculture is appropriate, that is appropriate to the tax involvement, there could be no guarantee that compensation for individual farmers or for individual enterprises would be adequate.  There can be no machinery whereby one could ensure that the compensation would be exactly equated in the individual case.</P>
    <P>It is in the light of considerations like these that the farming organisations feel that there should be a simpler method in relation to agriculture particularly at this juncture when it is so essential to have our agricultural industry producing at an accelerating rate.  They have put forward the idea of a zero rate.  I do not know whether a zero rate is looked on with favour from an EEC point of view but I think that it should be considered. The Minister rather brushed it away by saying that the proposals put forward on behalf of the NFA were not workable or something of that kind.  It appears to me that the detailed proprosals which the NFA have put forward in their document should receive from the Minister more patient consideration than he appears to have given to them.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that probably no time at which a new tax is introduced is ever regarded as suitable.  I have the strong feeling that this particular time for the introduction of this kind of taxation can well be disastrous. Obviously it is because of fears in this respect that the Minister has already agreed to postpone the date of impact from January to March.  I should like to see it postponed a great deal longer. I think we have a great distance to go before we can have our economy on any kind of a sound basis.  We have gone through a very bad period indeed with instability and insecurity coming from rising prices and dropping money <Col N="1470" /> values and I think at this stage and in the foreseeable future the introduction of any new tax on consumption which is going to affect the entire range of activities and sales throughout the economy can be highly dangerous unless there is available a sophisticated system of price surveillance and supervision to effect the conversion and the change.  As we all know we have not got that.  We could not even do it with decimalisation and there is certainly no evidence of any kind of fresh thinking to provide it now.</P>
    <P>While I can accept that in normal circumstances the principle of this form of taxation may be sound at this time I feel the introduction of this tax can be highly dangerous and I would urge that consideration be given to its postponement.  In fact, if I am in order, I would propose that the Second Reading be refused until such time as an adequate system of price surveillance and control is introduced.  I do not know whether it is possible to move such an amendment at this stage, possibly only with the Minister's consent. Is that the position, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle?  Perhaps I shall raise it later.</P>

      <P>This attempt by the Minister for Finance to bulldoze through this House this value-added tax at this time is a fraud.  It is unwarranted. There is certainly no demand for it.  Even Italy, which has been a number of years in the EEC, has not changed over to the value added system yet.  The Minister has not convinced me of the need to rush this through nor how this system has advantage over the system already in operation.</P>
      <P>In 1963 when this iniquitous turnover tax was being introduced the claim was made that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turnover taxation has many advantages over a system which taxes individual sales or commodities. It requires little record-keeping, can be calculated in one simple operation at the end of the selected period, can be readily adapted to <Col N="1471" /> the many different ways in which business is carried on and can be administered easily and economically.</P>
    <P>This is the introduction to the turnover tax outline of proposals published in May, 1963.  I believe those very words justify the retention of the present turnover and wholesale tax systems and further support my statement that there is no need for the introduction of this measure at this time.</P>
    <P>The economy has already suffered badly from the inflation which resulted from the change-over to decimalisation. I am not convinced by any platitudes from the Minister that prices are being kept under control.  Everyone knows there has been a tremendous increase in prices since decimal day. People were confused, confounded and tricked by decimalisation.  The half new penny is creating tremendous confusion.  When one compares the half new penny with the cent in America and the franc in France one realises we are at a tremendous disadvantage in having the smallest unit of currency as one half penny.  This is certainly responsible for the spiralling cost of living at the present time.  The Minister has done his utmost to make life complicated for people.  I was speaking to an accountant recently who said that Mr. Colley had certainly upset their lives and made it very complicated for them.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance, Mr. Colley, even though he did make a bid for leadership although I understand just today that he failed in his bid for leadership of the Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We found out today that the 5 per cent turnover tax is in fact a 5 odd per cent tax.  When I brought this to the attention of the Minister's predecessor he said I was wrong and that I did not understand but it was obvious from the figures mentioned of 11.11 per cent and 5.56 per cent that turnover tax was not 5 per cent but almost 6 per cent and when people bought goods they were not charged 5 per <Col N="1472" /> cent turnover tax, they were charged more.  This fact was nicely concealed for a long time.</P>
    <P>It was estimated that the cost of operating the original turnover tax would not exceed 1 per cent of the yield of the tax.  I should like the Minister to tell us what the administrative costs will be in the operation of value added tax because it extends over such a wide field that I am sure it will cost much more to operate than turnover tax does.  The Minister did not explain this in his statement today. If it is not for the purpose of bringing us into the EEC and if the Minister is as satisfied as he has stated with the present system which operates so easily, effectively and simply, why is he satisfied now that the value added tax system is the form of sale taxation most suited to our needs, as he stated today?  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The tax proposals represent little more than a change in the method of collection and their incidence and impact on prices should be broadly similar to the incidence and impact of the present sales taxes.</P>
    <P>These are vague, ambiguous words and they mean broadly that there will be no change but in actual fact the new tax system will mean a considerable increase in the cost of living.  The Minister will not stand up and deny that fact.  He does not say there will not be an increase, he says there will be a levelling up or a levelling down. We were fooled by that statement with regard to decimalisation and he is saying the same thing about the value added tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been inundated with requests to postpone introduction of the value added tax system.  If Britain is not going to adopt the value added tax system until 1973 I fail to see why we are in such a hurry.  People have not had ample opportunity to understand it, learn about it and make observations about it.  It would be a good idea if the Department were to explain to the public exactly how this system will work.  If we could see all the difficulties and defects of the Bill &mdash;which we shall not be able to correct once it becomes law&mdash;beforehand <Col N="1473" /> we might be able to come up with some changes, alterations or suggestions as to how the system might be operated more satisfactorily and more in the interests of the public.</P>
    <P>The system is being operated over the same range of goods as the turnover tax and the wholesale tax.  Products such as baby powder, toothpaste and medicated shampoo which are subject to wholesale tax will be taxed under the new system as well when in fact it is known that they are medical products needed for medical conditions and should be exempt from tax.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that small shopkeepers who are dependent on overdrafts will have to pay tax the following month whether or not they have sold their goods and this means their overdrafts will have to be extended.  This imposes a crippling burden on small shopkeepers who at the present time are facing tremendous competition from the big combines.  They will be further penalised by the requirement that they pay the tax within one month whether or not they have sold the goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann having regard to the manner in which Mr. J. Gibbons, now Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, misled the Dáil on 8th May, 1970, when he was Minister for Defence, is of opinion that his conduct was unworthy of a member of the Government and of a member of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this motion I should like to make it clear at the outset that I have no personal feeling whatever concerning the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  In fact, the character of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is not the issue in this motion.  It might be said that the duty of moving this motion is a responsibility I must discharge and which I shall do.  The issue is whether the Minister, when he was <Col N="1474" /> Minister for Defence, on 8th May, 1970, accurately informed the Dáil and the country about certain events.  The issue is whether his statement to the Dáil on that day stated accurately and fully the facts as he knew them or whether subsequent statements made by him in what is known as the Arms Trial in October, 1970, differed from the statements he made in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It is well-established practice and recognised procedure that a Minister in answering to the House and, through the House, to the country is obliged to state the facts and is not entitled to alter the form in which the facts are presented because of personal or political embarrassment.  Therefore, this motion must be considered apart from the personality or character of the Minister concerned&mdash;the former Minister for Defence and present Minister for Agriculture&mdash;or, for that matter, the personalities of Ministers or Deputies involved in certain events of 18 months ago.</P>
    <P>It is too facile to suggest that these events should be forgotten now.  Of course, it would be pleasant for some &mdash;maybe for all of us&mdash;to do so if one were to ignore the fact that statements made at the time in the Dáil and subsequent statements, to which I will refer, conflict about certain events which had then happened.</P>
    <P>Very briefly I shall recall to the Dáil certain statements contained in the Official Report dated 8th/9th May, 1970, Volume 246.  At column 838, Deputy Gibbons, then Minister for Defence, intervened and said he wished to refer to certain statements that had been made and to clarify some points. He stated:</P>
    <P>I have been informed that Mr. Patrick Kennedy, MP, in the course of a Radio Éireann interview, suggested that any participation by Captain James Kelly in an attempt to smuggle arms could only have been made with my knowledge and consent. I wish emphatically to deny any such knowledge or consent.  I was aware, through the Director of Intelligence, that attempts to smuggle arms were a constant danger and these attempts were kept under surveillance at all times.  I wish to <Col N="1475" /> say I discharged my duty to the full extent of my knowledge of the situation.</P>
    <P>Later, at column 841, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>There was some reference to the training of civilians in Donegal.  I want to point out the position of the Defence Forces in this regard.  The Defence Forces train only members of their own ranks, whether they be FCA or Army or Naval personnel. That is the extent of their training. This story first got currency in the <i>Protestant Telegraph</i>.  It is time that stories of this kind ceased.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to say on this matter.  There were certain matters which I wanted to clarify for the House at this stage and I have done so.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Arms Trial, in October, 1970, the Minister was asked a number of questions.  I do not wish to delay the House in reading all of that evidence.  Mr. McCarthy, one of the counsel, in the course of cross-examination quoted an extract from the Official Report of 8th May, 1970, and he said:</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan had also mentioned training which had been given in at least one camp to civilians.  Mr. McCarthy said that Mr. Gibbons had interrupted Deputy Ryan to say &ldquo;That is not true&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gibbons: No.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: They were not civilians?&mdash;They were fully attested members of the FCA.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: You intervened expressly because of allegations of your own implication?&mdash;Yes.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCarthy: And in the course of that did you say that there was some reference to the training of civilians in Donegal?&mdash;I wanted to point out that the Defence Forces trained only members of their own ranks.</P>
    <P>Was that telling the whole truth, Mr. Gibbons?&mdash;This was a declaration that the people who were trained in Dunree were members of the FCA and were duly attested as such.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> Do you think it was perhaps not telling the whole truth, that civilians from Derry, citizens of another State, were enrolled in the second line of the Defence Forces, the FCA, for the express purpose of training themselves to go back to Derry to defend themselves?&mdash;A great many of the members of our Defence Forces come, in fact, from the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Do any members of the FCA come from the Six Counties?&mdash;I was given to understand that people living in the Six Counties do.</P>
    <P>Can you turn up an instance of it? &mdash;When I spoke to Colonel Hefferon about this at the time, his view was army recruits&mdash;and we were recruiting at that time&mdash;were not unduly quizzed as to where their origins were.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gibbons said that in the case of the permanent Defence Force, it was quite a normal thing for Six County people to join the Army.</P>
    <P>Does not that mean that this was a device to enable the Army to train them for the defence of the Bogside? &mdash;I admit that this was a device to enable Derrymen to join the FCA and to obtain training.</P>
    <P>Do you think then that your reply to Deputy Ryan was not something of a half-truth?&mdash;I am suggesting that what Deputy Ryan said was inaccurate.</P>
    <P>Would you accept that in this instance you had told the truth but only half the truth?&mdash;This was a Dáil debate.</P>
    <P>It is your answer, Mr. Gibbons, that one is not bound to tell the truth in a Dáil debate?&mdash;This is a Dáil debate in which Deputy Ryan and his colleagues are seeking to demolish the Government and the Government party.</P>
    <P>Did you ever tell Dáil Éireann that you had no concrete examples of attempts to import arms?&mdash;I don't think so.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCarthy then quoted from the Dáil Reports an excerpt in which Mr. Gibbons had said: &ldquo;I wish to emphatically deny any such knowledge of attempts to import arms.  I <Col N="1477" /> was aware from the Director of Intelligence that attempts to smuggle arms were a constant danger...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would direct the attention of the House to a letter the Minister sent on 2nd April, 1971, to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The House is aware that this committee were investigating the disappearance of certain funds.  The letter stated:</P>
    <P>On April 30th, 1970, I sent for Captain James Kelly who had submitted his resignation from the Army.  I met him in my office in Leinster House.  It then seemed clear to me that he had been an active agent in an attempt to import arms into this country.</P>
    <P>Among other questions I asked him from what source the money for this operation came.  He replied that it came from the fund for the relief of distress in Northern Ireland. This was the first intimation that I had received as to the source of the money.  Up to that time I had no knowledge whatever as to the means of dispensation of this fund or to whom payments were made. I knew nothing whatever about it nor have any documents relating to it.</P>
    <P>(Signed) James Gibbons.</P>
    <P>Later a point was put to Deputy Gibbons in relation to the following quotation from the Taoiseach:</P>
    <P>I do not think the House would expect nor could I give any more information about the disposal of Secret Service funds.  However, I want to add that I made specific inquiries as to whether any money could have been devoted or could have been paid out of Exchequer funds or out of any public funds in respect of a consignment of arms of the size we have been dealing with and I am assured there was not nor could there have been.</P>
    <P>This was on 14th May and the chairman put this to Deputy Gibbons:</P>
    <P>Yet in the document you say&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Gibbons: I had been told by Captain Kelly.</P>
    <P>I think that from the extracts I have <Col N="1478" /> read it is shown clearly there was a fundamental difference between the remarks which the Minister made in the course of his intervention in the debate on 8th May and his subsequent reply to cross-examination to certain questions put to him by counsel in the arms trial and subsequently confirmed in a letter from James Gibbons, T.D., Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Government Buildings, dated 2nd April, 1971, and addressed to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts in which reference was made to the events I have read out in relation to 30th April.</P>
    <P>This motion goes specifically to the issue of confidence in the discharge of his functions and responsibilities as a member of the Government, and the House will be aware that under the terms of Article 28, 4.2 of the Constitution:</P>
    <P>The Government shall meet and act as a collective authority, and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by the members of the Government.</P>
    <P>This responsibility which the Minister discharged, according to the Taoiseach's own statement to the House, concerned two specific matters.  One was the question of an attempt to import arms and the expenditure of money which subsequently the Minister stated had come from the fund for the relief of distress in Northern Ireland and the issue of training members of the FCA from Derry.  I think it is abundantly clear from the facts I have disclosed in these two specific extracts that this goes not merely to the manner in which the Minister failed to inform the Dáil of the full facts of the situation but to the manner in which the Government collectively, and the Taoiseach as head of the Government, for a long period stood over the failure to inform the Dáil of the full facts.</P>
    <P>I think the House will appreciate and the country must by now recognise that it is not sufficient to say this was a Dáil debate and that this failure to disclose was because Deputies on the Opposition side were endeavouring to bring down the Government.  No one can have confidence in a Government <Col N="1479" /> or the individual members of a Government who behave in the way in which the members of this Government handled this whole question.  This particular event and the other events which now have been the subject of discussion during a period of 18 months may seem of little account to Members when the question of whether a Government are supported by a majority or whether they cease to retain that majority is at issue.  It has been argued that because of the manner in which this was presented to the House there was no obligation to tell the full facts.  It has been long established and recognised as fundamental to a democracy that those elected to particular positions must in the discharge of the responsibilities imposed on them disclose all the information to the House and to the country.  In this case, in his capacity as Minister, Deputy Gibbons failed to disclose the full facts.  Subsequently, all these facts came to light either in the course of cross-examination or in the letter which the Minister sent to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>I want to make it absolutely clear that in so far as this motion is concerned the personality of the Minister or of any of the other Ministers or of Deputies who were formerly colleagues does not enter into it.  The question is whether the duties imposed by this House in electing certain individuals to Ministerial office were discharged, whether those Minister acted <i>bona fide</i> in telling the House the full facts or whether they sought to mislead the House by not disclosing all the information that was then available.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this motion is one of confidence and that the risk inherent in an election might bring or would bring dangers to this country.  It is well to recall that elections in this country were held in far more difficult circumstances and that the will of the people prevailed. It is better to have an election than to have a continuation of the present undisguised uncertainly in which, in order not to have political or personal embarrassment, anything that can be got away with is accepted as the appropriate standard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> They are not the standards that we believe to be in the national interest. They are not the standards that we believe, irrespective of political parties, the majority of the people expect from their elected representatives.  Those who think otherwise are free to vote against this motion.  We put down this motion because we are convinced that until we can get elected representatives to speak and to act in the same way it is impossible to have either trust or confidence in the Government or any member of the Government.  On that basis, this motion is put to the House in the knowledge that those who wish to support it do so in the certain knowledge that it is a motion of no confidence in the manner in which the Minister himself has discharged his responsibilities, but more than that a motion of no confidence in the whole chaotic handling of national security in the last 18 months by the present Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion that has been moved by the leader of the Opposition.  It is now a matter of general knowledge that this motion stems from the events which shocked this House and shocked this nation 18 months ago when it became apparent in May of 1970 that there was a suspicion, leading in fact to a conviction, on the part of the leader of the Government that members of the Government Party were actively engaged in events which could well have brought disaster to this nation. It can be appreciated how deeply concerned was everybody outside this House then.  We know that, following those events, two members of the Government were requested by the Taoiseach to relinquish their offices and that another members, who is the subject of this motion, has been continued in office.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Cosgrave has said, what is involved is not a personal vendetta against the present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or against anyone in the Government, but what is involved is a determination on the part of Deputies on the right of the Ceann Comhairle to assert here, even if it is 18 months later, that we insist on high and proper standards in high places.</P>

      <P>We will not remain silent and we will not be silenced if we suspect that inside the Government and the Government Party there are things being done that ought not to be done. As Minister for Defence, Deputy Gibbons had a high and noble responsibility&mdash;the holding of office under this House and under our Constitution as a Minister of State.  Public honour is very valuable because it embodies public trust.  Public honour means that, when one speaks on behalf of one's office, one's words must carry credibility because they are true.  Once that trust disappears, this House ceases to be significant and democracy ceases to function.  What is involved in this particular record&mdash;and I regret to have to describe it as a dismal record&mdash;is that Deputy Gibbons, as Minister for Defence, knowing well that among his colleagues something had taken place and was taking place that ought not to take place, was prepared, in answer to a parliamentary question from Deputy Ryan, to take chances with the truth and he told a half-truth. If that practice should continue, how is this House to function?  As Deputies in Opposition, how are we to know when we table parliamentary questions to any member of that Government from now on that the reply will be the truth?  How are we to be convinced and how are the people whom we represent to be convinced that, when a Minister stands up here and tells us something, he is giving the whole information available to him?  Is the business of this Parliament and the important right of a Deputy to ask a question to be regarded, as Deputy Gibbons described it, as just one other effort by the Opposition to unseat the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is what parliamentary activity is to be reduced to, our democracy is in serious danger.  We know that this motion has been preceded by the most unparalleled activity on the part of Fianna Fáil Deputies.  We know that there have been groupings, lobbying, pairing and hawking and doving all over the House.  We know, too, that the nails on the fingers of two or three Deputies are bitten away to such an extent by anxiety that very little of <Col N="1482" /> them remains.  But we would hope that men who have made much of themselves in talking about honesty and truth, men who have puffed themselves up in importance by attacking the policy of their own leader when they thought it was safe to do so, will now have the courage of their convictions. Will these men act and talk as they should, or will they be as silent as mice?  Public honour is not significant and the national interest ceases to count if there is a possibility of causing perdition to the lot by the general election that the people require.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sauve qui peut</i> is a very low standard for those who profess ever to lead a country in honour.  Here, I regret to say, are a Government Party consisting of many groups all concerned to wring the leadership from their leader.  They are now face to face with the crunch involved in this motion and that can produce only one common feeling&mdash;a feeling of fear in relation to the people of the country if the people were asked to decide their political future.  A party united by fear rules this country at a stage in our history when courage and dedication to the leadership of the nation are required urgently.  Can we hope, even at this last moment, that some men will remain men and that the mice will cease to count?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary at this stage to remind the House that the motion before us is that I misled the Dáil on the 8th May, 1970.  It is necessary to remind the House of this after the histrionics that we have heard from Deputy O'Higgins and after some of the puke of his leader, Deputy Cosgrave.  By so misleading the House, as they allege, I, as Minister for Defence, became unworthy to be a member of the Government and a Member of Dáil Éireann.  It is plain&mdash; and very plain&mdash;that the object of the mover of this motion is to secure, if possible, my retirement from public life.  There have been times since May of last year when, for the sake of my family and myself and through sheer weariness occasioned by the court hearing, by the confidence debates and by the appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts and through <Col N="1483" /> the campaign of vilification and abuse hurled against me personally, I have been tempted not only to resign as a Minister but to leave Dáil Éireann and to return to my own people in Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>What has made me resist this temptation in the past and what makes me resist the temptation now is the certainty that at no time I misled the House as alleged in this motion or at any time told lies because I would recognise that such conduct would, in fact, render me unworthy not only to be a Minister but to sit as a Deputy for Kilkenny in Dáil Éireann.  If it could be shown to me that at any time I deliberately either misled the Dáil or told untruths I would have no hesitation in tendering my seal of office to the President and my letter of resignation to the Ceann Comhairle.  This I can see would be the honourable and decent thing to do.</P>
      <P>As of this moment, let me say that if any Deputy can demonstrate one piece of evidence that I either misled the Dáil or told untruths I am still prepared to adopt the course I have mentioned and to retire from the Dáil.  I am confident, however, that no such decision will be required to be made by me as the material in this debate, like the material contained in other debates, consists of a repetition of innuendo and special pleadings that are unworthy of the men who make them.  Anybody who listened to the contemptible contribution of Deputy Cosgrave would agree with me in that.</P>
      <P>I am not going to rehash the various matters covered in the earlier debates except in so far as these matters may be coloured by subsequent events and conduct.  The charges against me relate, of course, to my speech on 8th May, 1970, and resolve themselves to two charges that, to quote the words of Deputy FitzGerald at paragraph 257 of 29th October, 1970, Volume 249, No. 2 I&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... misled the House by various processes of half truths or lies.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first charge relates to the training of personnel at Dunree Fort.  In my speech on the occasion of the confidence motion in November, 1970, I <Col N="1484" /> dealt fully with this charge and I have very little to say except that this whole affair arose as a result of a suggestion which was then made to me in the presence of the then Chief of Staff, General MacEoin, and the then Director of Intelligence, Colonel Hefferon, that these men might be trained if I so decided.</P>
    <P>I decided off my own bat that they should be attested into the FCA and brought to Dunree Camp for a crash course of seven to ten days.  The Taoiseach was away at the time and on his return I told him about it and he was opposed to the continuation of the idea.  After the initial attestation of the first group of nine, ten or 11 men &mdash;I have forgotten the exact number&mdash; the entire scheme was dropped I told no lies about this matter.  I would never have been party to the training of these men by the Army authorities except under the aegis of the Army so that the men involved should be amenable to Army discipline.  When my words are examined with care the charge has as much validity as the earlier charges made in the course of the motion of confidence of 8th May, 1970, that Weapons, presumably for an illegal organisation, were collected in Army trucks&mdash;a suggestion which was made by Deputy Tully at that time&mdash;at Dublin docks and were presumably driven away to some unknown destination, or the rumours and stories about ships lying in Dublin Bay sailing away with murderers on board.  I do not know what became of the men of Dunree after their course had finished. Perhaps they were de-listed as suggested by Deputy FitzGerald at paragraph 410 in Volume 249, No. 3, of 3rd November, 1970.  I have said all I am going to say on this subject.  I will say no more.</P>
    <P>The second charge is of a more sweeping nature and is that I misled the House with reference to the statement made by Patrick Kennedy, MP, in the course of a radio interview when he suggested that any participation by Captain Kelly in an attempt to smuggle arms could only have been made with my knowledge and consent.  I emphatically deny any such knowledge or consent. I went on to say the following&mdash; and I quote:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> I was aware, through the Director of Intelligence, that attempts to smuggle arms were a constant danger and these attempts were kept under surveillance at all times.  I wish to say I discharged my duty to the full extent of my knowledge of the situation.  I want to say also that in recent times I formed the opinion that Captain Kelly was becoming unsuitable for the type of work that he was employed on.  I want to say that certain suspicions were forming in my mind.  I was kept informed by the Director of Intelligence but nothing concrete emerged.  I am satisfied that at all times I honoured the obligation that was placed on me by the Taoiseach when he made me Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>I want to stress the passage:</P>
    <P>I was kept informed by the Director of Intelligence but nothing concrete emerged...</P>
    <P>because I will have something to say about the then Director of Intelligence, Colonel Hefferon, later on.  It was alleged that this passage contains lies, misleading material and half-truths but, as I said then and say now, I challenge the Opposition that if they have any scintilla of evidence of any activity on my part they have an obligation to produce it and to produce it at once so that the necessary steps may be taken.  I made this challenge before and I am making it again now.  It is not good enough for words to be taken out of their context.  I cannot help quoting what Deputy Harte stated immediately after I sat down on 8th May, 1970, as reported in the Official Report of the debate on 8th May, 1970, Volume 246, column 841.  Deputy Harte said:</P>
    <P>I would underline and go along with the Minister for Defence, Deputy Gibbons, to a great degree in what he said about gun running. As a northern Deputy, I have kept in reasonably good contact with northern political thinking.  I have heard rumours.  Any person who approached me or mentioned to me that there was gun running I asked them to put up the information and <Col N="1486" /> I would arrange a personal interview with the Taoiseach, or I would arrange for that person to go to the Taoiseach.  I did not think it was a responsible job for me to come into this House and to make allegations about gun running without evidence. This is the most damaging thing that could be said in this House.  Any rumour I have heard has not been substantiated.  I would add that, when I have been approached and when I indicated I would arrange for the information to be given to the Taoiseach, I was not approached later on that subject.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that this advice was not taken by the Deputy's colleagues because, in the ensuing months, any old rumour or any old charge was sufficient to be used to disparage me and other members of the Government.  I have been called a perjurer.  I have been called a convicted liar by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien.  I have been singled out for special vilification in the hope that if Gibbons fell the Government in some way would also fall.  I venture to think that the people are heartily sick and tired of this mud-slinging by the Opposition.  In seeking time for this debate they have gone to the well once too often and have found it dry.  I have the honour to represent the joint counties of Carlow and Kilkenny.  I know that in the fullness of time the ordinary men and women of those two counties will throw back in the faces of the Opposition the charges now made against me that I am a perjurer and a convicted liar.  You should all be proud of yourselves.</P>
    <P>It is not only the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party who have carried on this campaign of vilification concerning my good name and honour. The former Minister for Local Government, and ex-Deputy, Mr. Kevin Boland, has not only formed a new party but has stamped up and down the country singling me out for special vilification and abuse.  This self-appointed high priest of true republicanism is no longer in this House but his deputy, no doubt on the orders of his chief, has pledged himself to go into the division lobby with Fine Gael and Labour in an effort to bring down <Col N="1487" /> the Fianna Fáil Government.  Mr. Boland's avowed object is based upon hatred of many of his former colleagues and his will is to encompass the ruin of my great party of which he claimed it an honour to be a member in the not too distant past.  He may think that by shouting &ldquo;liar&rdquo; and &ldquo;perjurer&rdquo; often enough he will convince the people that what he says is true.  I am not afraid of any of his sallies however vicious they may be.  I challenge him to run as many candidates as he likes in Carlow and Kilkenny against the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>In the preparation of this speech I have read and re-read the Dáil debates on the two motions of confidence and the appropriate portions of the record of the meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I wish to return to what I said on 8th May concerning the director of intelligence.  In the earlier portion of this speech I said that I wished to stress that I was kept informed by the director of intelligence but nothing concrete emerged.  I also stated that I was aware, through the director of intelligence, that attempts to smuggle arms were a constant danger. Deputies will realise that the director of intelligence is one of the senior officers in the Army and, as such, in the day-to-day ordering of affairs the Minister for Defence must rely upon the <i>bona fides</i> and loyalty of the director of intelligence in forming his views and making up his mind on what to do.</P>
    <P>It is quite apparent from what I said on 8th May, 1970, that I relied heavily on the director of intelligence and that I placed my trust in him.  It was through him that I learned of the existence of Captain Kelly, referred to by him as his young man and stated by him to be a fine young officer.  It was he who set my mind at rest regarding the proposed visit of Captain Kelly to Frankfurt in the middle of February, 1970.  It was he who was a party to the suggestion about the training of the Derry men in the FCA in the Dunree Camp.  I know what he has said already to the Committee of Public Accounts and I understand that a large submission has recently been received making, I suppose, <Col N="1488" /> further and better charges against me. I know he says that I knew the real purpose of the visit to Frankfurt.  I know he says that he informed me of Captain Kelly's visit to Antwerp.  I know the allegations by Captain Kelly and Colonel Hefferon that I knew at all times the true nature of Captain Kelly's activities on the Continent.</P>
    <P>I have said before and I now say again&mdash;and Fine Gael Deputies and Labour Deputies and Mr. Boland's party can accept it if they like or reject it if they like&mdash;that these allegations of knowledge on my part are completely without foundation and are blatant lies. In my 13 years of membership of this House I have not singled out an individual outside this House for any criticism.  Neither have I made any charges against persons who are not in a position to defend themselves.  It is with great regret that I make these charges now.  I make them only because the Dáil has been used by persons inside and outside it as a sounding board for every rumour, every yarn.  The only standard required was that its content was capable of vilifying me, the Attorney General, the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>
    <P>Let me take Deputies back to the speech by Mr. Boland on 3rd November, 1970.  I refer to the portion of his speech commencing at the bottom of column 461 and ending at the top of column 462, Volume 249 of the Official Report of Tuesday, 3rd November, 1970.  He said:</P>
    <P>So the evidence of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in court made the jury's task simple. They naturally decided that the two tried and trusted Army officers were honourable men.  They decided that the Army's estimation of these people was vindicated.  They decided that the man who had been serving as a junior officer in the most trusted branch of the Army&mdash;the intelligence service&mdash;was properly assessed by the Army authorities as being fit for that job.  They decided that the man who had progressed to the highest rank he could reach in the Army, the highest rank that can be reached by anyone in the <Col N="1489" /> Army except the chief-of-staff&mdash; colonel&mdash;and had held the position of maximum trust in the Army&mdash;director of intelligence&mdash;they decided that the Army's assessment of these people was the correct assessment: it was vindicated.  They decided also that, in this business, it was the then Minister for Defence who was the weakling.</P>
    <P>That is the end of Mr. Boland's quotation.</P>
    <P>Even then, when I spoke on the 3rd November, 1970, I had no true inkling of the perfidy of the former Director of Intelligence.  I agree with the former Deputy Boland that the Intelligence Service is the most trusted branch of the Army and the Director of Intelligence holds a position of maximum trust and I say that all his utterances to the Committee of Public Accounts and elsewhere and his conduct have made it clear to me and clear to everybody else that he betrayed his trust and was unworthy to hold his high position in the Army at the time.</P>
    <P>What are Deputies to think?  What do the people think?  These two allegedly tried and trusted Army officers have turned up as founder members and important personages in the ranks of Mr. Boland's new political party.  I say that none are so blind as those who will not see; none are so deaf as those who will not hear; but the emergence of Colonel Hefferon in the ranks of Aontacht Éireann is a fact which, above all others, shrieks loudest in this House even to penetrate the near deaf ears of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  This military gentleman now has knowledge and consents to the policy of the former Deputy Boland who makes no secret of the fact of his detestation of the Taoiseach as a man of peace and he sees nothing wrong with the supply of arms to the North.  He might call them defensive weapons but the purpose of a gun is to kill and to maim and, since Deputy Cosgrave is recalling certain sayings in what has come to be known as the arms trial, I recall saying those very words at that time.  Colonel Hefferon is a party to all this and so is Captain <Col N="1490" /> Kelly but I dismiss him as a man of little consequence.  I find it hard to contain myself as regards Colonel Hefferon.  His actions, to me, supply the missing pieces of this horrible jig-saw puzzle and, in my eyes, he stands in line with Iago, the false friend of Othello in Shakespeare's tragedy.  The Fine Gael and Labour Parties can lend their aid to the machinations of the former Deputy Boland, Colonel Hefferon and Captain Kelly, if they so wish.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition knew all this before he sought time for this motion to be discussed.  I believe that the action of Colonel Hefferon has spoken louder than any words that I have uttered or that any Deputy has uttered in this debate and I can only repeat the sentence with which I concluded my speech on 3rd November, 1970: I am staying here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it ought to be said, with all due respect to you, that this motion is being taken tonight, not so much in deference to the wishes of the Fine Gael Party.  It is abundantly clear that the purpose of the exercise by the Taoiseach is to challenge some members in his own party.  This is, unfortunately, a continuation of the sordid events brought about, may I say, by the Fianna Fáil Party themselves, events which have seriously affected the business of the Dáil and the administration of the country.  These events commenced in the early part of May, 1970, with a motion by the Taoiseach nominating three Ministers on the dismissal of two and on the resignation of another.  I do not think anybody could deny that there was tremendous shock and disbelief on the part of the ordinary people in the country that such things should have happened within a Government&mdash;a Government of the Fianna Fáil Party. Senior Ministers were accused of treasonable acts.  The Cabinet was decimated, so that now we have the second XI of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that precise time the integrity of this House was at stake and it was up to the Taoiseach then, in view of these extraordinary events, to see that national confidence was restored.  The <Col N="1491" /> only way in which it could have been restored then and the only way in which it can be restored now is for the Taoiseach, despite what may be the result of the vote on this motion, to dissolve this Dáil and to ask the people to give their verdict.  It is not too late now because, as somebody on this side has said, we fought elections in difficult circumstances.  We fought elections in January.  We fought elections in December.  Let there be no excuse.  If the Taoiseach wants to test the confidence of the country, apart from some of his dissidents, now is the time for him to consult the people, and not to consult his own party and to try to blackmail some of them as well.</P>
    <P>All of us have paid the price for the events that commenced in May, 1970, and I suppose it is no business or concern of mine but the Fianna Fáil Party suffered more than anybody else.  That is poetic justice.  We now see that party crumbling brick by brick. This debate will be a further cause of erosion of public respect and esteem for this House because the electorate will see the sorry spectacle of Members voting against their conscience and, might I say, not for the first time.  We have seen this before.  Those members of the Fianna Fáil Party who vote with the Government Party on the motion before the House, with the threat of expulsion from the party, or those who abstain will, in effect, be withdrawing all that they have said for the past 18 months and there will be on their part, by their votes, an admission that they were wrong and that the Taoiseach was right when he sacked Minister and forced others to resign.</P>
    <P>One can understand the feelings of Deputy Jimmy Gibbons, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, and I suppose one can excuse him some of the extravagant language he used.  He said here, as an aside, that a member of our party had accused him of being &mdash;I think he said&mdash;a convicted liar.  He ought to travel around the back benches of the Fianna Fáil Party and then he will find out what they are calling him because some of them&mdash;and I say this to his face&mdash;some of them have called Deputy Jimmy Gibbons a perjurer and <Col N="1492" /> Mr. Childers, on TV, in respect of some of his colleagues, called them conspirators.  So, let us not imagine that any of the criticism that has been focused on Deputy Jimmy Gibbons over the last 18 months or tonight is exclusive to the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party because one can remember the remarks passed&mdash;not so much about the Minister in question now&mdash; the abuse and the insults that were hurled at the Taoiseach by ex-Ministers, by members of his own party, when the result of the arms trial was made known.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons said that he was reluctant to criticise people who were outside this House and could not defend themselves.  Captain Kelly&mdash;I think I mentioned this in that famous debate &mdash;made allegations against Deputy Gibbons.  He called him &ldquo;an unmitigated scoundrel&rdquo; which I suppose is clearly libellous.  I would ask Deputy Gibbons, in those circumstances, why he has not taken action not alone against him but against Colonel Hefferon about whom he was so bitter here tonight.  In any case, as I say, the Taoiseach has regarded this and told his party that in effect it is a motion of confidence or otherwise in him. They, who make no secret of their dislike of the Taoiseach, Deputy Gibbons and other members of the Government will, as they have before, troop behind Deputy Jack Lynch on the plea that they are supporting the Fianna Fáil Party and not the Government as such.</P>
    <P>They are demonstrating in that that they put Fianna Fáil before all other things in this country despite the fact that the Government are a Fianna Fáil Government and, as such, control the economic and social life of this country which, by the ineptitude of the Government and the internal wrangling within the Fianna Fáil Party, has severely endangered the social and economic life of this country.  We have seen this before and we will not be surprised if we see it tomorrow night. As long as the Members of the House make no secret of voting against their stated beliefs Fianna Fáil stay in the sorry position they have been in for the last 18 months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> We have seen it on motions of &ldquo;no confidence&rdquo; in respect of members of the Government, in respect of the Taoiseach and we had it in a smaller way on the dole issue.  They who openly, although not in this House, criticise the Taoiseach and his Ministers have no hesitation, as they said, to prop up the Fianna Fáil Party, to trot behind the man whom they say they intensely dislike, Deputy Jack Lynch, the Taoiseach of this Government.</P>
    <P>We have now what has been described as the Gibbons Motion and as I said it has been treated by the Taoiseach as a motion of &ldquo;no confidence&rdquo;, a motion so to speak of no confidence in himself because that is in effect what he is purported to have said to the Fianna Fáil Party meeting last week. This, in my view, is only correct because it was the Taoiseach who made Deputy Jim Gibbons, the Minister for Defence as he then was, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, as he now is, the central figure in a Cabinet crisis.  I say he is deliberately, despite the fact he conducted his own defence first tonight, shielding Deputy Gibbons by putting himself between Deputy Gibbons and the rest of the Fianna Fáil Party.  He says in effect: &ldquo;If you hit Deputy Gibbons you must hit me first.&rdquo;  A lot of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers, those who have been described as dissidents, are not prepared to hit Deputy Jack Lynch yet. They will bide their own time.</P>
    <P>Why has there been this criticism of Deputy Gibbons?  It is because of his statement in the House, to which he has referred, to which other speakers have referred, which I believe was proven to be untrue and which Deputy Haughey says should be left to the judgment of history as the other events of May, 1970.  I do not think we can wait for history to deliberate on whether or not Deputy Gibbons was right, whether or not he misled the House or whether or not the events of 1970, as per Deputy Haughey, Deputy Blaney and Mr. Boland were correct or otherwise.  I prefer, and I am entitled to as an elected representative of this House, as we all are, to make my own judgement.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach himself, of course, <Col N="1494" /> has offered some judgment.  After the arms conspiracy trial, in New York and in Dublin, he said&mdash;I do not purport to quote him exactly but I think I remember listening to it on television &mdash;he was still satisfied he was justified in taking the action he had.  This motion is directly related to a quotation by Deputy Gibbons in Volume 246 of the 8th May, 1970, column 839, when he said in the course of his speech with regard to the alleged attempt to smuggle arms:</P>
    <P>I have been informed that Mr. Patrick Kennedy, MP, in the course of a Radio Éireann interview, suggested that any participation by Captain James Kelly in an attempt to smuggle arms could only have been made with my knowledge and consent.  I wish emphatically to deny any such knowledge or consent.</P>
    <P>We have got, therefore, to decide on what evidence we have and from the statements that were made, whether or not the person in question had any knowledge or consent in the matter of the attempt to import arms illegally into this country.</P>
    <P>We all remember, unfortunately, the awful situation in the two main cities in the North of Ireland on the 12th and 14th August, 1969.  In October, 1969, there was the now famous meeting held in Bailieboro' and the Captain Kelly referred to attended that meeting which was comprised of defence groups from Northern Ireland.  As far as the evidence I have is concerned he was authorised to go there.  He was there in an official capacity and this was stated at the special Public Accounts Committee. In the Public Accounts Committee report on page 249 of Book 6 the same Captain Kelly said that &ldquo;the genesis of the whole operation&rdquo;&mdash; those were his exact words&mdash;&ldquo;was the procuring of arms&rdquo;.  Captain Kelly was there in an official capacity.  The Special Branch were there.  The Special Branch reported to Mr. Berry, ex-Secretary to the Department of Justice.  He is alleged to have reported to the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach is alleged, according to the evidence, to have got in touch with Deputy Gibbons, the then Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>I must confess that this evidence is <Col N="1495" /> from Colonel Hefferon and I do not expect, in view of what he said, that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will agree with what was said at the Public Accounts Committee.  The fact is, as stated by Colonel Hefferon, that the Special Branch reported to the Secretary of the Department of Justice who reported to the Taoiseach who got in touch with Deputy Gibbons and I assume that there was a full report of the meeting that was held in Bailieboro'. Therefore, as far as knowledge is concerned the then Minister for Defence must have known about this meeting and as was described the genesis of the operation being to procure arms.</P>
    <P>That discussion between the Taoiseach and Deputy Gibbons, according to the report, was in November, 1969.  The Minister knew about the meeting and he knew what the purpose of the meeting was.  Mind you, apart from the general denial of Colonel Hefferon, there was no denial of this statement that I know of in any case.  Further to that, at that stage in November, 1969, both Captain Kelly and Colonel Hefferon knew that the Taoiseach had approached the Minister for Defence, as he then was, and discussed the matter with him.  Again, in evidence in the Public Accounts Committee, Book 7, pages 312 and 313, it was stated that on the 13th February, 1970, Colonel Hefferon went to Mr. Gibbons himself, and this is an extract from what Colonel Hefferon said to the then Minister for Defence. Speaking about the activities of Captain Kelly he said on page 313:</P>
    <P>...I told Mr. Gibbons that he said he was going to the Continent and I suspected he was going to &ldquo;vet&rdquo; arms.</P>
    <P>That was on the 13th February, 1970, despite the fact that on 8th May the then Minister for Defence denied knowledge of the proposal to import arms illegally.</P>
    <P>I do not know Colonel Hefferon.  I may have met him once or twice.  I do not know what his reputation is within the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not know whether it was the Fianna Fáil Government who approved his appointment <Col N="1496" /> as head of Army Intelligence.  I would suspect that it was the same Government of which Deputy Jim Gibbons was a member.  Can we discount the evidence of the head of Army Intelligence appointed by the Fianna Fáil Government?  Should we not trust the word of a man who, as far as I can remember, served in the capacity of <i>aide-de-camp</i> to the President of Ireland?  This is the man who Deputy Gibbons said should not be trusted, whose word should not be accepted.  He was the man who through the Department of Justice and the Taoiseach, informed Deputy Gibbons about the meetings in Bailieboro'. Therefore, as far as knowledge is concerned, I believe Deputy Gibbons knew about the meeting, that he knew the purpose of the meeting, that he knew that Captain Kelly, according to the evidence in the Committee of Public Accounts, was going to the Continent to &ldquo;vet&rdquo; arms.</P>
    <P>This was knowledge.  Deputy Gibbons has denied knowledge of the activities of people against whom it was alleged they wanted to import arms illegally.  Again, I suppose there is no point in saying this to Deputy Gibbons on the question of consent in view of what he said about the other gentleman, Captain Kelly.  Captain Kelly said he saw Mr. Gibbons on the 4th March, 1970, and in evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts said he gave him a full briefing on intelligence operations to date.  In Volume 11, page 468, Captain James Kelly said:</P>
    <P>I come in on 4th March, the first time I met Mr. Gibbons, and I give him a full briefing on Intelligence operations to-date.</P>
    <P>As far as consent is concerned may I then quote Captain James J. Kelly:</P>
    <P>...if Mr. Gibbons did not agree all he had to say was &ldquo;No, this must stop.  This is not authorised.  This is not Government policy.&rdquo;  Instead he said &ldquo;Carry on&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I asked&mdash;and I did not mean offence to either of the two parties&mdash; when the Taoiseach had concluded his speech on, I think, the 9th May: who is telling lies?  Who is the liar, Gibbons or Kelly?  This has not yet been established. <Col N="1497" /> However, I put this to the House as evidence that was submitted by Captain James Kelly who says that when he told the then Minister for Defence of his activities, that the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Gibbons, said &ldquo;Carry on&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This whole business has been the subject of many discussions and of an inquiry by the Committee of Public Accounts.  It also went to the High Court.  In the High Court a jury of Irishmen decided that the defendants were not guilty of conspiracy.  Remember, these defendants had been named by the Taoiseach, at least those who were members of this Government and some of whom are now Members of this House.  The charges were dismissed. I think we must interpret the decision of the High Court.  The charges were dismissed.  Ex-Ministers and others were accused of conspiring to import arms illegally.  The fact that the High Court, with an Irish jury, decided that the charges should be dismissed meant, in effect, that the jury accepted the facts as outlined and did not accept that these activities had been carried out without Deputy Gibbons's knowledge or consent.  The court made their decision and I think we should make ours now.  The court did so over many days, after hearing many witnesses and under the most rigorous rules of evidence.  I am prepared to accept that evidence and to put my own interpretation on it.  As far as that decision is concerned, what the Taoiseach alleged against two of his Ministers and others was proved unsustainable, and still they are in the wilderness, but that is the Taoiseach's problem.</P>
    <P>I repeat that the Taoiseach has put himself between the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Gibbons, and this House.  He said on that famous occasion, whether it was the 8th or 9th, that the slightest taint of suspicion should not attach to any Minister.  Common sense and the judgment of the court dictate that a great deal of suspicion is attached to Deputy Gibbons.  Neither is the Taoiseach entirely free from that taint of suspicion. As I said at the beginning of my speech, because the people are bewildered, <Col N="1498" /> frustrated and annoyed with the Government, despite whatever result there might be from the &ldquo;loyalty&rdquo; of some people in the back there who will give the Taoiseach their vote on this occasion, the honourable thing to do would be to go to the country and let the people decide and not the clique inside the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to speak at any great length in opposition to this motion.  I have had experience of Government, some 17 years in all, and of being associated with a great many Ministers.  Like other Ministers I was naturally shocked by the events of April, 1970, but I wish to say that at no time did I have reason to believe that the former Minister for Defence, Deputy Gibbons, was concerned, directly or indirectly, with the smuggling of guns into the North.  Ultimately this is a question of human faith.  I believe Deputy Jim Gibbons.  I do not believe those who gave evidence which suggested that he had complicity in this matter and I think that everything Deputy Jim Gibbons said in regard to the later action of these persons is of importance in this matter.</P>
      <P>This debate is, of course, like many we have had in the past.  Allegations of disunity, large-scale disunity, have been made repeatedly in this House for years and years, disunity on all sorts of subjects.  Over and over again we have been accused of sudden changes of policy and sudden variations in policy either because of stormy differences within the Government itself or within the party itself.  This is very, very old hat in so far as it relates to the suggestion that the Fianna Fáil Party is for the nth time collapsing on an issue of great importance.  I have heard it all before.  I know of no political party among the 20 most civilised democracies where there has been so much remarkable unity as there has been within the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>This party have been determined to pursue specific social, economic and international policies ever since we took office for the first time in 1932.  We have been subjected to tremendous strains in various kinds of crises that arose, the crisis of World War II and economic and other difficulties which every country has had to face.  I know of no party in which there cannot be some gust of emotion that arises from time to time in relation to matters of interest, but the main point about the Fianna Fáil Party is that we remain together and those members of the party who, perhaps, feel that some particular aspect of policy is not entirely in accordance with their wishes, accept the majority decision and honour it.</P>

      <P>I want to put something else on the record.  During the whole time that Deputy Jim Gibbons was in the Government as Minister for Defence, at no time was there ever demonstrated a difference of view in regard to Government policy on the North either by Deputy Gibbons or by any other Members of the Government. I also want to deny on my solemn word of honour that there have <Col N="1500" /> been any gusts of any sort of differences of opinion within the Government during the whole of the recent and very serious events occurring in the North and all the allegations made by Deputies that there are hawkish members and doveish members of the Fianna Fáil Government, that we have been disputing among ourselves and have very narrowly managed to preserve an outward face of unity, all these rumours are completely untrue. Indeed, in all the immensely difficult decisions that have had to be made in relation to negotiations with the British Government, in relation to diplomatic approaches to the British Government and in relation to the situation in the North, which changes from week to week, there has been a spirit of absolute unity between myself and my colleagues and the Taoiseach and this damnable sort of talk must stop because it simply is not true.</P>

      <P>To take the Tánaiste up on the very point upon which he concluded, one finds in his own very words reason for greater concern rather than reason for confidence.  The Tánaiste has said that before certain members of the Government were dismissed there was no expression of a difference of view regarding the North amongst the members of the Government, members of the Government who were doing things which the Taoiseach later said cast more than a taint of suspicion on their activities.  Now he asks the country to feel reassured that there is not even the gust of a difference between the members of the Government and we are to assume because there is not even the gust of a difference blowing across the Cabinet table, that all is well, that there is total agreement and that there is no further possibility of any member of the Government being dismissed from office for doing something unsavoury and contrary to the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste has asked us to place confidence in the Taoiseach, in himself and in his colleagues, because there is no element of disagreement in the Cabinet.  We recall that at a time when <Col N="1501" /> there was similar unity there were around the Cabinet table people whom the Tánaiste later called conspirators. How many conspirators are left?  Is it not possible there is more than one? We suggest, not because of any allegations made by Colonel Hefferon, not because of any statements made by Captain James Kelly, two men whom the former Minister for Defence finds unpleasant, but because of his own words, his own written statements, his own sworn testimony in court, that he too was a conspirator, wittingly or unwittingly, and it is the electorate, as he himself says, on some other occasion should decide.</P>
    <P>As we listened to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries express his view about the sordid disagreement which has brought the very institutions of this State to a lower level, nationally and internationally, than they have ever been before, we recall a certain defence on another occasion, when he was trapped with his own words, when he was presented with his own efforts to mislead the Dáil and the nation, the defence that he was entitled to do that because the Government and he were under attack.  Does he think tonight that this is an exercise in preserving him and his Government?  Does he feel secure tonight?  Did the Taoiseach feel secure last night when he had to utter a threat to his own dissidents?  Is it not clear that, once again under attack, Deputy Gibbons adopts the same code, believing that any score is good enough and he is justified in misleading?</P>

      <P>There are certain other amendments consequential to No. 3, I think, Nos. 50, 51, 53, 56, 59, 61, 63 and 65.  It would seem convenient to take them together.  I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 12, to delete &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the College Council&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment arises out of the debate on the Committee Stage when I was endeavouring to create a structure which, in appearance at any rate, would be more akin to that of a third level institution, the College Council. I think the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out certain defects in my amendment, certain untidiness in drafting, certain omissions, and I have endeavoured to tidy these up and to produce a more coherent approach to this question in these two amendments Nos. 1 and 3.  I hope they will be acceptable.  If I have, in fact, managed to cope with all the problems, I think it would be better if we had a college with a college council and could get away from this awkward phraseology about &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; with references to the college coming in at other points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have here an organisation which will be a college and it seems appropriate that we should refer to it as such, as indeed the Bill does in its present form at certain points.  We should be consistent in referring to it as such and when we are referring to the body which is the executive body to run the college it should be given a title of a reasonably academic character reflecting the academic nature of the institution.  For that reason I suggest that body be called &ldquo;the college <Col N="1503" /> council&rdquo;.  If I have correctly divided up the cases where &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; refers to the institution and where it really refers to the body running it, then these amendments, as drafted, I think would meet the case.  I hope the Minister will be able to give them consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear I cannot accept these amendments.  I think the Deputy will agree that in relation to our discussions on the Committee Stage I have made an effort to frame the amendments I have put down here to meet many of the cases the Deputy has put forward.  However, in relation to this amendment I think, from what I could understand of the Deputy's statement in regard to this matter on the Committee Stage, that he was attempting to associate a board with commercial activities.  But, as I pointed out then, there are many other types of boards besides those engaged in commercial activity, for example, the Board of Governors of the National Gallery and the Board of Trinity College, and so on.  It is true that the two words &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; and &ldquo;Council&rdquo; are used rather loosely to describe a body of people assembled together for a particular purpose. Generally speaking, the word &ldquo;Council&rdquo; is taken to mean an advisory or deliberative body.  A college council in this country is the name generally given to a body set up to advise on various activities of the college and it has not got the executive function which one would envisage in a board.</P>
      <P>Just to quote a couple of instances we have college councils in two of our Dublin colleges of technology and these councils are purely advisory.  The board is a corporate body established to run an institution which is the college.  It is the employer of the staff and the operator of the official seal and the college itself is merely an institution and does not have any corporate status. The term &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; fills the situation I have in mind and I believe that in this instance the Bill should be left as drafted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>When a somewhat similar amendment came up on the Committee Stage one of the problems we found was the difficulty in establishing the connection or the line of authority between the board and the college council as proposed. Despite the thorough research of Deputy FitzGerald, I think the task has once again proved almost impossible. First, the Deputy will note that in the actual title of the Bill itself it says:</P>
      <P>Bill entitled an Act to establish a Board to be known as Bord an Choláiste Náisiunta Ealaíne is Deartha, to define its powers and duties and to provide for related matters.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has not in fact made any proposal to amend the title which I think he will accept would be a matter of immediate consequence if his amendment were accepted.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's amendments have suggested that in the definition the College Council, which hitherto has read &ldquo;The Board&rdquo;, the College Council has a meaning specified in section 4 (1) of this Act, in other words, substituting &ldquo;College Council&rdquo; for &ldquo;The Board&rdquo;. When we look at section 4 (1) we find ourselves in this position, reading in the Deputy's amendment:</P>
      <P>There shall, by virtue of this section, be established on the establishment day a board to be known as Bord an Choláiste Náisiunta Ealaíne is Deartha, to perform the functions given to it by this Act (in this Act referred to as the College Council).</P>
      <P>I think there are some other anomalies that one could point to.  I am not suggesting that anybody looking at a Bill of this sort, particularly in regard to substituting the words &ldquo;College Council&rdquo; for &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; could immediately tie up all the loose ends but I hope Deputy FitzGerald would acknowledge from that that loose ends have not been, and I submit, cannot be tied up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may go further and quote from himself.  I can understand his attitude generally being that &ldquo;College Council&rdquo; is more appropriate to an academic institution than a board <Col N="1505" /> which seems more appropriate to commercial or semi-commercial institutions, as the Deputy would argue it. On the Committee Stage debate he said himself on 2nd November as reported at column 778 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The argument is made on section 4 (2).  Section 4 (2) defines &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; as being a body corporate.</P>
    <P>The Deputy went on to say:</P>
    <P>If it is a body corporate it cannot simultaneously be the college council running the place.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Deputy, in a number of cases here, has left the situation where the College Council is not a body corporate and having at the same time the College Council running the place.</P>
    <P>Take section 12.  One of the essential characteristics of a body corporate is that it acts under a seal as distinct from an individual who acts under his signature.  A body corporate can only in most instances act under a seal.  The Deputy has proposed in section 12 that:</P>
    <P>The College Council shall, as soon as may be after its establishment, provide itself with a seal.</P>
    <P>He is substituting the words: &ldquo;College Council&rdquo; for &ldquo;Board&rdquo;.  He is establishing in his own amendments that the college council is a body corporate. He is, on his own line of reasoning, disqualifying it from acting as the managing authority of an academic institution.  I must confess that I do not have the diligence of the Deputy who has successfully distinguished between the College Council and the college in many of these amendments.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it is fairly clear that even now and, I would suggest at any stage, what the Deputy is trying to achieve cannot be achieved because effectively it is a question of terminology that seems to be worrying him, nothing more nor less than terminology. He did, on the last occasion, seem to have a concern that there was no clear line of distinction between the managing authority and the executive. I think it is clear under the Bill as proposed that the board is the board of management and the executive are <Col N="1506" /> clearly set out to be in the Bill what they are&mdash;the director and the registrar and their staff but particularly the director and registrar.  This has an analogy in commercial practice or in academic practice.</P>
    <P>I would submit that it probably has in both.  This is a clear indication of how normal the practice is.  I cannot imagine that what is in the Bill as proposed is in any way unacceptable.  The most important thing of all is that it does not in any way disable or disqualify the board or the officers or servants of the board from effectively doing what we all would want them to do and that is to implement the autonomous management of the college.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were a centipede rather than a Deputy I would have to say that the Parliamentary Secretary has only left me about 95 legs to stand on.  He has pointed out some defects in drafting which I suppose are inevitable and, lacking the skills of the parliamentary draftsman which are not available as freely to me as to the Minister and Parliamentary Secretary, clearly there are some defects here which he has cogently pointed out.</P>
      <P>Had the Minister and Parliamentary Secretary felt that the spirit of my amendments made them desirable and had they been moved to accept them, what they could and would have done would have been to accept them and tidy up such anomalies as I may have left.  Clearly, however, they do not seem disposed to do so.  They do not feel that the basic thought behind them is worth considering.  The Minister said the word &ldquo;council&rdquo; had an advisory meaning only.  This is not, in fact, true in that in the universities the academic council is the executive body.  It, of course, has certain advisory functions but in the academic sphere it is, in fact, an executive body.  It may be different in other higher level institutions.  I am not saying that the term is ideal.  The Minister has a point but, I think, the word is one which has both advisory and executive connotations in different arenas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly I am not going to persuade the Minister.  It is not a major point compared with some of the issues <Col N="1507" /> about which we shall be arguing.  I note the analogy of Trinity College and its board.  Perhaps resting on that I will accept what I am not very happy about but what is not worth holding up the House on any longer.</P>

    <P>We had a very considerable discussion on this section last day and I tried to go as far as possible in relation to the suggestion put forward by, I think, Deputy FitzGerald again.  I think the amendment I am putting forward leaves the board greater freedom in its decision regarding scholarships and other rewards. The only control retained by me on this is the overall expenditure involved. I do not think there is anything new about that.  I think the board, once it is aware of the total moneys available to it, will apply these moneys in an equitable manner as between the entrance scholarships and other scholarships. I know I argued the last day at considerable length in relation to the entrance scholarships and their relativity, as it were, to higher education grants.  Having considered the whole matter I thought it would be better if I gave more freedom to the board in the sense of relying on their own good sense to utilise properly whatever money was made available to them for this specific purpose.  I thought this particular amendment would meet the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister argued so persuasively on the issue of entrance scholarships last week that he persuaded me to put down an amendment to meet it.  He has now circumvented me by changing his ground completely and by putting down an amendment of a quite different character on what is really a different issue altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I recall it, last week the Minister was not arguing that he must control the total expenditure on scholarships, prizes, <i>et cetera,</i> because he will control directly at present, and perhaps later through the HEA, the total expenditure of the college.  I do not think we wasted much time on the point because it is not an issue.  The whole question was whether there was a problem of co-ordinating entrance scholarships, as he defined them, although I would call them grants, with entrance grants for other higher level institutions.  I thought <Col N="1510" /> him persuasive on the point.  There was an issue here.  I could see there was a sensitivity and it seemed worthwhile trying to meet him.  I thought my amendment went the whole way to meet everything the Minister said last week.  I am a little taken aback and a little disappointed, having gone to such trouble to meet the Minister, to find he has spurned my efforts and produced instead an amendment as to the value of which I am not clear.</P>
    <P>In so far as the amendment is a control of expenditure amendment the Minister has that control in any event because he can control the total budgetary provision for the college.  As drafted it does not enable him to exercise any control over the entrance grants&mdash;he has given up the control which he was seeking the other day &mdash;and when he says, as he did a minute or two ago, that this leaves the board free to determine their own scholarship scheme, it is a most curious form of freedom.  They are free to provide any scholarships they like as long as they are within the sum of money named by the Minister.  That is the kind of freedom which Henry Ford offered in regard to the colour of the car.  I do not find it acceptable in its present form.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to tell the House what is wrong with the amendment I have drafted.  He did not claim last week that he needed to control the amount of money spent on prizes and bursaries.  He referred only to the need to ensure harmonisation of entrance scholarships to the college with entrance grants to other higher level institutions.  Why then is my amendment not acceptable?  It seems to meet completely the points he then made.  Why does he wish to extend his control to a new area not hitherto mentioned, that is, control by earmarking college funds for a particular purpose?  It was hitherto contemplated, as I understand it, that the college would be given a grant and the board given authority to spend it. No doubt the size of the grant will be determined in the light of representations made by the board, just as other higher level institutions will be making representations and putting forward submissions to the HEA about <Col N="1511" /> the amount of money they will need. That will have to be tailored to take into account what the State can afford. This board will have to put in a submission for their total requirements including scholarships, grants, bursaries, prizes and so on, and that total sum so provided should then be left to the board to dispense within their own autonomy, the kind of autonomy we are trying to give them.</P>
    <P>Why at Report Stage does the Minister try to introduce an earmarking principle for this particular form of finance for scholarship, <i>et cetera,</i> when it does not give him the power which he not unreasonably sought to have in relation to ensuring co-ordination with higher education grants? This being Report Stage I regret that it will not be possible for me to pursue the matter as far as I should like. I would like to hear the Minister's reply because I am afraid his opening statement has not helped me to understand what is in his mind and if I am limited to just one speech by the formality of the debate I am going to be in some difficulties in dealing with him.</P>

He has not told the House what is wrong with the amendment which I have drafted for his benefit and not knowing what is wrong with it, and not knowing why he wants to introduce this earmarking principle on Report Stage, his opening address having been singularly taciturn on these two subjects, I am in considerable difficulty in carrying the matter any further than I have.  It would have been helpful if he had explained the position further and it would be very helpful indeed if he explains it a bit further and if I could have a chance to comment again if he discloses something.</P>

      <P>The Chair appreciates my difficulty: my amendment was designed to meet the Minister's point. I am now moving it, but owing to the fact that he has put down an irrelevant amendment which does not meet the point at all I am being put in the position that I cannot reply to his reply to my own amendment.  That could have been overcome had he replied to my amendment in his opening address but he did not.  It seems to me there should be some way around this situation and I should not be precluded from replying to my own amendment because the Minister has put down an irrevelant amendment.  To me it was a mistake to group the two together.  I recognise they are alternatives but by grouping them together the debate is being impeded. Is there not a procedure for recommittal by agreement?  This is often done on Report Stage when a complex issue is being discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I should have adverted to the Deputy's amendment when I was speaking.  One of the things I felt about it when I had it examined was that, while I agree it conformed to a certain extent to what I was speaking about on Committee Stage, I felt it would hardly stand up in law.  For instance we have here, &ldquo;who had attained a certain standard&rdquo;. The question is: who would determine this certain standard?  The earmarking of money, as I mentioned when I was speaking earlier, is not something new.  I am informed by the Department that money is earmarked for Department of Education scholarships for universities and even the number of them is specified.  What I felt here was that in a somewhat similar way the amount of money being made available by the Department to the college for scholarships, bursaries and so on, would be specified by the Minister and this money would be used by them for entrance scholarships, about which I spoke on the last occasion, and for other types of scholarships as well.  The very fact that there would be a specified amount of money available for this would ensure that the board would carefully examine the situation and that they would make the awards of <Col N="1514" /> scholarships as equitably as possible. The very fact that the amount of money would be defined would ensure that they would have to have regard to the situation in relation to entrance scholarships as well as to other scholarships and bursaries.</P>
      <P>For that reason I believed I was, in effect, giving the board a wider control of the situation.  During all the discussions on this Bill in Committee the Deputy pressed for as much freedom as possible for the college board and, as he can see in many instances in relation to the amendments which we have passed, I tried to give as much freedom as I could to the board.  This was my main reason for putting in the amendment because I thought it gave most freedom to the board while ensuring that the money was used to the best possible advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one small point.  The Deputy has been concerned basically to preserve as much as possible the autonomy of the institution and has drawn the analogy of the desirability of having autonomy at university or third level institutions, which I accept.  However, in the Deputy's amendment any grants or scholarships, or schemes of grants and scholarships, whether analogous to the grants schemes or scholarship schemes operated by universities, in each instance would require the consent of the Minister.  Under the Deputy's amendment individual grants or scholarships would require the consent of the Minister.  That would appear to me to be contrary to the Deputy's wishes in this matter and to cut across the arguments he has made. I can see that it might not represent exactly what he would want to do and I think the Deputy would agree with me on this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Chair is allowing discretion to the Deputy on this occasion to speak again on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to answer the points made.  First, the Minister said there might be some legal difficulty about the concept of a certain <Col N="1515" /> standard and who would determine the standard.  I am open to advice on the legal significance of the terms I have chosen.  What I intend by that is to distinguish between grants and scholarships.  Grants are awarded to those who reach a certain standard. Depending on the number who reach that standard, grants are given and this is the grants system operated by the universities.  I wish to distinguish this from scholarships, where it is decided to give a fixed number of scholarships to those who achieve the highest standards, perhaps subject to the provision that unless people achieve those high standards scholarships may not be awarded in certain instances.</P>
      <P>They are two quite different systems. The phraseology I chose was designed to define in as near as I could get to legal terminology the concept of grants under the Higher Education Authority as they operate, namely, anyone who gets four honours in leaving certificate, reaching a certain standard which will be defined by the Minister&mdash;or in this instance by the board&mdash;will get a grant which will last him through his college career.  This is what I call a grant and I think it answers the Parliamentary Secretary who suggested that I was tying down the college in regard to scholarships.</P>
      <P>I am only tying down the college in regard to grants of the kind given for higher education to those who reach a certain standard to enable them to continue with their career.  These are social grants rather than academic scholarships.  They are designed to achieve the social purpose of enabling people who reach a certain standard to achieve higher education.  They are different from scholarships which are an award for excellence, given only in a limited number of cases.  The Minister may be suggesting that the Parliamentary draftsman may have thought that the phraseology &ldquo;a certain standard&rdquo; did not quite convey what I had in mind but, if that were so, I am sure the draftsman would have found some way around it if the Minister had thought the amendment commended itself to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's amendment, <Col N="1516" /> I find his argument unsatisfactory. I wonder if his Department have informed him fully of the circumstances in which the scholarships to which he has referred came into existence?  The scholarships which he described correctly as Department of Education scholarships have nothing to do with the college.  What happened was that prior to the grants scheme students coming to the college were entitled to sit for entrance scholarship examinations in the college.  Scholarships were awarded lasting for one year on the basis of that examination.</P>
    <P>However, it was also possible for students to get scholarships from the county councils up to that time.  These scholarships were awarded in accordance with a certain scheme.  The introduction of the grants scheme eliminated the county council scholarships but, unfortunately, there were people who would have got such scholarships because of the high standards they would have reached but who, perhaps, because of the means test, would be ineligible for them.  This created the situation where the then Minister in seeking to introduce a grants scheme of a desirable and welcome, although inadequate, character was unintentionally eliminating the scholarship system which benefits people who could not benefit from the new scheme.</P>
    <P>This gave rise to concern and the Department met this by introducing a certain number of Department of Education scholarships.  These scholarships are not university scholarships and, in fact, the colleges are most unhappy about them because they consider they were tricked into taking these on with the promise of additional money which evaporated once the scheme was started.  They are the cause of considerable dispute between the Department and at least one of the colleges.</P>
    <P>In equating the Department of Education scholarships with university entrance scholarships, the Minister is confusing the issue.  The simple fact is that the university colleges have their own entrance scholarships which have nothing to do with the Department. They are decided on at the colleges' discretion and there is no departmental <Col N="1517" /> control exercised in the matter.  The Minister has no function in relation to the university entrance scholarships and I can see no reason why he should have a function in relation to the total amount of money to be spent by this particular institution on scholarships of the same kind, namely, their entrance scholarships, possibly payable to a student who does very well in order to carry him through his first year or any subsequent scholarships, bursaries or prizes that may be awarded at a later stage in his career.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not given any reason for wishing to exercise a control which he does not exercise over the equivalent university scholarships, bursaries and prizes.  I found his reason for introducing a principle of earmarking for this kind of expenditure unsatisfactory and rather worrying.  The Minister appeared to be saying that there would be no danger of the board going wild in providing scholarships and grants and I saw here the rather ominous tight control of the Department of Finance, working through the Department of Education.  The Department of Finance would make sure that the amount of money would be so small there would be no question of going wild on it.</P>
    <P>This new board should be put in the same position as the universities: namely, entitled to operate their own system of scholarships in the strict sense of the word as I defined it previously, using as much funds for that purpose as they thought proper and felt able to do, given the other requirements it would have to meet out of the funds available.  I accept that if a system were introduced of genuine grants for people reaching a certain standard and payable throughout the whole career of the students, these would be so closely associated with the higher education grant scheme that the Minister would have a proper interest in them and he ought to have some control over them.</P>

It would leave the college completely free in the matter of entrance scholarships each year and any other such bursaries or prizes the college wanted.</P>

The Minister, having heard the arguments, may reconsider the position and be prepared to accept my amendment as drafted or half of his amendment.  I think I have given good and sufficient reasons for my amendment.  His amendment seems unnecessary, indeed extremely unnecessary, and I suggest that either he modifies his amendment to delete the offending words or else that he would perhaps accept my amendment.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 5 to delete lines 3 to 6 and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  there shall be eight ordinary members of the College Council of whom one shall be the Director, and a Chairman;</P>
      <P>(b)  No member of the College Council shall be a civil servant&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In its present form, the amendment has two purposes.  Paragraph (b) is that the College Council shall not have a civil servant as a member.  For reasons of general principle, I do not think it is proper civil servants should be members of boards of educational institutions. I am not convinced of the desirability of their being members of State bodies, except in particular circumstances.  There are special cases which I have recognised in another form, in another place.  There may be a transitional changeover of Departmental control of a State body or there may be a particular need for special liaision.  In such cases a civil servant on a board may be desirable but I think it is undesirable as a general principle.  In this instance it is particularly undesirable because of the need to make a fresh start in view of the fact, as the Minister has said, that the present arrangements in the college have not worked out as happily as they might have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to paragraph (a), I will try to explain my reasoning.  It seems to me undesirable that this body should be one in which there would be a non-academic majority.  By non-academic for this purpose I mean a majority of people other than staff and student representatives.  I am not saying that staff and students should be a majority but I think the desirability of strong academic representation of at least half of the total number should be seriously considered.  I have accepted the Minister's proposals for staff and student representation and I <Col N="1521" /> have not received representations from either staff or students to amend them, and the only way of ensuring they would not be in a minority is to limit the total membership of the board to eight&mdash;this may seem a rather round-about way of arriving at eight.  I had thought of limiting staff and student representation to two each.  I would be glad if the Minister would indicate whether he is prepared to give consideration to either of these aspects of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept these amendments.  While the Deputy has stated that he would not want the student and teacher side to be in the majority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in practice, if the director is included, they would be a majority on the governing body.  So far as I can remember, the Deputy said at the Committee Stage that such a situation might lead to inbreeding. As I see it, the college is there to serve the community and not the community to serve the college.  The overall control in relation to a college should not rest on those who operate inside the college day after day.  In a situation such as I have mentioned, I would be afraid that those concerned would not be able to see the wood for the trees and for that reason I cannot accept the first of the Deputy's amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the second of the two amendments, it is rather unfortunate that he should have put down an amendment of this kind, particularly in view of the recent past history of the college.  I suppose it would appear to civil servants as if they were to be regarded as people who were not suited for this type of work.  Apart from any other considerations, a civil servant could have an artistic bent and it is quite possible that he could contribute very effectively to the running of the college.  However, what I consider to be unfortunate in so far as the tabling of this particular amendment is concerned is that during the past year, or perhaps two years, there has been a very particular type of antagonism towards officials of my Department.  To say the <Col N="1522" /> least of it, this antagonism was irrational.  I might add that, of course, I had no intention of appointing a civil servant but, because of the history of the college, I regret that this amendment was tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy FitzGerald himself has remarked, neither the staff nor the students have complained to him or to anyone else about the representation being given to them on the new board.  I would suggest that that is not surprising because the representation being given to them under this Bill is, in principle, a very significant if not a total breakthrough. I think everybody has recognised the breakthrough in this representation on the board of teachers and students. Under the Bill it is proposed to give a representation of four out of a total of, I think, 11.  This is a considerable representation, but we must not go too far too quickly.  What is suggested in the Deputy's amendment is that we reduce the number to eight, thereby ensuring that two students and two members of the staff and a director would provide automatically 55 per cent of the total representation: in other words, that those associated immediately with the college, either by way of students or staff, would provide five-eights of the personnel of the board.</P>
      <P>Frankly, I do not know whether the public who, I concede freely, are not the final arbiters of what is good art or of what is the function of an art college, will be of the opinion that they, or someone other than those associated directly with the college, will have some say in the matter.  I would go so far as to say that it is a situation where we would be blazing a very new and, possibly, very delicate trail for which there is certainly no precedent here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When one considers, both collectively and individually, the staff and student representation, one will find that this is a precedent.  It is not reasonable to ask that we should go further, because if this college is to be what we might call a channel of influence on the public and on the public attitude towards art and artistic creation it is important that there will be others on the board who are not associated directly with the college&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On this aspect of autonomy the Labour Party representatives might have a different view, but I am putting the views of my own party.  Our attitude is that at the third level in particular academic institutions should, in large measure, be self-governing but that at the same time it is desirable that at the third level and, indeed, at post-primary level also, the public interest be represented.  It is that principle that has formed our third level education in this country since the Universities Act of 1908.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what the Parliamentary Secretary said, 13 of the 34 members of the governing bodies of the universities are public representatives, appointed either by the Minister or selected in various ways by the local authorities or in the case of UCD <i>ex officio</i> by the Lord Mayor of Dublin. The Government of that time, which I have already had occasion to contrast favourably with the present administration, took the view that on the one hand the principle of self-government of an academic institution should be preserved and that it should therefore provide within itself the majority of the representatives on the governing body, but that there should be a significant and strong minority representation of the public interest.  That principle is a good one.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary should take a different view.  It is a step backwards at this stage to move away from the concept of staff and students being the people principally concerned with running an educational institution with the help of outsiders who can bring a breath of fresh air to the institution and prevent it from becoming inbred. To many people, including myself, the representation in respect of the NUI is unsatisfactory and anti-democratic, but the basic concept of the students and staff and the graduates having a majority representation and the public interest having a minority representation is a good one.  I regret that principle is now being rejected.  Perhaps the original drafting of the Bill was designed specifically to put them in a minority.  That is a pity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister regretted that I should <Col N="1525" /> put down an amendment on the question of the presence on the board of a civil servant.  The Minister is wrong about this.  In saying that he is being over-influenced by a loyalty to his own staff, which is commendable in itself but which should not be allowed to affect legislation of considerable durability. The Minister and his staff may have had a raw deal.  They may have been criticised unfairly.  The Minister and his staff are entitled to feel that is so.  It is commendable that the Minister should express his views about this matter but he should not be so moved by it as to enshrine it in legislation even negatively, by non-exclusion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is doing this by refusing to accept my amendment.  I am giving the Minister the chance to cover this point and to provide that no member of the College Council shall be a civil servant.  For the Minister not to accept the amendment is to insist that this issue be kept open and that civil servants could be appointed.  This is bad for the general reason I have stated earlier.  I see no reason for departing from that principle.  It is also bad because of the history of the college.  The Minister misunderstands me in thinking that I am over-sensitive when he takes the line he does on this point.  In relation to this, I have not said that particular civil servants were unacceptable.  I did not comment on who was responsible for the problems of the college.  I avoided speaking on these matters in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows more about the problems of the college than I do, and if it is the case that all the blame rests with the staff and the students and none with the civil servants&mdash;though I find it hard to believe that and I have some evidence to the contrary in relation to one particular matter which I produced in this House&mdash;the fact remains that this college is in a position where, because of the manner in which it has been allowed to run on under the present arrangements which the Minister himself says are not suitable, a polarisation has built up which has <Col N="1526" /> created a neurosis on both sides.  I cannot say whether the civil servants are feeling sensitive about the way they have been treated.  I suspect that they must feel badly.  They should never have been involved in trying to do this job which was politically imposed on them.  The staff and students feel a neurosis about the civil servants involved. If they feel that, it is irrelevant whether they are justified in their feelings or whether it is their own fault or whether the civil servants behaved skilfully or impeccably throughout.</P>
    <P>If that feeling exists it is desirable to avoid starting this thing off on the wrong foot.  This could lead to a continuation of attitudes which will do damage.  The Minister said that it was not his intention to appoint civil servants to the board.  The appointment of civil servants at this stage could lead to a continuation of damaging attitudes.  The Minister wished to leave the question open because there might be a civil servant of considerable artistic ability at some time and he could be very useful on the board.  I accept that.  Poetry and literature in this country have been enriched by the Civil Service.  Much of the talent in this country is contained in the Civil Service.  It is surprising that the contributions of civil servants to the culture of this country have not been very great.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that he does not intend to appoint a civil servant to the board, and, on the basis that there could be a reason at some future stage why a particular civil servant could prove for artistic reasons eminently suitable, I shall not press this part of the amendment.  I regret that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are insistent on the principle of minority participation for staff and students.  The whole concept of participation by people in the running of their own affairs is one which the Government have failed to grasp.  Perhaps this is so because they have been in office throughout the whole period when the growth of this feeling has emerged.  One must cast one's mind back to when this Government came into office.  The Government have been in office rather a long time.  There <Col N="1527" /> may be a divergence of views as to whether they have been in office too long or not.  They have been here rather a long time by the normal standards of democratic government. When they came into office vocational bodies were only beginning to play an effective and useful role.  The concept of people running their own affairs instead of having everything done for them paternalistically by the State was something new.  This concept did not emerge in the early decades of the State.  From the late 1950's onwards, and particularly in the 1960's, Irish people have come to feel that they have a role to play in running their own affairs.  This Government, having been in office throughout this whole period of resurgence in the real sense of Sinn Féin, have retained paternalistic attitudes which were perhaps necessary until the 1950's but are now completely outmoded.  One of the reasons why the Government seem irrelevant to some people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is relevant to point out the divergence of attitudes.  It is regrettable that this divergence is showing up so much in this instance. Sixty years ago students were not thought of as having a role.  We now seem to be coming to where the role of the college in the running of its own affairs is to be diminished.  It would appear that the staff and students together are now to have only a minority role in the running of their own affairs. This is a mistake.</P>

      <P>Deputy FitzGerald will note that again I am taking cognisance of the comments he made on Committee Stage that the members of An Bord should nominate the chairman from among their members.  It will be noted that in my amendment certain members of the board are specifically excluded from being nominated <Col N="1529" /> as chairman.  These are the director, the two teacher representatives and the two student representatives. I do not think anybody could reasonably suggest that the chairman should be appointed from among those operating inside the college, those employed day in and day out in the college.  I strongly feel that the chairman should be detached and neutral. I should add I have gone a long way towards meeting the case made by Deputy FitzGerald on Committee Stage in agreeing that, while the chairman will be appointed by the Minister, he will be elected by the members of the board.</P>

      <P>The Minister has met me very fairly on this.  His amendment is a good deal longer and more complicated than mine and I am sure there are very good legal reasons for that.  I am sure that in that respect his amendment is better than mine.  I note what he says about the chairman not being a staff or student member. Given the form of this institution, that it will have a director who will be an executive and a part-time chairman of the governing board&mdash;and I am not convinced that this is necessarily the right formula&mdash;I think the Minister is right in that.  It would be wrong to have a director while another member of the staff was chairman.  This would be topsy-turvy.  The Minister is right in making that provision, given the format of the board.  We might have thought of a different format altogether but, given that this is what we have, the Minister's amendment meets what I have in mind and covers the technical points involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 5, at the end of line 20, to insert &ldquo;provided that the method of choice shall either involve a single election employing the single transferable <Col N="1531" /> vote or, if two separate elections are held for the two nominations, the numbers of electors in each case shall be approximately equal&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a variation of a Committee Stage amendment.  The Minister implied reasonably enough on Committee Stage that my amendment tied down the system of election too closely and that it might also have had a slightly ideological air about it, as if I were trying to push PR as the only possible system even in this type of election.  In the light of those considerations I tried to see how one could so word an amendment as to exclude the danger to which I adverted at some length last week, a danger for which the Minister should have more concern, the danger of any group of either staff or students dominating the representation if they had 51 per cent of the votes, or possibly in some instances less, and getting both the seats.</P>
    <P>In view of the desirability of avoiding that and the desirability of leaving the method of election as open as possible I devised this amendment.  If there is to be an open election for the two posts together, there is no way I can think of of doing this in a manner that will not leave open the bloc vote system with 51 per cent getting both the seats, except the transferable vote.  My knowledge of electoral systems is limited. Maybe there is something I have not thought of but I cannot think of any other way of doing it.  One way of avoiding the dilemma which would be posed by such an electoral system would be to have two separate elections and to divide the staff and students into two constituencies.</P>
    <P>My other amendment excluded this possibility, or did not advert to it.  It did not leave open the possibility of a simple &ldquo;X&rdquo; vote system.  I am convinced that PR is preferable but I do not want to be ideological about it.  If half the staff were temporary and half were permanent we could divide them into two groups.  I hope the proportion of permanent staff will be far higher than half in future.  There is no reason why we should not have two constituencies and let each elect one person. It seems quite a good idea to let them <Col N="1532" /> each elect their own representative instead of having an election for two representatives in which one group might sweep the board leaving half of the staff unrepresented.</P>
    <P>Therefore it is desirable to amend my original amendment and to leave this open.  It is the same in the case of the students.  A similar division could be effected.  If the Minister does not want to introduce a PR election for two seats, it is open to him, under this amendment, to divide the students into two groups&mdash;foundation students and other students, perhaps, if they are of approximately equal size&mdash;and to have two separate elections so that they will both be represented.  This amendment is more open than the other.  It is designed to be as open as possible while excluding only one thing, that is, a single election for two seats by an &ldquo;X&rdquo; system.</P>
    <P>I commend and recommend the amendment to the Minister.  I hope he is prepared to consider it because, as far as I can see, the only form of election it excludes is the one dangerous form of election which we should properly exclude.  It would leave it open to those concerned to devise their own system subject to a single limitation.  I could have drafted it the other way around and done it by exclusion but I found difficulty in describing in suitable technical language the &ldquo;X&rdquo; voting system for two seats.  I am sure it has a suitable term and if Miss Enid Lakeman were around I could have asked her but in her absence I was not too sure how it should be described properly.  Instead of doing it by exclusion I did it in this form.</P>
    <P>The amendment or something like it is desirable.  It avoids the danger of a system under which half of the students and/or half of the staff might be unrepresented.  I was worried by the Minister's statement on the last occasion that he would accept any system proposed by a majority because 51 per cent of the students or staff could propose a system under which they would get both seats.  It could have very unfortunate results if half of those concerned in either group were unrepresented.  I hope the Minister will <Col N="1533" /> give favourable consideration to my amendment.</P>

      <P>When the Deputy was speaking earlier he tended to think that I was tied too closely to the situation as it is at present and that many of the proposals formulated by me were formulated because of this.  He mentioned in particular the situation in relation to civil servants.  My reaction at that time in my own mind&mdash;I was not permitted to reply to him&mdash;was that I could hardly visualise him putting down that specific type of amendment if he did not have at the back of his mind what the situation had been like in the college.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>When we are directing our attention to this Bill&mdash;and I agree that there is a certain amount of difficulty in it&mdash;we should try to get away from what the present situation is and what the situation has been for the past year or two.  We should try to make our proposals on the basis of what we would hope it will be like in the future.  For that reason I believe that it would create a better atmosphere if I were to leave the method of election open as I am doing.</P>
      <P>I gave all the reasons when we were discussing this on Committee Stage as to why I do not propose to tie the hands of the teachers or students in the type of election they would adopt. I do not propose to go back over that again.  I would qualify it in this way that perhaps I should have said that I am prepared to accept, within reason, proposals regarding elections put forward by teachers and students.  Having listened to Deputy FitzGerald, while not willing to accept his particular method&mdash;it has no bearing on PR; it is simply that I do not want to tie anybody's hands at this stage&mdash;it is as well that I should re-emphasise what I have said here, that is, that I would accept the proposals put forward by the teachers and students, within reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find difficulty sometimes in relation <Col N="1534" /> to Deputy FitzGerald's amendments that he tends at times to make arguments which run counter to what he has been plugging&mdash;if you like to put it that way&mdash;in relation to this Bill all the time, that is, that things should be left as free as possible.  I have endeavoured to meet him in relation to this in many instances and I did accept in relation to some of the proposals he put forward that they were an improvement on the proposals that I had originally put in the Bill and I accepted them on that basis; but in this particular case he seeks to control the situation too rigidly.  Of course, he has given his arguments for this.  Nevertheless, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves it would possibly create an atmosphere of goodwill if the students and the teachers and myself could come to an agreement as to the best possible manner in which the election could take place.  That is why I prefer to leave it open rather than to tie down the situation, so that we could have discussions on this and come as near as possible to agreement on it.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is that elections will take place on a number of occasions. There will be the first election and then after a number of years another election, and so on.  If it is found that the first type of election devised or agreed upon does not turn out to be satisfactory over a period of years it will be possible to alter it.</P>

    <P>I have accepted on a previous occasion that the Deputy is a very able debater but in this instance he is arguing to a very considerable extent against the type of case that in general terms he has argued in relation to the college generally.  I want to emphasise that in order to create a reasonably <Col N="1535" /> good atmosphere what I would like to do is to try to come to an agreement with the students and with the teachers as to the type of elections they would prefer.

      <P>I hope so.  The Deputy, in fact, has proved one thing by putting down the alternative, that is, that the amendment he had the last day was not the final answer.  All of us will agree that the single transferable vote is one of the equitable types of voting but when the Deputy then saw the other alternative&mdash;on the last occasion he only had that particular choice&mdash;it is evident that the argument we posed on the last day is relevant, that there may well be other types and that if we write into the legislation these specific provisions that the Deputy requests, we are excluding all these other types.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might suggest one or two of them&mdash;again I am not the expert on this but, from recollection of the Constitutional Committee Report, there is, for instance, a well-known system of election, the points system, where one's first choice is worth, let us say, ten points.  This is a system used throughout the world, not as regularly as what is called the straight vote or what is called proportional representation.  Nevertheless, the record is there that it does exist and, possibly, for people of the artistic temperament of the electorate in this case, it may in many ways reflect a balancing of their first choice and second choice and, in some ways, a valuation of what the first choice means and what the second choice means.  That <Col N="1536" /> system does exist and who is to say whether or not art teachers or art students might not like that very system?  If we accept the Deputy's amendment, they are not entitled to use it and we will have to come back to the House to propose an amendment. God forbid that that would happen for a purpose of that sort.</P>
      <P>I hope I am not misinterpreting the Deputy.  I would readily share his concern if there were a possibility of two blocks, block A and block B, one possibly 51 per cent and the other 49 per cent.  Has the Deputy not thought of the possibility that in this very House we have three blocks and we have had in the past four blocks and five blocks.  Is there any reason why in the College of Art one would be confined to just two blocks of students?  You could have a situation arising where some students would, for instance, be proposing greater representation on the board for the students and less for the staff and who would make it the plank of their election campaign that they would propose that to whoever they should propose it. Others might have different views. Others again might have different views.</P>
      <P>I have to grant that in what one might call normal circumstances, if we always had a guarantee of normal circumstances, the proposal the Deputy has put down is both desirable and, I would suggest, even adequate.  But who is to say that we would always have normal circumstances and who is to say that the students or the staff might not opt for other systems?  If they do, then I think the Deputy would be just as reluctant as we are to bring it all back into the House for the purpose of amending the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the Minister is doing in this case the prudent thing, that is, that he will accept the system of election, subject to reason, that the students and staff propose.  This may, in fact, mean that, if they use one system in an election, next year they may propose a different system and, if it is an accepted system of election there is no reason why it should not commend itself.  But if we accept this amendment we are <Col N="1537" /> tied to it for all times, at least tied to it in the absence of amendment here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the Parliamentary Secretary's arguments more convincing than the Minister's in this particular case and I am glad that he rose to give us his arguments.  He has made a case against the amendment on the grounds that it limits the students to two possible systems and there may be others.  I think it is rather notional because this points system, all right, exists somewhere but I cannot imagine where because I cannot remember what I read in the Constitutional Committee Report four years ago.  But in this country, in fact, the only systems of voting which are known or thought of are basically the ones mentioned here.  Therefore, the point is rather theoretical.  I am much more worried about a practical point which does not seem to have struck either the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am wondering are they perhaps a little insensitive to the situation they may face.  I expressed fears that the electoral system proposed may be one designed to secure both seats for a particular block.  The Minister has responded at this stage&mdash;which he did not do at the other stage&mdash;showing some sensitivity on this score and has modified his initial enthusiasm for adopting whatever the students or staff suggest by saying &ldquo;within reason&rdquo;. The difficulty he is going to face here is, quite frankly, this.  If the students or staff put forward a proposal of the kind I have mentioned&mdash;again with the clear intention of securing all the seats for a bare majority of the group concerned and the Minister puts his foot down then and says: &ldquo;No, I will not have it, it is not within reason&rdquo;, he is building in a new sort of conflict.  If I were the Minister I would be trying to build out all possible sources of conflict and to work myself out of this college and its affairs to the maximum degree possible, consonant with the role of Minister for Education as the man who has to provide the money ultimately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fear that by leaving it on the basis of being with the consent of the Minister we are building in potential conflict. The Minister's belief that it will <Col N="1538" /> all be sorted out by sitting down around a table with the students and the staff and reason prevailing is not likely to happen.  The recent history of the college would not suggest that this is a realistic assumption.  The Minister is making a grave mistake here. I accept that my amendment can be criticised, as it has been by the Parliamentary Secretary, as being a little narrow.  It would perhaps have been better if I had confined the possible election systems&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  It might have been done better in this way, if it was possible to provide something which would exclude by law the particular type of danger I have mentioned, that is the system in which an X system is used for a two-seat constituency.  I just lack the technical expertise in description of this voting system to put it down on paper and therefore I took the easy way out by doing it the other way round which perhaps, in spite of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said may be at least theoretically a mistake.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister just to think about this&mdash;let it stand for the moment&mdash;between now and going to the other House because I really am worried about the possibility of conflicts being built in which we have now isolated.  It would not help at all if, before you even get the new board elected, in order to get it elected and to hand over the college to this group, get the Minister and his Department out of the act, the first thing that happens is that he gets into conflict with the staff and/or students under the electoral system because they want the system which he for the very good reasons that I put forward in this House does not want them to adopt. That will not start things off on the right foot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be better, I think, if instead of the Minister being put on the spot as an individual in the situation where already he has been in disagreement with some of those concerned, shall we <Col N="1539" /> say if the law were clear in the matter, that he did not have any option and he could not be blamed.</P>
    <P>Let the blame be put on this House, and, indeed, on the Opposition if necessary, for proposing the exclusion of a system which could lead to a block vote and let the Minister be in the position of saying: &ldquo;I am sorry, I cannot allow that system.  Under pressure from the Fine Gael Opposition in the House I have agreed to exclude this system.  You will have to have something else&rdquo;.  If he does not put down some amendment like that in the other House I am afraid he is building in a possible source of conflict for himself and I think this is undesirable.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to have another look at that between now and the time the matter is discussed in the other House.  I am merely thinking of his point of view.  I am not stressing any partisan view.  I am trying to save the Minister and the college trouble. The Minister finally implied inconsistency on my part in my approach.  It is not the first time he has said that. All I can do is to suggest that if he feels there is inconsistency it may be because he has not found it possible to follow all the subtleties of my thought rather than that I am inconsistent.</P>
    <P>There are two principles involved here.  One is the autonomy of this institution: get the Minister and his Department out of it; let it run itself with the minimum amount of involvement. We have done that in the Bill. The Minister has accepted a number of amendments to take out &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo; and so on.  That is important both because the general principle of autonomy is desirable in higher education and particularly because of the extent of the close involvement of the Minister and his Department in this college to date.  The second thing, having taken the Minister out, is to leave the institution as free as possible within the limits of prudence and of what this House considers desirable.</P>
    <P>You have to take both of these principles together.  When I say as free as possible I really mean that.  I mean there should be no limitation put into this <Col N="1540" /> Bill that is not shown demonstrably to be necessary.  I have proposed none and I propose to get rid of them but prudence may require certain limitations. There are limitations in the Bill. It, in various ways, lays down what can and what cannot be done.  I have not quarrelled with most of those and nobody would.  It is common sense that any institution must have some constitution to abide by, which it cannot play around with and fiddle with. The constitution of this body has been laid down by the House but you should not build in any unnecessary restrictions.</P>
    <P>It is in pursance of those two principles that I am proposing this amendment. I want to get the Minister out of the act for very good reasons, good from the Minister's point of view as well as this House and I want to have no unnecessary restrictions but there is a necessary restriction.  Any electoral system which enables half of those concerned to get all representation is a bad system and it is a necessary limitation on the college that that should be prevented.  I will go along with any necessary limitation to ensure the college works and I will oppose any which is not shown to be necessary.  I do not think I am in any way inconsistent in pursuing those principles.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, having heard me explain much more clearly than I had done previously, what has motivated me in moving this amendment to this Bill, will accept that I am not as inconsistent as he seems to be making me out to be.  I commend the amendment to the Minister for further thought.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 5, after line 24, but in subsection (7), to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>(b)  The first appointments under this subsection shall be made as soon as reasonably may be after the establishment day, but An Bord may act before such appointments are made.</P>
      <P>I felt it necessary to submit this amendment because of the definition here of student which means a person who stands entered on the students roll of the college and is following an approved course of study there.  In view of the fact that the college is closed at the present time and is likely to remain closed until such time as the board is appointed I felt it was necessary to amend this particular subsection.  As there are not, nor will there be, until the college is re-opened, students in the college following approved courses of study it would be impossible to appoint student members.  I fear that this would create a complete obstacle to the appointment of An Bord.  The amendment which I now propose, and which is before the House, will ensure that An Bord can be established in spite of the difficulties I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister worries me deeply because this is something which has not been suggested before. I am astonished to hear that this college has no students.  I understood that the college had students but that it is temporarily not working for various reasons which we need not go into.  The Minister seems to be suggesting that this board is to be established without student representation and that it is to open the college.  The Minister is likely to make the opening of the college more difficult by proceeding in that manner.  It seems to me to be very important that from the beginning the students should be represented in order to get the college opened.  We may be <Col N="1542" /> going round in what could be a very vicious circle here.</P>
      <P>I wonder could the Minister explain what he means when he says there are no students.  I understood that the college opened, the students were there and certain work proceeded.  In the foundation course two of the teachers said they would not give the course they had been given until they had got instructions.  I am not aware of the position of the other teachers but there are five teachers in the foundation course.  The students attended.  Some teachers, including one of those dismissed, did in fact give some lectures or talks to the students.  The foundation students were there and I cannot understand why there are no students.</P>
      <P>There may be some legal technicality similar to the question of registration in UCD at the moment.  The college authorities there have been talking about having no students.  This is a legal technicality.  I can tell the Minister that the place is full of students.</P>
      <P>Even on the day of the strike there were many students in the college and barring that day the place is packed with students.  It would be most unfortunate if on any legal, technical grounds the Minister proceeded to try to establish this board without student representation.  I would like to suggest that instead of adopting this expediency the Minister would consult his legal adviser as to what, if anything, may be necessary in order to enable the first elections to take place prior to the opening of the college or as soon as this Bill goes through, and the people whom we know as students of the College of Art, whatever their legal position, the ones who turned up to be taught, but who are not being taught, at the beginning of the term were elected at the same time as the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would press the Minister very hard on this.  I am shocked to hear that there is any suggestion to the contrary and I fear, lest we place any further obstacles in the way of the re-opening of the college.  If this is a legal technicality let the Minister consult his advisers and let us put in whatever clause may be necessary here.  It may be that some special section is needed saying that in the first election by the <Col N="1543" /> students the electors shall be those students in attendance at the college last year and who presented themselves again this year, having fulfilled certain requirements, and those foundation year students who presented themselves at the beginning of the year, and their identity shall be determined by some officer of the college.  There is no difficulty in devising some <i>ad hoc</i> legal formula to ensure that all the students who were there in the first week of the college will vote.  There are enough problems in the way of getting this college re-opened without adding to them by giving any students, some of whom may not be as enthusiastic for getting things going as smoothly again as others, any excuse to say that this college had been started off without student representation, that the director will be appointed, that it is all a way of keeping students out.  Do not let us do anything to enable anyone, whether genuinely or acting as an agitator, to say things like that.  I think the Minister should reconsider the amendment along the lines I propose.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to argue the merits of whether or not it should be closed or the grounds on which the decision was taken.  That is a different matter entirely.  If we accept the fact that the college is now closed, under the Bill as it stands possibly the board could not even be constituted which, one would hope, would be the first step towards re-establishing normality in the college under this autonomous board, with all students and staff and everyone else concerned. For that reason, the important thing is to allow that first step of normality to be taken even in present circumstances and this is precisely what this amendment is about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.  Very clearly it relates only to this particular time.  It says here:</P>
      <P>The first appointment under this subsection shall be made as soon as reasonably may be after the establishment day, but An Bord may act before such appointments are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It refers only to the first appointment. There is no question of this being a permanent exclusion.  It is simply intended to overcome the rather unusual situation that you do not have students within the definition of the Bill at present.  As soon as the board are constitued and as soon as we have students, and we hope that will be as soon as possible, then the normal provisions <Col N="1545" /> of the Bill will come into effect.  It can be argued&mdash;and this is where the Deputy might have had some grounds&mdash;that one would just look on the absence of students in the ordinary course as creating vacancies and the board could have acted in any event.  It could possibly be argued that the board could have acted and could have continued to act without making any reference to this first appointment only.  However, the fact that the Minister has seen fit to make it clearly refer to the present situation and the first appointments means that that potential disquiet cannot now arise. Whatever grounds there may be for dissatisfaction&mdash;and we all hope normality will be restored soon&mdash; there can be no grounds for any suspicion arising out of this amendment. It is purely meant to deal with the situation as it is, and I would hope we could put it forward to all concerned on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary is just being a little bit naïve in saying it does not create any problem.  I quite see the amendment is designed to enable the board to be established, that as soon as the college is re-opened the students would be enrolled and the election would then proceed.  It is good to have that made clear, I suppose.  However, the problem remains that the board will be appointed, will organise the re-opening of the college, will perhaps take the first steps towards the appointment of a director&mdash;that is a matter of great urgency&mdash;and will do this without student representation. This creates very serious dangers.  Certainly I would hope it will not, and the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary can be assured that anything I can do, if this goes through in this form, to persuade the students to co-operate, I will do.  However, I am afraid the Minister is playing into the hands of anyone who wants to make difficulties, because in this form the students will not have representation on the board which will re-open the college.  Of all the places where you want student representation it is on the board which has to perform this difficult task when the college re-opens.  It <Col N="1546" /> is very important to reconsider this. There may be legal difficulties, although it would seem to me that there should not be, I presume the students were on some kind of a roll; perhaps they were not.  Perhaps they were so disorganised that that never happened.  Perhaps like the university it takes several weeks before the registration process begins.  My assumption was that there were students, but the college had been suspended for a period, which could be regarded as a prolonged Christmas holiday.  After all, the college is not open at Christmas and Easter.  There are still students pursuing courses of studies, although they are not actually pursuing them on Christmas day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It holds water in the sense that if the college once opens for an academic year, the students are enrolled and they are pursuing approved courses of studies which have been temporarily suspended just as they are during the holidays.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary suggesting that during the Christmas holidays they could not have an election because at that particular moment students are not pursuing a course of studies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary is not suggesting that, then the definition of pursuing a course of studies does not entail students being in the college on that day pursuing a course of studies.  It accepts that there can be interruptions.  The nature and extent of those interruptions are undefined.  Either the College of Art opened and the students enrolled, or they did not.  If they did enrol then they are on the roll for this academic year.  There is an interruption which is akin in legal terms, but not in any other terms, to holidays.  If, in fact, there is a legal problem and if they have not enrolled, fair enough, but, either way, the Minister must find some way around it.  We cannot leave <Col N="1547" /> legislation in this form.  We cannot have a vicious circle where some students might persuade their colleagues that the college should not re-open if there are no student representatives on the board and, therefore, the re-opening date may be held up. What is required here is a commonsense approach.  We know who the students are.  Everybody knows what students turned up.  It is not such a huge place.  The number of new students is quite small.  The names of them are known to the staff.  It is merely a question of making a list of these students, having them vote and getting the new board going with full student representation.  If that requires legal formality to overcome the legal effect of the definition section, then let us devise an appropriate formula for that saying that: &ldquo;Notwithstanding the definition of student in section 1, for the purpose of the first election anybody who attended at the college and pursued a course of studies there on such and such dates shall be construed as being a student of the college&rdquo;.  I cannot draft something on my feet which will pass the parliamentary draftsman, but something on those lines could be done.  There is no legal obstacle and commonsense dictates this should be done.  We should not risk anything that will endanger the smooth and peaceful re-opening of the college.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might add my voice to that of Deputy FitzGerald's.  He is, I think, perhaps characteristically, more one who seeks a compromise than I do but, in this case, I want to endorse what he has been saying because there is a real confrontation situation here.  There is a sort of hen or egg situation; you cannot have a valid election of student representation to the board until you get the college going and you cannot get the college going until you have valid student elections and student representatives on the board.  It is a vicious circle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two sides to this.  The final act of suspending the college was taken by the Minister.  As I understand <Col N="1548" /> it, the academic year has begun and, unless there is some very elaborate registration mechanism, there are recognised students in all years, including the foundation course.  There has been a suspension.  I am interested in the Parliamentary Secretary's insistence on the words &ldquo;approved course of studies&rdquo; because I find it hard to believe that an institution of third level teaching under the control of the Minister would have any courses other than approved courses.  I believe there are registered students and that there is a student roll.  I believe the student year started.  There may be holes in the roll, but it does exist, and there are courses of study which have at least the approval of past ministerial decision and the sanction of use over many years.  I know there are courses one could criticise, but at least they are there and they have been functioning. There is no radical departure from what were approved courses in other years.  One could have endless semantic or legal arguments as to how comparable the present recess is with the normal vacation, but that is not the heart of the matter.  One is really looking for a way to get the thing going again and surely a resumption under the present dispensation would enable the situation to arise in which it could happen approved courses of study were being followed by students on a roll.  I think the mechanism should be gone through in that way.  If you insist the present college is dead and nothing can exist until the new board takes over, you cannot get a valid board off the ground until something is functioning and that something cannot function properly until you have a valid board.  Deputy FitzGerald's compromise gets everybody off the hook.  While I do not always approve of compromise I am happy to endorse it in this particular case.  I suggest the Minister might consider what Deputy FitzGerald suggests.</P>

      <P>The fact is that one entire class has not yet enrolled or did not enrol before the college was closed. In any case, this would be a new college and, on that basis, nobody is enrolled. Deputy FitzGerald seems to be concerned about when the students could be elected and appointed to the board. First of all, I want to ensure that the board will be legally constituted.  The Parliamentary Secretary has gone into that aspect pretty fully.  I visualise the college opening, the students going back, being enrolled and immediately electing their representatives to be appointed by me to the board.  I cannot see where this will make any great difficulty.  The basic consideration is to ensure that the board as constituted will be a legally constituted board.  If I could have avoided putting down this amendment I would have avoided it.  I was not anxious to put forward a subsection like this, but I recognised the need for it.  In fact what I am doing here is protecting the legality of the board.  I can assure Deputy FitzGerald that, immediately the students are enrolled and following approved courses, the election will take place and those elected will be appointed by me to the board.  That will be done as quickly as possible.  Whatever we may argue about the principle of the thing, the practical situation is that, unless we operate in this way, we will not have a legally constituted board.  A legally constituted board is of basic importance.  We cannot open the college at all until we have a board to open it.  As I said earlier, it does not appear as if it will be possible to open the college until such time as the new authority is appointed.  If that is so, then we must have a proper authority and, when that authority is appointed, we can have the college opened, the students enrolled, following approved courses, and immediately having their election and being appointed to the board.</P>

      <P>There is plenty of evidence to show that the Minister listens to his advisers but there is less evidence to show that he listens to me. There is no evidence in his reply that he took in either of the points I was making or the solution I proposed.  The Minister may either reject the point <Col N="1550" /> or reject the solution, but he should if debate is to mean anything, at least advert to them; this he did not do.  First of all, he starts with a basic misconception. He said an extraordinary thing for which there is no warrant of any kind in the Bill: this is really a new college and there are no students of the new college in existence now and, even if it were opened, there would not be any students until it is established.  I cannot follow that at all.  I read section 1 of the Bill: a student of the college, as it now is, means a person who stands entered in the student roll of the college.  I want to know what the college is.  Where do I go?  I look at section 1 again and I find the college has the meaning specified in section 2 of this Act.  I then move down to section 2.  It is customary for draftsmen to send one chasing around.  Section 2, subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>In this Act &ldquo;the College&rdquo; means the college of art, crafts and design known as the National College of Art and situate at Kildare Street, Dublin.</P>
      <P>and in section 2:</P>
      <P>In this Act &ldquo;the College&rdquo; means the college of art, crafts and design known as the National College of Art and situated at Kildare Street, Dublin.</P>
      <P>It is spelt out there.  It is not a question that there is no college in existence now; the existing college is having its organisation transformed and there are students of the National College of Art situated at Kildare Street, Dublin.  That is the definition here: they exist and, had this whole thing not happened, this closure, they would be students of that college and they would be entitled to elect.  To suggest that until the new college comes into existence and the board is appointed you cannot have elections because there are no students and therefore there can be no staff of the college on that principle&mdash;this is ludicrous.  I think the Minister at that point slipped up.  I suspect that was not in the brief he had, that it was a momentary aberration on his part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having dealt with that, or putting it on one side, the Minister has not adverted at all to the point I made. <Col N="1551" /> He talks of it all being so simple: you set up this board without the students: then open the college; the students come trooping back and you have your election.  Surely, by now the Minister has enough experience of student problems, particularly at the National College of Art, not to assume that life would ever be very simple where students are concerned.  They may not see it this way.  It may be&mdash; and I regret it is necessary in this debate, because the matter has been raised, to talk in such terms; I do not want to put ideas into anyone's head, but it is necessary, if we are to get this matter cleared up and avoid trouble, to get it settled at this stage.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister that it may not happen like that.  It is possible the students may be unhappy about going back into a college whose board does not include student representatives under the Bill and the fact that they are to be told as soon as they come back and as soon as they follow approved courses of study&mdash;whatever they are; approved by whom is not at all clear&mdash;that then there will be an election at a stage when the board may already have taken very fundamental decisions about the running of the college and perhaps decisions about the appointment of a director.  The students may very well be unhappy about that.</P>
    <P>The Minister should advert to the suggestion I made.  He said he is not concerned with legalities, that he wants to get on with the practical business of opening the college, taking merely whatever legal steps are necessary.  I am in exactly the same position.  I want the college re-opened. It is a practical problem.  Let us find a practical solution and let the parliamentary draftsman put it in legal language.</P>
    <P>I suggested a formula which I think would meet the point.  There is a doubt at least as to whether there are at this moment students of the college as defined in section (1).  If there is such a doubt what is required is a transitional section in the Bill to say that notwithstanding the definition of students in section (1), for the purpose <Col N="1552" /> of the first nominations by students of two members of the board those people shall be deemed to be students &mdash;&ldquo;deemed&rdquo; is the parliamentary draftsman's great word on such occasions&mdash;who were attending the college and pursuing a course of study there &mdash;if he likes to say it&mdash;in whatever week it was in October.  I am quite sure that if the Minister can see the wisdom and desirability of it and the dangers of not accepting it and goes to the parliamentary draftsman there will be no difficulty in drafting a legal formula to achieve this practical result which will enable the elections to proceed simultaneously for staff and students and avoid the creation of any excuse for students not participating for the reopening of the college on what would be no doubt, in the Minister's view, and might very well be, spurious grounds of their not being represented.</P>
    <P>Spurious or valid is irrelevant; if you give the students grounds for feeling that there may well be people to make the most of that who will thereby hold up the opening of the college. It is very unwise not to have the students in on the board on the ground floor from the very first meeting, when the board begins to regulate its procedure and elect a chairman.  How is this board to proceed?  Will it elect a chairman without the students being present to have a voice in that?  If it does not elect a chairman at its first or early meetings, who will chair it? Has the Minister given thought to this?</P>

      <P>The Deputy had a valid point but the problem arises on every Committee and Report Stage: one makes a constructive suggestion and the Minister naturally wants to consider it.  He can only do so by turning his attention away from the speaker who must continue talking. Sometimes I find myself repeating a little in order to give the Minister time to consider what I am saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am sorry.  The Minister was consulting at that moment.  I quite understand why he was doing so.  He may well have been wondering whether there was not something in what I was saying and was trying to consider it.  I can understand that and do not object at all.  I was concerned that the Minister should take the point I was making because it is a new point I am raising and I should like to put it to him.  It relates to the chairmanship.  When the board meets, presumably the first thing it must do is nominate a chairman for the Minister to appoint.  Will that come before the student members are there? Will they have a voice in the election of the chairman or not?  I doubt if the Minister has thought out the full implications of this.  If the students do not have that right and the chairman is elected without their having a say in it, they will probably&mdash;and I say advisedly&mdash;properly resent this procedure. On the other hand, if no chairman is to be chosen how will the board proceed in its early stages?  I do not know what the Minister has in mind. He should spell it out in greater detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very urgent to have a director appointed; the college cannot get properly off the ground without a director.  It will have a difficult year until there is a director and I think the board at its very first meeting should initiate procedure to advertise for a director.  Will it draft an advertisement in the absence of student members who may have very good and <Col N="1554" /> constructive ideas as to how one should seek a director?  If the Minister thinks about it he must realise that in the particular circumstances of this case it would be more than unfortunate, it would be disastrous if the student members were not present from the very beginning to elect a chairman and choose the director and get the college on its feet.  Apart from any spurious grounds that might be raised by people trying to make trouble, there are valid grounds that any decent student anxious to play his part would feel strongly about and that would entitle him to object to the procedure which the Minister now proposes.</P>
    <P>I suggest that between now and when the Bill goes to the other House the Minister should consider a formula of the kind I have proposed, under which the first election of students, on an <i>ad hoc</i> definition of students, would take place simultaneously with the election of members and staff representatives, so that the board with its full compliment would get off the ground from the very beginning and at the first meeting we would have a full attendance of students and staff representatives to elect a chairman and move towards choosing a director.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate some of the points I have made may not have come up for consideration until now and the Minister might be in difficulty in deciding what to do at this stage but I put it to him he should consider this further between now and when the Bill goes to the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point that there is a legal difficulty because when this Bill was drafted it was assumed that the transition from the National College of Art to the new College of Art would take place during the normal course of studies; it was not envisaged that the college would be closed.  That is a situation that has since arisen.  The Minister says he wants to be sure that the board will be legally constituted.  There will be no demur about that; it is obviously necessary. But if we turn it around the other way it is arguable that section 6 (7) says that two ordinary members of the board shall be students of the college and if this has not happened, <Col N="1555" /> because elections have not been held, could it not then be argued that in fact the board was not legally constituted? Is there not a legal argument, if one is concerned with legality, that works the other way round?</P>

      <P>I really think that if somebody with a legalistic turn of mind wanted to argue that the appointment of a chairman and all executive decisions which were made by the &ldquo;board&rdquo; before student representatives had been elected to it would be illegal.  The Parliamentary Secretary is a lawyer and perhaps we could have an opinion off the top of his head. Is there not a real legal difficulty here in that what the Bill was designing was a transition from a National National College of Art functioning to the new school and that now the National College of Art is not functioning?</P>

      <P>The Deputy would have to have some kind of legal clarity as to what would be &ldquo;in attendance&rdquo;.

There must be some reasonable clarification about this.  If students do not enrol and do not attend lectures, and this appears to be the case with a number of them, how can they be classified as students?</P>

      <P>I think the basis of this cross-talk has been that all of us, frankly, share the same intention and each of us is not necessarily trying to score points but just trying to see the way out of a rather unusual situation. I concede that there may be something in what Deputy Keating has said.  There may be something too in what I am now saying to Deputy FitzGerald.  I do not think Deputy FitzGerald's suggestion in regard to student definition can be accepted.  We can all start on the basis that the Minister's proposal is intended as reasonable and we might possibly mend the gap that Deputy Keating has referred to and introduce student representation as soon as ever possible.</P>

      <P>It says here:</P>
      <P>The first appointment under this subsection shall be made as soon as reasonably may be after establishment date.</P>
      <P>The thought that struck me was that if we could get sufficient goodwill all round the way in which we could achieve what the Deputy and I and the Parliamentary Secretary want would be to reopen the college before establishment day.  It is a thought that struck me whether it is possible or not.  If it were possible we could have the students enrolled and we could go ahead with the election.  Otherwise I have to hold by this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the merit of that but there is a difficulty here.  The Minister, I think, finds a difficulty in taking any action about the two members of the staff that were dismissed. Many of the students find a difficulty about going back unless this problem is solved.  There is a deadlock there which it is difficult to get around but which could be resolved when the college board is appointed.  The new <Col N="1558" /> board will have to decide what they will do about it.  What I envisaged was that the Bill would go through, there would be establishment day, the board appointed, perhaps, when the Christmas holidays would normally start, and the board would then sit down and decide what to do and consult with students and staff and decide what action to take.  The board might not be inhibited as perhaps the Minister is in the reappointment of members of the staff.  Perhaps they would be.  That is a matter for the board itself to decide. It is up to the board to say whether it thinks the staff should be reappointed and whether they think this is necessary or desirable for the good of the college. The board may take either view.  I would not wish to prejudge it.</P>
      <P>The difficulty in the Minister's proposal now is that it places an obstacle in the way of this because if the Minister does not find it possible to re-appoint those two members of the staff some of the students may not find it possible to come back and we may not be able to get the place reopened before establishment day.  We must be realistic.  It is for that reason that I am concerned that we should get an electoral system established which does not require the reopening of the college.  I would love to see the college reopened and anything I can do to help that I will do.  The Minister knows that.  I am fearful, judging by the lack of progress to date, it will not prove possible before establishment day, before the board is elected, and in those circumstances we need to look elsewhere for the solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we have aired the problem. No amount of drafting off the top of my or anybody else's head will produce an amendment to resolve it.  I would merely ask the Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to bear in mind what we have said and to see whether there may be an adequate legal solution to a difficult practical problem.  That means a solution, if there is one, which would have to be found in consultation with people with practical experience who know what would happen and how difficult it is to identify the students and what criteria of identification we might have.  That will have to <Col N="1559" /> be done between the Minister and his advisers and legal advisers.  Perhaps the matter could be left at this stage without the Minister committing himself in any direction.  It is very difficult for him to commit himself and we cannot offer him a copperfastened solution to the problem.  Perhaps he would look at it again in the light of this discussion.  We have tried to be helpful.  Perhaps he will look at it again to see if there is any way out of the problem other than a way out which holds certain dangers for the college, dangers that it may not prove as easy as we had hoped to get it reopened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to push this any more because there is a real difficulty which has to be resolved and we cannot resolve it here.  I was nodding vigorously when the Minister talked about reopening the college.  The point which Deputy FitzGerald has made is the central one.  I should like to see us go back to what one might call the <i>status quo anti,</i> the situation in which this Bill was drafted and in which we envisaged the transition taking place, namely with the college open and with the staff as they were at the beginning of October.  The new board will obviously be able to exercise a right of choice in the matter of staff. We have seen the compromise between the desire to give some protection on the one hand and the desire not to lumber the new board with a total staff on the other hand, and within certain limits that is a reasonable compromise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been much more critical of this Bill than Deputy FitzGerald has, but I want to say now for the record that if we had the situation of early October with all the staff and the college open&mdash;and I am saying it publicly now so there is no point in my trying to do otherwise afterwards&mdash;I would be very anxious to wade in with all the influence I possess and say, &ldquo;OK here is a new situation, it may not be perfect, but go in there, give it an honest trial and try and get the thing off the ground.&rdquo;  I cannot obviously make this undertaking for Deputy FitzGerald but my experience of his <Col N="1560" /> attitudes makes me think he would agree with me.</P>

    <P>The Minister has gone a long way to meet my amendment.  He does not go the whole way in that it will be open to the board to decide in regard to a particular relationship that it <Col N="1561" /> would permit the person to vote on his own relative, whereas I defined it clearly as no voting if the relative were &ldquo;within the second degree of kindred&rdquo;.  I am not entirely sure what the &ldquo;second degree of kindred is&rdquo; in the sense that if someone put to me a query about great nephews I might be in doubt, but it seems to me far enough removed to cover most cases where anybody would want to exercise influence for a relative, although in this country of extended families perhaps even fourth cousins might come in for a bit of a push occasionally.  The Minister's amendment has the advantage that it does not confine the relationship to any particular relationship; it does involve the disclosure to the board of the relationship whatever it may be, even if it is the tenth degree of kindred and the person knows about it.  Presumably after that has been disclosed the board would normally decide, if the relationship were in any way close, that the person concerned would not vote.  It seems to me, therefore, if I may speak on and in favour of the Minister's amendment, that his amendment meets the point I am trying to make.  It is a very useful innovation. I am not aware of its existence elsewhere. I am glad to have played some part in bringing it in and I trust it will become standard practice in similar Bills in the future.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 24, after &ldquo;imprisonment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;of more than six months' duration&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I had hoped there would be a ministerial amendment on this particular point because on the last day it did seem to me that, while I met at first a high degree of intransigence on this point from both the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, when I drew to their attention the fact that this six months provision applies to Dáil Deputies I detected a change of tone and a willingness to consider the position. I hope the absence of a ministerial amendment simply means they wish me to have full credit for having put down this amendment and having had it accepted and that it does not indicate any unwillingness to accept an amendment which I think is a desirable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be quite invidious for us to make distinctions and to reserve <Col N="1563" /> for ourselves the right to go to jail for six months without in any way affecting our £2,500 a year but to insist that much higher standards must prevail in relation to members of this board.  That type of parliamentary hypocrisy would not go down well with the public, students, or staff.  I hope we will follow the principle which we have established for ourselves of the right to serve these brief sentences in jail without prejudice to our position in this House.  Indeed, there was a long-standing political tradition here of imprisonment rather than university education for a large proportion of the TDs, although it was not necessarily always as educational.  It would be a pity, if having established this for ourselves we failed to extend this privilege to other relevant bodies.  I hope therefore the Minister will feel able to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The real reason is that here you would be introducing a new principle into legislation.  The Deputy has pointed out that the original distinction was between a felony and misdemeanour and six months was put in as the compromise in that connection. With regard to appointments to any boards under the aegis of the State, there is no precedent for suggesting that they could or should be fit people to serve on a board after being sentenced to imprisonment.</P>

      <P>There could be a possibility&mdash;I am not saying a likelihood&mdash;of this legislation tying the hands of the judiciary and creating a situation where contempt of court might be caused, not directly, by us here.  For instance, students or members of the board, staff or others&mdash;because I do not think we want to confine this to students&mdash;who were engaged in unlawful picketing and who were injuncted to restrain from that picketing but who refused to act on that injunction, would be in contempt of court and, in certain circumstances, <Col N="1565" /> could be sentenced to imprisonment for that offence.</P>

We cannot suggest that an offence that involves less than six months is not serious and that anything in excess of six months is serious.  The Deputy's instance about a student who undertakes certain activities, such as demonstrations, and is sentenced to imprisonment is an unreal one, as I pointed out previously, and it shows a lack of understanding of the attitude of the judiciary to student activities. I have not known it to happen that a student who did what the Deputy mentioned, namely, to pour blood on something, and did not do anything other than this, would be sentenced to imprisonment.</P>

      <P>My belief was that we should get through this as quickly as possible.  My intention was merely to listen to what was said and see what happened and I had not intended speaking.  Then we heard the amazing instance of a person who, in the Parliamentary Secretary's words, was injuncted for picketing.  It seems to me that this shows the chasm between us once again because I regard picketing as an extension of the process of communication in a certain, rather dramatic, way, I cannot see the faintest contradiction between someone trying to have his point of view carried out inside an institution and using this dramatic and fashionable method of communication to strengthen his position outside.  The suggestion that someone who might find himself outside some picketing law and, therefore, would exclude himself from even being considered as a member of the board, terrifies me and gets us back to square one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1567" /> now regrets having given this unfortunate instance because this is something we might divide upon?  I cannot imagine a better example of the need to be a little flexible in this instance.  He knows how fashionable picketing is this year.  Maybe after some time that fashion may be changed for some other method but to exclude people from the possibility of participating in the running of the organisation because they were involved in picketing which might be outside some picketing law seems to negate the idea that you may have valid student participation and listen to the point of view of people who do what the Establishment might consider slightly erratic and impolite things.  In fact, those are the kind of people we need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understood the Parliamentary Secretary correctly, he seemed to be saying that one might get sentenced for illegal picketing and because picketing in itself by a member of the governing authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, I did not say that because you cannot get sentenced as such for illegal picketing but if the situation went a step further and one were in contempt of court&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If someone was picketing and was injuncted not to picket but continued to do so and was then brought to court, by virtue of the fact that it was improper for a member of the governing board to be picketing, by virtue of that impropriety&mdash;whether or not the person was sentenced to imprisonment&mdash;he was deemed to be an unsuitable person to be on the board and this appeared to me to be what the Parliamentary Secretary was saying.  He astonished me somewhat because I could easily visualise circumstances in which the entire student body picketed&mdash;in fact, something similar to this happened recently in UCD, although it did not involve the entire student body&mdash;and therefore nobody would be deemed suitable to be on the board and student representation would cease until new students entered the college, people who had not been tarnished <Col N="1568" /> with this crime.  What bothers me is not the Parliamentary Secretary's reference to the imprisonment aspect but his assumption about picketing that of itself it disqualifies someone from being a member of the governing board.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the governing body of UCD.  It is not my practice to picket the college.  It is an unsuitable activity for a governor but I would not necessarily condemn some other governor if one of the student members of the college picketed the college &mdash;they probably have, for all I can recall; certainly one of them was picketing the Dáil on the subject of the night degree some months ago.  If a governor is picketing the college it does not worry me.  Nobody has suggested that that would disqualify such a student member of the governing body.  I should just like to deal with it and get rid of that unfortunate suggestion which I think we probably have not thought out.</P>
      <P>Dealing with the rest of the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary, frankly the word that came into my mind was &ldquo;feeble&rdquo; because he could not get away from the fact that it is all right for us in this House to commit offences which would merit six months in jail yet we can hang on to our remuneration and come back.  He tried to make a distinction between appointees and electees, that apparently it has been laid down in some way that it is all right for people who are elected to get six months imprisonment but not for people who are appointed.  This is the principle, but where does it come from?  Who has suddenly decided that there is this distinction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary then suggested that it is all right if you are elected because your electors might not re-elect you&mdash;that some of mine might but that in his more respectable part of the country he would be turfed out if he got a sentence of imprisonment for anything.  This may be true, but may I point out that those who are not elected are appointed and the non-student, non-staff members, may not be re-appointed because it is perfectly open to the Minister not to re-appoint them if he takes a poor view of their having been in prison for six months. <Col N="1569" /> They are in exactly the same position. Just as we are elected for five years, they are appointed for four years; and at the end of the period, when we might not be re-elected if our re-electors did not like us because we had been in prison, so the Minister, if he does not like his appointees having been in prison, would not re-appoint them.  The only difference is that he does it every four years and our electors do it every five.  I cannot see any point in principle here.</P>
    <P>In other words, the distinction the Parliamentary Secretary attempts to make is not a real distinction.  He was faced with the dilemma of trying to establish some kind of distinction between Members of the Dáil and members of this board but he could not do so and he tried to confuse the issue somewhat by the way he presented his case.</P>
    <P>Whatever views I may have had until this little debate I am quite convinced by the lack of any valid reason to the contrary that the principle which we in this Parliament have extended to ourselves must in conscience be extended to other people in other similar positions.  We are told there is no precedent.  This is nonsense.  We are a precedent first of all, and if we have set ourselves as a precedent we have to start somewhere in extending this precedent.  In so far as this is the legislation before us where the issue arises we can start here.  It has also been suggested by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister that such clauses as these are not universal and, I believe, not normal in other similar State bodies.  I am not quite sure why they come in here now or why this Department is so sensitive on the issue. There may be some precedents set by other Departments.  If so, I should be glad to hear of them.  There is a notable silence on this and there is no suggestion that this is a normal feature of legislation, that it applies to all the other State bodies, to Aer Lingus, Bord Fáilte, Córas Tráchtála and all the others, that they are all fussy about their members being in jail, that the Dáil laid down they must not have jail sentences without losing their jobs.</P>
    <P>If this were the case one would <Col N="1570" /> assume that either the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary would have mentioned it.  They have not done so. What we have not got a precedent for, it seems to me, is not leaving it out.  I am asking the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to accept this.</P>

To meet this possibility I am proposing this amendment which would enable a smooth transfer to take place without legislation being necessary.  This is something on which Deputy FitzGerald pressed me.  In my amendment I am providing for the <Col N="1571" /> nullification of section 14 and subsection (2) of section 16.

Section 7 of the Higher Education Authority Act states:</P>

      <P>It is quite a different matter.  I am not comparing everything that is in this Bill with what has been done in relation to the universities. All I was trying to point out was that in relation to section 16 (1) and (2) the situation is in line with what is being done in the universities, but I am not necessarily tying myself to the suggestion that everything done in the universities should be done here.  I see nothing wrong in that.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 47, to delete &ldquo;the College&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are merely drafting amendments. The director employs the board of the college which of itself has no powers <Col N="1573" /> of employing.  Section 15 (1) requires the board to keep proper and usual accounts of all moneys received or expended by them and therefore the registrar will be required to keep the accounts of the board.</P>

      <P>In page 8, after line 2, to add:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;provided that the term of office of the director shall be seven years, renewable for a second period of seven years&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the light of the debate on Committee Stage I decided to put forward an amendment with regard to the appointment of a director analogous to the provisions which I think are recommended by the Commission on Higher Education for the presidents of third level institutions.  It seems to me that this kind of provision is much better for this kind of institution than appointing someone for life.  The whole movement in opinion is away from that and I doubt if we will see life appointments on third level institutions in the future.  This is not considered desirable by the institutions themselves and neither did the Commission on Higher Education consider it desirable. I hope that the Minister and the Government also will move away from this.  If this is the case in respect of the universities, it should also be so in respect of this body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps seven years is rather long because here one is not dealing with somebody in a normal third level institution who has a great deal of experience of administration in the academic world; one is dealing with somebody who will try to keep an institution up-to-date in a rapidly <Col N="1574" /> evolving field.  I support this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I argued this case on Committee Stage on the basis that I could not visualise an individual accepting the position unless we were prepared to offer him the best possible terms.  I am speaking about a first-class person, a person who would be capable because this is the type of person we need on a board of this sort.  I do not know whether the change from four years to seven years makes very much difference.  On a previous occasion I pointed out that, as in the case of the Higher Education Authority, where it was recognised that it would be extremely difficult to get a first-class chairman, similarly, it would be equally difficult to find a top-class director who would be prepared to accept a job of this sort unless we could offer him the best possible terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of his contact with civil servants the Minister may consider security to be very important but in the academic world it is the other way round.  Nowadays it would be very difficult to find a person of high calibre in the academic world who would be prepared to take a post if it was a life post.  I know that in the university colleges there is the problem of finding people who are prepared to stand for the presidency of the colleges because most people of academic distinction have no wish to give up their academic work for the rest of their lives.  They are prepared to do their stint and to apply their talents for a period in an administrative way so long as they can get out at the end of that period.  One of the reasons why I suspect it is not easy to get a good field of candidates for the presidency of universities is that under the present system these appointments are for life.  People in their 40's or even in their 50's are not prepared to take on the job because it cuts them off for the rest of their lives from academic work.  The Minister is moving in a different world altogether,</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He is unrealistic and if he goes about this in the way he is <Col N="1575" /> approaching it now, he is less likely to get good candidates unless he visualises a civil servant as director, but I would visualise somebody of distinction in the world of art as director.  Such a person would not wish to take the post for life.  Admittedly, it can be said that he could resign after seven years, but people do not work like that.  If a job is for life, they think about it in those terms because they do not wish to take on a job with the thought of resigning from it after a period.  The Minister is simply cut off from the world with which we are dealing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 57:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 17, to add &ldquo;provided that any officer or servants suspended or dismissed shall be entitled to be given reasons for his suspension or dismissal, and that the Minister shall be obliged to inform the Dáil of whether this has been done, but shall not disclose the reasons given&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to cover this point of the need to give reason for suspension or dismissal but to make it quite clear that the Minister not alone will have to give reasons to officers or servants if they are suspended or dismissed but will also have to answer questions in the Dáil on matters on which he has information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  This is a matter on which I have strong feelings and one that I have mentioned by way of reply to supplementary questions in the House. It cannot be said of me that I have refused to answer questions in the Dáil because I must have answered more supplementaries than any other Minister.  Since we discussed this I have had inquiries made among people <Col N="1576" /> who could view this matter objectively and they agree that provisions such as this one were more proper to a contract of employment rather than to legislation.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <P>I move amendment No. 68:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 26, to add &ldquo;provided that if the committee is one to which the Board assigns some of its functions, it shall include at least one representative nominated in accordance with section 6 (6) and one nominated in accordance with section 6 (7)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is meant to deal with the question of committees being appointed that could actually delegate power.  It would be most undesirable to have any situation arising where the purpose of representation could be subverted by reason of a majority of the board delegating functions to sub-committees which did not have any staff or student member on them. It is important that this should not happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>When we discussed this matter on Committee Stage I pointed out to the Deputy that the reason I could not accept it was that I wanted to give the board full freedom to make their own decisions as to whom they should regard as being proper to the particular functions carried out by a particular committee. This suggestion of his, to some extent, is counter to the line he has adopted all along&mdash;that of giving as much freedom as possible to the board.  What we should do is give the board the fullest freedom possible.  I do not regard this board as being divided into various groups.  I believe the board will be a unit, the whole concern of whom will be for the students and for the students' education.  For that reason people who are best suited to serve on committees of this particular board are being appointed to these committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to reduce the probationary period from <Col N="1578" /> five years to two.  No case has been made in this context for a five-year period.</P>
