      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of a statement (details supplied) by Mr. Bailie, Minister of Commerce at Stormont, that before proceeding any further on matters such as economic development in Border areas it would be appropriate to receive from Dublin more co-operation designed to prevent destruction of existing establishments; if he will make a statement on the matter; and if co-operation in this direction has now ceased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in his reply to a Parliamentary Question put to him on the 23rd November the Northern Minister of Commerce, Mr. Robin Bailie, referred to benefits in co-operation in such fields as fuel and tourism and said that he did not think that anything would be gained by precipitate action to discontinue such developments. That is also the attitude of this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the incursions across the Border, the murder of an office cleaner and of a Customs official last week, both Catholics, and also of an hotel receptionist recently, what is being done by the Taoiseach, or by the Government to deal with the present situation and the drift to anarchy?  Is the Taoiseach not aware that there is a grave danger of this whole State, the Twenty-six Counties, being caught up in this whole turmoil, <Col N="680" /> which is taking place at present?  Is it the Taoiseach's intention to govern or to stand idly by?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government have any immediate plans for dealing with the present high level of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement on the economic situation made by the Minister for Finance on the 27th October last.  The measures introduced by the Minister on that date were designed specifically to increase employment opportunities by providing a stimulus to economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In keeping with the pattern in most other countries, unemployment in <Col N="682" /> Ireland generally rises in the winter. The measures to which I have just referred will help to moderate the effects of the seasonal rise in unemployment this winter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that his figure of 66,300 people at present unemployed will more than likely, going on present trends, increase to 70,000 in a matter of weeks and this, proportionate to the population here, would amount to two million unemployed in Britain?  Is the Taoiseach aware that the one million unemployment position in Britain is being treated as an emergency situation? What emergency plans do this Government have to combat this tragic unemployment spreading throughout the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have taken steps, to which I have already referred. I am not denying at all that unemployment has increased mainly because of redundancies, but we are taking steps in that respect too.  We hope, with the steps already announced and the other steps we are taking, these redundancies will be reduced to the minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach be in a position to state how effective he believes these measures will be in reducing the present level of unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give figures but the immediate effect I think will be in the field of building activities, to which over £1 million was added as a result of the Minister for Finance's proposals.  As the Deputy is aware, an increase in building activity reflects itself in other spheres of economic activity at an early stage.</P>

      <P>Question No. 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say what proportion of the people found redundant, to whom he refers, have been retrained to other activities? Would it be 10 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that.  If the Deputy puts down a question it will be answered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach appreciate that there has been an increase of about one-fifth in the numbers seeking unemployment benefit and that this increase can be related more directly than any other aspect to redundancy, including an enormous number of young people? Can the Taoiseach honestly tell the House that he and the members of his Government sufficiently appreciate that unemployment is now, at this time of the year, 5,000 in excess of the figure of last year?  The Taoiseach has been asked in reference to another question whether he is standing idly by.  I would accuse this Government of just standing idly by in the face of these tragic unemployment figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot deal with the percentages and increases referred to by the Deputy.  I admit readily that the increase in unemployment is very significant this year but this is mainly attributable to redundancies caused as a result of a recession in world trade, a recession which is having its effect in almost every other modern progressive country in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not given me a chance to finish.  We are taking steps in order to obviate the effect of that recession.  It will not happen overnight.  We know that perhaps even further redundancies will take place but, apart from the measures I have mentioned, before the Deputies jumped to their feet to ask further supplementaries, we have increased the availability of capital in both grants and loans by £8 million to the Industrial Development Authority, and Taiscí Stáit Teoranta, all of which will be designed to increase economic activity and industrial activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach state when the present high figure for unemployment was exceeded?  Will he not admit that the figure is much worse now than it was in 1961?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach say if industrialists coming in here have their cases investigated to ensure that they are sound people to set up industries or are there people coming in to collect money provided by the people and then pulling out in a few years?

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that lists of doctors participating in the choice of doctors scheme were sent to medical card holders with the names of many doctors missing from the list and that this has created confusion; and if he will state what action will be taken in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Eastern Health Board that, due to a printer's error, one leaf was omitted in a small number of cases in the Dublin area from the list of doctors issued to medical card holders.  When the matter came to notice, the health board arranged for publicity in the Press and on radio drawing the attention of medical card holders to this fact and inviting those who had received defective lists to contact the board for a complete list if desired.  The board also contacted each doctor whose name appeared on the <Col N="686" /> missing page and invited them to let the board know of any person who had received a defective list if it came to their notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be able to state exactly the number of cases where incomplete lists of doctors' names were sent to medical card holders?  How could the health board be in a position to decide on the number of incomplete lists sent out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the list contained six pages.  It can be assumed that the choice exercised by patients was potentially affected in only about 25 cases.  This potential loss of 25 patients is divided among 50 doctors approximately so that no doctor can justifiably say that he has been seriously affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be simpler for the health board to send a new, complete list to every medical card holder to ensure that no doctor would feel that he had been victimised because his name had not been selected by a medical card holder?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to the board, does the Minister not consider that the administration of this scheme should go ahead as originally planned and not in a piecemeal fashion, as the Minister has indicated in the House, and that all medical card holders should be re-circularised with the complete list because the Minister will agree that it is impossible to ascertain the number of patients who have received incomplete lists?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that a consultant surgeon (name supplied) has stated that the cost per day of maintaining a patient in a Dublin general teaching hospital is now £13 and will probably increase to more than £16 next year; if these figures are correct; and, if so, if he is aware of the grave hardship the extra cost will impose on many ratepayers; and if he has any new proposals to meet the burden that will fall on ratepayers this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the present average daily cost of maintaining and treating an in-patient in a Dublin specialist voluntary hospital is estimated to be in the range of £10 to £13.  The daily rate of payment by a health board for these services is £4.25 per patient and the revenue deficits of the hospitals, arising mainly from the discrepancies between the cost of providing the services and the amounts paid by health boards, are met by grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund to which a substantial Exchequer subvention is made.  The expenditure of the health boards is, of course, also recouped to the extent of 55.7 per cent, on average, from the Vote for my Department.</P>
      <P>It will be seen, therefore, that from the point of view of the local rating authorities this is one field in which services are obtained on extremely favourable terms.</P>

      <P>In view of the compassion the Fianna Fáil Party had for the ratepayers when in Opposition, is the Minister now aware of the grave hardship imposed on ratepayers by the ever-increasing burden of rates?  Is he further aware that it is reckoned that the health rate in some counties will rise by £1 in the £ this year?  In view of the fact that a definite promise was <Col N="688" /> made by a former Minister for Health to stabilise the health rate in 1965, are the Minister and the Government now prepared to make any provision to combat the ever-increasing cost to the ratepayers?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be disappointed to hear that the cost of the administration of the health services is only 3 per cent of the total cost and I would defend that as an extremely low percentage.  The cost of the new management structure of the health services has meant an increase of only a quarter of one per cent of the total cost of the health services. If the Deputy wants to ask me what the likely cost is of some of the support staff under the health boards and if I subtract the previous cost of the same kind of staff working for the health authorities, the Deputy will again be disappointed to hear that the actual percentage of the total cost of the health services is extremely low.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the total number of mentally sub-normal children awaiting admission to institutions in the Republic; and the total number of new beds becoming available in 1971, 1972, 1973 and 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>On 31st March, 1970, there were 869 mentally handicapped children under 16 years of age awaiting admission to residential centres. This figure includes children who are mildly, moderately and severely handicapped. With the development of services on a day basis many children, especially the mildly handicapped are being catered for in the community.</P>
      <P>In replies to previous Parliamentary questions, I gave particulars of the programme for the provision of about 1,500 extra places at centres for the mentally handicapped.  This includes about 1,000 places for adults but the provision of these beds will, in the main, result in the release of accommodation for children and the programme, when completed, will meet the target set by the Commission of Inquiry on Mental Handicap for special residential accommodation for severely and moderately handicapped children and adults in need of such care.</P>
      <P>I anticipate that by the end of this year 138 extra beds will have been provided, followed by 380 in 1972 and 375 in 1973.  It is hoped the balance of the 1,500 places will be provided in 1974 and 1975.</P>

      <P> (1)  General Medical Services:&mdash;It is proposed that the new general medical service with free choice of doctor and retail chemist will come into operation in the Eastern Health Board area on 1st April, 1972 and in the rest of the country some months later.</P>
      <P>(2)  Limited Eligibility Group Drug Scheme:&mdash;It is aimed for the introduction of this scheme which will assist persons with limited eligibility to meet the cost of drugs and medicines, to coincide with the introduction of the new general medical services to which I have just referred.</P>
      <P>(3)  Revised Rate of Maternity Cash Grant for persons with full eligibility:&mdash; Section 64 of the Act provides for the payment of a maternity cash grant in respect of each confinement amounting to £8 in respect of each live issue and £8 where there is no live issue.  A grant of £4 in respect of each confinement is currently paid. The introduction of this section will depend on the availability of finance and is being considered in connection with the preparation of my Department's Estimates for the next financial year.</P>

      <P>(5)  Disabled Persons Maintenance Allowances:&mdash; Section 69 provides that in calculating means for the purpose of determining entitlement to a disabled person's maintenance allowance only the applicant's own means and those of his spouse would be taken into account.  At present the means of all near relatives residing with the applicant are taken into account.  The date of introduction of this provision will depend on finance being made available having regard to the many competing budgetary demands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers (for the Minister for Transport and Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under arrangements made by the OECD oil committee it has been the practice for a number of years past to maintain stocks of oil in all member countries equivalent at least to 65 days supply. The OECD recommended this year that this level should be raised to 90 days supply.  The EEC directive is no more onerous than the OECD recommendation except that, as an EEC member, this country would be bound by the directive whereas the OECD recommendation is accepted voluntarily by member countries.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the Whiddy Island stocks at Bantry Bay and the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Act, 1971, enacted in March, 1971, this country is now in a position to comply with the new OECD recommendation.  We would, therefore, have sufficient reserve stocks to comply with the EEC directive if it were in force here.  Our law in the matter would, however, have to be revised and this matter is under examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I issued a public statement on 17th November, 1970, indicating National Fuel Policy as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;National Fuel Policy is based on:&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a) optimum development of indigenous energy sources;</P>
      <P>(b) access to cheapest markets for imported energy sources;</P>
      <P>(c) diversification of sources of energy supply;</P>
      <P>(d) the promotion of economy in the use of fuels; and</P>
      <P>(e) stockpiling against emergency situations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The recent discovery of natural gas off the Old Head of Kinsale has suggested that there may be a further source of energy available to this country in addition to the traditional sources in the near future.  What impact this discovery may have on the energy situation cannot be properly established until it is known whether gas is present in sufficient quantity for commercial exploitation.  The possibilities for the utilisation of nuclear power in this country are also being fully investigated at present.</P>
      <P>In regard to the utilisation of energy within the country, I have arranged for preliminary discussions between the ESB and the Dublin Gas Company to see whether co-operation between these undertakings would lead to economies particularly in the utilisation of scarce capital resources.  Dependent on the result of these discussions, further similar meetings may be arranged.</P>
      <P>In the light of the development indicated, my Department is keeping this whole situation under review.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether <Col N="706" /> existing maritime legislation, notably the classification of ships based on a division of operation into home and foreign waters, is a retarding influence on the development of a strong home-based coastal fleet; and whether any consideration has been given to adopting the criteria of other European coastal states which are based on size and power of vessel in defining safety and warning standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. The existing regulations in regard to plying limits are administered in as liberal a manner as possible, subject only to the essential requirements of marine safety.  Moreover, ships engaged in the coastal trade are not subject to the higher standards of manning and safety equipment laid down for foreign-going vessels.</P>
      <P>While I am aware that other countries have adopted criteria other than plying limits for regulating safety of shipping I have no reason to believe that such criteria imply standards of safety any less effective than those applied here.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a question on the 20th April last, I have invited representatives of the shipowning and trade union interests concerned to let me have their views on the bringing up-to-date of the merchant shipping legislation covering such matters.  Such prior consultation is necessary before legislation of this kind can be proceeded with.  I am still awaiting the views of those concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether his decision to terminate the shipping investment grant scheme was preceded by consultation with the shipping interests involved; whether he is aware that 85 per cent of all traffic through Irish ports is controlled by foreign shipping interests; and whether the termination of the grant scheme will contribute to reserving this trend towards monopoly foreign control of shipping through this country's ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No specific prior consultations about the shipping investment <Col N="707" /> grants scheme were held with shipping interests before the termination of the scheme.  I was aware, however, from various discussions, of the views of shipping interests on the incentives and concessions which they considered necessary.</P>
      <P>The grants scheme had been introduced in response to representations from Irish shipowners that they should be put in a comparable position with British shipowners, their main competitors, who were benefiting from a similar scheme.  In the light of the withdrawal of the British scheme in 1970, and having regard to the many demands on the limited financial resources of the Exchequer, retention of the scheme was no longer justified. As far as private shipowners were concerned the scheme had been availed of only to an insignificant extent.</P>
      <P>Due to the wide geographical disparity between the sources of our imports and the destinations of our exports the availability of adequate and efficient shipping services at reasonable freight rates is of the utmost importance in relation to this country's external trade.  At the same time, the continuing imbalance between imports and exports, particularly in the continental trade where the ratio of imports to exports is over two to one, creates particular difficulties for shipping companies.  Accordingly, it is Government policy to promote the greatest possible freedom in shipping and ships of any nation may operate freely to and from our ports, thus ensuring adequate and efficient services at the lowest possible freight rates.  The ships of the Irish fleet likewise operate freely between foreign ports.</P>
      <P>It is also Government policy to ensure Irish participation both in Irish and foreign-to foreign shipping trade and it is in pursuance of that policy that Irish Shipping Ltd. and the B &amp; I have been established and are carried on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>An Irish shipowner acquiring a new ship is eligible, for taxation purposes, for a shipping investment allowance equal to 40 per cent of the capital cost of the ship.  This allowance is additional to the normal depreciation allowance so that, over the full life of the ship, allowances of 140 per cent of the ship's cost may be offset against profits.  Alternatively, the shipowner is eligible for an initial allowance of 60 per cent in respect of the cost of a new or second-hand ship incurred before 1st April, 1973.  In both cases unused allowances may be carried forward from year to year and set off against profits.</P>
      <P>A shipowner is also entitled, in respect of a new ship brought into use before 1st April, 1973, to avail himself of free depreciation, whereby the total cost of the purchase may, for tax purposes, be written off in one year or spread over a number of years at the option of the shipowner.</P>

I impressed on them the importance of maintaining this link with the Continent in the interests of our tourist trade.  Since then the companies have been making exhaustive inquiries but so far without success.  The only inquiries still outstanding are those being undertaken by Irish Shipping Ltd., who are still trying to ensure that some arrangement can be made with another car ferry operator to provide a service in 1973 if not in 1972.

      <P>I recently met representatives of the Irish Livestock Transport Company which operates the cattle ships and lairages of the B and I Co. and of British Rail and on which the national executive of the Irish livestock trade is represented.  Arising out of the decision by the company to abandon the Heysham route due to lack of support by the trade, they agreed to my request to examine the possibilities of providing an alternative service.</P>
      <P>As regards the future prospects for the company, they informed me that their ships and lairages should meet all demands up to 1980.  The representatives of British Rail informed me that existing stocks of rail wagons should meet demands for some years to come and that they will be reviewing the situation in that regard in due course.</P>
      <P>At the present time the Irish Livestock Transport Co. is providing a service on the Holyhead route; private shipping interests are serving the Birkenhead and Silloth routes, and the Burns and Laird line the Glasgow route.

It was pointed out at the conference that the broad principles of the Government's approach to social development were as set out in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development, 1969 to 1972.  Chapter 16 of the programme lists the specific developments proposed in the spheres of education, health, housing and sanitary services, and income maintenance.  In regard to income maintenance, which is my responsibility, the Deputy is, no doubt, aware that many of the specific proposals have already been implemented, for example, retirement pensions, invalidity pensions, death grants, allowances for deserted wives, <i>et cetera.</i> When introducing the Estimate for my Department recently, I indicated the action being taken in regard to other proposals in the Third Programme, such as pay-related benefits, examination of the children's allowances scheme and a wide-ranging review of the assistance services with particular reference to home assistance.  I assured the House on that occassion that I <Col N="714" /> would continue to effect improvements within the limits of available resources, and this represents Government policy in this field.</P>

      <P>In the light of the report he has received from his staff and from the published reports of this conference, would the Minister be prepared to consider setting up an all-party committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas or, alternatively, a broadly based national commission, to review and to make recommendations on the current social policy in order to alleviate poverty and deprivation, lack of adequate income maintenance, and so on?  I say that not in any party political sense.  Would the Minister be prepared to consider such a review as being urgently necessary, as has been highlighted and spotlighted in a very objective manner by the proceedings of that conference and the papers presented at the conference?  Perhaps the Minister might consult with the Council for Social Welfare and then take steps to set up such a review body.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under statutory provisions in social welfare legislation, persons are deemed to be available for employment in certain circumstances. These provisions are limited to persons undergoing approved courses of rehabilitation training and to definition of days of unemployment in the special case of night workers.  In respect of persons to whom those provisions are not applicable, I am indebted for the following information to the officers referred to in the question, who, as the House is aware, are completely independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and are not subject to direction or control by me or anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specific criteria are not used for determining that an insured worker is not available for work; the approach is to apply criteria in determining whether a person is or is not so available. These criteria are broadly whether a genuine desire and intention to obtain work is present, whether domestic or other commitments exist which might limit the person's freedom to accept, or might prevent acceptance of full-time employment which would normally be suitable for him, and whether restrictions are being imposed by the person on the kind, place or hours of employment accepttable to him, any of which would unreasonably diminish his prospects of obtaining work.  The determination of availability is made by deciding officers and appeals officers, in the exercise of their statutory functions, through the interpretation and application of any or all of these broad criteria in the light of and in relation to the whole facts and evidence available in each particular case.  The procedures followed in the determination of such cases are no different from those used in the generality of <Col N="719" /> cases where title to unemployment payment is at issue.</P>

      <P>A claim for maternity allowance was received on 14th October, 1971, from the person mentioned by the Deputy.  As, however, the confinement to which the claim related had taken place on 2nd April, 1971, payment of the allowance could not be made under the regulations since the claim was not received within seven weeks of the end of the period for which the allowance would ordinarily have been payable.  A claim for the maternity grant which is payable in respect of confinement had been received on the 30th June, 1971, and was paid.  With a view to treating the claimant as favourably as possible in the matter of the maternity allowance claim this latter date was treated as the date of receipt of the claim for that allowance and this enabled the claimant to qualify for it for one week.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to make provision for further grants to Córas Tráchtala to enable it to continue the work of promoting, assisting and developing exports.</P>
      <P>When Córas Tráchtála was first set up, under the Export Promotion Act, 1959, the amount which could be made available to it out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas was limited to £1 million.  This statutory limit was raised by subsequent Export Promotion Acts, the most recent of which, in 1969, raised it to £9 million.</P>
      <P>The increasing pace of export promotion activities, involving necessary expansion of Córas Tráchtála's aids and services, both in volume and scope, has naturally increased the board's rate of expenditure.  Payments to the board by way of grant in aid up to 31st March of this year amounted to £7,611,885, which leaves a balance of £1,388,115 unissued from the existing limit of £9 million.  This balance is not sufficient to meet the board's financial requirements up to the end of the present financial year, which amount to £1,754,000.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to raise to £15 million the limit of the amount of grants which may be made to Córas Tráchtála.  The actual grant in aid provision to be made in each financial year out of this amount will, of course, be included in the Vote for my Department which will come before the Dáil in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is already aware of the role played by Córas Tráchtála in the expansion of exports, particularly industrial exports.  The aids and services which it provides for exporters cover a wide range, from information, advice and basic market research to specialist services in the fields of market research, design management and so forth, and from incentive grants for individual exporters visiting overseas markets to the organisation of national stands at international <Col N="729" /> trade fairs.  These services are kept under constant review to ensure that at any given time the services most urgently needed by exporters are provided in the manner and in the measure which would be most useful so as to make the best use of the funds available to Córas Tráchtála.  For instance, the most important trade factor of the current year is the prospect of EEC membership and Córas Tráchtála has already begun its planned campaign in preparation for this.  As part of its programme, the board plans to open a new office in Brussels, and later, in Milan, in addition to the offices it already has in Paris and Dusseldorf.  This is considered sufficient for the present, since it will be possible to cover the remaining countries of the Six&mdash;Holland and Luxembourg&mdash;from Brussels.</P>
    <P>Expansion and improvement of the board's services to exporters must result in some increase in expenditure. So much depends on continuing expansion of exports that Córas Tráchtála obviously must have adequate funds at its disposal.  The figures leave no doubt that the increasing demand by exporters on its services has been matched by a significant growth in exports.  Since 1960 the amount of Córas Tráchtála's annual grant-in-aid has increased by about £1½ million and in the same period total exports have increased by £315 million.  I do not, of course, assert that Córas Tráchtála is solely responsible for this growth, but I have no doubt it played an important part in it, particularly in the increase in industrial exports.  These, in 1970, amounted to almost £250 million, well over 50 per cent of the total exports.</P>
    <P>It is with confidence that I recommend provision of an additional £6 million for Córas Tráchtála over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains one other provision. This is the amendment of section 3 of the Export Promotion (Amendment) Act, 1969 to refer to quantity surveyors as well as architects and engineers.  The earlier Act provided power for Córas Tráchtála to extend its export promotion services to cover certain design and planning services in <Col N="730" /> connection with engineering and construction works abroad.  There was no intention of excluding quantity surveyors, who are equally concerned with engineers and architects in design and planning services, from benefiting from the help given by Córas Tráchtála and their exclusion was merely an accident of drafting.  The present amendment is designed to enable Córas Tráchtála to assist quantity surveyors to the same extent as architects and engineers in the kind of design and planning services which qualify for export tax relief under the Finance Act, 1968.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, like many others that come before us, seeks the permission of the House to increase expenditure above the rigid limit permitted by the Oireachtas until today. Fine Gael have no objection to allowing the Government to give increased moneys to Córas Tráchtála for its operations.  The measure gives the House an opportunity to consider whether or not Córas Tráchtála should provide the many and varied services that it does provide as a separate entity from the Industrial Development Authority and the Industrial Credit Company.  In their report Córas Tráchtála define themselves as an &ldquo;advisory and promotional body&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The figure of £1.6 million which they have expended is not an excessive sum when one considers the type of service they provide.  They have to deal with promotions, shipping, insurance, the effects of tariffs and taxes as well as the ever-changing position of currencies. Exporters probably need the help of Córas Tráchtála more today than they have ever done in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from the Minister's speech that he considers the ICC, the IDA and Córas Tráchtála should continue as separate entities in the foreseeable future and as we enter Europe. Before one can hope to secure a grant from the IDA for the production of goods for export, one needs the help of Córas Tráchtála as far as the investigation of the available market is concerned.  Similarly, the backing of Córas Tráchtála for the venture and a report on the possible future of the venture are necessary before one can <Col N="731" /> hope to get a loan from the ICC.  I do not say these things in any spirit of criticism but merely to suggest that these three bodies, which work in close liaison, be merged.  Such a decision would be a far-reaching one which would require detailed examination. This could not be carried out from this side of the House because it would require a mass of civil servants and others to work out whether or not such was a proper procedure.  I know there are certain bodies in industry who believe this to be a proper procedure. We should consider whether or not better support for promotions abroad and better support for exports might not be available if these three bodies were restructured.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to various matters relating to the operations of Córas Tráchtála during the year.  During the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce I referred to the fact that Córas Tráchtála are opening offices in Brussels and Milan and that they already have offices in Paris and Dusseldorf.  It is true that in the time immediately after the signing of the Treaty of Rome when the Minister for Foreign Affairs was Deputy Aiken, the accent on Europe was minimal whereas the accent on foreign affairs activities in America and elsewhere was maximum. I fear we are still operating on a shoestring in Europe, that we are not devoting sufficient attention to the potential there&mdash;perhaps our only potential within a few years.</P>
    <P>One must remember that the glorious idea of free trade in Europe means something else also, namely, if one continues to set up common external tariffs against goods from abroad, other countries in the world will be affected.  In this connection, I would mention the Mills Bill in America which has not yet become law.  One can see how important it is that Córas Tráchtála and the other two bodies who did their best for the promotion of industrial exports should make their priorities the continent of Europe and Britain.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the opening of two new offices in Brussels and <Col N="732" /> Milan is sufficient.  I am aware that not so many years ago our diplomatic representative in Brussels was grossly overworked&mdash;I was there as a parliamentarian and I know this to be a fact.  The man in question was overworked to such an extent that eventually he had to take a lighter job.  I am aware that our activities in Strasbourg up to some five or six years ago were minimal also.  I do not think offices in Brussels and Milan are sufficient to meet the need that exists there or for the promotion of exports to Europe.  We must remember that the rest of the world may raise their tariffs against the Common Market as that Community is enlarged.  As the Common Market becomes stronger it will become more of an irritant to other nations; as countries enter the EEC, America and other nations will not have the same opportunity for their exports.</P>
    <P>Is it wise to state that we can carry out operations in Holland from one of our other offices?  Is it wise to have only one office in France?  I would suggest that neither decision is wise.  While individual Members in this House might disagree on the way to carry out this operation, all will agree there is need for the expenditure indicated here for the promotion of industrial exports. Equally, all Members will agree that the people involved are doing their jobs efficiently.  Any difference is merely about the way the job might be done or how improvements might be effected.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the operations of Córas Tráchtála this year in their efforts to get trade behind the Iron Curtain, and the appointment of a marketing representative in Vienna. The appointment of a marketing representative in Vienna is of little consequence and I do not think the House should argue about whether the appointment of one man or the establishment of an office in Vienna will make or break the country.  With regard to trade behind the Iron Curtain, my opinion&mdash;based on some experience&mdash;is that such trade is extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>For countries in Eastern Europe trade is largely a matter of the acquisition of currency for purchases for themselves&mdash;I would add that such <Col N="733" /> purchases almost certainly will not be made in Ireland.  It is true that one can buy certain goods from Iron Curtain countries at cheaper rates than elsewhere but the reason is that hard currency is needed.  However, that is not sufficient for us; what we need is a <i>quid pro quo</i> situation whereby if we buy from them they will buy from us. The balance of trade between Ireland and countries behind the Iron Curtain is very bad as far as we are concerned and even if we secured trade as a result of the appointment of a representative in Vienna I do not think the situation will improve to a great extent. That is not to say that we should decry the effort that has been made to secure trade with Eastern Europe, that we should cast it aside, or that we should not have hope for the future.  However, the position of our balance of trade with those countries must be stated.</P>
    <P>Our efforts to sell capital goods to the Middle East is worthwhile and I think a wise decision has been made in this case.  I do not think there is much chance of selling anything else to that area but there are countries rich from royalties in oil who need large quantities of capital goods.  It is indicated that the value of such goods is £200,000, with a hope for an increase of £500,000.  This amount is tiny but if there is a chance of pursuing this line of activity let us try to do so with vigour.</P>
    <P>I have some personal experience of the working of Córas Tráchtála and the people who work in the organisation and of their every effort for our export drive.  I have nothing but commendation for them.  The money that is being spent is being well spent.  I am just drawing attention to an opinion which exists and which is held fairly strongly on the restructuring of our three promotional agencies, our money agency, the Industrial Credit Company, our grant agency, the Industrial Development Authority and our promotional and advisory agency, Córas Tráchtála.  We must find out if it is possible to make more use of them and to make more use of the efforts they are making.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is non-controversial and it has the support of <Col N="734" /> all of us.  We realise that &ldquo;export or die&rdquo; is a motto which has absolute relevance for this country because the expansion of employment and the saving of the home market depend on our increasing our export competitiveness. CTT could be described as the front line State agency in the matter of seeking new export markets.  Their assistance to home based industries is essential if they are to find new export outlets.</P>
      <P>Irish industry has not been very interested in export outlets in past years.  Up to quite recently industry was pampered with an excess of protectionism which meant that you relied on the home market for an easy living and, if you raised your eyes at all to the outside world, you did not have to look beyond the Irish Sea to the British market.  Nowadays the position in all markets is far different.  Even on the home market industry is facing very stiff competition indeed.  The home market can no longer be regarded as the secure and safe market it was, say, ten years ago.  Industry must be competitive to survive and to survice it needs more export outlets and new export markets leading to an improvement in design and so on to enable us at another remove to hold on to the home market and enable us to expand our industrial base so as to give fresh employment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan referred to the necessity for some closer liaison, unspecified, between the various State agencies, the IDA, the Credit Company and CTT.  Most ideally that closer liaison should be between the Department of Foreign Affairs and CTT.  The Minister talked about opening up two offices, one in Brussels and one in Milan, in addition to the offices already opened in Paris and Dusseldorf.  We have other embassies in Europe and I see nothing wrong with assigning a CTT official to each of those embassies. Wherever we have an embassy we should have a full-time CTT officer. We would not have to buy new premises.  We could utilise the premises we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our criticism of the Department of Foreign Affairs in past years was in regard to their aloofness from the mundane subject of seeking new trade <Col N="735" /> export markets.  This would seem to be an ideal way of bridging the gap which formerly existed in the Department of Foreign Affairs in the matter of looking for extra trade.  Willy-nilly officials of the Department are involved in one way or another with the development of export possibilities in their areas.  There is a CTT office in San Francisco but the official from the Department of Foreign Affairs in the consular office is also involved, even if only marginally, in trade matters.  I would suggest that we should try to discover how we could get closer liaison between that Department and CTT, between the State agency looking for new markets and our embassies in these areas.  This seems to be a co-ordination which is called for.</P>
    <P>There is no reference to a CTT office being opened in Africa and yet we have an embassy in Lagos.  Why not have a CTT office in that embassy?  Nigeria is a vast African country with growing trade prospects. The Minister has visited what has been referred to as somewhere east of the Iron Curtain.  I do not know if that phrase is applicable any longer, with the European Security Conference looming up.  I should like some information from the Minister on the results of his missions, these Ian Fleming visits of his, to Prague and other places east of the Iron Curtain. What may we expect as a result of those visits?  Extra trade?  What was the point of those visits?  Who did he meet and has he any encouraging news for the House?</P>
    <P>It is no secret that the Department of Foreign Affairs are planning closer liaison with this area with the opening of an embassy or a consulate in Moscow or in Warsaw.  It would seem to me that CTT should be working in close liaison with the Department if such a development is in sight.  They should be considering moving into that area and opening up a full-time office. There is the old British imperial idea of trade following the flag but our trade should follow any country in which we have embassy status.  It has been pointed out that the balance of trade situation between ourselves and <Col N="736" /> the Communist countries is very adverse to our interests.  We should do everything in our power to level up that adverse balance.</P>
    <P>CTT work against a climate of lack of interest on the part of Irish industry, it must be said, in the prospect of expanding export markets.  In addition to their many faults, which have been commented on many times over the years, Irish management have never been market-orientated.  I suppose any management or business structure coming out of a protectionist era cannot be expected to acquire export consciousness for some period, but the trouble is that we cannot wait for the passage of time.  Developments in the outside world are rushing ahead at a very rapid pace indeed.  Irish management, still awaking from their protectionist slumbers, are not up to the job and are not aware of the urgency of the task before them in looking for new markets.  Whether they are production orientated is another question but certainly they are not market orientated.  While the first task of CTT is to look for markets abroad, they must also be aware of this problem which faces them on the home front.</P>
    <P>It is useless for a CTT official to draw up a contract in a foreign city if he then finds that the home industry on which he is depending to fulfil the order is falling down on the schedule of orders.  Unfortunately this happens very frequently.  It must be said, unhappily, that in certain international quarters Irish business life has a very bad reputation as regards punctuality of schedule of delivery and so on.  You do not hold a new market if the order is not filled on time and on the date specified.  Unfortunately, this has been the experience and I am thinking especially of the United States.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether CTT have already considered this problem or whether, in fact, it exists as a problem but I think CTT must be on the lookout continuously for men for their marketing force abroad who have proved their worth in industry.  In other words, I do not think there should be any age barrier for recruitment to CTT; possibly there is not. I am sure of this.  I would suggest that <Col N="737" /> people who are specialists in seeking and acquiring new markets are rare and exceptional.  The salary for such people should be in accordance with the results achieved.  There should be no Civil Service ceiling on the salary scales paid to the man who proves his worth in this difficult task of gaining new markets for Irish industry.  A new foreign market gained for an Irish industry spells many new jobs at home.  I do not think that people who have this expertise can be overpaid.  I think it is impossible to overpay them so important is their work.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately there is still a lack of interest on the part of industry in the whole question of the gaining and conquest of new markets.  Unfortunately the idea still exists that this is not quite as essential as politicians seem to think.  We should inaugurate &mdash;at least I am not aware of its existence so far&mdash;some scheme of prizes or awards for exporters.  Perhaps we have one at the moment.  If so, it is not very well publicised, because I am not aware of any interest in Irish industry or of any publicity being given to this.  We should attempt to demonstrate imaginatively the importance of gaining new markets for Irish industry.  I do not think we are adequately pushing this message home in Irish industry at present.  If it has not already been done, I would suggest the institution of an annual award to be made to different sectors of industry with particular emphasis on small or medium-size firms, because possibly it is there we have most work to do.  CTT have done their utmost to get firms in a particular section of industry to group together in seeking new markets for their products.  I know CTT have done this with a certain amount of success.</P>
    <P>With the increasing free trade and competition to which we are subject the home market will not be so secure in the future as in the past.  One of the factors which contribute to the difficulty in getting Irish management interested in export markets is the language barrier.  I am thinking especially of the European market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> This is the ridiculous legacy of refusing to educate boys in our secondary schools up to quite recently in any of the European languages.  The result is that there are many Irish managers who in their secondary or university education have no training in the major European languages.</P>
    <P>CTT continue their efforts in the North American market.  The Nixon levies will affect us adversely there, but it is an important market.  On my one or two visits to the United States last year I had occasion to note the solid work done by CTT in New York and other regional offices in America in the matter of increasing our exports to that country.  However, in areas where we have no inside knowledge of the market CTT should consider utilising existing marketing agencies. You cannot compete with local knowledge and if it is possible to link up with a local intelligence marketing concern or group that should be done in areas where we have no offices.</P>
    <P>In talking about co-ordination I would hope that CTT would preserve close links with the IDA and the Credit Corporation.  However, I would consider the greatest priority for CTT is close liaison and consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs, through the various Embassies.  I know they have knowledge of one another's work but I would suggest that in every Irish embassy or consular office abroad there should be a CTT official.</P>
    <P>The Minister visited Bulgaria this year.  I should like to know if, as a result of that visit, our adverse balance with them will be redressed.  I also recall that a Rumanian delegation led by their Commerce Minister earlier this year made a short tour of Irish industry. Are there any results from this? Furthermore, we are probably on the eve of setting up diplomatic relations with one or other of these countries, and I hope CTT are keeping a close eye on that development.</P>
    <P>While CTT are obviously looking for new markets in many parts of the world where it has the facilities to do so, I would suggest that, in regard to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and the dangers faced <Col N="739" /> there at present, there should be coordination with CTT on the special problems of that region, which may worsen in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>We already have two Foreign Affairs offices in Brussels, and I do not see the point in having another, separate CTT office.  We already have an Ambassador to the Community and an Ambassador to Belgium.  I hope we do not progress towards the fulfilment of Parkinson's law and have yet another CTT office. We have an Embassy in Paris in a very large central building, ideal for CTT offices and for our purposes.  The essential requirement is that we have skilled men paid the right salaries in these areas.  This is more important than palatial offices in a few places in the world.  The skilled men should be spread as widely as possible in areas capable of development.  We should have some trade presence in the Far East, for instance, Japan.  This cannot be described as a luxury today for a small island economy with a small industrial base, its home market subject to pretty intense competition, as it will be in the near future.  That small economy must put every penny it has into increasing possibilities of export markets abroad.  Any money spent on an extensive CTT export operation throughout the world, wherever markets may be found, is well spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Donegan, leading off as spokesman for Fine Gael, agreed that there was a need for the provision of this additional grant aid money for CTT.  Deputy O'Leary spoke in support and pointed out that this was a Bill on which there could be general agreement. Both Deputies paid tribute to the efforts of the CTT officials to develop exports.  There were conflicting viewpoints with regard to the best method of using the money in order to develop our export trade.  Deputy Donegan said that we should endeavour to have closer liaison between the CTT, the IDA and the ICC and stressed the fact that at the present time he was aware of such liaison but wondered if it might not be better to have those three organisations working as one unit. Deputy M. O'Leary said that it was more important that the operatives of <Col N="740" /> CTT abroad should work in closer liaison with the Embassies of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Since I became Minister for Industry and Commerce I have seen the close liaison between the CTT and the IDA, and also the liaison which exists between the officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs overseas and the operatives of CTT.  When Irish manufacturers or potential exporters travel abroad these bodies know of their journeys.  The officials in the Embassies are usually aware of the travelling arrangements of such people.  There is also close liaison between the exporters and the CTT representatives abroad.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan suggested that we should establish offices in Europe as a preparation for making the fullest use of the EEC.  Deputy M. O'Leary felt that CTT representatives should be placed in the various legations and criticised the decision of CTT to open an office in Brussels.  The Deputy said that that was just opening another office in a city where the Department of Foreign Affairs had already two offices.  I disagree with Deputy M. O'Leary's view on this point.  CTT must have an office in Brussels, which is the administrative headquarters of the new, greater European area.  If CTT were being established now and were looking for a particular city in which to establish an office, Brussels would be the obvious choice, in the light of our entry to the EEC and in order to be able to contact the 250,000,000 consumers within the enlarged Community. The officials of CTT must be able to communicate with the businessmen and the potential buyers within Europe.  We must make use of the opportunities available to us.  I agree with Deputy Donegan when he says that we should endeavour to have as many operatives as possible spread across Europe.  We must consider how we can best spend the money made available to CTT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan and Deputy M. O'Leary expressed different views in relation to the advisability of endeavouring to develop our trade with eastern European countries.  Deputy Donegan said that CTT were unwise in opening an office in Vienna and in <Col N="741" /> sending a representative there to develop trade with eastern European countries.  The Deputy felt that there was no satisfactory <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangement whereby we could sell to the eastern European countries and expand our purchases from them.  Our adverse trade balance with these countries is not encouraging, but it should act as an incentive to us to develop business.  Any new development will help to close the trade gap which exists.</P>
    <P>Deputy M. O'Leary asked whether the efforts made to develop trade with eastern European countries had been successful.  The Deputy referred to my visit to Bulgaria some time ago and to the visit here of the Rumanian trade delegation.  The Deputy asked whether there was any improvement in trade as a result of these visits.  The trade figures for our exports to Bulgaria for 1970 were in the region of £7,000 to £10,000.  Following my visit to Bulgaria, which coincided with a trade fair where CTT had a display of our export goods, a trade agreement was completed and orders amounting to £250,000 have been booked to March of next year.  These figures show the extremely large increase in trade. Similarly, the trade agreement concluded some time ago with Rumania on the basis of both countries endeavouring to arrange a balance of exchange trade justifies the appointment of representatives of CTT to such areas.  There are discussions towards trade agreements going on at the present time with Czechoslovakia, Poland and the USSR.  While both Deputies spoke about the advantage that can accrue from CTT endeavouring to improve exports to the Middle East and to Japan the very same argument can be made by way of encouraging Córas Tráchtála to expand our exports into Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>Further progress is already being made in this direction.  This is by way of reply to Deputy Donegan's suggestion that we make our priorities almost entirely European at this stage.  Let me say that I think this would be a mistake.  Deputy Donegan referred to the potential effect of the Mills Bill. We have very sizeable exports to the <Col N="742" /> tune of £60 million a year to the US and good prospects in spite of the present difficulties there.  There are reasonable prospects arising for developing an export trade to Japan. We have a sufficiency of imports from that country and there should be some articles that we can export to them.</P>
    <P>I stated in my opening remarks that great progress has been made by Córas Tráchtála with the co-operation of industry in the expansion of our exports.  We should not be too critical of our manufacturers here.  Deputy M. O'Leary was rather critical about the failure of some of our manufacturers to be able to meet delivery dates.  I appreciate that there are problems in this regard but they are in the context of endeavouring to build up goodwill between manufacturer and potential customer overseas.  There is the necessity for the manufacturer to ensure that the delivery deadline is met and I think, overall, we do not have too many failures of this nature.</P>
    <P>One of the complaints which is most often mentioned to me by home purchasers, that is the distributors of our produce here, is that they are very often held up in deliveries because the manufacturer neglects the home market in order to meet the export deadline. This is very often said to me at functions following my appeal to the general public to concentrate on giving full backing to Irish manufacturers by buying goods made in Ireland, particularly those for which there is a market abroad.  When I am told by a home distributor that the manufacturer has been unable to meet his order because of the necessity to meet his export deadline, I find it extremely difficult to know what to advise. Deputy Donegan said that it was most essential that the time schedule in relation to exports be complied with.</P>
    <P>Deputy M. O'Leary spoke about recognising the small manufacturer for his achievements in the export field.  I should like to remind the Deputy in this regard that over the past couple of years we have had export award schemes.  No fewer than five awards are allocated each year and one of those awards is reserved for a small industry.  I do not think this is as <Col N="743" /> sufficiently appreciated as it might be but, certainly, there are quite a number of manufacturers who do not seem to have as much meas on this award as they might have.  This award is meant to be a recognition of work well done by those manufacturers and I hope as a result of this debate here that further interest will be shown in it.  Awards, such as a plaque, a medal or a token of some type is an appreciation of the State's recognition of the efforts of manufacturers.  The manufacturer is free to project on his literature that he is an award winner in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say in relation to the award to the manufacturer if there is any similar award to employees?  Would this help in publicising this award which I am afraid is not given a great deal of publicity at present?  Surely the employees who take part in the success of an export firm should be similarly awarded?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be practical about this.  While all of the team within an industry are part and parcel of the effort that has won this award if I were to try to devise a scheme whereby a replica of the award that is presented to the management, arising out of the success of the firm, had to be presented to every one of the 20 in a small firm or 500 in a larger firm I do not think it would serve any useful purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bear in mind what the Deputy has said because this had not struck me before.

I can certainly look into that aspect of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Deputies mentioned liaison with our embassies abroad.  Córas Tráchtála, in whatever country they have an office, keep in close contact with the Irish Embassy in that country and the embassies, from the information available to me, give a great deal of assistance and help to the personnel of Córas Tráchtála and to individual exporters. We must appreciate the fact that the embassies have other functions than trade and it does not follow that there are enough trade prospects everywhere to justify putting a CTT man into all the embassies.  As well as that, mixing business with straightforward diplomacy might not always be the best way of doing business.  From my point of view I can see difficulty in that regard.  I am all in favour of working in harmony.  My personal experience of those in various embassies is that they are always extremely helpful but when you want to get details which a potential purchaser needs from a potential exporter, this is where the various embassies can put the potential purchaser in contact with the CTT man.  There is close liaison all round, as far as I know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I can go quite a distance with the Deputy in regard to Bord Fáilte, CTT and various industrial agencies, but in my limited experience of foreign travel the embassy seems to be always in a particular part of the city which is not the trade centre.  If we wish to develop our export market it is to our advantage to try to get into the business centre of any city with that office even if it costs somewhat more in the business centre as it normally does.  I disagree with the Deputy on that point.</P>
      <P>I think it was Deputy O'Leary who spoke about CTT salaries.  CTT are completely autonomous as regards fixing salaries.  I do not think they have an age limit on the staff they recruit. They are looking for the best they can get.  From my experience of representatives of CTT whom I have met I want to say that I think they are extremely good.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Leary mentioned the language difficulties exporters may have.  CTT are quite conscious of the requirements here and have tried to lay on courses and encourage manufacturers and potential exporters to learn or get their representatives to learn languages.  They have not been very successful so far but I expect, with the prospect of EEC membership around the corner, there will be more awareness in this regard and that any further courses sponsored by CTT will be better availed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also said that CTT should try to use selling agencies abroad. They do this to the fullest possible extent.  Both speakers suggested that we should encourage the development of trade with the Middle East.  This is being done.  There are difficulties for CTT in this.  It is a part of the world where we have not Foreign Affairs representation and this creates problems which are at present being tackled with a view to making use of any opportunities open to us.  I have endeavoured to cover the points raised to the best of my ability.  I think there is general agreement with the Bill and I welcome the reception given to this <Col N="746" /> provision of £6 million extra for export business for CTT.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 2, line 36, to delete &ldquo;500&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;750&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to increase the minimum membership from 500 to 750.  I feel that the larger the unions the better.  As Deputy Desmond said on Second Stage, there are an enormous number of unions in the country at the moment and it will be necessary to amalgamate several of them in order to rationalise the trade union movement.  The aim should be to end up with 20 unions instead of the present 94.  The more members in a union the better because the more members the greater the amount of subscriptions and the greater possibility there will be of unions employing the experts they need, economists and people with business knowledge.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the current subscription per member per week is. It is probably about 25p.  In the old days it was 2s or 3s a week.  If unions are small they cannot afford, without exorbitant subscription rates, to pay for experts.  There is no doubt that in these days unions need expertise to help them to deal with companies.  It will be necessary for unions to become aware of how the business is going. They can then proceed for a fair share by way of wages and, of course, they will be in a position to know if businesses are not doing so well and they will then not push them too hard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mind if we fix minimum membership at as high as 1,000 but I feel that the Minister's figure of 500 is too small.  There was only a passing reference made by the Minister to compensation for trade union officials who have to retire on amalgamation of unions.  All trade union officials are hard-working men, some of them having to work 24 hour days, and I think we should be made aware of what provision there is for compensating them.  We will not get unions to amalgamate if we do not encourage them to do so and the more unions we can get to amalgamate the bigger the <Col N="748" /> unions will become, the more resources they will have and the better they will be able to pay experts to do their work.</P>
    <P>The style of work of trade unions will change radically and there will be a need for outside machinery to help to smooth out internal disputes as they come up.  I know that congress have their own appeals machinery but I suggest there is a need for an outside appeals body with, perhaps, a Ministerial nominee, perhaps a member of the judiciary.  I remember a case in which a carpenter appealed to the court against his trade union and it took the case six months to get into court.  I suggest that such cases should get priority in court lists and that as well there should be the type of outside body I advocated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of 500 in the Bill was arrived at as a reasonable figure taking into account what the Bill seeks to do.  It seeks to change the old system.  Whereas under the old system seven members would suffice with a deposit of £1,000, here we are providing three impediments: first of all, there must be a waiting period of 18 months, secondly, there must be a deposit of £5,000 and, thirdly, 500 minimum membership.  When that figure was arrived at, it was considered to be reasonable having regard to the other provisions of the Bill.  It takes into account also legitimate specialised groups who, at some time, might want to form a separate union and who would have the blessing of all concerned. It ensures that there would not be too much difficulty for such groups.</P>
      <P>These are the main considerations. I do not think that a figure of 750 as compared to 500 would make any difference when one considers the other provisions in the Bill which make it less easy than before to form trade unions.  I am inclined to leave the figure at 500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot support this amendment because we consider the figure of 500 to be high enough and because there are several considerations that one must take into account.  First, there is the right of <Col N="749" /> association.  I agree that there are too many trade unions.  Congress are conscious of this defect in the movement as a whole and they have been striving and are continuing to strive for rationalisation and amalgamation within the movement.</P>
      <P>However, at the moment there are approximately 40 recognised trade unions operating in this State who have a membership of less than 750 and no matter what legislation we might pass here, if we were to accept this amendment, that situation would continue so that there would be about 40 unions who would not qualify. While I agree with most of what Deputy Belton has said, I cannot agree with him in regard to the size of trade unions determining their strength because the specific purpose of a trade union is to defend and further the interests of their members.  No matter how much we try to achieve these ends by negotiation, the fact is that the strike weapon is all that a worker can rely on ultimately.  What determines the strength of a union is not their number but the state of their strike fund because that fund, combined with the determination of the members, will to a large extent dictate the outcome of any dispute that may arise. Some of the 40 trade unions I have mentioned&mdash;those having less than 750 members&mdash;have a healthy fighting fund.  It would be unwise of the House to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned specialised groups and said that there are quite a number of these with a membership of less than 750.  I would like to point out that there are a number of specialised groups whose membership is less than 500 and, indeed, there are some whose membership is less than 100 and some of these might wish to form a trade union.  I take Deputy Cluskey's point concerning the 40 trade unions whose membership is less than 750 but my point was that if a union have 1,000 members each paying 25p a week they must have more money than a union who have 500 members each paying the same amount. It is my contention that instead of concentrating <Col N="750" /> for the time being on cutting down numbers, more could be done within trade unions with the money available.  For instance, experts could be employed within the unions and any surplus money could be used in cases where it was necessary to resort to the strike weapon.  This would enable trade unions, too, to pay a sufficient number of officials who would work, say, 50 hours a week rather than have the present situation whereby officials are working for as long as 90 hours a week.  The second reason for my amendment is that it would cut down on the number of trade unions but only after we have brought in some legislation which, in the case of amalgamation, would compensate officers on retirement from a union or whereby they could be dispersed among other unions.  My main reason for the amendment is to ensure that trade unions would have the necessary finances to enable them to employ experts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak against this particular amendment.  One should examine the situation in its entirety. There are craft unions and general unions but some of the craft unions are diminishing in so far as membership is concerned.  Therefore, if the figure of 750 were to be applied to craft unions, the situation would be impracticable.  Any legislation that is passed must be realistic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In some cases, especially in relation to the trades as distinct from general workers, it would be impossible for any group of people to get together on the basis of having a membership of 750.  It would be wrong if the legislation were to apply to the other section alone, that is the section that would be likely to have groups of 750.  As Deputy Cluskey said, the figure in the Bill is more satisfactory than the one suggested in the amendment. I do not think there could be any confusion in relation to finance for staff and facilities because this is a different problem entirely.  The issue at stake here is that of numbers.  I <Col N="751" /> might say that, in the first instance, I thought the figure mentioned in the Bill was perhaps too high but I would be prepared to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge Deputy Belton not to press the amendment mainly because I do not think it is entirely appropriate to this piece of trade union legislation.  The Bill is designed democratically to prevent the formation of breakaway unions and as such there is to be a membership limit of 500.  With regard to the Deputy's comment to the effect that he would like to see trade unions of 750 or more members that would be understandable if one were dealing with legislation that was designed to assist amalgamation or rationalisation of the trade union movement.  I understand his feelings in that regard but we are in the very delicate, complex area of freedom of association, of the right of association, and I think the further strengthening of the Bill, as suggested by Deputy Belton, might be somewhat self-defeating.  Therefore, I do not think the amendment should be strongly pressed.  In any event under the Bill, it is open to any group of less than 500 members to apply to the High Court for general exemption on the basis that an application from such a group with less than 500 members would not be against the public interest. This is a desirable feature and even if we were to agree to the 750 there would still be a substantial &ldquo;out&rdquo; for such groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our main preoccupation here is with the giving of a negotiating licence to very small groups of less than 500 members.  There is nothing sacrosanct about 500 members.  It is an entirely subjective assessment of the situation by the Minister.  It may be that in years to come we will see the wisdom or the validity of the point made by Deputy Belton but I do not think that at this stage of trade union legislation it is desirable; it may confuse the situation further and there has not been any great demand for it.  Our real purpose is to stop 50, 60 or a couple of hundred people going off at half-cock in the middle of an industrial dispute and <Col N="752" /> setting up their own trade union, not to stop them in any repressive sense but to enact legislation which will give workers cause to pause and to think of the enormity of what they would be doing in forming a trade union where they have relatively little negotiating strength or relatively little finance available to them, and who are forming a union because of passion or frustration caused by a particular issue relating to conditions of employment. That is not the best way to set up a trade union.  I do not think Deputy Belton's amendment would be that helpful in the long term and it might raise hares which we, on this side of the House, might not wish to chase.  It could prove to be very difficult in the context of freedom of association which is adequately covered by section 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there could be an argument put forward for reducing the number specified in the Bill.  We have, I think, 12 unions with less than 100 members.  If there was an amalgamation of, say, three of these unions would the Minister consider that they should qualify with a smaller number? This would have the effect of encouraging unions to amalgamate and so reduce the total number of unions.</P>

This I would hope to deal with in separate legislation.  With regard to the point made by Deputy Moore I should like to point out that any small unions which already have a negotiating licence are free to amalgamate. They will not be required to comply with the requirements of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 14 to 18 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.  (1) A body of persons (in this section referred to as the applicant) which fulfils a condition specified in section 7 (1) (a) of the Act of 1941, and which has deposited and keeps deposited with the High Court the appropriate sum (within the meaning of section 2 of this Act), but otherwise does not fulfil a condition specified in section 2 of this Act, may apply to the High Court for a declaration under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is for the purpose of clarification.  It is a drafting change which clarifies the point that it will not <Col N="754" /> be necessary for a body applying to the High Court for a declaration under this section to have kept the appropriate sum deposited for the previous 18 months.  The purpose of that is obvious.  The section as it was originally amended would mean that a body intending to go to the court might have to wait the 18 months whereas as re-drafted, clarified by this amendment, the section will enable a body who have lodged the necessary deposit to go to the court without waiting 18 months if they do not comply with the other requirements, say a body of less than 500 who feel that they have a right to appeal to the court for a licence.  Instead of having to wait 18 months as stipulated in the Bill generally they could go to court on the lodgment of the deposit.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>Before the Schedule to insert a new Schedule as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject to the requirements of section 2 (1) (b) the deposit shall in all cases be £5,000.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my first amendment I proposed that the number should be 750 instead of 500.  The Minister said 500 was sufficient.  Where people lose their heads and break away from a union they must have 500 members to form a new union.  Therefore, I feel that £5,000 should be sufficient right through.  I would not mind if it were £6,000 or £7,000 but there should be just one scale, not a sliding scale.  This is a fivefold increase on the amount in the 1941 Act.  It is difficult enough for a trade union to get subscriptions from their members and £5,000 is quite a sizeable amount for a breakaway union with 500 members to have in hand.  A union with 2,000 members can have £5,000 to £8,000 without any trouble. <Col N="755" /> I do not see why £5,000 of anybody's money should be tied up.  The deposit could go to £15,000 and in that case I do not see why £10,000 should be tied up in the case of the bigger unions. Admittedly the union get a dividend on the money lodged in court but they could use that money to better advantage in, say, building for themselves. A big trade union might want to have a branch in Cork.  To build an office there, using their own money, would be a better investment for them than to deposit the amount in court. I suggest that there should be a minimum and a maximum.  I do not see any reason for having a sliding scale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposition made by Deputy Belton might complicate matters even further.  In relation to trade union organisation, money is no great incentive to amalgamation. The deposits required have never stopped people from setting up a trade union, if they were really serious about setting up a union, or from amalgamating.  While it is true that there will be two levels of contribution arising out of the Schedule, Deputy Belton's amendment will not prevent this.  On balance, we would prefer to allow things to stand as they are within the Bill.  We honestly could not support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would advise Deputy Belton not to press the amendment as it would create anomalies, in that under the 1941 Act there was also an ascending scale and some unions at present have deposits as high as £10,000, which is the maximum under the 1941 Act, and if Deputy Belton's amendment were accepted, the unions that might be registered under this Bill, would be put in a better position than those registered under the 1941 legislation. For that reason alone, it would create an anomaly and could not have our support.</P>
      <P>There are other reasons for which it is well to keep an ascending scale.  As Deputy Desmond has said, people who wish to prove their <i>bona fides</i> as an association or as an organised, registered, legitimate trade union, will not baulk at lodging the necessary deposit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> It is not a payment; it is just a deposit and as such, is not really a drag on a union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not pressing the amendment.  I felt that if £10,000 was payable under the previous Act there is no reason why it should be only £5,000 now.  It is stupid when you get to a big union, who have to pay £15,000.  I do not see why £5,000 should not be sufficient and let them use their £10,000 in any way they like.  It is waste of money to put it into court and invest it in certain securities yielding 4 per cent and 6 per cent whereas the money could be used to the advantage of unions and their members in some other way.  That is the only reason why I put down the amendment.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £72,772,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1972, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid. </P>

      <Col N="757" /> The 1971 Budget provided for increases in milk prices and pig prices, increased levels of support for beef exports and improved rates of grant under the hogget ewe scheme, the small farm incentive bonus scheme and for certain farm buildings and equipment. In addition, the Minister for Finance announced in October that he was providing further funds mainly for disease eradication schemes.  I will be introducing a Supplementary Estimate at a later stage to take account of these and other items which are not included in the Estimate total of £72.8 million. That total is £3.3 million higher than the final provision for 1970-71.  It includes almost £36 million for price support, £22 million for agricultural production and development aids, £4 million for livestock improvement and disease eradication and almost £7 million for agricultural education, research and advisory services.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have already received notes on the main activities of my Department which will be of help to them in the debate on the Estimate.</P>
    <P>In 1970 the volume of agricultural output was an all-time high being 2.6 per cent more than in the previous year.  The rise in cattle output in 1970 made the greatest contribution to the overall output increase.  Although more cattle were sold than in 1969 there was an increase of 176,000 on farms at the end of 1970 so that the number available for marketing and breeding this year is much greater. There was a small decline in the volume of milk output due to the diversion of milk from creameries to feeding on farms.  The output of pigs exceeded the record level of 1969. Poultry output was also up but the output of sheep declined.  Barley output rose by about 4 per cent and there were marginal increases in the output of wheat and oats.  Sugar beet output also increased marginally but potato output continued to decline.  Agricultural prices also rose in 1970 and the combined effect of the rise in prices and volume was a new record output figure of £343 million, or £24 million higher than in 1969.  With increases in the usage and prices of fertilisers and <Col N="758" /> feeding stuffs and in other expenses, operating costs rose substantially during the year but, in spite of this, total family farm income was £10 million or 6 per cent higher than in 1969.  Allowing for the decline in the numbers engaged the income increase per person was, of course, more than 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>Farmers, like everybody else, are affected by the inflationary trends in the economy and as Deputies are aware the Government intervened on two occasions in 1970 and again in the 1971 Budget with a series of measures designed to raise farm incomes.  Total Exchequer provision in relation to agriculture is now running at a very high level&mdash;it is estimated that it will amount to about £105 million in the current financial year.  For reasons which are well known and which I need not explain the level of farm incomes is highly dependent on Government policy and action.  Farmers have very little scope for passing on increased costs to consumers and prices obtainable on export markets for several important agricultural commodities are often below cost of production, a situation which we hope EEC membership will remedy.  On a wider plane, this expenditure is justified by the very important contribution made by agriculture to the national economy, its impact on the balance of payments&mdash;agricultural exports are likely to be well in excess of £200 million this year&mdash;and its basic position in relation to the large sector of industry which is servicing it and dependent on it.</P>
    <P>I should now like to review briefly the main trends on a commodity basis beginning with cattle and beef.  The cattle trade was buoyant during 1970 and has continued so during the current year.  Our exports of store cattle to the UK so far this year show a marked increase on the figures for the same period in 1970.  The upward trend in export slaughterings of bullocks and heifers which has been evident in recent years was again maintained, although in recent months the high prices obtaining in Britain led to a greater proportion of our heavy cattle being exported live.  Up to the <Col N="759" /> end of October this year it is estimated that we have exported 550,000 live cattle as compared with 473,000 in the same period in 1970.  Slaughterings of cattle at export premises in the ten month period were 576,000 as compared with 530,000 in the same period in 1970.</P>
    <P>Cattle prices throughout this year have been averaging about £1 per live cwt. over 1970 prices, which themselves were regarded as satisfactory.  In the short term the prospects of firm cattle prices are reasonably good.  In the longer term we can look forward to a higher level of prices on accession to the EEC.  The latest census returns show cattle numbers at record levels.</P>
    <P>Thanks to good market conditions in Britain, export subsidy costs on beef this year will be substantially less than in 1970-71.</P>
    <P>Quota restrictions on beef imports into the US continued during 1971. Ireland's quota for the current year was 31,116 tons, an increase of 670 tons on the previous year.  Our beef exports to the US consist almost entirely of frozen boneless beef for manufacturing purposes.</P>
    <P>All in all, we have the very satisfactory situation in the cattle industry this year of an increased national herd, increased cattle and beef exports and a profitable level of prices.</P>
    <P>Following the improved rates of grant introduced in 1970 there was a big increase in participation in the beef cattle incentive scheme in all counties and in the year to March, 1971, over £4.8 million was paid to about 51,000 herdowners.  In 1971 there was a further significant increase in the number of participating herdowners and in the Estimate now before the House funds totalling £5.3 million, or an increase of £500,000 on the amount paid out in grants last year, are being provided. However, with over 61,000 herdowners now participating and the average herd size tending to increase, the £5.3 million will not be adequate and additional funds will have to be provided.</P>
    <P>Over 1,000,000 cows or 61 per cent of the total were artificially inseminated in 1970, Hereford and Friesian being the breeds mainly in demand.  There is <Col N="760" /> no indication of any significant change in this pattern in 1971.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of the policy of trying out new breeds under Irish conditions, 12 bulls and 122 heifers of the Fleckvieh, or Simmental, dual-purpose breed were imported from Austria last May.  The bulls have been located at AI stations to enable a comprehensive progeny test to be carried out, while the heifers are with pedigree herdowners who are participating with my Department in an assessment programme to evaluate the breed under Irish conditions.  Two further importations currently under way will bring the total imports of this breed to 450.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of Friesians in the national breeding pattern, an experimental import of 11 bulls and 11 heifers of the German Friesian breed was also arranged in 1971 to investigate the potential contribution which this breed can make to our native stocks.  The bulls have gone to AI stations to be progeny tested for milk and beef characteristics while the heifers have been used to establish an experimental herd at Clonakilty Agricultural College where they will take part in comparison trials with a herd of Irish Friesians.</P>
    <P>Turning to milk, the slight fall in intake at creameries last year has been reversed and it is estimated that intake this year will reach the record total of 530 million gallons, about 16 million gallons over the 1970 figure.</P>
    <P>A world shortage in supplies has resulted in prices for our dairy produce, particularly in the UK, reaching very high levels.  However, notwithstanding the increase in the volume of milk available here for processing, we were unable to take full advantage of the suspension, owing to the supply situation, of the British butter and cheese quota arrangements.</P>
    <P>The £30 million in the printed Estimate for creamery milk support does not include provision for the increases in the milk price allowances or the adjustment of the multi-tiered system of payment announced in the Budget.  It now appears likely that, because of the improved export market prices, the additional expenditure on production allowances will be counterbalanced <Col N="761" /> by savings in the grant to An Bord Bainne.  I might add that creamery milk producers, in addition to benefiting from the Budget increases, have also benefited directly from the favourable market situation through a reduction in the levy payable by them to the board.</P>
    <P>This has not been an easy year for the sheep industry.  Since April last sheep and lamb prices have been lower than in 1970 but in recent weeks factory prices for lamb have hardened and are now about the same as they were at this time last year.  The reasons for the lower prices this year were poorer market conditions, especially on the French market where import levies were increased and where stronger competition was met from increased British exports.  Increased earlier marketings of lamb arising from mild weather conditions in the spring also added to the problem.</P>
    <P>There has been substantial help from the State for sheep production this year.  The rate of subsidy on hogget ewes has been increased from £1.50 to £2 per head and total payments under the sheep subsidy schemes will be about £1.75 million, an increase of about £400,000 over 1970.  The guaranteed price for lamb was increased, in line with the British increase, by 2.2p per lb.  To assist the industry we extended the period during which the upward seasonal adjustment to our rates of subsidy applied and we abandoned the autumn deduction.  As a result of these measures and of having to send increased supplies to Britain rather than the Continent, export subsidy payments on mutton and lamb since last April have amounted to about £400,000 as compared with about £30,000 in the same period in 1970 and payments for the full year 1971-72 are expected to amount to £850,000 as compared with £56,000 for 1970-71.</P>
    <P>Even with heavier slaughterings throughout the year we have an increased sheep flock.  A rise of 76,000 in June, 1970, has been followed by a further increase of 84,000 in June, 1971.  I am hopeful that the rising trend will continue and <Col N="762" /> accelerate.  In the mountain areas, the number of sheep presented for subsidy this year is expected to show an increase of about 10 per cent. The hogget ewe subsidy introduced last year in the lowland areas appears to be having the desired effect in encouraging more hoggets to be retained for breeding and the number presented for subsidy is likely to be up by more than 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>This year I took further steps to improve the efficiency and operation of the wool marketing arrangements.  On 1st April the register of buyers of wool was set up with the result that only registered buyers could operate from that date.  Over 250 buyers have been registered and all those have premises which meet the standards laid down in regulations. Also in April this year, on the basis of recomendations by An Chomhairle Olla, I made regulations providing for the purchase of wool on a graded basis and the display by buyers of purchase prices.  Buyers are also required to furnish to producers statements of wool purchased.  Our thanks are due to wool buyers and producers for the manner in which they co-operated with my Department and with an Chomhairle Olla in the introduction and implementation of these requirements. The courses in wool grading provided by An Chomhairle Olla for wool buyers and their staffs proved particularly useful.</P>
    <P>As regards horses, the most important development was the setting up of Bord na gCapall under the Horse industry Act, 1970.  The board have a wide range of functions, including the establishment and operation of a national equitation centre, giving advice on breeding, and promoting the sale and export of non-thoroughbred horses.  I am looking forward to this body playing a most useful role in the development of the horse industry.</P>
    <P>Pig production continues at the high levels of recent years.  So far this year deliveries of pigs to bacon factories are well ahead of 1970 and the total for the year will exceed 2,000,000.</P>
    <P>Pigmeat was in surplus supply on European markets this year and marketing conditions were difficult <Col N="763" /> with subsidy costs high.  There is now some slowing down in European production and the market is expected to improve over the coming months.  In order to meet higher costs of production the guaranteed minimum prices for pigs were increased in May and again in September.</P>
    <P>The rationalisation of our bacon curing industry has become a matter of urgency in the context of prospective EEC membership.  It has been apparent for a long time that, in relation to total production, we had too many factories, a low average throughput and excessive overhead costs.  Furthermore a number of our factories no longer meet the very high standards of plant and equipment required by importing countries.  Fewer plants and higher all round standards are essential if we are to safeguard the interests of pig producers and the industry in the competitive conditions which will have to be faced on home and export markets in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>A rationalisation scheme has now been put in hand.  Individual processors are being invited to surrender their licences on a compensation basis. Factories which will continue in operation will be encouraged to modernise and extend their plants where this is considered necessary.  The administration of the scheme, the cost of which will be financed by a levy on pigs slaughtered at the factories, has been assigned to the Pigs and Bacon Commission. The commission will be assisted in their task by a consultative group representing the Industrial Development Authority, the Fair Trade Commission, the Federated Union of Employers, the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Department of Labour and my Department. The commission will keep in close touch with the IDA, AnCO and the Department of Labour in the course of the rationalisation programme so as to ensure that there will be a reasonable opportunity of arranging for alternative employment in the area of closures and also for special training courses for any new industries with which it might be possible to replace the factories being closed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> Turning to poultry, broiler consumption continues to increase.  Production of broilers in 1970 amounted to 15 million birds and is expected to be about 17 million in 1971.</P>
    <P>In the case of turkeys, increasing use of day-old poults from licensed turkey hatcheries has led to an improvement in the quality generally of turkeys marketed.  Supplies of fresh turkeys for the Christmas trade are likely to be about 5 per cent greater than last year and, together with increased stocks in cold store, will be fully adequate to meet the demand.</P>
    <P>As regards livestock diseases, while there is no appreciable change in the incidence of bovine tuberculosis its persistence in some areas, even at a slightly lower rate, is a cause of concern. Testing on an area basis is at present being done in counties Waterford and Kilkenny and it is proposed to extend such testing to the remaining southern counties next year.  The purpose of the change from a county basis to an area basis is to ensure that all the cattle in each area are tested and all reactors removed over a very short period.</P>
    <P>There are five counties in the brucellosis free area&mdash;Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Sligo.  Herd testing must continue there to guard against any resurgence of the disease.</P>
    <P>In the light of the introduction of brucellosis eradication on an area basis in Britain, and our prospective accession to the European Economic Community, the early clearance of brucellosis from the midland counties, from which most of our live cattle are exported, is very important.  With this in mind, and also to safeguard the counties already cleared, full scale eradication measures were started in Counties Louth, Longford, Mayo, Roscommon, Westmeath, Meath and part of county Offaly in 1970.  The level of the disease in County Mayo was low and clearance was rapid so that I hope to add that county to the brucellosis free area within the next few months. In County Meath, on the other hand, the disease incidence, as had been expected, was high, particularly in the dairy herds.  The numbers of reactors and the high prices paid for them have made a heavy drain on the available <Col N="765" /> funds and I am aware that some dairymen have met with difficulty, even hardship, because of the persistence of the disease in their herds.  I have the eradication procedures under examination at present to see whether these difficulties can be abated.  The scheme is proceeding very satisfactorily in the other counties mentioned and I am confident that, even in County Meath, the second round of testing will show a substantial reduction of the disease.</P>
    <P>In the remaining counties the Voluntary Brucellosis Scheme and the Brucellosis (Certified) Herds Scheme are available to herdowners who wish to clear their herds in advance of general eradication.  In these counties also two rounds of milk ring tests of all creamery herds were carried out this year to identify the clear herds.  Discussions have taken place with mart organisations to promote special sales of animals from herds which were twice clear to the milk ring test.</P>
    <P>The Heifer Vaccination Scheme operating in the 11 main dairying counties of the south and east is, I am glad to say, proving attractive to farmers and over 300,000 heifers have so far been vaccinated.  Vaccination will not, of course, cure or eradicate the disease but it will give protection to many herds in the dairying area until the eradication programme reaches there.</P>
    <P>The work of the expert group formed to study the problem of liver fluke has already produced some useful results.  Bodies co-operating with my Department in this group are An Foras Talúntais, the veterinary faculties of the universities and the Irish Veterinary Association.  Shell Research Ltd. is also making a valuable contribution.  I wish to take this opportunity of thanking these bodies for their help.</P>
    <P>When the provision for general disease control and eradication was being estimated it was expected that the cost of free treatment of warble infested animals this year would be much the same as in 1969-70.  In the event it was decided to suspend free treatment and to allocate part of the provision towards meeting the cost of providing supervision of the national warble dressing <Col N="766" /> programme this autumn.  This programme has gone very well and, while final figures of the number of cattle dressed are not yet available, it is clear that well over 5,000,000 cattle have been dealt with.  I am grateful to the farming organisations who co-operated fully in the scheme and to the vast majority of herdowners whose ready participation helped to make it a success.  A special word of thanks is due to the artificial insemination bodies for their excellent work in organising and executing the dressing programme in their respective areas.</P>
    <P>A serious and widespread epidemic of fowl pest occurred in Britain last year.  The disease spread rapidly through most of England and Wales and some areas in Scotland.  Special precautionary measures were taken to guard against the introduction of the infection into this country.  Although the situation in Britain has been progressively improving for some months past continued vigilance is necessary in the interests of our valuable poultry industry.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of animal diseases I would like to stress the importance to the agricultural economy of our eradication and control measures.  By raising the standard of health of our livestock these measures not only improve efficiency in production but also ensure a better return from sales on export markets of the resultant higher and better quality output.</P>
    <P>As regards tillage the area under cereal crops in 1971 showed an increase over 1970 and is now close to 1,000,000 acres.  Harvesting was completed quickly in favourable weather conditions with relatively few intake or storage problems.</P>
    <P>The wheat acreage was 226,000 compared with 234,000 in 1970.  Yields varied considerably but, on the overall, the average yield is likely to compare favourably with the levels of recent years.</P>
    <P>Under the stimulus of a floor price increase of £2.50 per ton to the grower, the acreage under feeding barley increased by almost 12 per cent over 1970 to a new record of 452.000 acres in 1971.  Malting barley at 139,000 <Col N="767" /> acres was up by about 10 per cent. The average yields of both feeding and malting barley were higher than in 1970.  The return to growers should be very satisfactory and the increased production of home-grown feeding grain will help our balance of payments position.  Barley growing is one of the areas where producers will benefit on this country's entry to the EEC and the steadily increasing acreage of feeding barley is a healthy trend.</P>
    <P>Despite an increase of £2.50 per ton in the guaranteed floor price for oats grown in the western counties in 1971 the overall acreage of oats continues to fall.  The area sown in 1971 was 151,000 acres compared with 168,000 acres in 1970.  In general the quality was reasonably good and the average yield was higher than last year.  Owing to insufficiency of home supplies, some imports of high quality oats will again be required for oatmeal milling and for feeding to bloodstock.  It is my policy, however, to ensure that such imports are kept to an absolute minimum and that they will not interfere with the market for home-grown oats.</P>
    <P>The production and use of compound feeding stuffs is continuing to increase and reflects the growing preference of farmers for properly balanced livestock foods.  The output figure for 1970 was slightly over 1,000,000 tons.  I have been concerned to ensure that only good quality compound feeding stuffs are offered for sale and that proper standards are observed by manufacturers.  Although it was necessary to take legal proceedings during the past year against a number of compounders whose products were found, on analysis, to be deficient in relation to their statement of guaranteed contents, I am glad to say that the position generally has considerably improved.</P>
    <P>While the number of applications received in 1970-71 under the Land Project was less than in the previous year, there is still a high level of demand for the facilities of the project.</P>
    <P>During the year the Farm Buildings Scheme was rationalised and improved to bring it more into line with modern agricultural requirements.  A number <Col N="768" /> of new grants were introduced and existing grants revised.  In the case of the Water Supplies Scheme the maximum grant for the provision of piped water to farmyards and fields was increased.</P>
    <P>These schemes for modernising farm buildings, improving land and water supplies have greatly increased the potential of Irish agriculture for efficient competitive production.</P>
    <P>Ground limestone consumption for the year ended March, 1971, at 1.6 million tons was only slightly less than the record figure for the previous year. Consumption of nitrogen, phosphorus and potash continued to increase.  The total amount being provided for lime and fertilisers in the current year is £7.1 million, an increase of £230,000 on the amount provided last year.</P>
    <P>The total provision for horticulture in the Estimate is £518,000 of which £450,000 is for grants for glasshouses. The latter sum would be sufficient to provide for the erection of over 50 acres of modern fully equipped glass, but, in fact, a large number of grants this year have been for the installation of heating and ancillary equipment in houses already erected, rather than for completely new houses.</P>
    <P>Applications for grants are still substantial, but the backlog of applications which awaited attention in previous years has largely been eliminated.  Since the introduction of the scheme in 1967, over £1.6 million has been paid in grants, with an investment of about twice this sum by growers.  Although the home market for tomatoes during the cold month of June was somewhat depressed, returns over the full 1971 season have been satisfactory.  Up to the end of September, almost 3,500 tons of tomatoes valued at £728,000 had been exported compared with 3,100 tons valued at £600,000 in the corresponding period of 1970.</P>
    <P>The Estimate provision includes £50,000 in respect of grants for the erection of mushroom units.  These grants offer growers an incentive to enter an expanding sector of horticultural production.  With approaching entry to the EEC, it is necessary that provision for statutory grading of horticultural produce should be made and <Col N="769" /> preparation of the necessary enabling legislation is at present being undertaken.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with our education, research and advisory services. By far the most important of our agricultural resources are the men and women who work on our farms and my Department is very much concerned with improving their management and technical efficiency.  This involves a continuing process of education and advice and the provision and application of new information and techniques.</P>
    <P>Full-time residential courses are provided at 11 agricultural colleges and in 1970-71 total attendance at these courses was approximately 600.  This year Kildalton Agriculture and Horticultural College at Piltown, County Kilkenny, was opened as a new residential college with accommodation for over 100 students.  In addition to full-time courses, residential short courses are provided at the Department's colleges at Athenry and Clonakilty. Winter agricultural classes and farm schools are conducted at numerous centres throughout the country.  Full-time education in commercial horticulture, poultry-keeping, dairying and farm home management is also provided at several centres.</P>
    <P>The farm apprenticeship scheme, which has grown from the original 24 participants in 1964 to 123 in 1970-71, also plays an important part in agricultural education and training. Educational facilities in agriculture, horticulture and dairy science at university level have been expanded and the number of students taking degree courses has steadily increased. Proposals for further development of the university faculties are being examined by the Government Departments concerned in consultation with the universities.  It will be evident that very substantial progress has been made in providing the educational basis for a modern, sophisticated agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>There has been rapid expansion also in the advisory services.  The number of instructors has increased from 355 ten years ago to 608 at present.  During <Col N="770" /> the past year I have had a series of consultations with the various interested organisations on the proposals for the reorganisation of these advisory services.  The discussions are not finally completed but I hope that the stage will soon be reached when decisions can be taken on an organisational structure for the services which will best suit our needs in the challenging times ahead.</P>
    <P>One of the most important tasks of the advisory services is to keep in touch with research and technological advances at home and abroad.  Research in this country, undertaken by An Foras Talúntais, the universities and my Department, has been considerably stepped up in recent years and has given some useful results.  A substantial allocation of State funds is now involved.</P>
    <P>On the subject of small farms, I am glad to say that the Small Farm (Incentive) Bonus Scheme continues to make steady progress and is very attractive for smaller farmers planning expansion. New applications are being received at the rate of about 2,500 per year and more than 2,000 new participants were launched on farm development plans during the past year, bringing the total of active participants to nearly 10,000.  The scheme continues to have most impact in the western counties which account for two-thirds of the participants.</P>
    <P>Under a pilot scheme introduced earlier this year certain types of group farming projects will be eligible to qualify for special grant assistance. The scheme is directed mainly towards encouraging groups which aim to increase their efficiency in the production and marketing of their produce.  The grants offered are intended to be of a &ldquo;priming&rdquo; nature to help worthwhile groups in the early stages of development. The scheme is essentially experimental at this stage and it is proposed to review its scope and general operation in due course in the light of experience.  A limited number of applications have already been received and these are being processed in consultation with the local advisory services.</P>
    <P>A report entitled &ldquo;Agriculture in <Col N="771" /> the West of Ireland: A Review of the Low Income Problem in Farming&rdquo; prepared by my Department's western regional officer is due to be published shortly.  The report presents a general examination of the factors contributing to the low income problem in western farming as well as an appraisal of the pilot area development programme covering its first five years of operation and an assessment of the factors which contributed to or inhibited progress in the pilot area during that period.  I look forward to constructive public discussion of this report and to receiving comments on it from interested persons and organisations.</P>
    <P>On the subject of pollution, which is a matter of serious concern, my Department is represented on an inter-departmental working group set up by the Minister for Local Government to examine the problem.  At the same time my Department has been pursuing its own investigations on problems arising or likely to arise in the agricultural sector, for example in relation to silage effluent, farmyard waste and effluent from creameries and meat and poultry processing factories.  The results of these investigations have been transmitted to the inter-departmental working group for consideration in connection with its work on the overall problem which is one that calls for increasing attention if we are to succeed in overcoming this danger to our environment.</P>
    <P>I should now like to say a brief word about the general agricultural position in 1971.  This has been an excellent year for farming and it is already clear that both output and income will be substantially higher than in 1970.  Our estimate is that the volume of output will be up by around 5 per cent and aggregate family farm income by about 10 per cent.  The most encouraging feature is the strengthening of the cattle sector where numbers have now topped the 6,000,000 mark and, with the breeding herd in excess of 2,000,000 for the first time, future prospects are very promising.  Milk production is above last year's level, pig production is expanding and the declining trend in sheep numbers has been reversed. The tillage acreage is up, with significant <Col N="772" /> increases in the case of barley and sugar beet.  The increase in output has already added £30 million to our agricultural export earnings this year.</P>
    <P>We have now had four years of sustained expansion in farm output, income and prices In this period output has increased by over 15 per cent; agricultural prices have risen by 26 per cent and incomes by almost 40 per cent.  This evidence of continuing progress and prosperity is a tribute to the skill and hard work of our farmers and reflects the soundness of the Government's policy in relation to agriculture. It also clearly demonstrates that the farming community is now well equipped to exploit the opportunities which membership of the EEC will provide.</P>
    <P>I do not propose on this occasion to go into detail on the terms of accession to the Community for Irish agriculture. This will be spelled out in the Government White Paper which it is planned to publish early in the new year.  Following publication, the House will have the opportunity to discuss the terms and the prospects in depth.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the terms of accession for Irish agriculture provide for the gradual harmonisation of our agricultural prices with the common price levels of the Community, the gradual removal of obstacles to trade within the enlarged Community and the adoption of a common trade policy <i>vis-à-vis</i> non-member countries.  For our major products, price harmonisation means a gradual levelling up of our prices to the Common Market level; in the case of cattle and milk it means something in the region of a 50 per cent increase on 1970 prices.</P>
    <P>One could not over-emphasise the significance to Irish farming of our move into Europe.  Irish farmers will be participating in a common agricultural policy which has among its specific objectives the aims of ensuring market stability and the provision of a fair and reasonable standard of living for the agricultural population.</P>
    <P>Membership of the EEC will place Irish agriculture on the threshold of a new era of challenge and opportunity. What it means is that our farmers will be getting the chance, hitherto denied <Col N="773" /> them, of competing on fair and equal terms with their fellow farmers in the Community in a great and growing market.  Fair and equal terms means that obstacles we have had to contend with up to now will be removed and it will be up to ourselves, through the efficient production, processing and marketing of top quality farm products, to compete successfully and reap the full advantages of membership.</P>
    <P>Here I might mention that one of the points that keep coming up in discussions about our membership of the EEC is the position of the small farmer. It should be said straight away that the small farmer who works his land efficiently will be better off under EEC than he is to-day.  He will get better prices for what he has to sell and it will be up to himself to get the most out of his land.  Aids and incentives which can be operated under Common Market regulations will be oriented towards less favoured areas and smaller farmers, the basic purpose being to increase their efficiency and earning capacity.  While it is not possible to say at this stage precisely what changes will have to be made in various schemes and services of my Department to align them to Common Market regulations, I feel I can say that the general principle on which my thinking is based is that the effort of the State will, in future, be more and more concentrated on the smaller but potentially viable farmers to help them make the most of their resources in order to take the fullest advantage of what the Common Market has to offer.  For the bigger farmers operating on a fully commercial basis, their rewards will come increasingly from the market, and their dependence on Exchequer assistance should progressively decline.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I must stress the urgency of adapting our processing and marketing organisations to take full advantage of the opportunities the Common Market will offer.  This is particularly true in the case of milk processing.  The rationalisation of the creamery industry has made some progress, but it is still far from complete and, in some areas at least, there seem to be lingering hopes that everything can go on as before and that talk <Col N="774" /> about rationalisation is so much hot air.  Under the Common Market system, there can be a big difference to the producer between the best price and the worst price, and that difference will depend largely on the efficiency of the processing unit and its ability to use its milk supply to the best advantage. This means utilising all parts of the milk, including in particular the skim milk.  At present, some areas lack facilities for processing skim milk. This is a serious drawback to those areas and one which the owners of creameries there must tackle with drive and energy immediately.</P>
    <P>From time to time, it has been stated that the position of the Dairy Disposal Company has been an inhibiting factor in the process of rationalisation.  This is certainly not the case.  I have stated repeatedly that the Dairy Disposal Company will be happy to co-operate in schemes of rationalisation or to sell units to co-operative groups as part of the rationalisation process.  In the past few months, subject to settlement of details, agreement has been reached on terms for the transfer of three of the company's creamery groups to co-operative societies, and negotiations for the transfer of a further group are at present taking place.  This is considerable progress and will make a positive contribution to creamery rationalisation in the areas concerned. In other areas&mdash;for example, Kerry&mdash; the Dairy Disposal Company is participating with co-operative and private interests in setting up diversification facilities.  In County Clare the Dairy Disposal Company has been authorised to create new processing facilities. There is no intention of closing the door to co-operative development in County Clare, and I would suggest to the IAOS and to the farmers in that county that, if they want to put the milk industry in County Clare on a co-operative basis, they should develop a programme to buy out the Dairy Disposal Company for an agreed price over a number of years.  This, however, is a matter entirely for themselves. Co-operation cannot be forced on them nor indeed on anybody else by any kind of Government order.</P>
    <P>As regards marketing, the monopoly <Col N="775" /> export position which An Bord Bainne now enjoys is not in conformity with EEC regulations.  Under EEC the maximum co-operation in processing and marketing between the dairy cooperatives will be essential for success. Pigmeat exports which are at present centralised through the Pigs and Bacon Commission will face a similar situation.  Ireland is not a big country and our entire exports of dairy products or pigmeat are not large by world standards.  It will certainly not be in our interests to have these exports handled by individual exporters selling relatively small quantities with variations in quality and seasonal irregularity in supplies.  In our circumstances, co-ordinated exporting by central agencies using modern techniques will be indispensable.  I am glad that, in the case of dairy products, the farmers' organisations and others concerned are, in fact, actively considering the type of marketing arrangements which they should have in EEC conditions.</P>
    <P>I should like to add a brief word about foreign participation in the dairying industry.  Under Common Market regulations, this cannot be prevented by Government action, but it will take place only to the extent that milk producers and their co-operatives want it to take place.  If the cooperatives, through lack of enterprise or skill, or through an inability to work together for the good of their members, leave a vacuum in the marketing process, somebody is bound to fill it. Shortage of capital is often referred to as the cause.  I accept that sometimes it has been a problem, but I believe it is often the smallest problem and one which the steps now being taken to expand credit facilities will help to overcome.</P>
    <P>This is one of the major questions which I have been discussing recently with farmers' organisations.  Another is the restructuring of our creamery milk prices in anticipation of EEC membership.  I shall deal with creamery milk first.</P>
    <P>The Government have reviewed the creamery milk situation particularly with regard to the need to gear the milk price structure more closely to the conditions that will obtain under <Col N="776" /> an enlarged EEC.  The greatly improved export demand for dairy products and the increase in production and processing costs have also been carefully considered.  The improvement in the export markets for dairy products in the past 12 months is expected to be maintained in 1972, and the further outlook for beef cattle also appears to be good.  Farm and creamery costs, both wages and materials, have however also been increasing appreciably.  In these circumstances and to strengthen further the position of the dairying and cattle sectors of our economy in anticipation of future export opportunities, the Government have decided to raise creamery milk prices.  I am announcing this decision now rather than waiting until Budget time next spring so that farmers can plan their next year's farm programme with the knowledge of these significant changes.</P>
    <P>The structure of the creamery milk pricing system will be remodelled on a basis that would be appropriate in an EEC context and at the same time the average return per gallon will be increased.  This will be brought about by increasing from 1st December, 1971, the prices paid by An Bord Bainne for butter and other dairy products, including a system of support for skim milk powder; by introducing a subsidy on liquid skim returned to suppliers and by removing the liability on farmers to meet one-third of any increased losses incurred on exports of dairy products arising from these changes.  The higher prices payable by Bord Bainne will incorporate the existing Exchequer milk price and quality allowances and this change will mean that the arrangement under which a tiered system of milk price allowances was paid to producers supplying over 10,000 gallons per annum to creameries will no longer operate.  It is estimated that in 1972 the average price of creamery milk will be 2p per gallon higher than the average price in 1971.</P>
    <P>The ex-creamery price of butter for sale on the home market will be increased by £52 a ton; this will represent an increase of approximately 2½p per lb. in the retail price.  The home butter price, which for the first time <Col N="777" /> in many years is now below the export price, has remained at the same level since 1966, despite a number of increases since then in milk prices and, indeed, in food prices generally, including margarine.  Even allowing for this price increase, butter consumed on the home market will still carry an Exchequer subsidy of nearly 8p a lb. Home market prices of cheese and other milk products will also be increased correspondingly.  The price of milk used in these products has not been increased since before 1962.</P>
    <P>To give effect to these changes, the following detailed arrangements will apply on and from 1st December and will continue unchanged during the 1972 season.</P>
    <P> (1)  The price payable by An Bord Bainne to creameries for butter as from 1st December, 1971, will be increased from £469 per ton by £256 to £725 per ton.  This increase will be equivalent to 5p per gallon of the present milk price and quality allowances.  The payment of the present milk price and quality allowances by my Department direct to creameries will cease at the same time.  New arrangements will be made with creameries to ensure that quality standards for milk are maintained.</P>
    <P>(2)  The price for skim milk powder will be supported at a level of £160 per ton equivalent to a price of about 5p per gallon of skim milk.  As facilities for the production of skim milk powder are not available in some areas, a subsidy of 2½p per gallon will be paid on skim milk returned by creameries to their suppliers.  This subsidy will be equivalent to 2p per gallon of the present milk price allowance on whole milk.</P>
    <P>(3)  The support prices of other dairy products will be increased to bring them into line with those of butter and skim milk powder.</P>
    <P>(4)  These changes will mean that Bord Bainne will be involved in substantial export losses and it will be necessary to ensure that this does not reduce the return to producers. It is proposed therefore to amend the Dairy Produce (Marketing) Act, <Col N="778" /> 1961, to enable the whole of any increased export losses that arise as a result of these proposals to be met by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>(5)  The retail price of creamery butter on the home market will be increased by approximately 2½p per lb.  This will still leave an Exchequer subsidy of £176 per ton on creamery butter supplied to the home market, making the price for that market £549 per ton against the new Bord Bainne purchasing price of £725 per ton.  </P>
    <P>To encourage smaller producers, especially those in creamery milk production, to expand their enterprises on a more intensive basis, the Government have also decided to increase to £500, from the present level of £325, the total bonus grant that may be earned by new participants under the Small Farm (Incentive Bonus) Scheme. The increased rate will apply to farmers accepted into the scheme on and after 1st January, 1972.  This scheme which is giving very useful results, will be revised and kept under review in the light of evolving EEC structural policy.</P>
    <P>The Government have also reviewed the present capital position of agriculture and the agricultural processing industries, and the capital requirements which will have to be met in the light of prospective entry to the EEC.  It is estimated that the level of total capital investment in farming is now running at around £60 million a year.  Of this, over £40 million comes from investment by farmers, financed both from reinvestment out of farm incomes and from banks and other normal credit institutions, and the rest is provided by the Exchequer as part of the public capital programme.  Farmers can be expected to increase their rate of investment still further in the coming years in view of the excellent prospects for agriculture. Extra investment will be needed to finance both a higher rate of farm output and the rationalisation and modernisation of production and processing facilities.  It is expected that much of this extra investment will be financed from the substantially higher farm incomes arising from entry <Col N="779" /> into EEC as well as from the usual commercial credit sources.  There are, however, some areas of agricultural investment which might not be met in full by these sources.  The Government have, therefore, decided to increase the availability of credit for agriculture through the Agricultural Credit Corporation in the following ways:</P>
    <P>In the case of credit for farmers the amount which the corporation may lend in 1971-72 for the purpose of expanding efficient production will be increased.  This year the amount in the public capital programme for lending by the corporation was £6.3 million, and, as recently announced by the Minister for Finance, this has been increased to £9 million.  The Minister for Finance has now authorised the corporation to lend a further £4.5 million in the current year.  The corporation expect that this level of lending will enable them to meet the full demand for productive credit by farmers this year.</P>
    <P>Credit for processing industries will be available as required from the Agricultural Credit Corporation to help finance approved projects and to supplement capital raised from State grants, farmers' investment, and borrowing from other sources.  Priority will be given to the milk processing and pigmeat processing industries, but this does not preclude consideration of applications from other processing industries. In the case of the milk processing sector, it is estimated that the extra borrowing required may be of the order of £4 million.  Of this, the Dairy Disposal Company may require up to £1 million to cover the construction by the company of processing facilities in County Clare and the participation by them in processing plants in other areas.  For the bacon industry, after making allowance for grants, and for capital to be provided from non-Exchequer sources, an additional sum of the order of £1 million may be required to help finance improvement of factories as part of the bacon industry rationalisation scheme.</P>
    <P>These decisions will result in total lendings by the corporation being increased to an estimated £13.5 million in 1971-72 with further substantial increases <Col N="780" /> likely in the following year. Moreover credit availability through the corporation will be kept under review in the light of the demands for credit and the resources available.  The Central Bank are currently reviewing the overall credit situation and in that context will be discussing with the commercial banks the particular needs of agriculture.  The extra facilities to be provided by the Agricultural Credit Corporation taken in conjunction with the public capital programme, farmers' own investment funds and normal commercial credit facilities, in particular from the commercial banks, are expected to meet in full the capital needs of Irish agriculture in the years immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>These developments on milk and capital will give farmers added incentives and opportunities to plan ahead in the knowledge of the full support they will receive from my Department. Farming to-day is prospering and there is all round confidence in the country that this prosperity will increase further. We have followed policies that have generated this prosperity and we will continue to give farmers the support they need to develop the full potential of our agriculture.</P>
    <P>In conclusion may I say that I look forward to a useful debate on this Estimate and I shall welcome any comments and suggestions Deputies may wish to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My comments on the Minister's speech shall be brief because it is very difficult to go into any detail or to assess the increases given to the farming community when one received a copy of the brief only as the Minister stood up to speak.  However, I am sure that other members of this party will be more detailed than I in their assessment of the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I wish to say that what has astounded me is the complacency of the Minister regarding the prosperity of the agricultural community. We have been subjected to this sort of complacency for far too long.  I welcome wholeheartedly the increases given to the farming community and I welcome also the change in the milk <Col N="781" /> price structure.  This change is long overdue.  It might be said of it that it is too little and too late.  From this side of the House we have long been advocating a change in the milk price structure because we believed that the structure, as it was, was doing untold damage to the dairying industry and that it was militating against efficiency and quality production, which are so important.</P>
    <P>At this stage, too, I should like to say that, in so far as the Minister himself is concerned, I concede that, when he was appointed Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries as a result of the re-shuffle or the turmoil within his own party, he was favourably accepted by the farming community, particularly in the south of Ireland. The reason for this was that, unlike his predecessors who had no idea whatsoever of the problems of the farming community, he had a practical knowledge of agriculture and its problems, and such knowledge is necessary in order that one would understand the problems associated with agriculture. However, it must be said that people who were pleased when he was appointed have been critical of him of late because up to now he has not achieved anything.</P>
    <P>In my opinion and in the opinion of my party the present is a very important time in the history of agriculture in this country.  If we are to derive the fullest possible benefits from our membership of EEC it is important that there be the necessary alterations and preparations.  Very valuable time has been lost.  The Minister must be aware of the necessity for gearing our farmers to meet the challenge of the competition that they will encounter within the EEC.</P>
    <P>I shall deal first with the dairying industry because I believe this branch of agriculture to be the basis of the entire industry, because from it stem all other farming activities.  Those engaged in the dairying industry have got a raw deal.  This can be said, in particular, of those engaged in milk production. What is needed now to help these people to modernise their farmyards and equipment is an injection of capital.  I am glad that a change in <Col N="782" /> milk prices has been announced today. I have pointed out to the Minister on various occasions that it is necessary to fix the price for milk early in autumn because it is at that stage that farmers are planning their programmes for the year ahead.</P>
    <P>Because of the uneconomic price that was paid for milk last year and because of the multitier price system which almost bankrupted some farmers, many farmers in my area were contemplating changing over to the beef subsidy scheme.  I could see a distinct danger in this respect, that is that because of the amount of slavery that is attached to milk production, people who change over to beef production will find it very difficult to change back to milk production.  The young farmer of today is not attracted to the seven-day week that is demanded of those who keep herds of cows.</P>
    <P>I still say, particularly as far as the south is concerned, that we are better geared and more suitable for milk production than we are for beef.  The young farmer coming up today wants to have a modern farmyard and modern equipment and realises that we have never succeeded in getting the full potential out of the land of this country.  As is stated in the Minister's speech, the production of milk and beef has gone up and production in other lines of farming as well, but the problem is that there is not a sufficient amount of capital to get the maximum production from the land of this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that there will be extra money available to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I have had considerable dealings with the ACC and I am at a loss to know what is necessary in order to qualify for a loan from them.  Out of a large number of applicants who have written to me, I think I have succeeded in getting a loan for only one.  If we are to succeed we must have an injection of capital and not the figure of £9 million mentioned by the Minister.  This is only a drop in the ocean.  Let us take the case of the son of a farmer who is about to take over.  He will want to get the maximum production from that farm.  In order to do that he will <Col N="783" /> need to have a full stock on that farm. The price of cattle is pretty high to-day. Without the capital he cannot get the maximum out of his farm.</P>
    <P>This is something which has not been attended to by the present Government and the present Minister for Agriculture. He must meet the problem as a Deputy in his constituency as we all do. Take the case of a farmer with a young family who is not in a position to invest in his farm because of the scarcity of capital.  His family are growing up and it will be found that they will have to emigrate because he cannot keep afloat since he has not got the wherewithal to invest in his farm.  If the Minister is serious about gearing our farmers to competition in the EEC there will have to be far more capital provided for the farming community.</P>
    <P>I was glad that the Minister mentioned the rationalisation of the creamery industry.  When the Minister was first appointed as Minister for Agriculture and was interviewed by some pressmen he said that one of his top priorities would be the amalgamation and rationalisation of the creamery industry.  I am with the Minister all the way in this activity but I am very disappointed with the progress that has been made.  In our area we have the Dairy Disposal Board creameries&mdash;he knows what I am referring to because we were on a deputation to him&mdash;and the Ballyclough group of co-operative creameries are taking over two groups of Dairy Disposal Board creameries. This has gone on for a considerable time with meetings of the farming community, meetings with the Minister, meetings with the committee in Ballyclough and meetings with representatives of the Dairy Disposal Board. Unfortunately, to date, there has not been much progress and, even if there has been progress&mdash;and I understand that it is progressing very, very slowly &mdash;it takes too long.  The delay is too long and farmers are uneasy.  The difference in the price of milk to the farmer supplying milk to Ballyclough and to the farmer supplying milk to a Dairy Disposal Board creamery for the past three years is approximately £8 2s 5d per cow per year.  The Minister will realise that for the farmer with, <Col N="784" /> say, 20 or 30 cows this will mean a considerable sum in a year.  While this is happening the Minister and his Department and the directors of the Dairy Disposal Board are dragging their heels.  Is it not ludicrous that the Dairy Disposal Board should start haggling about the price of the creameries when, when we are members of the EEC, the farmers will have free access to any creamery of their choice and the Dairy Disposal Board or the creameries who are not paying the price for milk will go by the board anyway?</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to take action at this late stage.  If action is not taken on this there will be many disappointed farmers who are supplying milk to the Dairy Disposal Board creameries.  I would say, in fairness, that their day is gone.  They have no longer any useful purpose to serve.  I should like to see in every area the Minister using his influence to try to get them to hand the creameries over.  I disagree&mdash;I put down a question about this some time ago&mdash;with the price that is being charged for the Dairy Disposal Board creameries because they were modernised.  They were improved; new machinery and lorries were purchased from the profit that was made from the milk supplied by the farming community to those creameries.  Now, when the farmers are taking them over, they will still have to pay an outlandish price for these creameries.  Here is something in which the Minister could interest himself and make sure that vested interests &mdash;and I want to emphasise vested interests&mdash;within the board are not dragging their heels in order to keep some of them in good jobs at the expense of the farming community.  I have no doubt about this.  I have seen this in operation.  What grieves me more than anything else is that when I was approached by the producers in an area&mdash;the Minister knows where I am talking about&mdash;the workers there in the creameries had no complaint or had no objection to the creameries being taken over by the Ballyclough Co-op.  They felt that this would mean an increase in the income of the farming community.</P>
    <P>Nobody knows better than I do, <Col N="785" /> because I have spent many years in dairy farming, the amount of work that the farmer, his wife and very often his family have to put into milk production and the late hours worked on a dairy farm while other sections of the community talk in terms of a five-day week.  What is annoying and frustrating milk producers in Dairy Disposal Board creamery areas is that this situation continues.  We talk about rationalisation and amalgamation. If we behave like this in the Common Market some day we will wake up and we will not know what struck us.  In 1962 there was a report on the need to rationalise the creamery industry.  There were four reports between 1962 and 1968.  Yet very little progress has been made.  In the context of the EEC, when we are competing with people who are far more sophisticated than we are, the small unit with inflated overheads, with irregular supplies, will have no hope of existence.  I cannot understand the attitude of the Minister and of the Dairy Disposal Board.  Should we become a member of the EEC, farmers will be able to leave creameries and they certainly will leave them and will move to the creamery that will pay the highest price.</P>
    <P>I am quoting the difference in price in respect of an economic unit of the Dairy Disposal Board but there are areas in west Cork and west Clare where the difference is far greater.  Yet we continue to drag along in the same old way, afraid of change and there is no encouragement given by the Minister or by the board.  I repeat that there are vested interests at work here and that is one of the factors that have prevented amalgamation and the rationalisation of the creamery industry. There are some people&mdash;a very tiny minority&mdash;in every area who, for some reason best known to themselves, will object to rationalisation, who will go to any extreme to try to embarrass and to obstruct the members and the suppliers in their efforts to bring about rationalisation of the creameries.  Some of these people are exploited by those who have a vested interest.  The Minister should be strong enough to say to the board at this stage that there must be rationalisation of creameries and <Col N="786" /> that nothing should stand in the way of this development.  We could continue along the same old road, making no progress in this very important matter and it is the farming community who will have to pay the price if we refuse to do something about this matter.  I feel very strongly about this matter. Last year and the year before I referred to the fact that I am not satisfied with the progress being made.  The Minister talked about prosperity within the agricultural community and his speech indicates complacency.  There is increased prosperity but costs have also increased out of all proportion and prices have not kept abreast of the rising costs in agriculture.  Rates, labour, cost of machinery, all the overheads, are going up year in year out.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the question of availability of credit.  The Minister knows that in the past year or two and this year there has been an increase in the number of farmers who have changed from dairying to beef production. This is a classic example of where credit is necessary and where it is not available.  Because of the uneconomic price for milk last year and because of the multi-tier system a farmer, after a bad year in milk production, may change to beef.  He may have a herd of 30 or 40 cows.  When the cows calve in the spring, he will have to buy calves, in order to have double suckling.  That costs a considerable amount of money.  Calves are making a good price because of the demand under the beef subsidy scheme.  In addition to having to invest in the calves, he has to invest in fertilisers and lime, and he has to pay rates.  For that year he will have no income at all. There will be no cheque coming in. He will have no income from his herd because if the farmer wants to make the maximum amount out of the cattle under the beef subsidy scheme he will have to keep them for at least two years, in which he has no income.  Here the Agricultural Credit Corporation can play a very important role.  The amount of the loan extended would be safe and secure.  It would be merely a bridging loan.</P>
    <P>I have been talking for a long time about the uneconomic price for milk. Were it not for the factor that I have <Col N="787" /> referred to, many more farmers would change over to beef.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation are great people for giving loans to people who do not want them.  I do not mind quoting a case that came to my notice last night. A farmer with 120 acres, limed and manured and with sufficient feeding to carry over a good number of cattle for the winter but who did not have the wherewithal to buy them applied to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and because he owed about £1,000 or £1,500 on a 120-acre farm he could not be considered for a short-term loan. I have seen several cases turned down of applications for a loan to increase the herd so as to extract the maximum amount out of a farm and increase family income, where they would sign an agreement that the creamery would pay over to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I should like the Minister to take particular note of that matter because it is playing havoc with the farming community.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the case of a farmer's son who is getting married and who is buying a farm.  Does anybody realise what it costs to stock and equip the farm?  Production on that farm will be retarded for a number of years until that man is able to overcome his financial difficulty. In 99 per cent of cases the loan would be quite safe.  The people are hard working and they have the resources which will permit them to repay the loan.  They find it impossible to get credit.  I would ask the Minister to interest himself in this matter.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Minister for Finance announced that he had £20 million extra to distribute and that he was giving £2.7 million to the farming community.  I felt that this was an opportunity for me to renew my claim for the people who approach me.  I find that that was not a contribution made by the Government from the Exchequer to the Agricultural Credit Corporation but that it arose out of the ACC's loan system, and that they were allowed to lend an extra £2.7 million.  People in the country reading the announcement understood that the Exchequer was giving £2.7 million more to the farming community, <Col N="788" /> whereas it was, in fact, money that other farmers had invested in the ACC. Something will have to be done about this question of credit.  We have never got half of the potential from the land that we could get if there were sufficient capital invested in it.  We have the farming community; we have the labour force.  We are fortunate in this country to have a hard-working farming community who, if they got a fair price, would produce the goods. That has been proved time and again.</P>
    <P>The system has been ludicrous.  Let us go back as far as the in-calf heifer subsidy scheme.  We were encouraging the farmers to produce more calves.  We were encouraging them to produce milk for which we had no market.  We were subsidising butter to the tune of 11d. per 1b. so that the British would eat it.  Only a few years ago there was a huge surplus of dairy products all over Europe. Mark my words, in the next few years there will be a scarcity of dairy products in Europe.  The young farmer today is changing from the traditional type of farming carried on by his father and I believe we should have encouraged our farmers to continue in milk production.  Our land is very suitable.  Our grass is excellent. We have a temperate climate and, therefore, a short winter.  Our costs of production are less than they are in other less salubrious areas.  We would do better.  I believe, by encouraging the farming community to stay in milk.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to pig production. Not so many years ago pig production was a valuable source of income for the small farmer.  In the congested areas the pig was a valuable asset to the farming community.  The trend is changing.  The big pig producing co-operative is becoming fashionable. A number of pig fattening co-operatives are being set up with the aid of generous grants.  Might I here say a word of commendation about the notes on the main activities of the Department?  I compliment the officials on these notes.  We have at the moment a certain number of pigfattening co-operatives.  These are taking on well in the south in particular. The danger is that these co-operatives <Col N="789" /> might be run on a professional basis to the detriment of the farming community as a whole.  The co-operatives might take on the rearing and fattening of their own pigs.  Should they do so the farmers would cease to reap any benefit.  This is a definite danger and the Minister will want to be wary of this trend.  I am in favour of these co-operatives if they are run by the farming community.</P>
    <P>There are complaints that the profit in pig production is too small.  The price of feeding stuffs is too high and the margin of profit is too low.  If the farming community run the pig-fattening co-operatives that will ensure that the benefits will be evenly spread.  It will also result in an increased income to the farmers.</P>
    <P>Rationalisation of bacon factories is very necessary.  One of the disadvantages at the moment is the fluctuation in pig numbers delivered to the factories; in one week there may be 1,000 pigs offered and the next week there may be only 100.  There is need for more liaison between the producer and the factories.  If there were a proper liaison a great number of the difficulties that exist could be overcome.  As the Minister said, we probably have too many bacon factories. Rationalisation is imperative. We are very slow about rationalising and, in the absence of rationalisation, the producer will not get the price he should get.</P>
    <P>Last year there was an increase in the subsidy in relation to sheep and lambs.  That was very welcome.  There is, however, the problem that the price of mutton and lamb this year was never lower.  It is very much down on last year's price.  An increase in the subsidy would encourage farmers to increase sheep numbers.  There is a potential market in the EEC.  Farmers have not been encouraged to fertilise mountainous land and improve sheep pasturage.</P>
    <P>The price of wool is rockbottom. There is very little the Minister can do about it, but it does mean that the income to the producer is reduced.  I believe there is a market for mutton and lamb in the Common Market countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> There are farmers who are not complying with the regulations with regard to sheep scab.  More stringent measures would want to be taken because this is a very contagious and a very dangerous disease.  If it is not checked it can result in severe losses to the farming community.  It is not an easy thing to do but we should intensify our efforts to make sure that all sheep are dipped for sheep scab.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Bord na gCapall.  I am glad the board was set up and I wish it every success.  The chairman, who is a constituent of mine, has a great knowledge of the industry.  I hope there will be no interference in the board and that they will be given sufficient funds to build up this industry which could be so valuable to the farming community if properly handled.  Irish horses are famous throughout the world and for that reason Bord na gCapall could do a good job.  There is a falling-off in the Irish draught breed which is the foundation stock for all our horses. The Minister should examine this in order to improve the breed and increase the numbers of Irish draught mares.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not deal more fully with our proposed entry to the EEC.  Since the Minister was appointed political head of this Department he has done very little to enlighten the farming community about what is involved in and what the full implications are of membership of the EEC and I condemn him for this. Quite a few people, particularly small farmers, have reservations about entry because they believe every small farmer will go to the wall in the EEC. A good deal of literature has emanated from the Department of Agriculture but it has not got through to the farming community.  A group of anti-marketers have toured the country and advised small farmers that entry means the end for such farmers.  It is far easier to advocate non-entry than entry to our farming community because they are slow to change.  If there was a referendum tomorrow morning a number of people would not vote at all and a number would <Col N="791" /> vote against entry because they are afraid of the implications.</P>
    <P>I saw a programme on television last night about the value added tax.  The Department should use the television media to get through to the people and explain what entry to the EEC means. Fine Gael is committed to entry and it is people like Deputy FitzGerald, Deputy Ryan and Deputy Keating who are creating a basis for debate.  The Minister has a duty to get across to the farming community the implications of membership and what in fact membership will mean to each individual farmer.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have referred to the Mansholt Plan.  It is not known whether the Minister and the Government accept it.  A booklet has been issued by the Department but the onus is on the Minister to say whether he is accepting or rejecting the Mansholt Plan.  The Mansholt Plan has been revised and modified as a result of knowledge gained during many debates. Mansholt has moved away from his original idea that a farm cannot be viable unless it has 100 acres and 60 cows, but he has not indicated what he now believes a viable farm to be.  In fact, it is very difficult to say what a viable farm is as its viability will depend on the area, the population and many other factors.  With intensive farming methods I believe a 50 acre dairy farm could be regarded as viable within the context of EEC.  I believe small farmers will do better inside the EEC than outside it and for that reason the Minister should spell out more clearly what he thinks of the Mansholt Plan and whether or not he accepts it. I have been to a number of seminars on this subject where the Minister's party was not even represented.  If the Minister himself is not able to attend he should send a representative along so that they can give the Government's view on entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>There are many complaints from the non-farming sector of the community about the amount of tax they have to pay in order to subsidise the farming community.  This occurs because time and time again the Government announce that the Department of Agriculture are contributing £105 <Col N="792" /> million or £106 million a year in subsidies. This of course is completely untrue.  A committee was set up some time ago to investigate the subsidies paid by the Department to the agricultural community.  Taxpayers have a right to know where their money is going.  State expenditure in relation to agriculture is listed as follows:&mdash; education, research and advisory service, livestock improvement and eradication of disease, production and development aids, marketing support and aids, land annuities, relief of rates, agricultural grants, rural electrification, capital for Agricultural Credit Corporation <i>et cetera.</i>  Let us take rural electrification at random: if electricity is extended to a doctor's residence should this be included in the subsidy in relation to agriculture?  Is it not ridiculous?  Rates relief costs approximately £20 million a year.  Rates relief is a tax concession or relief given to the small farming community.  From time to time we are all given tax reliefs but they are not given as a subsidy. There are a number of people who are misinformed about the subsidies paid to the farming community.  People do not seem to realise the amount that the farming community are doing for the economy.  Agricultural employees form about 28 per cent of our total labour force.  Our manufacturing industries indirectly employ about 45 per cent. Agriculture is playing a vital part in our export markets and it is our greatest earner of foreign currency.</P>
    <P>So far as industry is concerned, for every £100 million we export, we import approximately £40 million worth of raw materials.  However, for every £100 million of agricultural produce we export, we import approximately £7 million or £8 million worth of raw materials.  We should not talk in terms of £100 million being paid to agriculture as this figure is completely inflated.  In my opinion agriculture is the only industry that will stand up to competition in Europe; therefore, we should do everything in our power to increase the income of the farming community and try to modernise the industry.  If we have a prosperous farming community, automatically it will follow that people in the villages will benefit because more money will <Col N="793" /> be in circulation.  Our farmers can compete with any farmers in Europe. By giving them the credit that is necessary to make their farms more efficient we will be doing good work for them and for this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a person who has been 20 years in this House, I should like to say a few words about procedure and this is an appropriate time to do so.  The system used by the House to transact business is deplorable.  We have under discussion this evening one of the most important Estimates.  As happens in other debates, the Minister has read out a statement and we are supposed to make an appraisal not only of that statement but of all aspects of agriculture.</P>
      <P>The present system may suit Ministers and Government Deputies because they have the Civil Service to supply them with the information that is necessary to make a constructive contribution to a debate such as this. As a rural Deputy I must travel to Dublin from the south of Ireland.  I am not in a position financially to pay anyone to do research work for me; I must depend on the Library and the General Office here for information. As a Member of this House I consider I am entitled to help from public funds in my research on this or any other subject.  The State should provide this kind of assistance to Opposition members as well as to members of the Government Party.</P>
      <P>If the Minister requires information with regard to any aspect of agricultural policy it will be obtained for him but the same does not apply to Opposition members.  Because of this lack of facilities I am unable to make a constructive contribution and I do not hesitate to say so.  It may be said that Deputies living in areas near Dublin have an advantage because they are here each day and travelling does not take up much time.  However, for many rural Deputies it takes practically one day to come to Leinster House and another day to return home.  In addition, we must do our own correspondence, we must make representations on a personal basis, or we must telephone the various Departments&mdash;all time-consuming tasks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> It is right that the public should know what is happening because they are the people who pay us.  At the moment when we are discussing such an important matter as agriculture there is only one member of the Government party present&mdash;the Minister &mdash;and there is only a small number of other Deputies here.  I do not blame them because I know the rural Deputies are exceptionally busy trying to answer correspondence.  I know some of them are anxious to contribute to this debate but they cannot do so because they have not got facilities for research or have not time to carry out this work.  It can be accepted that a Member of this House with an income of £2,350 per year is not in a position to pay half of that amount to employ a junior clerk to work for him.  I can speak for the rural Deputies of the Labour Party when I say we are not in a position to pay for this kind of service.  I maintain we should not be asked to pay for it; the public service should be at our disposal just as it is at the disposal of the Government. In other countries this facility is provided. What happens here? The Leader of the main Opposition party and the Leader of the second Opposition party get an allowance.  This allowance is more or less to cover their own personal requirements.  Naturally they must have staff but that allowance does not extend to Deputies such as myself and others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no harm to drive that point home.  There are a number of Deputies whose financial circumstances enable them to do this from their own resources.  This applies to every Estimate.  I have said this outside the House so often that it is about time, for a change, that I said it here and made our position clear.  How can Deputies make a proper contribution when no facilities are provided for them?  I hope that, as a Member of the Government, the Minister will bear that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be an all-party effort to change this system which has been <Col N="795" /> too long with us in regard to the provision of essential facilities.  It is no harm to make that point.  I have to go on the statement of the Minister and on the document issued by him dealing with the main Estimates of the Department. I have not got the time&mdash;and this applies to other discussions as well &mdash;to apply myself to the task of getting the many valuable books, memoranda and leaflets which are available and which would be exceptionally useful in a debate of this kind.</P>
    <P>That is my preamble.  At the end of his speech today the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Farming today is prospering and there is all round confidence in the country that this prosperity will increase further.</P>
    <P>We are all very pleased to hear a statement like that and we all hope that it will be borne out.  The reason for that is to be found earlier in the Minister's speech.  It is good market conditions in Britain.  This is the fortunate position that obtains here today.  Cattle prices are good and our economy is helped by virtue of the increased returns from cattle exports whether on the hoof or as carcase beef.  I do not want to criticise the Minister or his Department unless my criticism is justifiable.  We must accept that this position is not of our own making.  The fact that cattle prices are good is outside our control.  What happens abroad reacts here so far as the prosperity or otherwise of agriculture is concerned.  In past years when prices were bad&mdash;say, in the 1930s and in other years&mdash;farmers suffered heavily because of the poor returns from the export market.  I will not go back on what the Government party used to say then because that would serve no purpose.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the Minister's statement, and having listened to statements made throughout the country by different spokesmen, the question which enters my mind is: is this one of the last debates we will have on agriculture? Is it one of the last debates during which this Parliament will be in control of that industry?  On the assumption <Col N="796" /> that we will become a member of the European Economic Community, is that not the position?  I am sure that before the next Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries is discussed in this House we will be either in or out.  On the assumption that we will be in, our agricultural industry to a large extent will not be controlled from Dáil Éireann but from the Commission's headquarters in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The booklets, leaflets, memoranda, call them what you will, that have emanated from Government sources have given some people the idea, and particularly the farming community, that for them moving into Europe will be something similar to the assessment of a religious person of moving into Heaven, that so far as farmers are concerned moving into Europe will be a kind of Heaven upon earth.  I am looking for some more information. The Minister tells us that we will get a 50 per cent increase in milk prices and a 50 per cent increase in the price of beef and veal with the result we will be much better off.</P>
    <P>Accepting the Government's assessment, if we go into Europe the price of beef will increase and I presume that our exports of beef will increase, too, because I cannot visualise the average housewife in this city, or, indeed, in any country town or village being able to buy steak or beef when the cost has increased by 50 per cent. Naturally, therefore, consumption on the home market will decrease.  That is a reasonable assumption.  As a result we should become richer because we shall have more cattle to sell in Europe.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister in this statement that milk prices are being restructured to bring us into line with what will happen; when we fly across St. George's Channel and land in Brittany we shall be getting so much more money for our milk.  Everybody likes to see more money coming, whether from beef or milk, and I am quite sure that the same position will apply to our butter and milk exports, because so far as my limited knowledge of the system at the present time is concerned, I do not think it is the <Col N="797" /> Government's intention to subsidise milk and milk products here at home. If that is so, the housewife will be paying more than 50 per cent extra for her pint of milk and for her pound of butter.</P>
    <P>The position must be examined also from the point of view of the consumer. In my perusal of the number of documents I could read through, I did not find, so far as other commodities are concerned, that there was a likelihood of a golden harvest.  This is a question that will be referred to the people, and what I am trying to do in the course of this discussion is to appraise the position as practically as I can.  We can all learn a great deal more about Europe.  To my mind, the literature from the Commission is reasonably practical and objective, but I would not say the same about what we get from Government sources. I think that is slanted and not a fair appraisal of the actual position.</P>
    <P>The job of a Deputy here in this debate is to try and get more information. I am asking that information of the Minister and the Government. Granted their foresight is very limited, and they are not able to project themselves very far into the future, as witness, there were mountains of butter around Ireland and mountains of butter around Europe.  The Government brought in the beef incentive scheme to get people away from the creameries.  Too many farmers were supplying milk to the creameries, and, as the Taoiseach himself stated here in the Dáil, the cost to the Exchequer was enormous and unbearable.  When he made that statement about four years ago he indicated that the cost was 13d.</P>
    <P>More than 50,000 farmers were removed from supplying milk to the creameries, and, from what I can gather in this document, we would like to have them back again.  Market prices abroad changed, but the Government were unable to see that change.  We are told in the Minister's statement:</P>
    <P>The greatly improved export demand for dairy products and the increase in production and processing costs have also been carefully considered.  The improvement in the export markets for dairy products <Col N="798" /> in the past 12 months is expected to be maintained in 1972, and the further outlook for beef cattle also appears to be good.</P>
    <P>How is it that the Government had not sufficient foresight to see this a few years ago?  That speaks for itself and if you were to take this document here you would find at the present level of prices that obtains the milk price support is drastically reduced.  However, I shall be moving to that at a later stage. At present I am most interested in getting more information about Europe and it is not for myself I want that information.  Like every other Member of the House I want it for the public. It is all right handing in scripts for the television and the newspapers telling what is happening, but we want it debated across the House here.  It is rarely that I bring much documentation to a debate or start arguments by quoting what this person or that person said, but I believe I did so in an agricultural debate some time ago.  I do not want to repeat what I said then, but the questions I want answered are about Mr. Mansholt.  Everyone knows the position he holds so far as the Community is concerned.  He says viable farms are essential.  Arguments were put forward by Deputy Creed that Mr. Mansholt's statements were misinterpreted. His viable farm is to contain a minimum of 100 acres and a minimum of 60 cows.  That kind of farm, with few exceptions, does not exist in our part of the country.</P>

      <P>Nor in Cavan either. Such farms are exceptionally scarce. I read two years ago that the Community were very anxious to cut down on agricultural products.  They considered then that they were overstocked in so far as agricultural products were concerned.  The Community were more than self-sufficient then.  I have particulars of their scheme here.  I do not think it is necessary to read out the actual wording of the case, but the Community were most anxious to get rid of milk and to reduce its production. People on the Continent use lemon with their tea, not milk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>They think the fattening qualities of milk are not suitable. There was a subvention to farmers of £80 per cow.  Two years ago the official policy was to get rid of at least three million cows within five years.  Looking a little ahead, are we to assume that they will pay subventions to farmers within the present Community to kill off cows and reduce milk production? We, in Ireland, can increase our stocks to avail of the big prices obtaining for milk products.  I doubt whether there is anything in the Treaty of Rome or in any other treaty which defines that as the position.  I am not arguing against entering the Common Market but endeavouring to give the picture as I see it.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party delegation were in Brussels a year ago, just before the farmers' protest march there.  The position then was that agricultural prices had not increased over a number of years.  We had been in Brussels 3½ years before that.  In the 3½ years between our visits, and for much longer, the prices of agricultural products had not increased nor, from the information given to us, did we understand that it was intended to increase such prices.  The ceiling was regarded as too high and it was felt that the only way to bring prices down was to let them stand still.  While prices were allowed to stand still the costs of production were increasing.  The incomes of those engaged in agriculture within the Six were falling sharply.  We all know that agriculture within the Six is in a weaker position than agriculture here.  When I speak about strength I could say voting strength just as well, because of the small percentage &mdash;it was only 8 per cent&mdash;of the people within the Six who are dependent on agriculture for their livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We read about the huge march in Brussels.  It was composed of farmers of the Six demanding a change in the agricultural policy.  There were similar protest marches in parts of France.  As a result of these marches some changes occurred.  I am not in a position to give the actual details.  It suffices to <Col N="800" /> say that the amounts involved were not large.  My purpose in bringing these matters to the notice of the House is to question whether this policy could continue.  We know about the situation in Europe.  Everyone we met on our visits, from the top man to the humblest official, gave us information which was factual and objective.  The officials were truthful and straightforward.  They were not endeavouring to mislead us in any way but on examining the information given to us we felt that the farming community may not fare nearly as well as they think they will.  There is a movement away from small farms, as indicated by the Minister's speech, with the exception of the Small Farm (Incentive Bonus) Scheme.  The tiered price for milk has gone.  The preference given to the small farmer has gone.  I am personally interested in a substantial body of farmers living on the western coast of this country from Malin Head to Kinsale.  It is clearly set out in Government legislation and it is an accepted fact that such farmers, by virtue of the inadequacies and the uneconomic nature of their holdings, cannot derive a reasonable livelihood from their farming activities. A policy was formulated here, which I supported, and which it is possibly regrettable to have.  However, although regrettable it was essential.  The policy to which I am referring is that which allows for the direct payment of weekly subventions to small farmers along the west coast.  As a result of these subventions, the standard of living of these farmers has been improved. Of course, no credit for this is due to Fianna Fáil who, with the exception of six years, have been in office since 1932.  It would not be to the credit of any Government that such a policy was necessary.</P>
    <P>Another question to which I want a reply is: What is to become of small farmers after we join the EEC?  Deputy Burke looks at me in surprise.  He may say that farmers will get much more for their produce after we join.</P>

      <P>On the occasion of the visit I have mentioned I asked an Italian member of the Commission who deals with such questions whether the system of weekly subventions would be allowed in Common Market conditions. His answer was a definite &ldquo;no.&rdquo; Therefore, as soon as the transitional period has expired, so too will the payments to the farming community have expired.  I then asked this gentleman whether, apart altogether from the Community's funds, the Irish State would be allowed to continue the payment of such subventions from their own funds and, again, the answer was &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The people must be apprised of the disadvantages as well as of the advantages of membership but of course it is possible to have only a small number of the questions that arise discussed here.</P>
      <P>I have here some books that were published by the Commission and the central theme in these books is an acceleration of the drive from the land. They say that there are too many people living on the land.  Whatever aids may be available, they certainly will not be available to farmers unless they measure up to the conditions specified in the literature issued by the Commission.  In this regard my opinion is that very few of our farmers would measure up to the requirements laid down for qualification for special aid. Where, then, are the farmers to go? Earlier I mentioned the lack of facilities here in so far as Deputies are concerned and, if I could, I would give a priceless quotation from the Commission's Report.</P>

      <P>On the question of redundant farmers or farmers' sons or daughters, we have not, according to the responsible commissioner, so far devised a regional industrial policy but they believe it would be quite easy to establish industries in a place like Ireland.  They think it would be quite feasible to establish industries in towns to take the redundant agricultural population.  I thought that was an excellent piece of information until my informant told me that his definition of a town is a place with a population of more than 50,000. According to that definition, we have only two towns in this part of the country&mdash;Dublin and Cork.  Bantry, Skibbereen, Clonakilty, Cahir or Carrick-on-Suir are only&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;hamlets.  That is a very bleak position so far as obtaining alternative employment for the many small men&mdash;I mean small in resources so far as farming is concerned; they are possibly some of our biggesthearted men&mdash;is concerned.  Have we not been discussing in this House since the establishment of the State the idea of trying to put industry into the 12 western counties with a view to keeping the people at home?  Despite all the efforts and all the moneys put into such areas, even special moneys put into Gaeltacht areas by Roinn na Gaeltachta, the population is dwindling. Most of those who are left have to suffer the odium of going to employment exchanges or Garda stations every Tuesday or Wednesday to sign for the pittance they are getting.  Is that not the position of our agricultural folk in the 12 western counties?  This Government, who are supposed to have done so much for this country and particularly for the West and the small farmers, have imposed this infamous obligation on these people in order to qualify for their allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great confidence in the Parliamentary Secretary.  I think he is&mdash; I should not use the term &ldquo;one of ourselves&rdquo;&mdash;a man who understands <Col N="803" /> rural life, maybe better than people with handles before their names and letters after them.  As a practical man the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me that that imposition should be removed and some other system devised.  I do not like it.  I do not like to see our farmers, with a tradition behind them, having to crawl on their knees to get this money.  For God's sake do away with that.  While this is a matter for the Department of Social Welfare, the reason I emphasised it here is that the people involved are agriculturalists and the Minister for Agriculture is obliged to help them and to see to their interests.</P>
    <P>What are we to do with the West of Ireland?  Should we address ourselves to what we will do with it on the assumption that we will become a member of the EEC?  If we do so, we are assured, and there is no way of changing it&mdash;I have documentary proof of it here if necessary&mdash;that those small farmers will lose this income.  What are we going to do?  In addition, we have the European assurance that the establishment of industries for them is more or less confined to towns with a population in excess of 50,000.  We have not got that kind of population in our towns.  Are we going to do anything about finding jobs for agriculturalists, even part-time jobs?  I see nothing wrong in a farmer having a part-time job.  If his income is insufficient, as is the case with most small farmers, I think it is a great thing if he has a part-time job.  I see it working in Skibbereen.  There are a number of farmers employed in the processing plant there and the two incomes give them a reasonable standard of living.  There is no use in waiting until the transitional period has expired to find out what is going to happen.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary think they should go to Holland, France or Italy?  Does he think that they, too, should move into Europe? If he does, or if the Minister or the Government do, they are making a big mistake.  I believe the language is sufficient barrier to keep us physically out of Europe, or at least most of us, and certainly the type of people we are speaking about here.  They will not <Col N="804" /> be in a position to move into Europe. They will not be in a position to go to Germany, France or anywhere else except to where they are going at present, to Britain, to get employment if it is not available for them at home.  I believe the barriers are too formidable for the ordinary working person and they will not bridged in the foreseeable future.  As well as that traditions and customs there differ very much from ours.</P>
    <P>Speaking of land, if Irish people move out of small, uneconomic holdings, who is likely to move in? There will be no Land Commission then to provide safeguards.  I have had discussions with a number of Germans. Language is no hindrance to their coming to Ireland.  It is a hindrance to our going to Germany.  My personal opinion is that, possibly more than the inhabitants of any other country, they will buy up a big portion of Ireland. According to the Treaty of Rome and all the articles of the EEC they are quite entitled to do so.  They will be bidding for holdings on the same basis as the man next door or any Irishman will be bidding.</P>
    <P>In a television programme recently, a well-known personality said that was not so.  In my view his information was incorrect.  I do not say he was deliberately misstating facts.  These people can come over here and will come. Some people may say it would be a good thing to mix the blood a bit. Anyway, it is something that must be borne in mind.  There is no need to dwell on this.  As indicated, the people will have an opportunity of saying whether or not they want Ireland to become a part of Europe.  Of course, in becoming part of Europe, the major question is political unity.  Political unity is mentioned in these leaflets issued by the Commission.  There may be advantages in that but the debate on the Estimate for Agriculture is not the appropriate time to discuss what may happen in Ireland or to assess what may happen so far as our existing industries are concerned.  Personally, I see advantages in becoming a member of the Community but I see grave disadvantages as we are at present.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to our exports and <Col N="805" /> their value.  Ireland is fortunate to have good markets for its exports of cattle and beef.  The Minister used the term &ldquo;good&rdquo; and I follow him in that but we have developed an inferiority complex in regard to our trade with other countries.  On page 1 of the memorandum, &ldquo;Main Activities of the Department,&rdquo; figures are given in regard to exports and imports.  Accepting the figures as factual, the total exports of all classes of goods in 1970 were valued at £416 million as compared with £358.5 million in 1969.  We sold £416 million worth of goods, of which agricultural exports accounted for £179.5 million as against £162.9 million in 1969.  I assume, then, that we sold about the same amount of cattle and beef because the price increase would almost cover the increase in the value of the exports.  There is one question to which some of us cannot supply the answer.  We must ask one of the economists to give us the explanation.  How is it that we could sell only £416 million worth last year and could buy £653 million worth?  It is not too easy for some people to understand that, particularly when the trend is a continuing one.  I know that we are borrowing, borrowing, borrowing and that it costs almost £100 million to service our borrowings.  I know that we moved out to Europe in order to borrow.  There may be a case to be made for borrowing in some circumstances but this Government borrow anywhere they can get the money.</P>
    <P>My point is that we do not owe anything to anybody.  We buy more from other countries than we sell to them.  Last year we sold to Britain £275.8 million worth, or 66 per cent of our total exports, which included £139.9 million worth of agricultural products, and we bought from Britain the staggering total of £349.6 million worth of goods.  So, I should like it to be known and to be emphasised that when we send a bullock to Britain, we do not get £X for the bullock or when we send carcase meat there, we do not get £X for it; we get equipment that Britain is selling, a washing machine, a fridge or whatever it may be.  We have cattle to sell.  Other countries have other goods to sell.  We are <Col N="806" /> not getting money for our cattle.  Far from it.  I mention Britain now as our best customer.  I do not know how we managed it but we were £74 million in the red last year in our trade with Britain.  One would need a senior economist to explain that.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that, on the assumption that we do not move into Europe, markets will be closed to us, that we will meet all kinds of obstacles, that barbed wire fences will be erected against us, that member countries will not trade with us, that there will be tariff fences that will have to be surmounted, and so on, that we cannot have any kind of association with them because they do not want that. As the figures prove, we buy more from almost every foreign customer of ours than they buy from us.  They buy our bullocks and carcase meat because they want them and because we buy their washing machines and other equipment that they do not want and that they are able to export. Therefore there is no need for us to have an inferiority complex and to exclaim that they are great, that but for them we would not survive and that prices for our cattle would not be so good.  We are good customers of theirs.</P>
    <P>There used be, as an appendix to the memorandum, &ldquo;Main Activities of the Department&rdquo;, a special leaflet showing our exports to and imports from the Six.  Now we get the exports but we do not get the imports.  Therefore it is difficult to make a comparison. In previous years, for every £1 worth of goods the Six bought from us we bought £2 worth from them.  I hope that trend has changed. The information is not in this document and so it is not possible to make a comparison.  I am sure that this was an oversight.  I would never think it was deliberate. Maybe these tables would not be good for our digestion and so whoever compiled the document left these figures out, for some reason.</P>

      <P>Tomorrow the cry will be that the Minister has increased the price of milk: &ldquo;I am a great fellow, Fianna Fáil are bringing this into line with Europe.&rdquo;  We are living in an inflationary age and I got this Book of Estimates for the current year which gives the total on the cover at £493,213,000.  That is the sum required this year.  Last year the sum required was £418,085,000.  The Estimates have increased by £75 million this year.  I think the increase last year was round about £54 million.  Last year, as I say, the total required was £418,085,000. The year before that it was £354,180,000 and the year before that again it was £302,000,000.  In that bad old year, according to Fianna Fáil, in which we had the last inter-Party Government the total sum required was £109,123,280. Mark you, during their present span in office Fianna Fáil have managed to multiply the figure in the Book of Estimates by almost five.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not part of the Government?  We have this talk about twopence a gallon on milk. That is the calculation at least.  This is couched in such terms that it is not quite clear.  I think the Minister is allowing fivepence but he is doing away with some of the present supports and, between adding and subtracting, the net <Col N="808" /> figure is around twopence.  Whether or not this is correct I do not know.</P>
      <P>Everything is going mad in this country moneywise.  The inflationary trend is gathering momentum.  The increase announced by the Minister does not compare relatively with the increase in the Book of Estimates.  I agree with Deputy Creed that the man who works in the field in a self-employed capacity is as much entitled to his increase as the man who works in the comfortable surroundings of the Department of Agriculture, if I may say so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also true that in many of our farms the milk cheque is never seen.  So far as the farmers are concerned it is invisible because goods purchased during the winter months, when the milk cheques are absent, are debited to the milk cheques the farmers should receive during the summer.  The lean period is an extended one.  It runs from the end of October until the following April.  The farmers are so much in the red that it takes the summer period to make up the deficiency.  It is true to say, and I know this from my own personal knowledge, that many farmers never see a milk cheque because they have a continuous debit balance with the creamery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said on previous occasions, there is a great variation in farming and, small as the country is, it is very hard to apply a general policy.  The land in Kilkenny is good.  It is possibly better in Carlow.  The farming carried on in these counties is very different from the type of farming in my locality and in the west of Ireland, where Deputy Burke comes from.  It is not possible to relate a system of farming in Kilkenny, Tipperary, the midland counties, even Louth and north Dublin with farming in other parts of the country. The productivity content in these areas is much, much higher.  When the land is nourished the productivity becomes <Col N="809" /> higher still.  In the poorer parts a farmer may get a grant under the land rehabilitation scheme but, having got the grant and done the work, he must go on nursing the land all the time.  One could almost say that he has to breast feed it because it is weak and undernourished.  Now this nourishment is very costly indeed.  It runs at round about £35 per ton.  There is very little profit in that kind of farming. Where the land is good the yield will be higher and of a better quality without any nourishment than the yield will be from land which needs continuous nourishment.  No matter what grant is paid for land under the land rehabilitation or reclamation scheme unless the land is continuously nourished the money spent is largely wasted.  I am satisfied the Department is justified in reviewing closely applications from people who do not measure up to the necessary requirements so far as previous applications were concerned.</P>
    <P>I live in the Mizen Head peninsula. If the Minister, during the course of his political rounds, were to visit that area he would see the hardship that has to be endured and the work and industry that has to be put into the land there.  I am sure people in the centre of the country where, fortunately, good land exists&mdash;we are not jealous people, if we do not have good land we do not mind others having good land&mdash;cannot visualise how people can live off such farms. They live in the main by hard work. The man with bad land has to work much harder than the man with good land.  They have to do many things such as draining which people on good land do not have to do.  This type of farmer is not doing well at the present time and were it not for the help given by the Department of Social Welfare in the form of weekly subventions such farmers would find it very difficult to exist with steadily increasing prices and no increase in their incomes.</P>
    <P>As statistics show, many farmers earn an average of between £400 and £500 a year, apart from the subvention to which I have already referred. Many farmers are living on incomes well below the last increase <Col N="810" /> granted to our public servants.  Some people, who have had the opportunity of being educated, are earning £7,000 a year, but it must be remembered that a stone of potatoes, a pound of butter and a loaf of bread costs such a man exactly the same as it costs the small farmer, the housewife, the widow or the old age pensioner.  With a population of 2.8 million I do not think it is justifiable that some people can earn £100 for a 40 hour week while small farmers are earning on average £8 or £9 a week.  I am referring particularly to the agricultural community as this is an Agricultural Estimate.  The gap is far too wide. Whatever party is in Government in the future it must try to close the gap.</P>
    <P>The percentage increase should be wiped out.  The gap is already wide enough.  The man earning £6,000 a year who gets a 10 per cent increase is receiving an extra £600, whereas the man who earns £1,000 a year will only receive £100.  The gap is widened immediately by £500.  We are then told that they both get the same increase. It is true they both got 10 per cent, but there is a big difference between 10 per cent of £6,000 and 10 per cent of £1,000.</P>
    <P>The dairying industry is extremely important for this country and, having regard to the marked improvement in the price level on the export market, the increase in this case is justified. Like Deputy Creed, I am convinced it was overdue.  It appears to be in keeping with EEC policy that no matter how many cows we have or what the state of the market in the future will be, the price has levelled off.</P>
    <P>When the late Deputy Walshe was Minister for Agriculture, I was the first person to advocate special help for the small farmer.  At that time support money was scarce and something similar to the two-tier system was what I had in mind.  The claim was made that there was only a limited amount of money available to do this. The question then arose whether the man with 100 cows should benefit equally with the man with ten cows but to my mind that is debatable.  Last year we were told that the number of farmers with a production of 30 <Col N="811" /> gallons of milk and over was only 2½ per cent but I am doubtful if this figure is correct.</P>
    <P>I have frequently stated that money does not come from heaven; it has to be found to pay any supports that are necessary.  The system announced today does not differentiate between the large and small farmer, with the result that the small man will lose. A special effort should be made to help the person producing 10,000 gallons or less; even if it were only 1p per gallon on that 10,000 gallons it would be a considerable help.  I can understand that the Minister is associated with big farmers; as a big farmer himself he knows more about them, possibly he is more sympathetically disposed to them and naturally he may not be in favour of a differential, as has obtained until now.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to pig production. He stated that it has continued at the high levels of recent years, that so far this year deliveries of pigs to bacon factories are well ahead of 1970, and that the total for the year will exceed 2,000,000.  He stated that pigmeat was in surplus supply on European markets this year and marketing conditions were difficult with subsidy costs high.  Are we to assume from this that so far as Europe is concerned the future for this branch of the industry is not rosy?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the rationalisation of our processing plant and stated that individual processors are being invited to surrender their licences on a compensation basis.  He told us that factories which will continue in operation will be encouraged to modernise and extend their plants where this is considered necessary.  I have mentioned time and again the case for a processing plant for west Cork.  In fact, I thought we had secured such a plant because Deputy Crowley in March, 1970, announced that everything was in order in regard to the site and the building was to commence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Dunmanway.  That was the official announcement.  There was nothing wrong with it.  I accepted that the statement was factual.  Now the Minister is worried about having too many bacon factories and it is no wonder that he would be.  He is locating bacon factories where pigs are unheard of.  Imagine having four bacon factories in and around Cork city.  If you kept a pig in Cork city or within miles of those bacon factories you would have the health inspectors and the police and everyone down on you.  Why not shift the bacon factories down to where the pigs are?</P>
      <P>That is the case we are making for west Cork.  We produce the pigs and we will produce more.  The figure two years ago&mdash;and I am sure it has not changed very much in the meantime &mdash;was 11 per cent so that one pig in nine produced in this State is produced in west Cork.  We still have people emigrating continuously from west Cork.  Our claim is a simple one. We provide the raw materials and the raw materials should be processed where they are provided.  Imagine giving a huge grant&mdash;and I suppose there may be what is called &ldquo;pull&rdquo; in getting it&mdash;to a city factory even quite recently.</P>
      <P>A farmer likes to be near his factory. He likes to see his pigs being weighed and graded.  That can only happen if you locate a factory where the pigs are produced.  The Minister referred to the need to rationalise bacon factories and to the need for paying compensation to some factory owners with a view to getting the factories closed down.  That in no way interferes with our case for a processing factory in west Cork.  The Minister may not be there all the time. That case was put to his predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed to learn that the Minister and his Department are not favourably disposed to us.  We have to make our case and stand on our own feet.  I do not want to erect any more borders in this country but I represent people from south-west Cork, people who have suffered greatly so far as industrial development is concerned. This is the raw material they have in their own area and they want the opportunity to process it in their <Col N="813" /> own district.  There is nothing unfair or unjust about that demand.</P>
    <P>If this should bring about redundancy in other factories the plain fact is that there are better and brighter prospects for alternative jobs in other areas than there are in south-west Cork. I am not being in any way parochial when I make that assertion.  We will keep hammering in the hope that some time there will be a Minister and a Government who will be interested enough to examine the justice of our claim and to see that it is approved.</P>
    <P>I am deeply disappointed in our pig numbers and at the fact that more pigs are not being produced in the farmsteads and in the cottage holdings.  I believe that pig production could be a valuable supplementary asset to any farmer.  I remember&mdash;and times have changed a great deal since then&mdash;when I was a young fellow and when pigs and bonhams were not very profitable and we had to stay up at night minding the young piglets or bonhams for as long as a fortnight at a time.  That happened all round the country.  We had more pigs and more sows at a time when there was not much income from them.  We must assume that the income from them is not sufficient today.  Otherwise it would not be necessary&mdash;and I dislike to see this&mdash;to have big fattening units erected around the country.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of co-operation and co-operative effort but I would much prefer to see the individual farmer or the individual cottier increasing the number of his sows from two, say, to three or four and the number of pigs kept at the one time from ten to 20. This would be more healthy.  I said here before&mdash;and I said it down the country and I know that many pig breeders and others do not agree with this assertion, but my limited capacity tells me&mdash;that what happened in relation to the hens will happen in relation to the pigs.  We have only a relatively small number of broiler stations around the country with a very small employment content gaining anything from the poultry industry.  I believe the same thing will happen in relation to pigs if we encourage the erection of <Col N="814" /> pig fattening units either by publicly-owned or privately-owned combines, I do not care which.</P>
    <P>I should hate to see the small producer disappearing.  I have said previously, and I will say here again now, that for the life of me I cannot see why the Department are unable to get across to the producer the advisability of increasing his herd.  Is it because they are satisfied that the margins set down by the Minister are inadequate and uneconomic and they are ashamed to do so?  There should be a reappraisal of this matter.</P>
    <P>I am well acquainted with pig production at all levels.  I am satisfied that, if prices were reasonable and fair, sows and pigs could be a very valuable sideline for any farmer.  I am hopeful that the small people, the individual owners, the cottiers and small farmers will be encouraged to increase their pig numbers and that they will do so and keep out the combines.  Once those people come along they will take over. I do not accept the case made by some of our big national farmers.  They tell us about the advantages of pig-fattening stations; that in fattening 5,000 pigs together there is regularity of supply to the bacon factory, that the bacon factory will know in advance that so many pigs will be coming in today and so many pigs tomorrow; that there are lower transport costs and lower incidental expenses in dealing with a combine keeping thousands of pigs rather than dealing with the individual farmer keeping ten, 12 or 20.  However, the way things are subsidised here, that is false economy.  I believe it is essential to encourage the small pig producer and that it is imperative for the Minister for Agriculture of the day and, indeed, for any Government, to address themselves to that question.  I am saying all this at a time when we are told that our European friends do not welcome pigs or pigmeat, that they have enough themselves. Why then go ahead with these big piggeries?  The small producer should get the preference all the time. Sheep, mutton, lamb, wool and horses are items which were covered by the previous speaker, Deputy Creed, and I am somewhat of the same mind so <Col N="815" /> far as the statements he made on them are concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to grain crops, one grain crop I should like to mention in particular is oats.  The acreage of oats has declined a great deal.  Many people gave up growing oats; some of them used to grow a quantity of oats for the sake of the straw, but the price for the 1971 crop was increased to £26.50 a ton for clean oats of good feeding quality grown in the western counties comprising Cavan, Clare and Cork (West) and I shall say a little about that in a moment.  £26.50 is a small price.  Oats used to be a popular crop with small farmers and it was a valuable crop.  The price did not matter much because most of it would be retained for home consumption.  While we hear a great deal from Deputies about the price of wheat and barley, and rightly so, the question of the price of oats is overlooked and that should not be the case.  Anyway, in relation to oats, the 12 western counties are named and &ldquo;west&rdquo; is put in brackets after &ldquo;Cork&rdquo;.  I think it is an injustice in every field of public activity that parts of west Cork which should be included in the 12 western counties are not included.  There is a map in the development team office in Cork that I sent along to the Minister for Social Welfare, as apparently he was not conversant with the boundary of that part of County Cork which should be within the boundary of the 12 western counties.</P>
    <P>I have raised the matter here on a number of occasions.  I am satisfied to let it go to independent advice that some man in an office in Dublin, whether in Social Welfare or elsewhere, made a mistake.  The best of clerks make mistakes, but it is about time this mistake was rectified.  There is this kind of feeling in the House that when representations come from the Opposition: &ldquo;We will do nothing about them in case he may get any kudos from them.&rdquo; Some of our Ministers are very narrowminded and, unfortunately, we had it in previous Governments as well. I will give credit where credit is due there are people who are broadminded enough to judge representations on their merits irrespective of where they <Col N="816" /> come from, but, of course, there is the other mentality as well, for example, the fellow who will not even answer you.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise this point about the boundary of Cork (West), because it affects a number of farmers who would qualify for the small farmers' allowance from the Department of Social Welfare but who are deprived of it because they are deemed to be outside the boundary when, in fact, they are within the boundary.  I hope that the Minister, Deputy Gibbons, who I presume is over his own personal difficulties, will look into this important question when he has a little time to himself.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Department's agricultural grant schemes, I think complaints are few.  The main complaint is the inadequacy of the allocation of grant for land project work.  People are quite pleased with the other schemes and they do a world of good: the land project, farm buildings, water supply, small farms.  The incentive bonus scheme got off to a slow start but, as indicated in the statements made by the Minister, it is gathering momentum. These grants are a great help to the farmers.</P>
    <P>We have to consider now animal health, veterinary research, brucellosis eradication and bovine tuberculosis eradication.  The BTE scheme cost millions of pounds.  I was a member of the Cork animal health committee for a long time.  We were told by the experts that, once one got one's farm clear of TB and kept it so for two years, the likelihood of recurrence was remote.  This disease is recurring now with unusual frequency.  In 1971, £2,901,000 was set aside.  This was an exceptionally high sum of money.  It would be of great advantage to all concerned if more effective measures could be taken to eradicate TB altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a big problem. The herd of a farmer is locked up.  I know that people have to go to hospital.  It is a great handicap.  It is amazing that the prognostications of years ago have not materialised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> The brucellosis scheme is not as advanced as it should be.  On previous occasions, I emphasised that people who are co-operating with the Department and reporting the incidence of this disease in their herds do not get much sympathy.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the pilot scheme.  We have 12 pilot areas in the country.  The scheme is a good one.  We have received representations from many areas to have the pilot scheme areas changed and extended.  We are becoming more affluent now and this matter should be considered.  Some years ago when Deputy Blaney was Minister for Agriculture he said in reply to a question that he would be agreeable to applying the farm building grants applicable in the pilot areas to the 12 western counties.  It is essential for farmers, big or small, to have modern farm buildings.  Building costs are increasing steadily.  I realise it would cost a great deal of money to increase the grants, but a start should be made to improve the farm building grants in the 12 western counties.  They should be increased by 50 per cent. This would give a great incentive and would result in a marked difference in our countryside in so far as farm buildings are concerned.  I must emphasise the importance of good farm buildings.</P>
    <P>The Minister's distinguished predecessor, Deputy Haughey, said that animal diseases cost us £25 million annually.  Deputy Creed has referred to this.  There is also the question of sheep scab and associated ailments. The committee in Cork has not been functioning very well recently because of lack of co-operation from the Department.  There is the question of tagging sheep.  From the correspondence it would appear that the attitude of the Department is one of indifference. It is a problem and an embarrassment for a farmer who dips his sheep regularly and efficiently to find that his neighbour is careless and does not do so.  The law seems to be non-existent in such cases.  Surely sheep are important and while the law is there it should be implemented if people are unwilling to comply with reasonable demands.</P>
    <P>The Department should pay more <Col N="818" /> attention to the men from the grassroots who know all about the problems. We are told that, where sheep are dipped and properly attended to over a two-year period, sheep scab disappears for good.  In other countries like Britain, that has happened.  In Cork and Kerry we have a committee for the last ten years who have discussed this problem and the position about sheep scab has not changed, and the scab is not wiped out.  The number of outbreaks is few and the Department should be more co-operative.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for having delayed the House so long.  There are many other items to which one could refer under this Estimate, because agriculture is not only important to the people engaged directly in the industry, but it is important to every citizen in the country, whether he be living in Dublin or elsewhere, and the prosperity or otherwise of agriculture reacts on the population as a whole.  When people in other spheres are seeking a reduction in their 40-hour week and when they are making claims which they consider to be justified, the farmers, with the exception perhaps of a small number who are in a position to make certain arrangements, are working practically round the clock, week after week.  Most farmers now have not got the help of farm labourers, as very few people are prepared to work in this sphere because of the low wages paid.  The farmers claim that they cannot afford to pay them a just wage. Theirs must have been the worst paid job in the country.  I am hoping that some system will be devised, through co-operative effort, whereby these long hours of work for farmers will not be necessary in the years ahead.  I do not believe that young farmers will be satisfied in the future with the conditions that have prevailed up to now and, undoubtedly, in the future they will come together and organise themselves in such a way that they can have a five-day week.</P>

      <P>In this respect a good deal rests with the farmers themselves. I believe in the State giving them help <Col N="819" /> and advice but, after that, they must look after themselves and make their own contributions to the economy.  We are now in an era when all sections are looking for more.  In some cases they may be looking for something to which they are not entitled, but it is difficult for Governments to satisfy everybody, and, in particular, it is difficult to facilitate those who look for a larger slice of the cake than they are entitled to and no matter what Government are in power, they cannot give out any more than they get in.  At any rate, I agree with Deputy Creed when he says that the farmers deserve any help they get.  There may be some big farmers who are able to look after themselves but these are few in number.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Government have not put forward a regional policy of some kind but of course the only regional policies that would be welcome in Europe would be those drawn up by the Community.  Before the next Estimate for Agriculture and Fisheries, I hope that the people will have had an opportunity of deciding whether we should change our system or whether we should remain as we are. Under our Constitution it is the right of the people to determine this question and my advice to the people is to consider this question on an individual basis.  It would not be good enough for a Fianna Fáil supporter to vouch for change simply because he was a Fianna Fáil supporter and neither would it be good enough for a Labour supporter to oppose membership because some of the members of this party oppose it.  Each person should be able to make up his own mind and we can only hope that a decision will be reached democratically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister has had a tough year and to that extent I have a great deal of sympathy with him.  It was a year, too, during which he could not give his undivided attention to the Department under his control.  Consequently, I did not offer any personal criticisms of him.  In the circumstances, I do not think that such criticism would be justified.  In a country such as ours, and which has <Col N="820" /> a population of only 3,000,000 people, I would suggest that there should be a closing of the ranks.  By that I mean that there should not be such divisions between the different parties.  This state of affairs is not helpful to the country as a whole.  In this regard, I am putting forward again a suggestion that I made here on another occasion. That suggestion is that there be set up an all-party committee of the House on agriculture.</P>

      <P>Such a committee could discuss the pros and cons of the various policies.  The public may say that they are entitled to know what goes on, but very often, at committee level, there can be a more conclusive and more intelligent exchange of views.  On such committees you would have the advisers, the technical and administrative people.  I would ask the Minister to consider that suggestion. It could apply to other Departments of State as well.  There is no use in the Minister saying there are party committees. That is no good.  There should be committees of 11 or 12 Deputies from the three parties who could sit down with the Minister and his Deputy and with the executive officers of the Department.  It would be a great idea even if they held a meeting only every other month.  They could possibly do more good than we can by our debate. I would ask the Minister to give special consideration to my suggestion.</P>

      <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Murphy say that he is anxious to put the interests of Ireland before the interests of his own party on the question of going into the EEC.  This is a serious step for all of us.  I would agree with Deputy Murphy that everybody should know where they are going and what they are doing and that before people vote on this they should ask questions about it and weigh up the pros and cons.</P>
      <P>There are two points of view.  The Labour Party say many people will lose their jobs.  On the other hand, if we, as a small country stay outside, like a dead branch on a tree, I am personally convinced that we will have a lower standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> All countries depend on their exports for their balance of payments, even the socialist or communist states. If we are to be completely isolated what will be our position then?  I would ask the Labour Party to consider that very seriously.  My view is that there will be thousands more people unemployed and we will have a lower standard of living.  The Minister and the Department of Agriculture are trying to get the very best bargain they can for us.  I should like the people to ask themselves what will happen to us if the other applicant countries go in and we stay out.</P>
    <P>We are told that agricultural produce will be dearer for the people in urban areas.  There are people going around telling people they will have to pay more for their meat and other products but the countries which are already in the Common Market are carrying on all right.  Wages and standards of living have risen considerably, especially in places like Southern Italy where there was always emigration just as in the West of Ireland.  These are very serious considerations for our country and for all of us.  This is not a Fianna Fáil or a Fine Gael political gag.  I would ask those people who say that if we go in we will have hundreds unemployed what will happen to our standard of living if we do not go in?  The Government are trying to get the best bargain they can on fisheries as we can see from today's newspaper.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the Council of Europe and I attended some of the EEC meetings that were held in Strasbourg.  They were rather instructive. One thing that pleased me was the individuality of each country.  I was glad to see that the French were as nationalistic as ever and also the Germans and Italians.  There was no such thing as selling their sovereign rights.  Each country still had its own language.  Of course, in these countries they had concentrated more on the teaching of languages than we had here.  I think the time is coming when we will have a number of our people able to speak a number of European languages.  I was amazed that Malta, which was held down for hundreds of years and the British were there for <Col N="822" /> over 100 years, still had its own language and the people spoke other languages as well.  I was in Holland recently, one of The Six, and I found the Dutch as nationalistic as ever they were.  They speak their own language and also German, French and English. These languages are part of the secondary school curriculum.  I should like to hear people asking questions about these things.  I have been in France many times and I was in Germany recently and the people are as nationalistic as they ever were.  We have to make Europe into an economic unit.  As time goes on people of goodwill will help each other in every field, from education to economics, and we all learn.  When Deputies of all parties go abroad they learn something. Coming from an island country we feel we can learn from people in other countries.  When one ceases to learn from others one has lost interest.</P>
    <P>In relation to our entry to the EEC it will be the task of Deputies in the coming months to advise our people about the position.  People should be asking questions and making up their mind about the position.  If they do that they will not be able to say in years to come that Deputies painted a rosy picture of our prospects in the EEC but that the reality did not reach expectations.  The question of our position in the Community should be debated by the people so that there will be an intelligent approach to the matter.</P>
    <P>The county committees of agriculture and their staffs, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the officials of the Department, have contributed a good deal to the prosperity of the country and to an improvement in the standard of living of our people. In 1944 the then Minister for Agriculture, the late Dr. Ryan, suggested that we should encourage people in County Dublin to grow tomatoes. There are some of the best farmers and market gardeners in Europe in north Dublin.  Great advances have been made in horticulture.  The war forced us into this.  It took a great deal of persuasion with the help of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the county committees <Col N="823" /> of agriculture and of those Deputies who were interested, to get people to develop this production.  Now the tomato growers of County Dublin are asking me questions about their position in the Common Market.  They are fair questions and they are welcome in a democracy.</P>
    <P>At one time in this country flowers were not available in the winter season and had to be imported.  Now, our own people are growing hot-house flowers and are able to compete with foreign producers.  Tomato growing in County Dublin has improved by 300 per cent over the past 26 years. Initially the growers had small glasshouses but they expanded and have now acres of heated glasshouses.  I should like the Minister to indicate what their position will be in the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence in our people and in their ability to survive in adversity.  In the 18th century thousands of people lost their employment in Dublin and for 40 years the people endured poverty.  Then the famine occurred, which was the greatest tragedy that could befall a nation.  A nation subdued by the gun would have the spirit to fight again but a country that suffers famine is inert and it takes a considerable time to revive.</P>
    <P>I was born on a small farm.  My father was a very good manager. There were nine of us and he gave each one of us a chance to get on in life.  He was anxious that we should have secondary education.  The school was not too far away.  My mother was able to provide for the household out of the fowl, butter and eggs produced on the farm.  There was no creamery in that part of the country.  My father had milch cows.  At that time butter was 6d and 7d a lb.  There was no house in the district that did not rear pigs.  Bonhams were sold for 10s each. The people were able to exist.  There was a great ritual about killing a pig in those days and dividing it with the neighbour.  There was no £105 million subsidy in those days.  As I have often said, great things have happened in our time.  There was no such thing as <Col N="824" /> a subsidy in those days but there was a certain pride amongst the small farmers and the middle-class farmers. They did not want to owe anything to anybody.  They wanted to be independent and they worked very hard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On 25th November I asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he would arrange for the setting-up, in consultation with the health and local authorities, of a system of citizens' advice bureaux in all major centres of population.  The Minister indicated that he was not convinced of the need for setting-up advice bureaux in relation to the social security service.  He maintained that there was an information section in his Department to deal with general inquiries by telephone or letter.</P>
      <P>He mentioned that the officer in charge of this section gives public lectures throughout the country to trade unions and voluntary groups.  He said that personal callers are dealt with at two public offices in Dublin city, and that officers have been specially assigned to deal with inquiries at some employment exchanges, and information was also available from social welfare officers and local agents of the Department.  He said that, in addition, printed information was available.  In these circumstances, the Minister said he was not convinced of the need for setting up such a national service.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter tonight because it is my experience, in my two-and-a-half years here, that far too great a proportion of a Deputy's time is taken up making inquiries and seeking information on behalf of constituents. Indeed, the role of Deputies and Senators is largely that of messenger boys.  I regard this as scandalous.  Many Deputies and Senators spend 75 per cent of their time dealing exclusively with enquiries about housing, health, social security, employment and so forth.  Our role has been demeaned and abused and the danger is that our real role will become ineffective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> The rights and entitlements of citizens have been successfully made the subject of personal political patronage by those seeking votes in elections or in anticipation of elections.  Fianna Fáil Deputies and Fianna Fáil local representatives have been, perhaps, the most assiduous cultivators of this, in my opinion, unhealthy anti-democratic climate.  It is a climate that must be dispelled.  Every effort must be made to eliminate this unique parliamentary characteristic from our society.  One of the ways in which this can be done is by the establishment of citizens' advice bureaux in the major centres of population.  The establishment of such bureaux would, I believe, engender in our citizens a greater interest in the public services available for all our citizens, public services which should be the concern of all our citizens.  There is no greater threat to democracy than a feeling on the part of the ordinary citizen of bafflement, puzzlement and frustration because of ignorance of the meaning and scope of social and industrial legislation passed by this Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There is a need for properly staffed advice bureaux.  Such bureaux could be assisted at local level by voluntary social workers.  Today, the State, with an elaborate system of social services in education, health, housing, transport, planning and development, family allowances, pensions and consumer problems, such as hire purchase, impinges deeply on the life of every citizens.  In whatever direction one may turn there is some statutory provision or regulation standing in one's way. Advice bureaux could, with advantage, reduce a great deal of frustration arising as a result of these regulations and provisions.  First of all, the ordinary citizen could be made aware of the particular rules applying to his case; secondly, he could be made aware of the ways in which the application of a particular rule can be applied in his particular case; thirdly, he could be made aware of the services available for his assistance and how the rules must be applied to help him.  All citizens should be made aware of the machinery for reviewing grievances. These bureaux would, I believe, make the work of government more meaningful <Col N="826" /> and better understood by citizens. Citizens would have an opportunity, too, of voicing their criticisms of and suggestions for the improvement of the system.</P>
    <P>I believe my proposal is in accordance with the highest aspirations of our society in regard to caring for the individual.  Society is inevitably growing more and more bureaucratic and more concerned with the care of the community.  It would be an important advance in social thinking and in political development if such bureaux were established.  At present a great deal of laudable voluntary social work is being done by voluntary groups. These groups could play an important part in advice bureaux, an invaluable and an expanding role, and public servants and others would find their work greatly assisted.  Such bureaux would be a major local co-ordinator and would develop a much more rational approach to social services of all kinds. Duplication and waste would be avoided.  Ever since World War II such a system has operated in Britain. There are over 500 bureaux available at local level to British nationals which are staffed by trained professional people.  There are at least 20 such bureaux currently operating in the North of Ireland which are providing an essential social service.  Such bureaux should be set up in every major centre of population in the Republic.</P>
    <P>During the course of my duties as a TD I am obliged, and I regard it as honour, to provide information and personal assistance to constituents. People do not always come because they are in a quandary about what social welfare benefits they are entitled to.  They come very often in order to obtain comfort because of loneliness or personal social inadequacies. Voluntary workers could assist such people and find some form of community activity in which they could engage themselves.</P>
    <P>In the growing consumer-orientated society in which we live such bureaux could provide an effective consumer service at local level.  To take just one, hire purchase, this causes many problems to newly-married couples and <Col N="827" /> old people.  The value of such a public service is unquestionable.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the documents and leaflets produced, including those produced by voluntary organisations such as the leaflets published by the Dún Laoghaire Junior Chamber of Commerce on Entitlements for Elderly Persons, one realises that such a service is necessary.  It is not good enough to say that if people have inquiries they can ring up the Department.  I know our telephone system has improved greatly and I know a great deal of information is available by telephone. I know too that people can go to employment exchanges and speak to local social welfare officers.  In that way the majority of the staff of the Department of Social Welfare give help and assistance to citizens, but it is not good enough.</P>
    <P>If such bureaux were set up in major urban centres of population people could find out about the services available in the Department of Health, the Department of Education, the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Labour, the various local authorities and the many other Government Departments to which citizens have to go from time to time in order to find out their rights and their entitlements.  If such bureaux were set up TDs would be able to spend more time as legislators, inventors of social reform and public watchdogs than they do at present because a good deal of our time is spent giving advice and assistance to citizens. At present we seem to spend a great deal of time writing letters, filling in forms and giving information to citizens, all of which is laudable, but it is not something we are employed to do as public representatives.  I would ask, therefore, that such bureaux be established and if they are a failure at least we will have given them a say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I gave a fairly adequate answer to this question but obviously Deputy Desmond was anxious to pursue the matter further.  If bureaux were established in every town in order <Col N="828" /> to provide information not merely on social services, which covers a wide field in itself, but on education, health and agriculture, each bureau would need to be well staffed and in spite of the good that such bureaux would undoubtedly do, it would, in fact, be an overlapping service, and the cost would be tremendous.</P>
      <P>Social welfare is the one area where people frequently talk about the necessity of providing facilities in order to let the public know what they are entitled to.  I am as anxious as anyone else to have a good communications service with the public but from contact with my own constituents I have not found people are badly informed. I have found many people wondering how they can get a particular benefit even though they are not qualified for it and no bureau could provide such information.  The person who is always seeking information is worried because he does not qualify for a particular scheme.  As I mentioned on the Estimate debate one cannot have a scheme without laying down qualifications.  We have not reached the stage of instant social services.  It is not possible to go into an office and say: &ldquo;Give me a £500 grant for my house&rdquo; and walk off with it; or to say: &ldquo;I was 70 years old yesterday and I want my pension book&rdquo; and get it immediately.  I know the Deputy is not suggesting anything like that although I admit that would be the ideal service.  There are requirements laid down in order to qualify for any benefit.  When a person reaches a stage where he knows he may be entitled to benefit he can make application and I think there is sufficient publicity to enable him to know where to apply for benefit.</P>
      <P>We are anxious that everyone should know about the social welfare benefits and what they entail by way of qualification. However, if it is necessary for a person to have 156 contributions to qualify for a certain benefit and if he has only 155 no bureau can do anything about it.  This is the kind of person who writes to the newspapers and who complains about the poor services we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We go to the trouble of issuing a <Col N="829" /> booklet&mdash;which is changed each year &mdash;which is most useful.  In itself the booklet is not an interpretation of the law with regard to social welfare.  It gives a broad, simplified outline of the services available and it directs attention to more extensive information given in leaflets which set out full details in relation to each scheme. These booklets are freely distributed and Deputies make good use of them. I hope they circulate them to their constituents or to any person who may need them.  The new revised booklet which refers to the most recent benefits will be available in a week or two and I hope it will be availed of to the same extent as have the previous booklets. I hope Deputies will not only get copies for themselves but for people who act as social workers, because these people do an excellent job.</P>
    <P>In my reply to Deputy Desmond I pointed out that officers had been especially assigned recently to deal with inquiries at employment exchanges in six different offices&mdash;at Galway, Sligo, Athlone, Tralee, Wexford, and Drogheda and there is a fairly good service in Dublin.  In addition, there is an employment exchange office in every area and the manager of each exchange is thoroughly versed in matters relating to social welfare.  He will give guidance and advice to people but he cannot make decisions and this brings me to the important point regarding bureaux generally.</P>
    <P>No matter how they are set up, as long as they cannot make decisions they do not serve a great purpose in that they can only direct the person where to go.  They must be extremely circumspect about what they tell people and this applies also to bureaux in England.  Incidentally, in that country the bureaux are, in the main, generally manned by voluntary workers.  They can tell a person the requirements of qualification and even if they are of opinion that the person does not qualify for that benefit they can give him information about where to apply.</P>
    <P>The service in England relates to many other items as well as social welfare; it relates to agricultural requirements, to schemes of grants, methods of education, to health services and many <Col N="830" /> other items.  I am not denying that it is useful and the bureaux are set up in a number of major cities.  When I go abroad and meet representatives of other parliaments at conferences. usually we exchange views about matters of common interest.  I find that no matter what service is set up, no matter what kind of communication is made available to help people obtain information, they do not fail to contact their elected representatives seeking advice and guidance and, frequently, expect us to do something that legally it is impossible to do.  This communication has an advantage that it gives Members direct contact with thousands of people from all walks of life and this can be useful to a Deputy in building up his knowledge of what is good, bad and indifferent with regard to public administration.  I am not saying that this kind of contact should constitute the major part of a legislator's duties but the time will never come when an elected representative will not be questioned by his constituents regarding many details of public administration. For that reason, I would not base any case for the establishment of these bureaux on the arguments that it would release Deputies to be legislators only.  If that day should come we will have reached a stage when the elected representative will be remote from his people.</P>
    <P>In addition to the booklet which my office produce and circulate free of charge, there is &ldquo;The Guide to the Social Services&rdquo; published by the Stationery Office, costing 5p.  This booklet covers all types of services under 110 headings and it relates to various matters as well as social welfare; it makes reference to education, land, agriculture, fishing, to medical services and so on.  In Britain a social services guide is circulated; it is issued by Pelican Publishers in paperback form and it covers very many schemes. However, it only touches on them by way of telling people what they might get and where to go, thereby demonstrating that they have the same problem as we have and that they are continually trying to issue publications to give people the necessary information.</P>
    <P>As our social services become more <Col N="831" /> complex and as they expand to take more people under the social welfare code more efficient communication is necessary.  It is fair to say that we are endeavouring continually to improve the service and the fact that we have set up six exchanges in important towns is evidence of our recognition that, to some extent there is a problem.  However, this service relates to social welfare only and to set up the kind of bureaux which have been advocated would require the co-operation of a number of Departments.  It would need to be a highly skilled service with contacts throughout the country; it would need to be staffed by highly efficient people who would have at their fingertips knowledge relating to the various schemes, but these people would not be in a position to make decisions.  Their function would be to <Col N="832" /> inform the public about where to apply for benefits and to give them a broad outline of what is required with regard to qualifications.</P>
    <P>I could not promise the Deputy that I would set out to have a proliferation of bureaux of this type but it would be interesting at some stage to have an experimental pilot scheme to see if it would be justifiable.  My Department have been considering this but to do a worthwhile job it would have to embrace the workings of a number of Departments and it would require some inter-departmental study. Meanwhile, we will lose no opportunity of making available to the people in the easiest way possible all the information regarding our social welfare schemes.</P>

      <P>The rental data for local authority dwellings included in the consumer price index relate to the figures for total weekly rent, including rates, of all occupied rented dwellings. The rent inquiry is made at mid-November each year.  Data for 1971 are therefore not yet available.  The following statement shows for each county, county borough and for Dún Laoghaire Borough the number of occupied rented local authority dwellings, together with the average weekly rent, including rates, for which data were included in the consumer price index for November, 1970.</P>
      <P>NUMBER of occupied rented dwellings owned by local authorities in each County, County Borough and Dún Laoghaire Borough together with the average weekly rent (including rates) of such dwellings in each area, as used in the compilation of the Consumer Price Index at mid-November, 1970.</P>
