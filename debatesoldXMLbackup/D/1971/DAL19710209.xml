    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether it is intended that prior to entry to the EEC a White Paper containing the final proposals which have been negotiated by the Government will be submitted to the Oireachtas for consideration and debate before acceptance.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in the Dáil on 25th July, 1967, the Dáil will be given an opportunity of debating the terms of entry to the European Communities as part of the procedure for ratifying Ireland's accession to the Treaties establishing the Communities.</P>
      <P>The manner in which the terms of entry will be presented to the Dáil will be decided in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach now consider&mdash;and I think this was promised through his Whip a week or two ago&mdash;the resumption of the debate on the Government's motion on the EEC?  It is very important that we should have this resumption because I think the last real discussion we had was away back in June, 1970.  Since then, we are told, there have been more or less detailed discussions and negotiations. The House and the country are entitled to know what has gone on since June of last year.  Apart from the various speeches that Ministers make at Fianna Fáil cumainn around the country, we should have a debate here in Dáil Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I was under the impression, related to a question which was put down to the Minister for External Affairs last week to which he circulated a reply, that there would be a resumption of the debate last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not say it would be last week.  What the Minister said was that apart from the resumption of the discussion which was adjourned we might be able to arrange short discussions as the negotiations progress.  We are anxious to do that as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <P>In view of the importance of this decision to the country, and allowing for the attitude of every Member of the House, could the Taoiseach tell us now whether a free vote of the House will be permitted on this vital national issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the <Col N="849" /> Minister for External Affairs has said, would it be possible to have a new debate so that those who are keeping abreast of what is happening can speak on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to continue the debate as it is but the Minister said already that he is prepared to facilitate short debates as the negotiations progress.  I think that is what Deputy Corish suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins  Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Timmins</b> asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to a statement by the Confederation of Irish Industries that the unemployment rate here is higher than in the member countries of EEC and in the other three applicant countries; and if he will comment on same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are well aware of the comparative statistics for unemployment in this country, the EEC member countries and the other applicant countries.</P>
      <P>The Government's economic programmes and the NIEC's report on full employment laid emphasis on the objectives of raising employment and reducing unemployment and emigration, and on the need for rapid economic growth to achieve them.  The Third Programme was drawn up against the background of the NIEC Report on full employment and is a first step on the road to that goal.</P>
      <P>Economic circumstances in 1970 did not favour increasing employment. Most recent indications are that the economy grew at something under 2 per cent during the year.  There was a drop of 1,000 in the number employed between April, 1969, and April, 1970, as an increase of 9,000 in the industrial and other domestic sectors was more than offset by a decrease of 10,000 in the agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>A far more favourable outturn could have been expected had the conditions for steady economic progress as set out in the Third Programme been observed, in particular, the conditions of an appropriate relationship being maintained between the growth of incomes and of output and the existence of a substantial measure of industrial peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="850" /> A resumption of steady economic progress and improvement in the employment position depends on the measure of success achieved by the Government's medium-term policies. Broadly stated these are intended to bring about more rapid industrialisation, higher exports, greater investment and more saving to finance it.  A precondition of all of them is price stability, interpreted as no more, and preferably less, of a rise in prices here than in the countries with which we trade.  Equally obvious is the need for an ordered and disciplined approach in the conduct of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>Recent development on the incomes and on the industrial relations fronts allow reasonable grounds for hoping that the importance of these conditions of our progress is being realised and that we can look forward to a period of greater industrial peace.  With such peace and with the requisite response to, and co-operation in, Government development policies we can expect a resumption of steady economic progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the Third Programme for Economic Expansion is a failure, that we have gross inflation today and an increasing cost of living, and that we are heading for a financial crisis which will have a further adverse effect on employment?  Will the Taoiseach not agree further that the Government's inflationary policy means that much of our own production is being priced even out of our home market, let alone the foreign market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do everything in my power to offset the kind of sabotaging speeches being made by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that Government policy has led us into this position because the Taoiseach is more concerned with other things than with ruling the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Referring to the NIEC report, is not this a repetition of the kind of egregious rubbish that was thrown out four years ago about so many jobs and so much employment by 1980?  I do not know who wrote the <Col N="851" /> report but the men who signed it obviously did not believe it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Those associated with the Deputy in the Labour Party benches signed it as part of a unanimous recommendation to the Government. Will the Deputy sit down and let me finish?  The background I refer to is one of full employment that we hope to achieve.  It was set out as a target by the NIEC and it is reasonable to try to achieve that target.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach say there was a representative of the Labour Party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said there was a representative of the trade unions, and on that representation are members of the Oireachtas Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that, because the chances of reaching the employment targets set out by the NIEC by 1980 are nil, there is an obligation on the Government to provide fresh, revised and more realistic figures as a background attending our application for EEC membership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A reappraisal will have to be made because the targets set out in the Third Programme are based on certain assumptions and events have proved these assumptions not to have been justified.  As happened last year, the assumption was not justified. Unfortunately, we will have to reassess our position in the light of that situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if there has been an increase in the incidence of food poisoning in the past ten years; and what action is being taken to combat the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Food poisoning, as such, is not a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1948.  Consequently, there is no specific information available in my Department regarding the incidence of food poisoning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> However, the statistics available to my Department regarding food-borne infections indicate that while there has been an increase in salmonella infection the number of cases of dysentery has fallen.</P>
    <P>The elimination of contamination arising out of food is one of the aims of the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950. Salmonellosis has been the subject of a seminar held in April, 1970, under the aegis of my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries which was attended by medical and veterinary officers in the central and local authority services.</P>
    <P>The Food Hygiene Advisory Committee have dealt with the problem of food poisoning in their report which is at present under examination in my Department.  When this examination is completed I will then consider the further measures, appropriate to my Department, to be taken in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that food poisoning is a disease which must be controlled by more effective measures in the field of public health, would the Minister not consider it appropriate to make it a notifiable disease?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised it would be quite impracticable.  A lot of conditions which might be thought of as food poisoning might not be food poisoning in the sense which the Deputy means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>I am aware that there is a need for more speech therapists. To meet this need the Dublin College of Speech Therapy was established under the auspices of the National Rehabilitation Board in October, 1969, to train speech therapists for employment in the Health Services throughout the country.  It is expected that the first class, of 14, will complete their training next year and will then be available to take up duty.  Similar groups of trained students should be available in the succeeding years.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any general acute shortage of cot beds in children's hospitals in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Since early January there has been an unprecedented seasonal demand for the admission of young children suffering from respiratory conditions.  The unusual weather with rapid fluctuations in temperature was probably a major contributory factor.  This exceptional demand for hospital treatment of upper respiratory tract infections has been noted at this time in previous years but the scale of the demand has been much greater this year than in the past few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the Minister says he is not aware of the fact, he says also that there has been an unprecedented demand for hospital treatment. Consequently, must there not be an unprecedented shortage of cot beds? Will he not consider some proposals for increasing the number of cot beds in those hospitals?  Those hospitals have not been extended in recent years and there have not been any new hospitals built.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to increase the number of cot beds for this specific purpose.  I am studying the study group on children's hospital services. This involves more complex questions than the total number of beds.  It involves where they should be sited, the position of general hospitals in regard to the care of sick children and a number of other matters.  In my own view, the situation could be far better met by more effective use of out-patient facilities and out-patient care, by public health nurses and so forth.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the total sum spent by his Department on advertising his anti-smoking campaign on (a) radio, (b) TV, (c) newspapers and (d) magazines in 1968, 1969 and 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The answer to the <Col N="857" /> Deputy's question in respect of the financial years ended 31st March, 1968, 1969 and 1970 under each of the four headings into which he breaks his question is nil.  In those years the anti-cigarette smoking campaign of the Department of Health concentrated itself in three broad areas, viz. the dissemination of leaflets particularly to school children; the school film shows given in schools throughout the country by the National Film Institute on behalf of the Department of Health; and the inclusion in appropriate television and radio magazine programmes of features to educate the public as to the health hazard of cigarette smoking.</P>
      <P>In the current year, however, an additional sum of £25,000 has been made available to mount an intensified anti-cigarette smoking campaign aimed at the young.  To date in this financial year a sum of £7,654 has been paid out on producing material for, and advertising in, the media mentioned by the Deputy but accounts are not yet available in respect of the entire campaign. It is anticipated that practically the entire sum will be spent in the year.</P>
      <P>I should, of course, add that so far as the television campaign in the current year is concerned, the showing of the &ldquo;Smoking Kills your Taste for Life&rdquo; series of filmlets is not charged for by Radio Telefís Éireann.  They are being shown free of charge during commercial time as part of the RTE Authority's public service contribution. If the showings had to be paid for at the going commercial rates I would estimate that they would have cost my Department around £17,500 in the period between October last to January last.</P>

      <P>Our application has from the beginning been for membership of the EEC as this was the course which it was considered would best serve Ireland's interests.  An association or trade agreement with the Community as an alternative to membership, even if it could be negotiated, would not permit us to develop our full potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the view of the Minister or of the Commission?</P>

    <Col N="860" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Our decision was to seek full membership.  No view of the Commission was sought on that.  The question is raised as to whether we did seek opinions on associate membership from the Commission and I explain our position on the basis that at no time did we seek associate membership because our decision was for full membership on the basis of the information available.  I am sure the Dáil will be aware that when the negotiations for enlargement were suspended, the question of negotiating some form of trading arrangement in the interim period was explored with the Commission but it was made clear at that time that any bilateral exchange of preferences would not be available from the Commission so long as we maintained our present position on the British market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Since association can take different forms and can be of different degrees, did the Minister or the Government not consider it worthwhile to explore officially the idea of association?  The Minister said that the Government made up their own minds but would he not consider that, even now, it would be a good idea to explore fully the possibilities of association?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to attract us to association.  As the Deputy is aware, under associate membership there would not be available any benefits such as are available under the common agricultural policy in full membership; also, we would be excluded from decision making although the decisions would affect us very definitely, particularly in matters of trade.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's question in relation to our seeking the opinion of the Commission, in October, 1969, the Commission expressed the view that association or preferential treatment would not normally be contemplated except with countries who could not become full members.  They did say also at that time that countries which took less than full membership in certain cases might have to comply with a decision affecting their interests, a decision in the taking of which they had no part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

Could the Minister say whether or not Ireland would proceed with her application for membership if Britain decided that the terms were not acceptable to her?

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>If the negotiations between Britain and the Community are not fruitful or are unproductive there will be a totally new situation then for Britain and the other applicants. The decision to enlarge the Community was a Community decision and without this decision the four applicants would have had no business making their applications again.  If the negotiations with Britain break down the Council of Ministers will have to decide whether they will continue with their policy of enlarging the Community and the completion of the Community <Col N="863" /> because both are closely tied together. If they decide to continue with their policy of enlargement without Britain, then we will have to consider what our position will be and analyse all the effects of that in so far as we can.

The Community have never separated the four applicants except before the Hague meeting when there was a question of Britain joining on her own and bringing the Community up to seven.

At no time have the Community raised the question of what will happen if Britain does not succeed.</P>

      <P>A feasibility study for an aerodrome at Lifford, County Donegal was commissioned by Donegal County Council in 1969 and presented to me by representatives of the council in February, 1970.  The estimated cost of the project was £250,000.</P>

      <P>There has been no directive to Departments to suspend payments of grants due.  I should explain that because of the closure of the banks to normal business on Thursday and Friday this week, 11th and 12th February, in preparation for the change over to decimal working, Departments were asked to reduce to the essential minimum the issue of payable orders, which would necessarily be in £sd terms, between Monday, 8th February, and Friday, 12th February.  The purpose is to reduce the number of orders drawn in £sd terms which will have to be processed by the banks and the Paymaster General's Office around Decimal Day.</P>
      <P>Departments have accordingly arranged that payable orders be either issued a week earlier than they otherwise would or, in the case of payments which are not in any way pressing, be deferred for a few days.  However, no grant payment is being delayed in any way.</P>

In view of the fact, first, that they do not seem to be going to change their minds, secondly, in view of the fact that the governing body of UCD is so constituted that it is questionably representative of even staff, still less of students, and thirdly, in view of the fact that the Minister quite correctly intervened forcibly on a previous occasion on the question of leaving certificate subjects for entrance to the university, then in view of the fact that this precedent exists would he not take very forcible action to bring to the notice both of UCD and TCD their social responsibilities to this class of student?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take both Private Notice Questions together.</P>
      <P>I have found it necessary to express publicly the Government's anxiety about the deterioration of the situation in the North.  I did this in the statement I issued last Saturday 6th February in which I drew attention to matters which we believe to have contributed seriously to the deterioration.</P>
      <P>In doing so it was my intention to reassure the minority and calm the situation by making it clear that this Government is fully aware of the situation, is concerned about it and is actively engaged in exercising its influence in the matter.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced that Deputy Cosgrave's suggestion is a practical one at the present time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he would consider a limited discussion in this House on a resolution which would place on record the rejection by this House of the use of force?  I think this would be helpful at the present time and might I stress that I think the discussion should be limited? On the other point, might I ask the Taoiseach if he has changed his mind on the question of an interview with the British Prime Minister?  He will recall last April or May, when the situation was, I suppose, somewhat as serious as it is now, that he sought an interview with Mr. Wilson, the then Prime Minister.  It did not materialise but I think he should consider the idea of tripartite talks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is a very important one.  One does not have to look very closely at it to understand the impact agriculture has on the Irish <Col N="888" /> economy.  If agriculture is not developed to its full potential it must necessarily interfere with the development of other social and economic pursuits.  Agriculture must become increasingly efficient, forward-looking and capable of rapid adjustment, particularly in these changing times and changing circumstances.  However, when we think of the variable resources in land, labour and capital, the difference in the degree of competence and skill of our farmers, the variation in the size of farms and in the soil, we begin to think of what a complex problem this is for the Government.</P>
      <P>The development of agriculture presents at this time major problems not only for this country but for all developing nations of the world.  Basic to any development programme and basic to the interests of individual farmers and the nation as a whole is the underpinning of research.  We have been fortunate in the progress made by An Foras Talúntais in assessing the resources of our land, in outlining development programmes, in introducing new techniques and in the data and scientific knowledge they have put at the disposal of agriculturalists.  Any moneys voted in this direction are in the national interest.</P>
      <P>The necessity for farmers to be more efficient, for production costs to be cut down, raises the question of farmer education.  The drive for the education of farmers must be pursued with greater intensity.  Great strides have been made in this direction in recent times.  However, the number of young men going into agriculture each year is between 3,000 and 4,000; the number of places in agricultural colleges for young boys who can be trained in agriculture through one year courses is between 500 and 600, and only a quarter of that number eventually return to farming.  Therefore, the facilities for agricultural education are not adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While more investment must be put into the land, the greatest single resource, the one which can give the best return, is the human resource.  Our advisory services need to be even further strengthened so that our farmers can avail of the services of these men more than once or twice a year as is <Col N="889" /> the case at present because of the huge number of farmers with whom instructors have to get in touch.</P>
    <P>In regard to agricultural education I am delighted to note that in the new curricula for primary education this area is being more adequately covered than heretofore.  Certainly one must advocate majoring in chemistry, physics, biology and other allied agricultural subjects so that the farmers of the future will be geared for the competitive field they will be entering.  All the indications are that farming is becoming more scientific and more businesslike.</P>
    <P>Farm output must bring a greater income to farmers.  In the last year alone the 6 or 7 per cent increase in farm incomes compared to the 13 or 14 per cent increase in other incomes shows that the farmers' income must be significantly increased now and in the years ahead if those farmers with potentially viable farms are to remain on the land and the rural character, as we know it, is to be maintained.  There must be higher yields per acre and more capital must be put into agriculture. Farmers can meet and solve these problems only if they have the requisite basic training.  More people enter farming than any other type of work with little or no preparation for it.  The days when a son could carry on and intensify a farming business on what he has seen and learned as a child are gone.</P>
    <P>Winter farm schools and nightly lectures are being organised by the various committees of agriculture. Young people are anxious to equip themselves for the farming world of tomorrow.  Education is important in every walk of life including farming. Nowhere is education needed more than in the case of the farmer with a small or medium size potentially viable farm.  All of us want to see this type of farm maintained but international indicators show that it may not be possible for as many of them to survive as one would like.  Whatever the indicators are individual farmers can gear their farms to tackle these problems, with special aids from the State, so that they will receive an equitable return <Col N="890" /> for their work compared with those employed in other walks of life.</P>
    <P>While significant improvements have been made so far as the development of our farms are concerned, the degree of competence that one can expect from older age groups make development somewhat piecemeal.  While improvement in farm incomes has been significant it has been well surpassed by other sectors.  A scant look at the statistics shows that the more vital age groups are not available to work the land.  State aid should be geared at giving people a fair wage for the job because as long as industry can accommodate the surplus manpower they will draw farmers, even people with viable farms, away from the land.</P>
    <P>One of the basic things the Government should do is to equalise incomes as far as possible.  I do not agree with economists and others who advocate the extinction of small and mediumsize farms.  It is neither practical nor socially desirable.  These people should be given every opportunity to develop their farms to the full.  Sixteen per cent of our farms are less than 14 or 15 acres and they will be unable to survive unless they engage in horticultural enterprises and enterprises of a very intensive nature.  Until alternative employment is provided in industries established in provincial towns, it is practical for farmers to continue along these lines.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating described the two-tier price on milk as a wicked scheme and Deputy Bruton advocated its total abolition.  People who advocate the paying of subsidies at a flat rate must think we are living in some kind of paradise where money grows on trees. If we had unlimited resources we could consider paying a flat rate subsidy.  I have nothing against the larger producer who has developed his farm by purchasing land, using the credit facilities available, and has pushed himself and his family to the limit in order to develop and increase milk production on his farm.  It does, at times, appear as if this system might interfere with further expansion.  I want to say here that every farmer in milk production up to 30,000 gallons, which accounts for 85 or 90 per cent of our milk producers, get paid at the same rate, that <Col N="891" /> is to say every single penny given to the smaller producer is also given to the larger producer up to 30,000 gallons.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the question of whether people who advocate the abolition of the tier system are being really fair to the smaller producer who needs to be helped to bring his unit of production to an economically viable level in the future.  Anybody who looks at this must accept that he needs greater help.  I believe that this scaling down of milk prices does not interfere with expansion.  An examination of the economics shows that the larger the production the lower the cost per unit of production.  Inevitably the smaller producers' costs per unit of production are much higher than those of the larger producer and, therefore, in the long run it could be that even the 60,000-gallon producer getting on average 10d per gallon has, in fact on each unit of production a greater rate of profit than the smaller producer.</P>
    <P>The question of the scaling down of milk prices, of special aids given to the smaller and medium sized farmers, must touch on fairly serious questions for all of us not alone in this House but right through the country. Any social structure which preserves human values to the extent that rural life has done deserves to be retained. That is not to say that I advocate uneconomic units because sooner or later one must come to grips with this kind of situation but it is that I believe in special incentive aids given to the small and medium producer, helping him to become efficient and enabling him to develop his enterprise to the fullest by education, by the application of scientific knowledge and by subsidy to intensify the drive for rural renewal.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the low marriage rate, the size of farms, the lack of capital and the predominance of the young and the old.  These are all factors which cannot easily be overcome. Another thing one sees in many rural areas is the splintered farm unit where if all the land were together, it would be a viable unit but because it is broken up into two or three parts it is difficult for a farmer to work it.  Although it is not relevant to this debate I should like <Col N="892" /> to refer to the restructuring of farms of this nature.  I wonder whether the Land Commission could take on parishes or areas and, with the co-operation of farmers, exchange and acquire land to put production units together rather than having them disjointed as they often are.  This is a matter which could be pursued on another Estimate later on.</P>
    <P>Some of my remarks in connection with small farms might lead to my being criticised as being conservative.  I do not think I have any blind attachment to the traditions of rural life, farm life, but I honestly believe that with the measures undertaken by the Government intensified and increased, the better application of scientific knowledge and the increasing of farm enterprises, even smaller units can be made viable.  Indeed we have on average larger farms than they have in Europe.  This should be an encouragement to our smaller and medium sized farmer and we should not, as is sometimes the case, undermine the confidence of farmers who by their efforts and using the knowledge available to them can succeed in agriculture in the future.  We should not be discouraged either by relative failure in the past. This cannot be used as a yardstick because with the information they have now and with better adaptability farmers can grapple with their problems and in the long run can achieve viability of their holdings.</P>
    <P>An area which has been in many ways untapped is that of co-operation. Many organisations such as Muintir na Tíre and farming organisations have advocated co-operation and in some cases have brought people together to work in this way.  Smaller units with a build up in commercial ability and working together can have great strength.  Efforts that have succeeded in some areas are not copied sufficiently. Perhaps it is that we do not appreciate the value of the co-operative movement, that we have not worked out the formula by which syndicates could be made operative.  There has always been a townland tradition of co-operation dating back for generations. This can be recultivated.  Not alone do I think it can but I think it must be, <Col N="893" /> because it is one way we can cut production costs.  We just cannot afford waste.  We see waste every day of money which is scarce.  In fact not enough money is put into agriculture. Whatever is being poured into agriculture must be used to gear towards efficiency and towards cutting production costs.</P>
    <P>I have some experience of one or two machinery syndicates, pig fattening co-operatives, and I feel that their intelligent operation with goodwill between farmers could make a major contribution towards helping the farmers in question.  There is no use in exploring external markets or in subsidising boards to find more markets if the reason why we cannot hold our ground and penetrate those markets is that our production costs are too high.</P>
    <P>The rise in prices for agricultural produce right across the world has been slow and there is no indication that it will escalate.  One way in which a profit can be made more readily than in many other ways is by cutting production costs.  I should like to see more rural organisations and, indeed, all of us pushing this idea home and helping that notion to be crystallised.  It should be given the fullest backing with incentive grants and it should get our co-operation in every other way.</P>
    <P>This type of co-operation with smaller units facilitates bigger production units and, particularly where we have a reasonable number of farmers living close to one another, it can be introduced in the field of dairying and in allied farm work.  The farm incentive scheme is a well-conceived plan for encouraging development on the small farms as well.  Even though one would like to see the gross income qualification limit increased to possibly £1,000, or thereabouts, nevertheless this scheme, since it encourages planning and the setting up of targets, can act as a base to help the smaller producer to become more alive to and accustomed to the business-like demands of the farming profession today.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have been sufficiently credit conscious.  I have not got the figures with me, but I remember reading some time ago that the ratio of <Col N="894" /> indebtedness to total assets is quite low in this country by international standards. I suppose there are many historical reasons why farmers are not as credit-conscious as they should be but that is no reason why we should ignore them.  I should like to see the Agricultural Credit Corporation pursuing farm credit to the utmost.  It is not possible by any stretch of the imagination to give the kind of subsidies to farmers which would enable them to get into bigger units, so credit must come into it.  There is no way in which a small farmer who is potentially viable can really get off the ground unless he is able to get credit and utilise the money on an acceptable farm plan. He must get all the co-operation possible from his agricultural adviser and from the ACC.  The fact that our ratio of indebtedness to total assets is so low should be an indicator which would encourage the giving of more credit to our farmers.</P>
    <P>The production of cattle and the development of the capacity of our breeding stock are other areas in agriculture which interest me for many reasons, and in which I think greater efforts could be made.  By international standards our milk yield per cow is quite low.  Thinking in terms of efficiency and low production costs, the capacity of our stock to breed the best kind of dairy cow and beef with the best conversion rate must be aimed at, and in this field higher investment is essential.  In our AI societies the service of the AI bulls has now gone over the 1,000,000 mark.  The 260 or so bulls operating in the AI centres will have the greatest effect on this industry, naturally.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to note that the central performance testing station is getting under way, where young bulls can be recruited and leased out to the AI societies and the pedigree breeders.  I was also delighted to note that in our AI societies the intake of bulls has increased and that, having used younger stock for a short time, they were able to withdraw them from the service so that these animals could be assessed in terms of their capacity in relation to the production of milk and the conversion to beef.  The AI service <Col N="895" /> enables farmers to be selective in their breeding.  It is available at reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the development in the laboratory research stations, and I speak particularly of the one in Limerick which is closest to my constituency. I should also like to express welcome for the establishment of the Horse Board.</P>
    <P>Internationally speaking, we can be quite happy in the matter of disease eradication.  Nevertheless, on the matter of the bovine tuberculosis scheme which has been so successful in this country during the years, it is alarming that the Estimate for its continuation has increased to such an extent.  It might help if the annual testing of cattle could be carried out on all animals in the same area simultaneously. At the moment testing is done in disjointed farm units.  Very often, as I mentioned earlier, cattle are tested on one farm in an intensified dairying area at one time of the year and those on another farm are not tested until six months later.  An attempt should be made to carry out annual testing on an area by area basis so that this kind of thing would not happen.</P>
    <P>The advance in the eradication of brucellosis is heartening and those of us in the south are anxiously awaiting the day when we will be rid of this disease which erodes so heavily the income of farmers.  It is a disease which is responsible for a mortality rate of anything up to 50,000 or 60,000 calves annually.  It is a disease we cannot be rid of too quickly.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the scheme for warble fly eradication fell down last year.  The Department must share responsibility for this.  One farming organisation was totally against the scheme as it was envisaged.  A scheme which is so necessary and which could eradicate the warble fly completely should have been carried through and any difficulties which arose with a farming organisation should have been ironed out.  I do not agree that the scheme should now be conducted entirely on a voluntary basis.  I should like to see another attempt made to <Col N="896" /> operate the scheme on a compulsory basis.  I do not say that a voluntary scheme could not be successful, and I should like to think it would be, but I am not so certain of this.  An intensive effort should be made to get this scheme taken properly in hand.  Farmers in general, realising the value of the scheme, would welcome such an effort.</P>
    <P>In relation to pig production, a great deal of pessimism has been expressed about it.  The consumption of pigs in this country has increased by 9 per cent, during the past year the home consumption arm of the industry taking about 25,000 pigs annually and the export taking 22,000.  I do not have the same fears for the industry in the circumstances of EEC membership as many people have.  One eminent man, well-known in research into pig production, stated recently that if the same conditions operate here when we enter the EEC as now operate in EEC, the profit per pig will be in the region of £2 10s.  I realise that some of our factories inevitably will tend to be larger but we must appreciate that the volume of our trade with our nearest neighbour will continue for a long time.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of progeny testing and performance in this industry which I should like to see explored.  It relates to the number of bonhams per litter.  This primarily can be a management factor but I suggest that our breeding stock and progeny testing need to be intensified in an effort to find out how we can gain a bigger number of bonhams per sow.  In this we are behind the Danes and there is no reason why we should be.  Therefore, I should like to see an all-out effort to increase our litters.  This, in turn, would lead to greater profitability for the farmer engaged in pig production.</P>
    <P>I should like to see pig rearing by small farmers encouraged more and more.  It does not matter whether the land is good or bad: all a farmer needs is enough to service the unit.  It is an industry which ties in well with the economy of smaller farmers and there is a reasonable profit potential.</P>
    <P>Again in relation to smaller farmers, the re-scaling of some farm building grants may be necessary.  Investment in <Col N="897" /> farm building returns a small income and smaller farmers are not able to meet the commitment involved.  I should like therefore to ask the Minister to see whether these grants can be made more effective as far as this kind of producer is concerned.</P>
    <P>The intensification of smaller farms has been given as one of the reasons for the drop in sheep production.  We are running considerably below the number of sheep projected in the Second Programme.  It is hard to understand the reason for this.  It appears that the industry could have a good financial return.</P>
    <P>There have been some problems in relation to the sale of wool.  Apart from encouraging sheep production, efforts should be made to improve the fertility rate of ewes.  In general the rate is not as high as it should be.  We must ensure that the minimum number of ewes are carried over the winter and that the maximum number of spring lambs are sold.  This necessitates a greater drive towards higher fertility in ewes.  All possible research should be directed towards this aspect of sheep production.</P>
    <P>In relation to land drainage and reclamation, the £6 million spent annually and the £45 per acre grant towards land reclamation is well worth while. We still face some major problems in relation to drainage but, of course, it would not be feasible economically to deal with them all at once.  A greater effort will have to be made on the part of farmers towards the maintenance of rivers that have been drained already. Unless these rivers are maintained properly the amount of money spent on draining them initially will not result in the maximum benefits.  Farmers should be encouraged in this regard; otherwise, land that has been very well drained may revert to its original condition after a period of five or six years.  This should not be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the farm buildings grants.  The increased grants for water supply schemes must be welcomed also.  I have often wondered why some farmers are reluctant to avail of <Col N="898" /> running water especially when these grants are available to them.  Not only would a running water supply help domestically but it would also make possible a high standard of hygiene.  In relation to the production of milk, one cannot overemphasise the importance of running water in so far as hygiene is concerned.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect in relation to the payment of these grants which seems to be causing some concern.  The payment of this grant is tied, and rightly so, to domestic water supply grants.  A common cost certificate is necessary before either grant can be paid.  However, it seems to me, from investigations I have made, that communication between the two Departments concerned is not as close as it might be.  In saying this, I am not in any way being critical of the people concerned because I know of the interest and efforts that are made in this regard.  Nevertheless, the operation of the schemes could be a little less cumbersome if there was a little more streamlining.</P>
    <P>Reference was made earlier in the debate to the drop in the potato yield. It is likely that this is nothing more than an indication that people can afford to be more selective nowadays in that they can buy foods in more variety.  Therefore, there is not very much that can be done about this matter except, perhaps, that stabilising the price of potatoes might help a little. Potatoes have always fluctuated in price.</P>
    <P>The question of dwelling houses for farmers has been mentioned also.  In this respect, State aid has been very generous.  Driving through our countryside, one can observe the many new homes that have been built in recent times.  This is very heartening and it is to be encouraged even further since there is still overcrowded conditions in the homes of some farmers.</P>
    <P>Another matter I wish to refer to is the question of personal injuries to farmers.  Most of our farmers do not insure themselves against personal accidents with the result that, when serious injuries are sustained, they may find themselves in a very difficult situation because of financial loss and also because of the loss of man days on <Col N="899" /> farms.  Therefore, personal accident insurance is to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>In relation to our joining the EEC I notice that during the past ten years figures show that the prosperity per head of people within the Community has increased by more than 100 per cent.  I think anybody would be anxious to get into that kind of market which consists of almost 300 million people. Any Government should be anxious to explore the full potential of these markets and every effort should be made in this direction.</P>
    <P>When we compare the prices obtaining in the EEC we readily see that producers there do significantly better than we do and, from that point of view alone, access to the Common Market should benefit our farmers but to gain the maximum benefit every necessary preparatory step must be taken in the interim to gear our farmers for entry.  There are some attributes in our agriculture that not even the Labour Party can take away from it. We have good pasture land, a good climate, on the whole freedom from disease, and a longer grass growing season; the combination of all these makes ideal conditions for the potential of Irish agriculture in circumstances of free trade.</P>

      <P>As far as the production of grassland is concerned, if the Irish farmer works hard enough, there is nothing he cannot master.  This is an area in which there is a tremendous potential arising out of access to the European Economic Community. It is an area in which, no matter what the prices are, we can gain a greater profit as compared with farmers in neighbouring countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see the reports and the evidence available following on consultation and negotiation made available to our farming organisations in a language our farmers can understand. Sometimes the technical data is not as intelligible to farmers as it should be.  I advocate the speedy getting back of information to the industry to enable the maximum benefits to <Col N="900" /> be gained and to offset any possible deficiency.</P>
    <P>Someone once said that behind every successful man there is a successful woman; nowhere is this more true than in the field of agriculture.  The role of the farmer's wife is an important and a significant one.  The farm home advisory service is gaining ground every day and I would encourage &ldquo;farmersses&rdquo; to avail of this facility as much as possible by participating in demonstrations and exhibitions, because these all help towards brightening the pattern of Irish farming life.</P>
    <P>I must pay tribute to our young farmers' organisations.  The investment in these organisations has given a very good return.  Through organisation these young men are emerging as farmers with more ability.  We have in them the foundation of excellent agricultural production in the future. Already our land has reached a higher level of fertility.  We know more precisely what our resources are.  The output per head of those engaged in agriculture was never higher.  While more capital needs to be invested, more capital than ever before is being invested.  More cattle are going into our marts.  There is an increase in beef marketing.  We have more pigs.  There is reason for some concern about our dairying industry.  Extra help is needed here.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt about the potential of Irish agriculture.  Neither have I any doubt about the capacity of the Irish farmer to produce a variety of goods capable of competing with those produced by farmers in other countries.  If we continue to increase our efficiency, to use the technical and scientific knowledge at our disposal, and if we intensify our efforts and have a more dynamic approach towards development and renewal, given the means and placing the emphasis on training, the future for Irish agriculture is sound.  It can be made even more sound if the farmer of today by the use of better techniques ensures that the farmer of tomorrow is a competitive farmer unafraid of his counterpart in any other part of Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the <Col N="901" /> manner in which this Estimate is being debated.  There have been demands for more time to debate and discuss important matters.  Agriculture, as has often been said, is our most important industry.  In the Minister's interest, in the interests of this House and in the interests of farmers all over the country, there should be a greater degree of continuity in the discussion of this very important Estimate.  If we want a fruitful discussion continuity is vital.  The discussion cannot be fruitful if the debate is sporadic, a few hours now and a few hours then, deferred from week to week, or even from month to month.  That is not doing business properly.  It is not giving to our most important industry the attention it deserves.  This is wrong.</P>
      <P>I was very impressed by Deputy Smith's contribution.  It was an honest contribution.  However, once an Estimate is introduced, a Deputy will prepare himself to speak but when he gets an opportunity to speak his material may be completely irrelevant because we are living in changing times. I hope that whoever is responsible for the manner in which this debate is conducted will ensure that the procedure will be rectified in future.  You have farmers and farmers' organisations condemning this situation, and rightly so: I think they have a grievance, even though I do not agree with what was said by the farmers' representative on television&mdash;that we did not have any debate for the past four years.  We did, but the debate was completely disjointed and fruitless, in my opinion.  It was not a successful debate.</P>
      <P>I thought that particularly at this time in the case of this very important industry the Minister would have devoted more time to the implications of EEC membership.  I thought he would deal with this at length and deal particularly with the Mansholt Report because many people have expressed concern about and are not too satisfied with the idea of EEC membership.  The Minister said&mdash;and I quote him on 2nd December as reported at column 255, Volume 250 of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one aspect of our EEC Membership application on which I feel compelled to comment here.  I <Col N="902" /> refer to the unbalanced and distorted arguments that are being promulgated by certain groups and personalities against membership.  Well-informed and constructive criticism is a welcome and essential part of the total debate on and assessment of our future in the enlarged Community. The groups and personalities I refer to, however, appear to be neither well informed nor constructive and, so far as agriculture is concerned, are completely out of line with the views of informed agricultural opinion in this country.</P>
    <P>This is all right for the Minister to say and probably many of us agree that this is so but there are, particularly in the small farming community, large numbers of people who are convinced that if we become members of the enlarged Community it will mean complete extermination of small farmers which is anything but true but I think it is the duty of the Government, and particularly of the Minister when he has the opportunity of introducing this Estimate, to deal at length with the matter and say whether he has or has not accepted the Mansholt Report or Mansholt Plan.</P>
    <P>Our news media could be availed of to put across a programme, particularly in regard to agriculture, each week to give information to people who are very anxious for it.  There are certain sections and no matter how they are enlightened they will not accept it but there are genuine fears in the small farming community.  I suggest the Minister should consult with his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs with a view to using the media to enlighten people on the implications of EEC membership.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister on EEC because I believe we are in a position to reap a pretty good harvest.  I believe that because our farmers are the best in Europe they can avail of the market that will be presented to them but I want to condemn the Minister and the Government for not doing their part in getting this message across to the people.  I congratulate Macra na Feirme for making a constructive effort to enlighten the farming community by inviting Dr. Mansholt here for a discussion <Col N="903" /> on his plan.  It was a very creditable thing to do and they deserve high tribute for it especially when you think of an organisation doing so in the teeth of opposition.  Some people protested against the visit.  I had the pleasure of listening to Dr. Mansholt and, like the Minister, I was very interested in what he had to say.  There was a packed audience and if there had been accommodation twice as many would have attended.  People were impressed by what he had to say and the manner in which he said it.  Those who were most critical and who went there to extract any possible information from him were impressed by his very Christian approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>The Mansholt Plan is a concern for and an appreciation of the growing difference there is, a steadily growing difference, in the income of the farming community and of those engaged in other occupations.  Not much is being done to remedy that difference. I put down a question last week which was answered by the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary.  He would not accept that there is a great difference but agreed that the difference is growing. The reply was tantamount to saying that the difference did not exist at all but farmers' income was not improving as much as that of those engaged in other occupations.</P>
    <P>It is well-known, particularly to those who come from dairying areas in Cork and Limerick, that there is a serious problem for the dairying industry. The farmers who suffered loss of income in the past 12 months would welcome an opportunity to compete in an enlarged Community.  That is why great credit is due to Macra na Feirme for giving the farmers an opportunity of seeing what kind of man Mansholt is and hearing what views he has. His aim is to bring up farmers' income to equal that of those engaged in other occupations.  It is my view that farmers have the right to have an income as good as, if not better than, that of those now enjoying a 40 or 45-hour week.  All who have experience of farming realise that a farmer works from 70 to 90 hours every week, particularly a dairy farmer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> The dairy farmer must work seven days a week and particularly in spring-time he must work perhaps 14 or 15 hours a day.  I have experience of this quite near me: where local people are employed in industry, a farmer supplying them with milk finds it impossible to keep a man no matter what he pays because the people to whom he delivers milk enjoy Saturdays and Sundays off while the farmer and his men must work seven days.  People should be rewarded, whether in agriculture or in industry, for the amount of effort, time and energy devoted to their work.  As regards the farming community this is very far from being the position when you had the dairy farmers last year suffering a serious loss of income due to the graded increase in the price of milk.  I shall deal with that later.</P>
    <P>An Foras Talúntais not so long ago issued a report stating that the 30-acre farmer's income was less than £300 per annum and that of the 30-50 acre farmer, £450 per annum.  If this is so&mdash;and the report was produced by a semi-State body giving an unbiased opinion&mdash;it is an appalling situation at this time.  There are some questions I should like to pose to the Minister.  At the moment, farmers have every reason to believe that they are treated by the Government as second class citizens.  On an Adjournment Debate and on the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach I asked this question and so far I am still waiting for an answer.  I want to put the same question to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries now.  We have a situation which is a tragedy. We have a situation in which the farmers are trying to draw the attention of the Government to their plight and on a national scale have to encourage their members to break the law.  Those of us who are close to the farming community deplore the fact that such a situation should arise.</P>
    <P>We all remember the last occasion on which the farmers took to the streets and broke the law.  They came to Leinster House in their hundreds to protest and they were arrested, marched into Black Marias and removed to prison.  Even today there are people outside Leinster House protesting <Col N="905" /> and nobody has interfered with them.  Since the time when the farmers were arrested for protesting outside Leinster House many groups&mdash;some of them pretty contrary groups&mdash;have picketed outside the gates but nobody has touched them.  This is a clear indication that there is one law for the farming community and one law for the rest of the community.  It is understandable, therefore, that the farmers are convinced that they are regarded as second class citizens.</P>
    <P>From time to time we hear statements being made by economists who are not conversant with the situation, or by members of the Government, about the total subsidy given by the State to agriculture.  These statements are completely false and I will deal with them later.  There is this ever-growing barrier of suspicion and hostility, if you like, between the farming and non-farming communities and the reason is that the Government and some pseudo-experts are anxious to project the farming community as parasites on the taxpayers, which of course is completely wrong. From time to time we hear the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary saying that the total agricultural Grant-in-Aid is now approaching £100 million which of course is not true.  It is a distorted picture of what is being provided by the State.  The real figure would be approximately £40 million or £45 million.  This is a very different thing.</P>
    <P>I want to get back now to the implications of EEC membership.  On this side of the House we are convinced that there is no alternative to such membership.  As Deputy Smith said, our natural assets and natural resources will place us in a pretty advantageous position. For example, our natural grass would be the best in Europe; our shorter winter and our better farmers will all be to the advantage of the farming community.  However, before we are accepted as members of the Common Market&mdash;and I thought this debate would hinge around this&mdash;preparations will be necessary in order to be able to avail of the full benefits which will accrue from membership to the agricultural community.  We should have received more information from <Col N="906" /> the Minister about this matter.  It is necessary to modernise production and improve the professional qualifications of those who devote themselves to agriculture. Technical know-how, more information and better agricultural services should be available.</P>
    <P>We should also offer sufficient social guarantees to those farmers who wish to give up farming.  It is the aim of every farmer to try to have a viable holding but this is not possible under the circumstances because where the Land Commission acquire and divide farms and redistribute them then you are reducing the rural population immediately. We should create, as the Minister for Lands suggested some time ago, part-time farmers.  We would have to provide employment for those people who cannot make a living on their small farms.  In a sense it is a pity to see the small farmers going because they were the backbone of the agricultural industry in the past but times have changed and they are changing particularly as far as the farming community is concerned.  They will change more when we get into Europe.</P>
    <P>It is true that we have a lower percentage of small farmers than they have in Europe and we are in a better position to try to create part-time employment for them.  With part-time employment we can create jobs by the decentralisation of industry&mdash;which is something which can not be done overnight but is something which should have been tackled long ago&mdash;through tourism and through an intensified afforestation drive which is long overdue.</P>
    <P>Dr. Mansholt has not in any way indicated in the context of the Common Market what a viable farm is.  This of course, as in every other country in Europe, depends on a number of circumstances. It depends on the type of land you have and on the price of the produce, <i>et cetera,</i> how near you are to industries, and so forth.  In my opinion the fears expressed by some farmers in relation to their farming capacity are not justified; they have nothing to fear under Common Market conditions.</P>
    <P>I also believe that there is a great <Col N="907" /> case to be made at the moment for farmer co-ops.  This is very necessary and they can serve a very useful purpose but it seems to be a very alien concept among our farmers.  I cannot see anything wrong with farmers in an area pooling their resources and working together for the common good.  I have certain fears, however, as far as the other co-ops are concerned.  I know that where you can get this idea of co-operation across to the farming community it can help them in a big way.</P>
    <P>You have the problem of the western counties, and it certainly is a problem, but you will have to have heavier subsidies and the group farming and co-op farming ideas will have to be encouraged as well as more afforestation, tourism and industrial development in those areas.  The Minister and his Department do not appear to have any planned programmes so far as our major industry is concerned and it is time this was changed.  Because of this lack of planning and foresight on the part of the Government, people are moving away from milk production and I can foresee in the near future a serious scarcity of milk.</P>
    <P>I mentioned to the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary not long ago the case of a farmer who had 63 acres of reasonably arable land.  This farmer was milking approximately 49 Friesian cows; he was receiving 4d less per gallon in September, 1970, as compared with September, 1968.  I think the Minister and the Department are confused in their thinking about big milk producers and the big farmers.  Above all else we must encourage our farmers to be efficient but in the instance I have mentioned we can see very clearly that a person who specialised and became efficient was penalised.</P>
    <P>In every instance where a farmer has specialised in milk production it has cost him and the State a considerable amount of money.  Having regard to building costs, labour costs, the provision of milking-parlours with all the necessary fittings, Members will appreciate that the total cost is extremely high.  We should encourage farmers who have modernised their holdings to stay in milk production because I am convinced that milk prices must be <Col N="908" /> increased.  In two years time there will be such a scarcity that milk will command a high price on the European market.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that our butter stocks are completely depleted and that quite recently we could not supply the British market with this commodity because we had not sufficient stocks.  I would strongly recommend to the Minister that serious consideration be given to increasing the income of the milk producers because they have a genuine grievance.  I realise that a Minister may not be applauded by everyone for the initial actions he takes but the long-term interests of the people must be the first consideration and milk producers are in urgent need of some assistance.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, unless he makes a statement on this matter in the not too distant future, this industry will suffer to a considerable extent because the farmers will not continue for another season as they have done in the past.  The Minister made a case &mdash;probably with some justification&mdash; that the income of the small farmers and small producers must be improved, and nobody will quarrel with this. While I would not force a farmer out of any line of production in which he chooses to engage, there is no time for the small milk producer.  Quality milk is an essential and the small farmer will find it very difficult to meet the very high costs involved and, while I would not force any person out of milk production, I think the small milk producer should be encouraged to diversify into another line.  Something should be done in this direction; perhaps it might be stocking his farmyard with breeding sows or improving and modernising his farmyard.  The day is long gone when the farmer will drive three miles to the creamery each morning with the milk of six or eight cows and return when half of the day is over and for that reason we must provide some alternative for the small milk producer.</P>
    <P>There has been a difference of opinion on these questions within the Government.  About nine or ten months ago the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Blaney, had discussions and <Col N="909" /> consultations for approximately three weeks with the farming organisations. At that time Deputy Blaney said that it would cost £14 million to bring the income of the farming community into line with those in other occupations. The cost of living has increased since then and production costs, so far as the farmers are concerned, have rocketed. The cost of machinery and labour has soared but the farming community have not been provided with this £14 million which Deputy Blaney considered necessary.  Whatever may be said about Deputy Blaney, nobody will laud him as being very much in sympathy with the farming community but he could see this discrepancy.  Our major industry is getting a raw deal from the Government and nothing has been done to bridge the gap between the income of the farmers and that of other sections of the community.</P>
    <P>We should encourage farmers to engage in co-operative marketing because this would be very much in their interest.  For example, the marts are providing a useful service and if farmers wish to improve their living conditions they must in the future act on these lines.  Some of the older farmers are inclined to the old traditional structure of production but I think there is a change of attitude among the farming community.  This change has been brought about by Macra na Feirme and the young farmers' organisations.  However, the Government should give more encouragement to farmers to give greater attention to the co-operative movement.</P>
    <P>Certain groups and organisations in this country have condemned the purchase of land by non-nationals, and rightly so.  There is a fair amount of control and the situation is not as bad as people believe it to be.  However, there is also the problem not of non-nationals but of certain groups purchasing land.  I know of one co-operative which has continued to buy up all the land available in an area. There should be a limit to the amount of land any society may purchase.  If this were brought to a logical conclusion this country would end up with ranchers, and societies and co-operative groups would control most of the <Col N="910" /> land.  The Minister should exercise some control.  There is the Agricultural Institute, and I know of one co-operative society and AI station in my own area who have 400 to 500 acres of land. They have taken all the land available both for conacre and for sale in the area.  This has incensed many small farmers because a farmer who is anxious to provide a farm for his son has only a certain amount of capital and cannot compete against such societies with unlimited resources.</P>
    <P>For many years this country has exported dairy produce, particularly butter, and as far back as 1880 we exported 536 cwts of butter.  In its long history the dairying and creamery industry had to examine its structure, and even at this stage I believe it is necessary to have another look at this industry.  It must be rationalised.  I believe there is a crisis upon us, because if we are to compete and get the full benefits of membership of the Common Market we cannot afford to have creameries and processing factories carrying inflated costs and inflated overheads.  At the moment there is a difference of between 2d and 3d a gallon in the amount paid for milk by various creameries.  The Dairy Disposal Board have provided creameries in areas where a co-operative could not get off the ground but, be that as it may, the time has come when, rather than the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries handing the responsibility over to some group or board, he himself should take action immediately. There is no point in having efficiency on the farm and in production unless the creameries and processing plants are efficient in regard to transport and everything else.</P>
    <P>We had occasion to call on the Minister's predecessor in the Department with different groups who were trying to get permission from him to amalgamate creameries.  Every time we went to the Minister we were told the matter was in the hands of some board or some group who were supposed to report on the structure of the creamery industry.  The present Minister has brought about a change, and I am glad this has happened.  However, this should have happened a long time ago. <Col N="911" /> If that happened the farmers would have had a better income and those in my area would have got a better price for their milk in the past 12 months, because they would not be contributing to the inflated overheads and the inflated costs that small creameries have to carry.</P>
    <P>Since 1962 there have been at least four reports on the creamery industry.</P>
    <P>There was the report of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in February 1963; the IAOS report in 1962; the Knapp report in 1963; and the Cooke and Spragge report in 1968. All these reports had one recommendation in common, that the creamery industry should be rationalised, that there was no place for the small uneconomic unit.  In reply to questions I put down here as a result of pressure being brought to bear on me by creamery societies, creamery managers and farmers generally, I was told a social study group had been set up to examine the social aspect of rationalisation.  I never heard such nonsense in all my life.  I know jobs were created for some people.  People were appointed to the social study group.  I do not know if they ever met or reported to the Minister, but it was purely a delaying tactic because pressure was being brought to bear on the Minister and on his predecessor in this connection, and somebody's future would have been jeopardised. However, the interest of the farming community did not matter.</P>
    <P>This kind of thing must stop.  There is no justification for having five reports and waiting from 1962 until 1971 before action is taken.  Such delay is to the detriment of the farming community.  I have seen returns from at least three different creameries and I have seen a variation in price, as I say, of between 2d and 3d per gallon.  I have checked this myself and if the Minister has any doubt in that regard I can supply him with the information.  What incenses farmers is to see their neighbours getting an extra twopence or threepence a gallon just because they go to a different creamery.  The Department are dilly dallying about making a decision because they are afraid <Col N="912" /> of treading on the toes of some influential people in the organisation, but they should have the courage to do it.  Farmers are under the impression that the Minister and his officials are living in an ivory tower.  I know this is not correct but this is the impression the farmers have.  Any time I have contacted the Minister or his officials I have always been received courteously and had my problems listened to.  That is not the case with the farming community. They have lost confidence in the Minister and his Department.  The go-slow tactics of the Department have dampened their enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in days gone by the pig and bacon industry provided a living for the small farming community.  It has now been taken over by big concerns.  In my own area there are three co-ops and only one of them is controlled by farmers.  Millers and professional people are involved in pig fattening co-ops.  This means there is a greater flow of capital in the area and the people rearing the bonhams will benefit.  However, when large grants are being paid there is a great danger that these co-ops will buy anything up to 1,000 sows and supply their own bonhams to the factory. There is nothing to stop them doing this but it would be a retrograde step. The Minister should keep an eye on this situation because these people are being paid colossal grants, at the State's expense.  I would not like to see this happen to people who are making a good living out of rearing bonhams and selling them at the 12 or 13 week stage, but there is a danger that it might unless the situation is watched closely.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to undertake an immediate examination of the system of differential rents, particularly relation to the hardship and injustices caused by the implementation of the B scale in Dublin.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy O'Connell).</P>
    <Col N="913" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Those Deputies who have spoken on this motion are completely out of touch with the situation which exists.  Whatever rent structure is employed it will not be perfect. During the years I served on Dublin Corporation a series of motions were placed before the corporation asking for modifications to be made to the existing system.</P>
      <P>The differential rent system was introduced by Dublin Corporation in 1950 and ratified by the Minister for Local Government, who was a member of the coalition Government.  It was found difficult to modify and change the system once it was established. The system has been condemned by Deputy Dr. Browne who speaks in a different tone from other members of the Labour Party.  He is against this system although he tolerates it, but other Members of the Labour Party have different views.</P>
      <P>The differential rent system ensures that families with low incomes or no incomes have accommodation as good as those in receipt of larger incomes. In my time I have placed five resolutions before Dublin Corporation asking them to modify this scheme.  I did this because I was aware that there were injustices in some cases.  These motions were continually defeated by the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party who had the majority at that time. This shows that at a time when modification could have taken place no modification did take place.  The manager indicated that if the system of differential rents were modified the pool of finances which he received from the existing system would be reduced and increases would have to be made to offset these reductions.  Members of the council failed to have the matter fully examined because they felt there would be increases in some sections.  However, concessions, which were not reductions, were given in certain cases but there was no alteration in the structure, and people are now saying something is wrong with the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An attempt is being made here to have the entire rents structure re-examined so as to bring about a situation where the flat rate tenants and the A scale differential rent tenants will <Col N="914" /> have their rents modified and, indeed, substantially increased.  I want the Minister to ensure that those people who contracted on a flat rent basis with the corporation many years ago will not have their rents altered because of modifications in either the differential rent system or the flat rent system.  These people have paid the increases sought by the city manager and authorised by the Minister.  These were legitimate increases for repairs and other factors which were taken into consideration at the time.</P>
    <P>Some people seem to think that those living in Drimnagh, Ballyfermot, Cabra and Kimmage are paying rents which are too low.  These people have long standing agreements and I would ask the Minister to ensure that these agreements, which have been in operation for many years, will not be altered in any way by any motion in this House.  I would ask furthermore that the A scale tenants who have paid A scale rents when, at times, it was difficult to pay them, should not have these rents altered.  I would not like to see a rehash of the rent structure of corporation houses because I feel an injustice would be done to people who have paid their way over the years.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the entire system of differential rents should be altered.  The question of rent assessment has also been brought up.  It may be that local authority officials and local authorities themselves are not offering the best service for reporting alterations in incomes.  I suggested, as did many other members of the city council, that local inquiry offices be established to deal not only with problems of differential rents but with problems of repairs and other matters related to the local authority and to the health authority.  I suggested that these offices at which inquiries could be made without bringing people into the centre of the city should be established certainly in the larger built-up areas.  There is an attempt now to establish offices in some areas but the local authority organisation would benefit very much from the establishment of more of these offices.  There are difficulties if people must travel to the centre of the city to have a quick assessment made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> On the other hand, assessments are not made on the basis suggested by some speakers.  A person who wants to have his rent altered at shorter periods than the yearly period can have that facility from Dublin Corporation.  If he opts to have his rent assessed on a quarterly basis that indicates that he is prepared to submit on a quarterly basis the necessary forms required for any alteration in the assessment.  I have heard no complaint from people who wanted their rent altered and who opted to have it altered on a three-monthly basis, a six-monthly basis or even on a monthly basis.  I have not heard that they had any difficulty in getting this facility and they had no objection to presenting themselves with the necessary documentation to support their claims.  One speaker said that people are dragged down to the rent office in Jervis Street.  This is completely erroneous.  The staff in Jervis Street are courteous and efficient. Sometimes they make mistakes, like all of us, but on the whole they do a reasonably good job and treat people with courtesy.  Some people are difficult to deal with; some officials are difficult to deal with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept that there are difficulties on both sides and a reluctance sometimes on one side not to divulge the full facts.  On some occasions the corporation officials are in possession of facts about which the tenant thinks they are ignorant.  For that reason there may be confusion and there may be complaints made which cannot stand up to examination.</P>
      <P>The question of rents has been confused with the addition for central heating.  Central heating is separate from the rent assessment.  If central heating were not there the tenants themselves would have to heat their flats and provide the necessary warmth for their families and themselves, possibly at a greater cost than that which the corporation charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where central heating is not provided one finds cold dwellings where the people fail to live up to their responsibilities and the unfortunate children <Col N="916" /> have to spend many hours in misery. This does not happen in the modern accommodation provided by the corporation. There is an inclusive charge. It is no greater than the tenants would have to pay in order to heat their homes.  The fact that the children have these facilities has been praised by tenants who have come from dismal unheated dwellings.  People who have suffered in unheated dwellings can see that their children are able to study as they were not able to do in the past. They have no objection whatever to paying for the heat.  It has been mentioned that heating is not available all the year round.  It is true that there is an off period, but during the off period hot water and other facilities are available. It is all costed on a yearly basis and then there is a weekly contribution fixed for heating.  It may happen in time that central boiler houses will be discontinued and individuals may be able to regulate their own central heating as is the case in some corporation dwellings.</P>
    <P>There has been much confusion in what has been said in relation to family income, rent assessment and the officials of the corporation.  In many cases these officials, who are doing a good job in difficult circumstances, have been subjected to severe criticism here.  I have made it my business in recent times to go into the corporation.  I have seen the way they have reconstructed the section which deals with differential rent assessments and people have complete privacy and are given every chance to explain their cases fully.   Anyone who would accuse the officials of the corporation of harassing the people at this stage is not being fair.  These people are employed by the corporation to do a job and there is no reason why there should be such criticism of them.  Far too much criticism has been levelled against Irish workers and local authority workers from time to time without further criticism now being levelled by some members of the Labour Party against Dublin corporation employees. It is deplorable that this particular type of criticism&mdash;criticism of their fellow workers&mdash;should come from members of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Some of the problems arise from the attitude of the people who are seeking <Col N="917" /> assessment.  Perhaps they misunderstand the situation.  Perhaps the corporation have not provided the necessary material to indicate when and how their rents can be changed.  Change is certainly necessary in some aspects of the rents office.  Possibly the introduction of a tenants' handbook would eliminate some of the misunderstanding, and much of it is misunderstanding, in relation to incomes.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the concealment of income.  Responsible tenants will always indicate that if everyone paid his fair share there would be no problems.  They know that there are many people who are not fully meeting their responsibilities and so it falls on other people to subsidise them.  If everyone in a corporation dwelling met his responsibilities I am sure all the tenants would be satisfied and possibly might have their rents reduced.</P>
    <P>I visited Ballymun some time ago with the Minister when he examined the flats and examined the complaints which he had received here in the House.  He discussed the rent situation with the tenants there.  The tenants fully accepted the situation except for the fact that they felt there were people on the same landing as themselves who were not fully meeting their responsibilities but who had a better income than they had.  Wherever there is a differential rent system it causes discontent when people know that their neighbour is getting away with something. The only way this can be rectified is by having further inquiries made by additional inquiry officers.  I do not suggest we should have more inquiry officers but I do feel that when everyone meets his responsibilities there will be a better climate among the tenants and less of the distrust which exists at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that a small section is causing discontent and there is discontent among certain tenants but it is not for the reasons stated by members of the Opposition.   It is difficult to pick out each particular injustice and there are possibly injustices within any system but the corporation have gone a long way to remedy them.  There has been no major change in the scheme but nevertheless there has been a suggestion <Col N="918" /> going throughout the city that certain people here want to see a complete reorganisation of the rental structure. They want to see the rent of the flat rent tenants increased.</P>
    <P>There are many of these flat rent tenants in my area and I want to ensure here and now that flat rent tenants will not be disturbed because over the years they met their responsibilities in full. They are good tenants.  Many of them have since purchased their own houses. Some are not in that fortunate position and are still availing of this rent structure on which they have paid for so long.  Many of them entered the houses in the early thirties at a time when it was difficult to meet the rental requirement, low as it was.  The same thing applies to the A scale tenants in the Drimnagh and Ballyfermot area. I want to ensure also that their rent structure will not be altered.  It is the stated desire of the city manager that an alteration in the rent structure must yield the same amount when concessions are given.  While he will take it off one section, he will add it on somewhere else.</P>
    <P>If an authority are operating on the basis that certain works must be carried out and certain things must be done, then they require a certain amount of money.  If any section of the tenants are to suffer as a result of pressure being brought by a Labour Party resolution, the Minister will have a number of other Deputies to deal with in this House.  I would ask him to ensure that the Labour Party motion will not be accepted and that, if alterations are necessary in the rent structure, the local authority will deal with them on a realistic basis.</P>
    <P>When I was a member of a local authority I put down a number of motions on differential rents because at that time the rent structure in the Ballyfermot and Drimnagh areas was high in comparison with the flat rent scale that was in operation in other areas.  I did not get much support from some of the people who are loud now in their condemnation of the system. As I said, the system was introduced by the Labour Party in Dublin Corporation and whatever ills or disturbances have flowed from it are their responsibility.</P>

      <P>I should like to explain that last week I made an arrangement with the city manager, who agreed in principle, for the establishment of a special office in Ballymun and to have an officer in attendance there at times during the day and also between 7 and 9 o'clock at night to enable tenants to come and discuss rent matters, and particularly assessments of rent.  The office will provide a service to the tenants which will not be confined to rent matters. It will cover other matters which arise and for which the corporation are responsible.  This is being done as a pilot project and, if it is found to be successful, we can consider extending this type of service further throughout the city to the large housing areas.  I hope that the establishment of this office will help to eliminate some of the misunderstandings and misconceptions which have arisen in relation to rent matters and that it will help tenants to understand more fully their own rights and, indeed, their responsibilities in relation to the tenancies of these corporation houses.</P>

      <P>I want to raise a few points in reply to this motion.  The Minister said that he was not personally aware of any burning hardship. He also said that the fears of the tenants are false and are based on rumour.  There were protests parades, public meetings, demonstrations, the withholding of rents and rates in Dublin, Waterford, Limerick, Cork, Youghal, Midleton, Fermoy, Drogheda, Dundalk, Wexford, Cavan, Kilkenny and other areas, and how can the Minister in all honesty say the people are satisfied?</P>
      <P>At the annual general meeting of the National Association of Tenants' Organisation, there was unanimous agreement in condemning the system of differential rents which has operated since the enactment of the Housing Act, 1966.  There were 70 tenant associations from all parts of Ireland represented at that meeting.  Where does the Minister get the assurance that the tenants are satisfied with the scheme? I think the Minister is being less than honest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble stems from the Housing Act of 1966.  The Minister said that in cases where it can be proved that hardship is suffered he will eliminate that hardship, but he has dismissed the valid grievances of these tenants who were represented by their organisations.</P>
      <P>The Cork city manager was very honest when he said that he was satisfied that these charges can inflict hardship on families in these areas.  He also said that the abatements suggested will, to some extent, alleviate this hardship. I suggest that the Minister should get the views of other local authority managers on the existence of hardship, hardship which he says does not exist.</P>
      <P>At the commencement of the debate on this motion I said&mdash;and the Minister very wisely chose to ignore it&mdash;that the manager and the Minister have the ultimate decision in the introduction of a differential rent system and the elected representatives have no power to alter the decision.  The Minister made no comment on that.  I said they could increase the rent each year and ignore the elected representatives.  The manager has power to revise the maximum and minimum scheme whenever he thinks fit.  Therefore, if a tenant goes in on an agreement, it is a one-sided contract.  They can revise, or alter, or increase it, and the tenant has no say in the matter.  Such an agreement is not a contract when it can be altered without the tenant's permission.</P>
      <P>Every member of the family is assessed for rent purposes.  If a son or daughter has more money coming in than the father he or she is technically the tenant.  The assessment for overtime, bonus, shift work, is double taxation. They are taxed under PAYE and they are also taxed by Dublin Corporation.  This is doubly unfair.  The Minister said the rent can be as low as 1s to 5s, but I say this is farcical. I challenge him to produce one receipt for 1s to 5s from a Dublin Corporation tenant, even one receipt.</P>

A tenant has a right to an inter-transfer if he feels like it but, unless that inter-transfer is approved by the city medical officer because of severe overcrowding or on medical grounds, they both go on the new scale.  Deputy Dowling's contention is fallacious in circumstances like that.  He says no one on a fixed income can be on a differential rent. That is a lie.

      <P>The Gestapo forces are being employed to check with neighbours.  It is nothing short of the Gestapo methods used during the Hitler regime.  It is a disgrace and that is why we want a revision.  I have seen cases of attempted suicide because women were afraid to face those people.  &ldquo;Bring down the husbands,&rdquo; they say.  I have shown the grievances and I think there is sufficient to warrant an investigation.  Here is a Minister who has shown himself to be progressive. He has not been a Minister for very long but from the beginning he has said he has taken an interest in differential rents.  We in the Labour Party ask him not to put this to a vote.  Let him say, &ldquo;There are grounds for it; let us have an independent inquiry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling knows quite well there are dissatisfied tenants.  The Minister says that if I can show him half a dozen cases he will act on it. I can point out 50 cases.  I am asking him to set up an investigation.  To that investigation should be called representatives of the tenants, the social workers involved in these arrears of rent, inter-transfer cases, sociologists, all the other people involved.  It would not cost a lot of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a letter from Dublin Corporation <Col N="923" /> today which stated that the A Scale applied originally after 1966 to houses let on or after 1961.  That was changed in 1967 and the corporation then said that the B Scale, the really rough scale, would be applied to houses let after 1954.  The people are dissatisfied and they are entitled to some satisfaction.  If, after investigation, it can be shown that nothing <Col N="924" /> is wrong, I will be satisfied.  At the moment, however, I ask the Minister to say: &ldquo;Look, I will examine this; we will set up an independent body to examine all aspects of it to see what can be done to remedy any injustices.&rdquo; I have shown that there are injustices and I suggest that the Minister, a progressive man, should be most anxious to remedy them.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to hold a public inquiry for the following purposes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  to examine the causes giving rise to the increase by building societies in mortgage interest rates for existing borrowers;</P>
      <P>(2)  to report on the claimed need for increases and whether and when such increases can be reduced;</P>
      <P>(3)  to recommend the measures necessary to be taken to reduce interest rates or otherwise to ease the burden for borrowers if the increased rates are necessary;</P>
      <P>(4)  to examine and report on the adequacy of the present methods of financing house purchase by building societies, insurance companies and other sources, and recommend what steps should be taken to increase the flow of private funds for housing purposes; and that the inquiry be concluded on items (1) to (3) in six months and on item (4) within 12 months from its inception;</P>
      <P>and Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, pending the inquiry, increases in mortgage interest rates should not be permitted.</P>
      <P>This motion was tabled in my name and in the names of Deputies Patrick Donegan and Richie Ryan.  Like many other motions, it has been on the Order Paper for a long time.  The delay in taking motions of this kind is caused solely by the failure of the Government so to order the business of this House that motions can be taken within a reasonable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time this motion was put down there was absolute turmoil and uproar among people who had borrowed money from the building societies and who were faced with a substantial increase in their annual repayments.  If my recollection is correct, there were two increases in the interest rates charged by building societies in very rapid succession so that people who had borrowed money from the societies suffered two shocks <Col N="926" /> within a short period of time.  It is, I think, fair to say that probably the biggest single transaction in the lives of most people is the purchase of a house.  They examine very carefully whether or not they are likely to be able to carry this burden and meet the commitments involved.  For some reason there was no increase over a number of years in the rate of interest on money borrowed from building societies and I believe people had begun to think that they had borrowed money at a fixed rate of interest, a rate of interest that would not change from the day on which they entered into the commitment until they made the last payment.  They budgeted for a certain annual outlay, the outlay they met in the first year of the commitment.  For a number of years there had been no increase and the impression was created, therefore, that the rate was a fixed rate.  Added to that, they saw their neighbours borrowing from local authorities through the Local Loans Fund and they knew that borrowings from this source carried a fixed rate of interest and those entering into a commitment in this particular way knew exactly where they stood from the day they set out to pay for their house until the day the last payment was made on that house.</P>
    <P>Some people were in the fortunate position of borrowing money from building societies at a very low rate of interest, 5 per cent, or possibly less.  If my recollection is correct, their rate of interest was jumped from that to 8 per cent or 8½ per cent.  This is where the big grievance arises.  More recent borrowers had not to suffer this type of increase.  On a loan of £3,500 from a building society the increase in the rate of interest represents an extra £35 a year.  This is quite a substantial increase and I certainly saw every reason for the uproar when the increase was made.  People were finding it difficult in other directions to meet their commitments and this extra sum was placed on them without any warning whatever.  It was more than they were able to take lying down.  There were protests.  There were deputations to the Minister.  I am glad to see Deputy Foley here because he took a very <Col N="927" /> keen interest in this at the time&mdash;we were approaching a general election &mdash;and I think he gave public assurances that he would have this wrong put right; he was going to ensure that those aggrieved would have their grievance examined.  We had a similar assurance from the Minister for Local Government at the time; he was, in fact, going to inquire into the whole business to see what concessions building societies were getting and whether the increases being sought were justified.  We never heard the outcome of that inquiry.  In fact, we never heard if the inquiry was ever held.  Some of us believe it was so much eye-wash for the people at the time.  Nothing was, in fact, done.</P>
    <P>When I make these statements I am not to be taken as attacking the building societies.  People were entitled to have the position aired and clarified and the Minister for Local Government at the time had the responsibility to let the people know how these increases arose and whether they were justified.  That was not done. They were told this inquiry was under way and that the Minister would do everything possible to ensure that, if an increase were made, it was fully justified. We have no evidence that anything was ever done.</P>
    <P>The increase was a shocking blow. I do not think the building societies should have been allowed to increase anybody's rate of interest by as much as 3½ per cent; 1 per cent might have been legitimate.  An increase of 3½ per cent was outrageous.  I know that building societies can make the case that those who had to pay this enormous increase were lucky because they had reached the point at which they must have had their houses nearly paid for and they were fortunate in that interest rates initially had cost them very little by comparison with the cost on borrowers today.  Of course, all other costs have gone up, but here is something absolutely vitally essential, a roof over people's heads; it is something they must have if they are to get married and rear families.  They must get the money necessary to purchase their houses at the lowest possible rate of interest.</P>
    <P>The building societies make the case <Col N="928" />&mdash;it is understandable&mdash;that unless they are prepared to pay a competitive rate of interest on deposits they will not get deposits.  With this we must agree, but we have seen a time reached at which building societies are looking around for things in which to invest their surplus money.  They have got more than enough money.  This is something that should be examined.  Unfortunate borrowers got no enlightenment as to how or why these increases were taking place.  The Minister for Local Government at the time pretended to show an interest; had he been really sincere he would have held an inquiry and he would have told people that they would have the result of that inquiry at a certain date.  He did not do that.</P>
    <P>The first clause in this motion calls on the Government to examine the causes giving rise to the increase by building societies in mortgage interest rates for existing borrowers.  This is emphasised because new borrowers know the commitment into which they are entering and they enter it with their eyes open.  The confusion that existed in the minds of those who borrowed at what they thought was a fixed rate of interest and the actual flat rate of interest in borrowing by another means gave rise to a great deal of the trouble.</P>
    <P>Clause (2) calls on the Government to report on the claimed need for increases and whether and when such increases can be reduced.  Did anyone ever hear of a society reducing rates? If, in the morning, bank rates dropped, would the building societies reduce the rate of interest they are charging? Replying on their behalf, I say they would not.  They have never been known to reduce rates of interest. Surely this matter calls for investigation and for the establishment of a certain procedure, a procedure to be laid down by the Minister since the building societies enjoy certain concessions. Surely, from that point of view alone, there should be some control over the way they regulate and order their business.  If we had a full public inquiry it would lead to a much greater understanding on the part of the borrowing public as to whether or not they were getting a fair deal, so to speak, and whether it was possible to give them a better one.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> Clause (3) recommends the measures necessary to be taken to reduce interest rates or otherwise to ease the burden for borrowers if the interest rates are necessary.</P>
    <P>There is an admission in this paragraph of the Motion that if this investigation was made it could be shown by the building societies that these increases were in fact necessary but that there was serious doubt in the minds of the borrowers and they were not in a position to probe it themselves and they got no assistance to do so.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the increase in the rates I had a long letter from a borrower who told me that when the increases came about he wrote to his building society protesting and said he would not pay the increases.  He heard no more.  He went on paying the old rate which was accepted by the society in question.  He then wrote a letter asking when he would reach the final payment.  He got no reply and after writing a few times, I think, he threatened to send a solicitor's letter. He then got a reply to the effect that he would never reach the end of the road, that he was only meeting the interest and that there was no element of sinking fund in what he was paying. I think I passed this to the Minister for Local Government at the time and I think he told me it was not his responsibility, that it was for Industry and Commerce, and I sent it to Industry and Commerce.  I got no satisfactory reply from any source and there was nothing I could do to redress this man's grievance.  He could go on as long as he lived, and his ancestors could continue paying this money but neither he nor they would ever repay the debt originally incurred.  These are things that should not occur and building societies should not be allowed to let them occur.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To recommend the measures necessary to reduce interest rates ...&rdquo; If such an investigation indicated that it was not possible for the building societies to go on operating and make reasonable profits on their work, serious thought should be given by the Government to ways and means of bringing interest rates within the ability of the people to meet these commitments. <Col N="930" /> There is nothing unusual about this: it is done in other countries; interest rates are subsidised.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation, for instance, is now lending many millions annually at substantially subsidised rates of interest and at fixed rates. There is no change in rate from the day the money is borrowed until it is repaid.  Is there any reason why this could not and should not be done for people anxious to build and own their own houses?  Surely nothing is more essential than a roof over one's head?  There should be subsidised rates of interest for people anxious to own their own houses.  If this were done properly we could have a sliding scale of interest rates for people with various incomes and in this way you might shorten very considerably the list of applicants for local authority houses. In the long run the Government might not lose very much money.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any Minister has taken his responsibility in this respect sufficiently seriously.  They have allowed things to drift in regard to housing finance and no serious thought has been given to whether or not there is a better way of meeting this enormous burden.  That is what it means in many cases for people who have to make repayments, those fortunate enough to qualify to borrow.  That is the first obstacle; they must be accepted and must produce all the proofs that they will be able to make the repayments.  This is an enormous burden.  There are people paying £500 a year in repayments at present and some considerably more.  There are people paying less for smaller loans. The whole question of building finance at present is really a farce, particularly in regard to borrowings from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>We now have a situation in Dublin County Council where the applications are reduced by more than half mainly because a loan of £3,000 now is no good to anybody.  Houses are costing £4,500 or £5,000.  Where will the extra £2,000 come from?  Who is in a position to save it?  I believe that the person who is in the happy position of having an income sufficient to enable him to save £2,000 does not need a loan from a local authority and should <Col N="931" /> be able to meet his commitments through a building society.</P>
    <P>There has been no effective increase in grants for many years because of the increase in costs imposed by Government taxation on houses.  The Minister raises his eyebrows; he never heard of such a thing as the wholesale tax; he never heard it admitted in this House that that put at least another £150 on to the cost of a house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course not.  I appreciate that.  Timber for all the various purposes, windows, doors, floors and roofing is the big item but we also have tiles and so on.  It has been freely admitted that the turnover tax has added £150 to the price of a house and if you deduct this from grants that have been very slightly increased, you can easily see that there has been no effective increase in grants for many years.  Therefore, there has been no increase for many years in assistance to people trying to buy their own houses. This is another reason and a very good reason why we should have a careful look at housing finances and the difficulties people meet before first of all they can get acceptance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then you have the question of the valuing of the house and the system of valuing houses.  You have the selling price which is one thing and you have what it would make on the market if you put it up but the council's valuer has a different idea and when he is valuing the house for loan purposes he downgrades the house very much so that instead of getting, say, an 80 per cent loan a person gets nothing like that because of the way in which the value of the house has been lowered. The building societies, generally speaking, give about 75 per cent&mdash;a better valuation, let us admit it.  The building societies normally put a higher valuation on houses than do the local authorities. <Col N="932" /> The usual thing there is 75 per cent.  In certain instances where they cannot go wrong the societies will go as high as 90 per cent where perhaps an insurance company steps in and there is a bond to ensure that there will not be any loss of payments.  Then the larger amount can be secured.  Those who cannot get this concession have to look for money from other sources to try to meet the deposit.  It is an enormous headache for many people.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has done any local authority work in the Dublin region is quite familiar with the difficulties with which people are confronted when they decide to buy their own house; having secured the borrowing facilities they know what the commitment means and are aware of the millstone they have put around their necks.  Therefore, there is a very strong case&mdash;and I do not think any Minister for Local Government has ever tried to face up to this&mdash;for the subsidising of interest rates, subsidising them on a sliding scale for the various income groups. Another thing that has operated very much against people being able to buy their own houses is the fact that there has been no adjustment in the upper age limit for qualifying for loans.  The limit has been left there as it is for years and years and it is quite unrealistic at present.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with clause (3) mainly on the plea that the interest rates here for this type of borrowing are completely and absolutely excessive. I hope the Minister will intervene in this debate and tell the House why it is possible to borrow money for farming purposes at subsidised rates of interest&mdash;which I entirely favour&mdash;and why the same facility is not available to people buying their own houses.</P>
    <P>Clause (4) of this motion states:</P>
    <P>... to examine and report on the adequacy of the present methods of financing house purchase by building societies, insurance companies and other sources&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;other sources&rdquo; I suppose covers quite a wide field and includes borrowing through the local authority from the Local Loans Fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and recommend what steps should be taken to increase the flow of <Col N="933" /> private funds for housing purposes; and that the inquiry be concluded on items (1) to (3) in six months&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Of course, it is some 18 months ago since this motion was tabled and certainly that is out of date&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and on item (4) within 12 months from its inception;</P>
    <P>That was giving a reasonable period within which this whole extremely important matter of housing finance could be gone into by the Minister and the Department.  I am quite satisfied that on any fair assessment of the situation we would not just let the position drift as it has been drifting over the years.  Before this discussion ends we might be told whether the inquiry promised by Deputy Foley and by the then Minister ever took place and what was found as a result of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The motion covers a very wide field of investigation; it is left deliberately open and worded in such a way that no aspect of the whole field of housing finance could not be investigated. One appreciates the hardships suffered by people, first of all, in their efforts to borrow money, and then having borrowed it, their efforts to meet these commitments, not knowing to what heights interest rates will rocket in the period during which they have to meet their repayments and it is extremely desirable that ways and means be found to overcome this fluctuating rate of interest.  Even the building societies could find a way.  I know they can say that they are borrowing money at the going rates and that if they are to remain viable and if they are to continue getting money they must charge the going rates, but if it is possible for the Agricultural Credit Corporation to operate on the basis of fixed interest rates, and also to have this element of subsidisation, then there is no reason why housing finance should not be dealt with in the same way.</P>
    <P>It would be a great source of happiness, if I could put it that way, to people who have to get this sort of money if they knew everything possible was being done to ease the burden on them, but there is very little evidence that anybody is seriously <Col N="934" /> grappling with the problem which is an enormous one for many people.  I hope the Minister will take a serious look at this motion which has been on the Order Paper for a very long time and which should have been discussed much earlier.  It is always easy to put matters of this kind on the long finger and certainly the question of housing finance and the difficulties confronting people have been left on the long finger for far too long.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give his views on the whole system of finding money for house building and also on the problems facing people who are anxious to build their own houses.  I am one of those who believe that ownership is very important, that the maximum number of people should be enabled without undue hardship to own their own homes and that they should be able, without endangering their health or the health of their families, to meet the commitments involved in the purchase of houses.  The deposits which now have to be found are simply fantastic and the outlay required to meet these commitments is also enormous.  So far there has been very little evidence of sympathy from any source for these people.  It is overdue that sympathetic consideration be given to this matter.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my party I support this motion.  I put numerous questions regarding the increases by building societies to a former Member of this House when he was Minister for Local Government. When I asked questions about the authorisation for the increase of interest rates I was told it no longer came under the Minister for Industry and Commerce but that it had been passed over to the Minister for Local Government. I was assaulted later outside this Chamber for daring to question the Minister for Local Government on the increase in building society rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought building societies were established for the purpose of providing money for working class people to purchase houses.  I did not understand <Col N="935" /> that the societies were making vast profits and that they were merely large commercial concerns who bombard the public night after night with their television advertisements.  The amount they spend on advertising alone must be fantastic.</P>
    <P>Under the present interest rates charged by the building societies a person who purports to buy his own house will never own it in his lifetime and anyone who borrows from the building societies at the present time can give up any idea of ever seeing the deeds of his house again.  I am speaking now about a young man who has obtained the deposit and who gets a loan from the society.  Therefore, we must ask the question; what is the purpose of having building societies?</P>
    <P>I have already brought to the attention of the House the fact that building societies are lending money for purposes other than house purchase.  The then Minister for Industry and Commerce, now I think the Minister for External Affairs, said there was not a significant number of such cases that he could bring to our attention.  We were promised this inquiry as a result of harassing the Minister for Local Government but the inquiry was merely to put us off.  Of course, we were remiss in not pursuing the matter further but we now take the Minister at his word that he will hold an inquiry and that there will be a result.  He told us that he called the heads of the building societies together but that he could do nothing in the matter other than to have this inquiry.</P>
    <P>At one time people on low incomes were in a position to buy their houses. However, these increases were suddenly announced without any warning and the people concerned became most alarmed when they found that their income would not permit them to pay the increased rates.  I spoke to some people who wondered if they would be allowed to rent out a room in their house to help meet the extra charges but under the terms of purchase through the building society they are not allowed to do this.</P>
    <P>The building societies get special tax concessions from the Government.  By virtue of this fact they have a certain <Col N="936" /> responsibility.  They are able to obtain a vast amount of money on deposit and not only are they assured of the interest rates but they control the fire and theft policies on the house and in addition they insist on the applicant taking out an insurance policy through their own agent.  They control all these matters because the person who is seeking the loan will willingly go along with the society in order to ensure that his application for a loan is successful.</P>
    <P>I have also found out that a person with a normal income has no hope of getting a loan from the building society. At the present time the applicant must have an income of approximately £40 per week before he will be considered eligible for a loan.  I notice that the building societies are seeking more concessions with regard to tax.  If they operate on their present commercial scale, purely from the profit motive, I do not consider they are entitled to any rebate whatever.  On behalf of my party I suggest that we nationalise the building societies or, alternatively, that the Government should set up a national building society.  It should go into competition with the building societies, obtain deposits and grant loans for houses.  Having regard to the enormous profits made by the building societies, I think a Government-sponsored building society would be able to offer loans to people at realistic rates of interest.</P>
    <P>The motion we are discussing suggests that a public inquiry be held in order &ldquo;to examine and report on the adequacy of the present methods of financing house purchase by building societies, insurance companies and other sources&rdquo;.  I do not think our Irish insurance companies are playing their proper role in helping to finance house purchase.  I found that many of my constituents who wished to obtain loans were not able to get them from Irish insurance companies.  That is not good enough when those Irish companies get so many concessions as compared with the foreign companies.  However, it is obvious that Irish companies are in a position to invest vast amounts of money in office blocks throughout the city.  Not 200 yards away from this House one can see an office block of <Col N="937" /> gigantic proportions which is financed by an Irish insurance company.</P>
    <P>The onus is on Irish insurance companies to provide money for house purchase.  It is not good enough to say that it is only a British, Australian or other foreign company who will grant a loan but this is what is happening at the present time.  I appeal to the Minister to look into this aspect of the matter.  I remember speaking to a former Minister for Local Government and telling him about the problems with which people were faced in their efforts to obtain a deposit for a house. Incidently, in the last week I have carried out an investigation into the price of houses and I found that the lowest price for a new house was £4,700.  I worked it out that a single man would have to save £15 per week for two years in order to provide a deposit for a house.  I mentioned the problem a young man encounters in his efforts to obtain a deposit to the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Blaney, and his answer was: &ldquo;They are getting married too young nowadays&rdquo;.  He told me that he was 38 when he got married but this is not an answer to give to young people who wish to marry.  It is not sufficient to tell our young people: &ldquo;Do not get married and therefore you will not have to face this problem&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We must do all in our power to ensure that these young people can obtain loans and if the Minister for Local Government is so concerned about housing he might seriously consider nationalising the building societies or setting up in competition against them.  If he did this he would see clearly that young people are very anxious to purchase their own homes. Frequently a young couple who have a deposit come to me and say that the building society will not grant them a loan because their income is not high enough.  Even when they obtain a loan the young couple will never own their home.  It is time we had an investigation into this matter and established where the money is going.  If public money by way of deposit is going into this, if they are getting the tax rebates, as we understand they are, if they are looking for greater tax concessions, I would want to know why and what <Col N="938" /> they are going to give in return.</P>

      <P>We have already had a very full discussion on this Bill and I think I have said most of what I wanted to say in reply to the debate.  Many of the remaining points that were raised by Deputies opposite are more appropriate to Committee Stage and I propose to deal with them fully on that Stage.  There are just one or two further comments of a general nature which I should like to make.</P>
      <P>On the subject of housing which was referred to by a great many Deputies, it must be emphasised that the obligation to provide adequate housing for all our people is an obligation which rests on the community as a whole&mdash; where a person cannot provide it for himself&mdash;and cannot in equity be placed on individual property owners. It is an obligation which is properly undertaken on behalf of the community by bodies such as Dublin Corporation to whom the responsibility has been given by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it becomes necessary that private property should be compulsorily acquired to meet housing needs, this must only be done in accordance with procedures authorised by law and with due regard for the rights of the owners and occupiers of property who are entitled to be fully compensated for their loss.  Private individuals and groups have no right to take the law into their own hands in this matter.  To argue that they have is to advocate anarchy and to defend unlawful interference with fundamental rights and freedoms which are guaranteed by the Constitution. In view of some of the comments made from the benches opposite it may, perhaps, be fitting if I remind the House that the Government and the Oireachtas are bound to uphold all the principles enshrined in the Constitution and not just the ones which particular individuals or groups find it <Col N="939" /> convenient to cite for their own particular purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald and others alleged that the Bill seeks to make trespass in a building a criminal offence for the first time.  The Deputy is quite wrong in this.  If he will look at the Bill again he will see that trespass as such is not to be made an offence at all. Trespass consists in wrongfully entering on the property of another person. But mere entry on the property of another will not constitute an offence under this Bill.  To constitute an offence under section 2 entry must be achieved by the use or threat of force, and even where forcible entry is effected, the person concerned will not be guilty of an offence unless he interferes with the use and enjoyment of the property by the owner, and if asked to leave by the owner or by a member of the Garda Síochána in uniform, he does not do so reasonably quickly and in a peaceful manner.  It will be seen, therefore, that there is very much more to the offence than a mere act of trespass.  Indeed, a careful reading of the relevant provisions will bear out what I said in my opening speech, namely, that the Bill has been framed on the basis that the sanction of the criminal law should not&mdash;and will not&mdash;be invoked as a substitute for civil action against trespass.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been made of section 5 of the Bill on the basis that it allegedly transfers the onus of proof to the defendant.  I shall discuss this in full detail on Committee Stage.  Here I think it is sufficient to point out that the onus of proof in relation to forcible entry, which is the essence of the offence, will rest at all times on the prosecution.  All section 5 does is to provide that the Bill will not be rendered totally unworkable.  Without section 5, or without something like it, any group could take over a privately-owned house to which they had no suggestion of a legal claim and, if prosecuted for doing so, they could sit back and wait for the prosecution to prove title.</P>
    <P>Every Member of the House who <Col N="940" /> is a member of the legal profession and many Deputies who are not members of the legal profession are quite well aware that formal proof of title is a complex and expensive procedure. Anybody who has ever bought or sold a house or any form of real property knows this and knows that the idea of the prosecution, in the kind of case we are talking about here, having to go into the district court complete with title deeds, would be nothing short of an absurdity.  I suggest to any Deputy who is serious about this sort of criticism to ask himself this question: what would his attitude be if he returned home one day and found his house occupied by one of these protest groups and, when he asked the group to leave he was met with the challenge: &ldquo;Certainly we will leave as soon as you prove to us that you have a good title to the property.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In introducing the Bill I went out of my way to emphasise that I did not put it forward as the last word in perfection but as a reasonable and moderate attempt to meet a serious and recurring problem.  I concluded on the note that I would be glad to hear the views of the House and to consider any suggestions that might be made for the improvement of the measure.  This offer was made in good faith and it still stands.  However, the House will appreciate that for obvious reasons the offer must be confined to serious suggestions that are made on reasoned grounds, and I would appeal to Deputies to approach the Committee Stage in that spirit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purposes of this Bill are, firstly, to provide for a new definition of redundancy to meet the circumstances arising from a decision of the High Court in 1969 which gave a narrower interpretation to the term redundancy than was originally intended and to provide for the compensation of workers adversely affected by the High Court decision in the period before the amending legislation comes into effect; secondly, to reduce the qualifying period for statutory redundancy payments from four to two years; and, thirdly, to provide for improvements in the rates of redundancy payments.</P>
      <P>The Bill includes a number of other amendments to the Act, which are necessary or desirable to clarify certain provisions, to remove anomalies, and generally to facilitate the more efficient administration of the redundancy scheme.  I am also proposing to amend the provisions in relation to the resettlement allowances scheme to provide that the scheme may be extended in scope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it would be helpful if I were to refer briefly to the provisions of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, and to give some information on how the Act has operated.  Under the Act, a qualified worker who is dismissed on redundancy after four years continuous service with the same employer is entitled to a lump sum <Col N="943" /> and weekly payments related to his age, service and pre-redundancy pay. The lump sum is payable in full by the employer who may receive a rebate of part of it, normally 50 per cent, but up to 65 per cent depending on the length of notice of dismissal given. Rebates of lump sums to employers are paid from the redundancy fund, which is financed by weekly contributions from employers and workers. Redundancy weekly payments, which are paid to qualified workers during unemployment following redundancy are met in full from the redundancy fund.</P>
    <P>The redundancy payments scheme was designed to achieve two broad objectives.  Firstly, it set out to alleviate the hardship arising for workers affected by redundancy and, secondly, it sought to facilitate rationalisation of production, which is an essential feature of economic progress.</P>
    <P>The redundancy payments scheme applies to workers who are insured for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.  This means that virtually all manual workers are covered and that non-manual workers with earnings of up to £1,200 a year are within the scope of the scheme.  The number of workers at present covered by the scheme is approximately 730,000, comprising about 470,000 men and 260,000 women.</P>
    <P>The annual income of the redundancy fund from the contributions of employers and employees is now about £1,200,000.  In the period from 1st January, 1968, when the Act came into effect, up to 31st December, 1970, the total expenditure from the fund was £1,900,000 approximately.  This included £42,000 in respect of the expenses of the redundancy appeals tribunal.</P>
    <P>In the three year period since the introduction of the scheme on 1st January, 1968, up to 31st December, 1970, a total of 11,455 redundancies was notified to my Department.  This total was comprised of 8,994 men and 2,461 women.  The yearly number of redundancies has been remarkably even&mdash;3,863, 3,696 and 3,896 in the years 1968, 1969 and 1970 respectively.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="944" /> In the three year period 1st January, 1968 to 31st December, 1970, redundant workers received lump sum payments totalling about £1,600,000 and weekly payments amounting to almost £1,000,000.  Lump sums paid under the scheme have ranged from about £15 to almost £1,000 and the average weekly payment has been approximately £7, which is, of course, additional to unemployment benefit or other payment to which a worker would be entitled under the Social Welfare code.</P>
    <P>The figures which I have given show clearly that the redundancy payments scheme has been of great benefit in reducing the hardships resulting from redundancy for many workers and their dependants.</P>
    <P>I am glad also to be able to say that the redundancy fund from which the scheme is financed is in a very sound condition.  Despite the substantial outgoings on lump sums and weekly payments since 1st January, 1968, the fund had a credit balance of approximately £1,750,000 on 31st December last.  While it is prudent to build up and maintain a reserve in the fund against unforeseen contingencies, I am satisfied that it is possible to introduce improvements in benefits without the risk of serious depletion of the fund.</P>
    <P>I now propose to describe the main provisions of the Bill.  The decision to amend the definition of redundancy arose following a High Court judgment in 1969 which had the effect of interpreting the definition of &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo; in a restricted way which was not intended when the Act was drafted. If this interpretation were allowed to stand, certain workers who are dismissed as surplus to their employers' requirements and who are redundant in the generally accepted sense would not be entitled to redundancy payments. The Government decided to amend the appropriate provision in the Act and I publicly announced this decision in October, 1969.  I also announced then that it was proposed to provide for payment from the redundancy fund of compensation to workers debarred from receiving redundancy payments following the High Court decision in the period before the new definition of redundancy <Col N="945" /> comes into effect.  The Bill now before the House provides for these matters.  In fact payments have been made from the fund to 20 workers in anticipation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Turning now to improvements in the redundancy payments scheme the following are the main improvements in the Bill:</P>
    <P>(i) reduction in the period to qualify for benefit from 208 weeks&mdash; four years&mdash;continuous service with the same employer to 104 weeks&mdash; two years&mdash;;</P>
    <P>(ii) an increase in the maximum lump sum, at present the equivalent of 20 weeks pay, to 30 weeks pay;</P>
    <P>(iii) each year of continuous employment over the age of 41 years to count for two weekly payments instead of each period of two years over 41 counting for three weekly payments;</P>
    <P>(iv) a minimum of four weekly payments contingent on unemployment;</P>
    <P>(v) an increase in each lump sum payment by the equivalent of one weeks pay;</P>
    <P>(vi) a general 5 per cent increase in the rates of lump sum rebates to employers;</P>
    <P>(vii) the existing waiting period of two weeks for weekly redundancy payments to be reduced to three days; and, finally</P>
    <P>(viii) persons will continue to be covered by the Act for four years after they exceed the insurable limit under the Social Welfare Acts instead of for two years at present.</P>
    <P>Under these provisions every worker who becomes redundant from the date of the new Act will secure some additional benefit.  It will be clear that the main emphasis in the new benefits is directed towards older and long service workers who will gain from the higher maximum lump sum and the extra weekly payments for service over 41 years of age.  Workers with shorter service will be helped by the reduction in the qualifying service to two years and the minimum of four weekly payments. The higher rebates will largely reimburse employers for extra costs <Col N="946" /> arising for them as a result of the additional benefits for workers.</P>
    <P>The proposal to extend from two to four years the period for which workers are eligible for benefits under the Act after they cease to be insurable under the Social Welfare Acts is mainly relevant to non-manual workers who at present cease to be insurable when their pay is increased to over £1,200 a year.  I may say that this income limit for social insurance is at present under review by the Government. While no final decision has been taken as to how it should be revised, Deputies can be assured that it will not stay at its present level for much longer.</P>
    <P>Most of the other amendments which I am proposing to the existing Redundancy Payments Act are of a technical nature.  I do not propose to deal with these in detail at this point, as they can be debated more appropriately on the Committee Stage, except to say that they are desirable in the interests of the more efficient administration of the existing legislation, to remove anomalies and to provide for matters not covered in the existing Act.  I would like, however, to mention some of them briefly.</P>
    <P>Workers will be facilitated in pursuing legitimate claims under the Act by provision laying down a presumption in the workers' favour in the event of a dispute as to whether dismissal was due to redundancy or service was continuous.  The time limit for claims is also being extended and strengthened provision made to protect a workers' right where there is a change of ownership. Another provision covers the award of costs, at the discretion of the court, to be paid by the redundancy fund where cases which are dealt with by the Redundancy Appeals Tribunal are brought to the High Court.  The position in relation to eligibility for weekly redundancy payments in the event of a trade dispute is being brought into line with the Social Welfare Acts and some further penalties in relation to fraud are being introduced.</P>
    <P>Apart from the redundancy payments scheme, I propose to introduce an amendment relating to the resettlement <Col N="947" /> allowances scheme which was authorised by the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967.  Under this scheme various types of financial aids are payable entirely from State funds to unemployed persons or persons about to become redundant to move to new areas to takeup employment.  These allowances include interview grants, travel expenses for the worker and his dependants, household removal expenses, settling-in grants, lodging allowances, grants for the worker to visit his family while awaiting their transfer to the new area and grants towards the legal expenses involved in the sale or purchase of a house.  Since the resettlement allowances scheme came into effect in January, 1968, the demand for assistance under it has developed, though the number availing of it is still comparatively small&mdash;186 persons in the period from 1st January, 1970, to 31st December, 1970.  I am satisfied that the limited use made of this scheme was caused mainly by the fact that there is little tradition of geographical mobility of labour within this country except to the cities&mdash; mainly Dublin.</P>
    <P>I consider that the scheme should be extended to enable it to be applied (i)  to persons already in employment to facilitate them in moving to new areas in order to take up other jobs and (ii)  to Irish emigrants to assist them in returning to this country in order to take up jobs which are available here.  I feel that there are good grounds for extending the scheme also to assist persons who have to travel from their normal place of residence in order to attend for tests for selection for training at approved training centres&mdash;such as those operated by An Chomhairle Oiliúna&mdash;or to undertake courses of training at such centres. I also propose to clarify that the scheme may be applied to persons other than persons who are insured for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.  Provision is made in the Bill for the necessary enabling powers which will be put into operation in due course by regulations.</P>
    <P>Before this Bill was drafted, my Department had consultations as to its provisions with various representative <Col N="948" /> bodies, including, in particular, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers. I will not be letting you into any great secret if I reveal to you that the Bill does not go as far as Congress would wish but goes a great deal further than the FUE would like.  It is the lot of the Minister for Labour to be in the middle and he must make his own judgment as to what is to be done, with a special eye on what the fund can afford.</P>
    <P>I am sure the main criticism which will be directed at the Bill in this House is that it does not go far enough in extra benefits.  I expect also that I will be asked to apply some or all of the new benefits retrospectively.  In the hope of discouraging some of the advocates of higher benefits and retrospection, I want to argue the case for prudence.  The redundancy fund is in a healthy state but there is no guarantee that this will continue.  Wages are going up all the time and these will be reflected in higher benefit payments&mdash;but contributions are at flat rates.  When the social insurance limit is raised, many better paid people will qualify for benefits and the effect of this on the fund cannot be predicted.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;crunch&rdquo; period of the Free Trade Agreement with Britain and the probability of free trade with an enlarged EEC are approaching.  It is far better to approach these contingencies with something in the kitty.  I am completely against retrospection because there could be no basis in principle for picking one retrospective date rather than another and because any retrospective payments would have to be borne in full by the redundancy fund.  The additional benefits I am proposing will cost the fund over £450,000 a year, assuming that the rate of redundancy stays about the same as we have experienced in the last few years.  This is as far as I think it prudent to go in the present situation.</P>
    <P>The benefits could, of course, be further improved if contributions were increased substantially but I have no wish to add, at this particular time, to indirect charges on employers and workers.  I do, of course, propose to keep the situation under continuing <Col N="949" /> review and if I am satisfied that further improved benefits are justified by reference to the position of the fund I will take steps to introduce them.  I might mention that the 1967 Act gives powers to vary rates of benefits in a flexible manner, by orders approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that I do not regard the proposed improvements in the Redundancy Payments Act outlined in this Bill as the final solution to all the problems associated with redundancy.  A national scheme of redundancy payments for workers is an important part of the Government's overall manpower policy but it is only a part.  It is obviously not sufficient merely to compensate a worker for the loss of his job.  Every effort must be made to obtain for him new employment.  With this aim in view, the benefits available for redundant workers under the Redundancy Payments Act are being supplemented by the improved placement and guidance facilities being made available by the reorganised and strengthened national manpower service.</P>
    <P>An Chomhairle Oiliúna, set up under the Industrial Training Act, 1967, is also making an increasing contribution to the re-absorption of redundant workers into the labour force with schemes for training and retraining.  The improvements proposed under this Bill should, nevertheless, help to protect further workers' interests in this time of economic and technological change, and also encourage workers to accept the inevitability of change in the interest of national economic progress.  Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that most of these points were not covered when the original Bill was introduced.  Section 4 (2) of the 1967 Act provides that the Bill shall not apply to a person who is normally expected to work for the same employer for less than 21 hours a week.  I believe the 21 hours should be brought down a bit.  For instance, women cleaners may work for only 18 or 19 hours per week and I think they should come within the scope of this Bill.  The Minister has improved various payments.  Section <Col N="950" /> 5 of this Bill covers the case where an agency changes hands.  In this case an employee can change his job and still get redundancy payment as if there was no change of ownership and as if he was working in the same job.</P>
      <P>In this country I think we allow public companies to get rid of men on changes in management, though the company remains the same.  The new management can say: &ldquo;You are redundant as far as we are concerned. You can go&rdquo;.  Maybe I am taking it up wrong.  I know the provision is only put in to cover a person working for an agency if he suddenly loses that agency, but I think this could also happen in a public company.  That is the way I read it.</P>
      <P>We are in favour of the improvements in this Bill.  There is no point in going into details at the moment.  We agree with most of what is in the Bill and if we have any objections to make or improvements to suggest we can do so on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that during the period since 1968 the total number of redundancies of men was 8,994.  In other words, there has been an average annual number of redundancies of about 3,800.  The Redundancy Payments Act certainly favours those employed in the service industry, like grocers, tobacconists and so on.  Those people are dismissed because there are no jobs for them and they are given sufficient money to keep them for a reasonable time while they are looking for new jobs.  On the other hand, people like those employed by companies such as Hibernian Transport, who have spent 25 to 30 years in a firm, suffer because redundancy in their case means a ticket for the whole family to emigrate. The failure of the business I mentioned was caused by bad running. I am not blaming the Government although I do blame the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Transport and Power for not following the thing up in an effort to save the jobs of some of the people employed in Hibernian Transport.  Keeping even part of that business going would have meant an improvement in our balance of payments position and it would have kept at least 50 per cent of the 800 <Col N="951" /> employees in jobs.  Three or four years ago we recommended legislation to have worker representation in the managements of some companies, and a former Deputy, Mr. Michael Mullen, agreed with this, saying it would prevent mismanagement.</P>
    <P>From my point of view, the redundancy fund is all right for service industries but in relation to employees in other industries the Department of Labour should arrange for retraining. I agree that AnCO are doing a very good job of training people, although they are doing it slowly.  From what I can gather, however, very little retraining has been done by comparison with the amount of training.  Where there is redundancy, during the period that redundant workers are being retrained for new jobs, they should be paid their full wages.  Workers who are affected by free trade conditions or workers who will become affected when we join the EEC&mdash;neither of which was their doing &mdash;should be paid in full until such time as they are retrained.  If the Government could not foresee the possibility of such conditions 20 years ago, how could the workers be expected to foresee them?  At the moment, for instance, the shoe industry is affected.  Two industries in one town have got the knock.  The workers have to be retrained or else get out of the country to find work.  They should be paid in full.  Otherwise we have no manpower policy.  There is no information from the Government&mdash;they kept it from the people&mdash;that the shoe industry would get such a quick knock.</P>
    <P>In Dublin at the moment there are approximately 5,000 to 6,000 persons employed in the car assembly industry and the Government have not given them any information.  It has been said that there is no need to worry until 1980.  However, in the EEC set-up, people in this country can purchase cars in Germany and bring them in here cheaply without customs duty.  That means the motor assembly industry here will be in trouble and we should be already retraining the workers concerned. In England, most car makers make the body in one place and bits and pieces all over the place.  We do not do that.  Therefore we should be <Col N="952" /> retraining those people instead of telling them that the car industry will last. It well may not.  When tariffs and customs barriers collapse the car industry here will be on its way out.</P>
    <P>The workers have not been given information about the clothing and woollen industries, about whether they will survive EEC conditions.  We do not know yet whether the Government's non-intervention in the bank strike had anything to do with the future of those industries or whether those industries were on their way out anyway.</P>
    <P>All this the worker must be told now and I repeat that when retraining is necessary the workers should be paid in full during the time they are being fitted for new employment.  Not only must we know which industries will disappear but we must know also in what parts of the country they are least likely to survive.  Have we made any effort to encourage the setting up here of car industries whose headquarters are based in such far away places as America or Japan rather than those based nearer home.</P>
    <P>I do not think that workers are being made aware of the comparative rates of wages and production costs in the EEC countries.  Already we have heard a big brewery industry here say that with only a quarter of the staff which they employ here they could produce in England the same amount.  This comes from one of our major industries. On the Committee Stage of this Bill, we shall have an opportunity of going into more detail.</P>
    <P>Until such time as there are sufficient places in which to retrain anybody who becomes redundant and until we have a proper manpower policy, we should ensure that every person who becomes redundant is paid in full. There is a reference in the Minister's speech to section 18 in connection with employers and redundancy.  I can see this being abused very much and such abuse will result in many disputes between trade unions and employers in cases where employers will find it much easier to get rid of workers.  Quite often they may succeed because, for some reason or other, a person may be in need of a sum <Col N="953" /> of money at some particular time. There should be some provision to ensure against a person buying a business and deciding suddenly that people must go because he is able to prove that they are to some extent redundant. We support this section but, again, we shall go into it in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We, in the Labour Party, welcome the belated improvements embodied in this Bill.  However, we deplore the fact that it is so necessary and that it is becoming increasingly necessary in this country to cater for redundancy.  There is a tendency on the part of the Government not to remember what exactly redundancy is. If a person becomes redundant, he has lost his employment.  As the party who have been in power here for so long, the Minister and his Government must accept responsibility for a situation in which more than 6 per cent of our employable population are unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I used the word &ldquo;belated&rdquo; purposely because the proposals embodied in this Bill were brought before the House by the Labour Party as amendments to the original Bill but they were rejected then by Fianna Fáil.  As a result of that shortsightedness many people have suffered through redundancy.  Those who have become redundant since 1968 have got nothing&mdash;people who, when this Bill is enacted, will qualify. At that time, we asked that the qualifying period be two years and not four years.  We did not understand then and we do not understand now why the Government refused to accept that amendment.  This two-year period has been in operation in England and even in the Six Counties.  Many people have been disqualified from receiving any benefit or compensation for the loss of a right and we must concede that it is a right of any citizen to be employed. When compensation is given for redundancy it is a compensation for a denial of that right.  Deputy Paddy Belton mentioned an average figure during a number of years of about 3,000 people as becoming eligible each year under the Redundancy Payments Bill.  That figure was quite accurate but, by no means, does it give a true picture of <Col N="954" /> the number of people who become redundant because many people who have become redundant since the Bill was passed were disqualified from benefiting because they had not the necessary qualifications.</P>
    <P>Because of what the Minister has told us in his brief, we know that he can rectify the situation.  We know, also, that the fund is in a healthy condition. We suggest, as the Minister anticipated, that these additional benefits be retrospective so as to include people who should have been covered in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Another improvement in the Bill is that the maximum time for the payment of a lump sum is being increased from 20 weeks to 30 weeks.  Undoubtedly, this will help the older worker and it is the older worker who will be hit hardest by redundancy. However, why should there be any limit?  What is the necessity for a limit? There is a considerable sum of money in the fund so that there would be no extra cost to the Government.  If a man has sufficient service to qualify for 40 or 50 weeks, why does he not get it? When the Minister went so far in improving the Bill considerably why would he not go a little further and give the worker with the requisite service what is only his due?  The worker has contributed to the fund; so has the employer.  While we may on occasion say hard things about employers I do not know many employers personally who would begrudge any man his due.  The Minister should have another look at this.</P>
    <P>The waiting time has been cut down from two weeks to three days.  Why any waiting time?  Why should a worker have to wait three days if, through no fault of his own, but simply because of something over which he has absolutely no control, he suddenly finds himself virtually on the breadline? The fund is financially healthy.  Why should he have to wait three days?</P>
    <P>Again, non-manual workers with over £1,200 a year are not covered by the fund.  The ordinary, sane person finds this very difficult to understand. This is supposed to be a Bill designed to alleviate financial hardship on those who become unemployed through no <Col N="955" /> fault of their own.  The non-manual worker will probably suffer more hardship from being unemployed than will the average manual worker.  All workers suffer hardship, of course, but the white collar worker with £1,300, £1,400 or £1,500 a year will probably be buying a house with a mortgage.  He will have all sorts of commitments that the manual worker may not have.  If, however, he loses his employment, through no fault of his own, he is excluded; there will be no benefit for him under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand that thinking. The three days waiting and the £1,200 limit are a carry-over from the social welfare way of thinking.  It is about time we gave up that kind of thinking. This is 1971 and Fianna Fáil should rid themselves of this poor law appoach. I must say some Fianna Fáil people appear to be very liberal with money.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that he could not improve the Bill any further at this stage.  He spelled out two of his reasons for that statement quite clearly&mdash;the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain and our application to join the EEC.  The effects, he said, cannot be properly assessed.  The EEC is in the future.  The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement is in the recent past.  We have very definite views about our application to join the EEC and the way it is being handled by the Government. Because of that we have been subjected to a great deal of criticism. We have been accused of being shortsighted, of being cranky, or being agitators.  All sorts of labels have been pinned on us because of our attitude to the EEC.  We have had tonight from a Fianna Fáil Minister a statement with regard to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  This is not something in the future.  It is a reality. This party was the only party which told the nation and the Government what the possibilities might be and what the effects of that agreement would be.  A little late, apparently, it has dawned on the Fianna Fáil Party what the effects are.  The Minister <Col N="956" /> states in his brief that, because they cannot anticipate fully how much unemployment our people will be subjected to, it is not possible at this stage to improve the benefits further.</P>
      <P>There are improvements, belated improvements, in this Bill as compared with the original proposals in 1967.  We welcome these improvements but, on Committee Stage, we in the Labour Party will be proposing a large number of amendments and we would ask the Minister not to reject these amendments out of hand, as happened in 1967, because they will be tabled by men with long experience in industrial relations and with very close daily association with both workers and employers. The amendments will not be tabled merely to score political points but in an endeavour to improve the Bill.  If the Minister accepts these amendments he may not have to listen to me three or four years hence telling him once again: &ldquo;We told you so&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This advanced social legislation demonstrates to the country the fact that we are concerned with every section and, in particular, with the worker.  The Minister has been doing a good job as Minister for Labour and Minister for Social Welfare. He has the social conscience necessary for the holder of those offices. If we neglect any one section then the State will become lopsided.  I do not want to see anybody in our society hungry or in want in a Christian State. We are dealing with the problem of trying to rehabilitate workers who become redundant and place them in gainful employment again.  We are trying to tide them over evil days.  The reduction from four years to two years is a big advance which I welcome.  It is costing almost another £500,000 to do this.  Notwithstanding that, the Minister for Labour is not asking any <Col N="957" /> further contribution: the State will have to bear this increase.  The fund is solvent at present.  I hope to see the day when the resources of this nation will improve so much that none of our people will be unemployed but until such time as that happens it is well to know that we are making provision as far as our resources permit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know that, but I am thinking of the white collar workers and others.  I should like to see the legislation improved as time goes on.  Our economy has made great progress.  I remember statements made about the agricultural south by the then British Prime Minister, Lloyd George, who said: &ldquo;We have given them the agricultural south and they will never be able to carry on.&rdquo;  The people of Ireland, irrespective of political affiliations were sound and contributed immensely to our progress so that we have reached the position in which we are today.  If our economy continues to develop as it is developing, the standard of living will continue to go up and up.  I remember working in this city in my time, for about 2d an hour.  If the economy could afford it, the Minister for Labour would go further than he has gone. He would be glad to do it.  We are fortunate to have a man of his standing, of his social conscience and a man concerned with the wellbeing of the workers.  We are concerned with the wellbeing of every section of the people.  That is what makes a Christian society.  These are the things that have kept us on this side of the House for so many years.</P>

      <P>On the Committee Stage I will be listening to some people who will plead &ldquo;better than thou&rdquo; all the time and they will be putting something else forward.  I saw the time when these people, and I was <Col N="960" /> very hurt to see it, voted against increases for old age pensioners, against increases for social welfare benefits.  I do not know why they did this because these are the things which will help every section of our people&mdash;these wonderful advances which have been made in all social welfare benefits.  God forbid that we should see any more people unemployed but we are trying to deal with this situation.  The Minister for Labour referred to a transitional period when we go into the Common Market.  I know that this is not a debate on the Common Market but I do want to say that we cannot remain out on a limb, we cannot build a wall around the country and put glass and barbed wire on the top of it and let nobody in or out.  If we were to do that our standard of living would be very low.  For that reason there may be a transitional period.</P>
      <P>I should like to see more people from all sides of the House studying the repercussions which did take place within the six countries and thus be able to deal with this matter in a practical way.  This Bill represents a 100 per cent improvement on what went before.  I want to say to the Minister that I did encounter a few cases of real hardship, people who were not protected by a good trade union and who were sacked a few days before they had 40 years service.  When they went to claim redundancy benefit they were given some footling excuse.  I do not want to see that type of person hurt again.  People who are in a good trade union and who as well as having the protection of the union have the protection of its legal department are all right, but there are workers here and there in private employment who have no trade union, and more shame on them because they should be in a trade union if they want to have their interests protected, and they find themselves out in the cold.  Such people will now be protected under this Bill and none of these footling excuses will be accepted in the future under this more enlightened legislation.  How far are we going to go with retrospective legislation?  Are we going to consider going back so many years?  In this matter the Minister is up against it.</P>

      <P>I prefer to see agreement through ordinary conferences rather than by legislation.  This was a wonderful social advance.  The Trade Union Congress and the employers, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour were responsible for a very good job.  People said that the then Minister was going back on his word. There is an old saying that anybody is entitled to change his mind on greater enlightenment and that is what the Government and the party did in this matter.  I hope that in the interests of future industrial peace and harmony the same thing will be done by the present Minister, the Government and the party, because these are the things we all stand for, although the more conservative people would say that a Minister should not change his mind, or that the Taoiseach should not change his mind.  A judge cannot very well change his mind when he makes a decision in court but a Government or Ministers are entitled to change their minds on greater enlightenment. The Minister for Labour, the Trade Union Congress and the FUE changed their minds when they saw that they were getting something as a result of co-operation.  I hope that that co-operation will long exist between the workers, the employers and the Department of Labour.  In conclusion I welcome this advanced, Christian, social legislation which is a credit to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, that is so.  There are a number of matters which will be dealt with by amendment on the Committee Stage but in fairness to the Minister and his Department a number of the amendments which we propose to put before the House should be mentioned and explained.  Deputy Cluskey has already done so in regard to a number of them but I would like to mention a few more because some of them are so necessary that I cannot understand why the Minister did not take the opportunity of having them included in the Bill.  He mentioned that he discussed this with the Trade Union Congress and the FUE.  The Trade Union Congress submitted 25 amendments to him and he accepted about six; one or two of the remainder were partially accepted and the balance were just dumped out.  Was that because the FUE did not like them?  That was the suggestion the Minister made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from any other considerations such as benefits and scope, the provisions of the Redundancy Payment Act should be simplified in relation to lay-off, the daily and periodical dismissal&mdash;this is something which caused endless trouble in the other Bill&mdash;and the conversion of lay-off into dismissal and the claims for payment following the lay-off; continuity of employment when employment is interrupted, and the giving of written notice and written offers by employers.  Why were these not dealt with in this Bill?  These are matters without which it is not possible to operate the Bill properly.  Despite the fact that it was brought to the notice of the Minister they were not included and now the Labour Party will have to introduce amendments to cover these matters unless the Minister <Col N="963" /> changes his mind, as he is entitled to do, before the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I agree that these essential modifications can be achieved within the Bill as it stands.  To deal with section 3, for instance, it is not possible to define or foresee all the circumstances in which genuine redundancy may occur.  I am sure the Minister knows this.  This Bill became necessary because the High Court decision of July, 1969, to which the Minister referred, held that all the circumstances of redundancy were prescribed in section 7 (2) of the Act. This meant that either you were dismissed under this section or you were not.  The words: &ldquo;For the purpose of 7 (1) in 7 (2) of the Act&rdquo; prevent the tribunal from making an award in a case of genuine redundancy within the generality of section 7 (1), unless it comes within some of the circumstances in 7 (2) as extended by section 3 of the Bill.  When this Bill was going through one of the matters to which we objected&mdash;similarly in the Bill dealing with occupational injuries&mdash; was the fact that the phraseology of the Bill would make it possible for the legal gentlemen to sit back and have a field day.  They would be able to say &ldquo;In our opinion this is wrong&rdquo; and they would be able to misinterpret entirely the spirit of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had to come in to this House with a new Bill within three years of the operation of the first Bill.  I agree with the Minister that the original Redundancy Bill did much good.  I do not care who was responsible for its introduction; it was a major step forward in social legislation. However, it was spoiled because matters that could have been dealt with and which, in many cases, were introduced by way of amendment by the Labour Party, were rejected by the then Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 12 (2) of the Act which covers claims for payments following lay-off is difficult to understand and operate.  An employee who wishes to activate the section for the purpose of ascertaining his employer is likely to be in a position to allow employment to resume is obliged to terminate his employment.  This is the practice at the <Col N="964" /> present time with people who are on a three-day week, some of whom have been temporarily laid off.  Will they be re-employed fully or must they, in order to qualify for redundancy, terminate their employment?  This is as we read the Act.  The employee should be permitted to activate this section either by making a claim for payment or terminating his employment but notice to terminate employment is not appropriate in circumstances where resumed employment may be contemplated. This section would be more easily understood if the top section were inserted after the bottom section.</P>
    <P>A simplified version of section 12 (2) could provide that an employee could make a claim for redundancy payment while on lay-off without terminating employment.  It should be possible and there is no reason why it should not be done.  For some reason or another someone must have objected to it because it was brought to the notice of the Minister and he cannot say he did not know about it.</P>
    <P>The intent of paragraph 5 of Schedule 3 of the Act should be crystallised. There is no reason why it should be left as it is because experience has proved that employers tend to disregard the presumption in paragraph 4 in the mistaken belief that absences in excess of the periods listed in paragraph 5 have the effect of terminating employment. This is causing all kinds of trouble at the present time.  Dismissals, followed by resumption within the prescribed period, should not break continuity and it was never intended that they should.  However, this is the way it worked out because the Act is not clear.  The intention that a notice of termination of employment is cancelled by resumption within a certain period should be more positively stated.  If it is definitely stated that resumption within a prescribed period means that it is continuous employment and that it is not broken, this will solve the problem.</P>
    <P>For instance, employees who are hired daily and resume work daily should be given the same protection as other employees.  It is necessary to clarify the position of employees who are actually dismissed daily, such as <Col N="965" /> dockers, as interruption of employment in this case would not be a lay-off in the absence of a lay-off notice.</P>
    <P>The presumption in the first continuity rule in paragraph 4 of Schedule 3 of the Act is weakened in the absence of &ldquo;written&rdquo; notice to terminate employment. There is too much scope for disputed claims arising from the methods in which &ldquo;oral&rdquo; notice may be given when an employee is absent due to illness.  The supervisor may neglect to deliver the oral notice and this has happened on more than one occasion.  Notices which employers are obliged to give, or may give, to employees and offers of employment should be written notices.  When they are written notices this danger cannot arise and at least the situation is definite. There can be no doubt about it if the employer writes the notice and has it delivered to the employee.  The situation can occur that an employee who is ill would be completely unaware of what has happened and return to his place of employment when he has recovered.</P>
    <P>This procedure should also be adopted in the case of a change of ownership or the transfer of business. In some instances the new owners&mdash; and this includes solicitors who should know better&mdash;tend to avoid making a written offer to the employees.  This causes much misunderstanding, not to say suspicion, which may or may not be justified.  We have had a golden opportunity to do something to clarify this matter but the Minister has passed it up.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Act which deals with seasonal workers is unsatisfactory as some employers actually dismiss employees although it is intended to allow applicants to resume work at a future date.  Dismissal is not a lay-off and this kind of interruption should be deemed to be a lay-off.  There should be presumption of continuity of employment for periods before and after commencement of the Act as happens in the Northern Ireland Act and section 5 should be amended accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Act deals with lay-off and it is unsatisfactory.  It permits employers who laid-off employees, <Col N="966" /> in circumstances of genuine redundancy, to convert that lay-off into dismissal, without notice to the employees. Laid-off employees who are not allowed to resume work when work resumes should be deemed to have been dismissed for redundancy and a written notice in this case is necessary.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which should be dealt with.  It should have been done before and when the last Bill was before the House we attempted to deal with it but did not succeed. Now we have the chance to do it and it should be copperfastened.  Provision should be made to safeguard the position of employees who are dismissed between 22nd January, 1971, and the commencement of the new Act.  If they are laid off they are deprived of the benefit of the reduced 104 weeks qualification. Some employers dismissed employees between 17th May, 1967, and 1st January, 1968, and some employees lost the protection of the Third Schedule because more than 26 weeks elapsed between publication of the Bill and commencement of the Act. Possibly this could not have been foreseen but it did happen and it should not be repeated.  Employers who established new companies between May, 1967, and January, 1968, and transferred employees to the new companies managed to avoid the Act and therefore the benefit of long years of service was lost because of the fact that some clever people spotted a way to beat the Act.  This could have been avoided had the suggestion made at the time been taken up.  While it is not so serious now, at the same time we should ensure that it does not happen again.</P>
    <P>The surplus in the redundancy fund increased by £619,000 in the year ended 31st December, 1970, so that the accumulated surplus exceeds £1½ million.  The Minister gave me that information in answer to a question the other day.  The estimated annual cost of the improvements proposed by the Department of Labour is, according to the Minister's answer, £360,000.  In his speech today the Minister mentioned a figure of £450,000.  I should like to ask the Minister is the difference of £90,000 an estimate as to the cost of <Col N="967" /> resettlement?  Where did the Minister get the figure because the original figure which he gave me, added to the other figures, makes £360,000?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being clever and I am trying to be the same. If the £90,000 is not an estimate of the cost of resettlement, can the Minister say what it is?  Perhaps when he is replying he might supply the figures he said I did not ask him to supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should prefer the Minister to add them up afterwards.  The estimated cost of a lump sum related to weekly pay under age 41 and of twice-weekly pay over age 41 without an income limit, is £800,000, of which £250,000, unless the number of redundancies increases substantially.  There is scope for better benefits within the existing contributions, unless the Minister has information of large-scale redundancies coming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody told me the other day, and I do not know whether it is correct or not, that the Government, having carried out a survey, do have information as to the number of companies that are likely to go the wall, that they knew of a number which were in fact going to the wall and of ones which are likely to go to the wall: (a) under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement; and (b) under the Common Market if we are ever unfortunate enough to have to enter.  Was this what the Minister had in mind because, apart from saving the fund, as he said himself, he did by a very simple act the other day, when he was changing the figures into decimal currency, add £23,000 per annum to the fund?  Was he laying by for the rainy day?  Is the rainy day coming, and does the Minister know that there will be a call on the fund far greater than there has been over the past few weeks? <Col N="968" /> Incidentally, I should like to correct a figure which Deputy Belton gave some time ago in regard to the seven transport companies which went burst when he said that 50 per cent of the employees were eligible for redundancy pay.  My information, which I got by way of Parliamentary Question, is that out of 500 only 30 of them were not eligible for redundancy pay.  I should like to put that on the record.</P>
    <P>Provision should be made to extend the Act to clerical employees whose wages exceed £1,200.  The Minister may say the Government are considering that.  Might I ask the Minister this: How long does it take the Government to consider something like that?  If he remembers he will be able to confirm that he told me some time last October, that he told me again some time before Christmas and repeated it again last week, that the matter was under consideration by the Government and he repeated tonight that it was being consideration by the Government or was being considered by somebody anyway. Goodness knows it is not a terrible secret.  There have been bigger secrets which were much worse kept over the last 12 or 18 months.  I would ask the Minister to let us know to what figure he proposes to increase the limit, so that a great many people who are wondering at the present time what is going to happen will know whether they are in or out.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is making provision to cover for redundancy payment purposes people who are over the limit for the four years following; at the present time it is two years.  At the same time that is no good reason why he should not be able to say that the figure will be £1,800 or £2,000 or whatever he decides it will be.  Such employees as come in under the change should at least get full benefit for their employment up to the date on which they went over the full insurance.  This, I mentioned a few minutes ago, refers particularly to the 30 people who have been affected by the seven companies that went burst.  There is no reason why those people should not get benefit for their credits.</P>
    <P>It is now admitted that the cost of reducing the qualifying period from <Col N="969" /> 208 to 104 weeks is only of the order of £140,000.  We suggested this in 1967 and the Minister's predecessor refused to agree to it.  It shows that at that time we were right and the Minister was wrong.  However, it has done one thing: the refusal up until now to operate has meant that the Act is practically in-operative as far as the construction industry is concerned.  The Minister must know this and he should do something about it.  In any case he should agree that the matter should have been dealt with then.</P>
    <P>Another point which again was referred to correctly by Deputy Belton was that the 21-hour rule under the Act needs clarification, especially where an employee was in continuous employment on the 1st January, 1968 but whose weekly hours had been reduced to less than 21 when the Act commenced.  Employers had 33 weeks advance notice of the rules and I would ask the Minister to examine case No. 384/1970 and he will better understand the effect of this.</P>
    <P>The scope of the amendments to section 5 and to the schedule of the Bill referred to at page 11 are not in harmony.  Both should apply to a change in the control of a business before and after 1st January, 1968. Section 5 should extend continuity of employment to cases where a principal takes on the employees of a sub-contractor. The Minister must know that very often there will be somebody who is employed in a firm and who considers he is in the employment of that firm for a number of years; then somebody suggests that while he was working on the job and was there all the time some unknown person was a sub-contractor and he was an employee of that sub-contractor.  This problem can be solved by asking the principal employer to take over the employees of the sub-contractor.  Again in regard to section 2 of the Act, notice to be given by the employer should be in writing.  Offers should be in writing and dismissals should be in writing.  This should be insisted on in every case.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 10 of the Bill the time limit should not apply if the employer has not given the written notice of dismissal or the redundancy <Col N="970" /> certificate.  This is one way to ensure that the notice or the redundancy certificate is given in writing.  It cuts out completely the idea of someone just giving a verbal notice and trying to get away with it.  There should be a penalty if the employer fails to give the lump sum.  The employee should also be enabled to recover a lump sum as a simple contract debt.  Section 19 of the Act covers this.  It is very difficult sometimes to get a claim heard and dealt with and if the right to claim it as a simple contract debt was included in the Bill I believe it would save the redundancy court a great deal of trouble.  In addition, employers who would have no objection to going before the redundancy court would be made change their minds in regard to refusing or trying to avoid paying a sum if they thought they were going before an ordinary court.</P>
    <P>If redundancy has occurred or is expected employees should be free to accept a going offer of alternative employment in another firm without prejudice to a claim for payment.  That is quite a simple matter and I see no reason why it should not be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Provision should be made for payments from the fund to employees who lost their employment between 17th May, 1967 and 31st December, 1967 in circumstances of redundancy because of decisions made by employers to avoid the Act.  The Minister said he does not like retrospection of any kind. This is one case where, no matter what objection he has to retrospection, retrospection is justified.  This is one case where a number of employers&mdash;I could name many of them&mdash;dismissed people who had been in their employment for many years under, shall I be kind and say, very suspicious circumstances.  The effect of which was that those people did not get the benefit of the Redundancy Payments Act which they would have got if they had been retained a little longer.  This was brought about because when the Bill was going through this House the idea was that it would be law before 26 weeks but in fact it was 32 weeks, if my memory serves me correctly.  The new qualifying period of 104 weeks should apply from the date the Bill was published.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> I have mentioned the 21st January and I think the Minister is prepared to agree that this is reasonable; it will at least avoid the same thing happening again.</P>
    <P>Lump sum benefits should not be restricted to 30 years where the employment period exceeds 30 years.  Why should someone decide 30 years is enough?  I was talking to a man on Sunday last who had been in the same employment for 51 years, but under this Bill he would get the maximum of 30 years.  Why should he not get benefit for all the years he has spent there?  One week's pay in the lump sum should apply under 41 years of age and two week's pay thereafter.  The weekly payment should be two-thirds of weekly pay up to full pay.  It is essential that the Acts which are generally operated outside the legal arena should be simplified as far as possible.</P>
    <P>This Act is too complicated and there are too many things in it which leave it open to a legal mind to say: &ldquo;Well, look, there is a loophole here, we will let him take it to court and when it goes to court we will play round and round and round.&rdquo; Amendments to the Principal Act should be framed with a view to ease of reprinting the Principal Act as amended.  I do not know whether or not it is possible to do that but I make that suggestion to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendments to paragraph 5 of Schedule 3 of the Act are insufficient to remove anomalies.  Contrary to what the Minister stated on the 29th November, 1967, in Seanad Éireann, the prescribed period of 26 weeks following lay-off could not have preserved continuity where service was broken by an employer in anticipation of the passing of the Act, as&mdash;I mentioned this earlier&mdash;27 weeks had then elapsed since the publication of the Bill, 30 weeks had elapsed before the passing of the Act and over 32 weeks passed before the commencement of the Act on 1st January, 1968.  This had the effect of keeping people out who should have been in.  The Bill was brought into this House to protect them and because the Minister obviously could not count, the unfortunate unemployed person lost out on the deal.  If <Col N="972" /> there had been a lay-off in May, 1967, and no further resumptions in that year, a bridging period of 32 weeks was required, not 26 as in the Schedule. In any event the period of absence permitted without breaking continuity should be at least 52 weeks.  Is there any reason why it should not be?  This would solve many of the problems. A period following dismissal, especially a written dismissal, could not be bridged as employers could reasonably claim this was not an authorised absence.</P>
    <P>In section 11 (1) of the Act the words &ldquo;after the commencement of the Act&rdquo;, which is the 1st January, 1968, seem to restrict the lay-off procedure to periods after 1st January, 1968, and do not apply to the pre-1968 periods as suggested by the Minister on the 29th November, 1967.  When he made that statement he obviously thought it was all right, but it has now been proved either that he did not know what he was talking about or that somebody took advantage of the loophole which was there.  The words &ldquo;lay-off&rdquo; in paragraph 5 of Schedule 3 should read &ldquo;lay-off or dismissal&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The suitability of alternative employment in section 15 (2) (c) of the Act needs further examination.  Section 47 of the Transport Act, 1950, might provide an acceptable rule of thumb. In any event &ldquo;suitable employment&rdquo; should be defined as employment which is no less favourable to the employee than his immediate previous employment.  We had hoped the Minister would include this sort of thing when he was introducing the Bill.  It was brought to his notice by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and there was no reason why we should not have included them except that if he had done so the Federated Union of Employers would not like it.</P>
    <P>Before the Bill comes up for Committee Stage I would ask the Minister to take another look at this because if he introduces the amendment himself it will save both the House and himself a great deal of trouble.  If he does not do this, I am going to make this promise: we shall do what we did on a previous Bill and argue every way we possibly can to try to have our amendments <Col N="973" /> accepted.  We are as anxious as the Minister is for speedy implementation of this new legislation but we do not believe that as the Minister says if, when the new Bill as amended is passed, it is not perfect we can bring in another one.  That is not the answer, now is the time to do a good job on the Redundancy Payments Bill.</P>
    <P>The whole question of redundancy payments, the number of redundancies and the effect redundancy has on people is going to be highlighted within the next 12 months to two years. The Minister said that Irish people were not good at moving round from one place to another, they were not mobile.  I do not think he had in his mind moving around from Dublin to Cork or Galway and I would not dream of suggesting he had in the back of his mind moving to Paris, Berlin or down the Rhine Valley where all the employment will be if we are unfortunate enough to go into the EEC.  He does not include travelling out of the country as resettlement. He does think that people who have had to go to England to get a job should get assistance to return here if a job is available for them.  I remember the Minister telling me that the reason he found it necessary to ask some of these people to come home, despite the 65,000 or 66,000 people which for Deputy Burke's information is the number on the unemployment register, was that those on the unemployment register were not suitable for training.  I hate to think we have reached the stage where we are prepared to accept, as Deputy Cluskey has said, that 6 per cent of the insurable population are going to be permanently on the labour exchange because the Minister in charge of the Department for getting employment for them and training them for other employment, if there is nothing available for them in their own trade, considers they are not suitable for training; in other words what we have on our unemployment registers are the unemployables.  I am not prepared to accept that.  I think it is a terrible statement to have made.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to make a success of the Redundancy Payments <Col N="974" /> Bill he must ensure that, as well as getting compensation for those being dismissed from a job, other jobs are available for them.  It is just too bad if all we have been discussing this evening is how to give some little thing extra, and it is a little thing extra, to those who are going to lose their jobs. The Minister seems perfectly satisfied that apart from the number who have lost their jobs over the last few years the numbers will be increasing.  He is ensuring that the £½ million surplus is not eaten up by extra benefits, if it is the money will not be there when another draw may come on the fund.</P>
    <P>This gives us food for thought.  It appears that deep in the Minister's mind is the threat of further redundancies. We have blamed the cement strike, the bank strike, the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and we shall shortly be talking about the EEC. All these things are causing and will cause further unemployment.  For quite some time we have had far too many people unemployed.  The Government have never made any effort to find full employment for the working population here.  Recently I saw a figure given, which did not surprise me because I have mentioned it before in this House.  We tend to talk about all the man days lost through strikes.  The man days lost due to unemployment in this country is a national disgrace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill and to say that I regret that the original Act was not fully understood and the benefits included in it are still not fully understood by the community and by people who could and should benefit from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benefits outlined in the Minister's statement include interview grants, travel expenses for the worker and his dependants, household removal expenses, settling-in grants, lodging allowances, grants for the worker to visit his family while awaiting their transfer to the new area and grants towards the legal expenses involved in the sale or purchase of a house.  Many workers do not know about the benefits in existence at present.  It might be worthwhile for the Minister to explain <Col N="975" /> once again to workers the benefits that are already there.</P>
    <P>I should like to welcome the provisions of the present Bill.  The updating of legislation is very important. Whether it is updated on a piecemeal basis in accordance with the resources available or whatever the basis of updating is, when it brings new benefits it is certainly welcomed by this House and by the workers.</P>
    <P>While I would subscribe to many of the views expressed by Deputy Tully and other Deputies I feel that the Minister has gone a long way to meet the claims that have been put forward from time to time for consideration. The trade unionists in my party have on many occasions discussed with the Department and with the Minister many of the problems that have now been covered in this Bill.  The trade union group within Fianna Fáil, who are ever active in relation to the problems of the workers and the defects in legislation affecting the workers, deserve some credit for any legislation that flows from this House that is beneficial to Irish workers.  We have quite a number of those people actively engaged in processing problems and complaints and conveying them to the various Departments.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reduction in the period to qualify for benefit from 208 weeks'&mdash;four years'&mdash;continuous service with the same employer to 104 weeks'&mdash;two years'.  This is a substantial advance and by it a substantial number of workers who were previously not covered will be brought within the scope of this Bill and rightly so.  Another very important step is an increase in the maximum lump sum, at present the equivalent of 20 weeks' pay, to 30 weeks' pay.  This will give some degree of financial assistance to people during a difficult period when they are deprived of employment due to redundancy.  These are very important provisions and will affect the lives of the families of those people who will be redundant in the future.  Other improvements mentioned in the Minister's speech are that each year of continuous employment over the age of 41 years is to count for two weekly <Col N="976" /> payments instead of each period of two years over 41 counting for three weekly payments; a minimum of four weekly payments contingent on unemployment; an increase in each lump sum payment by the quivalent of one week's pay. These are all very essential advances and ones that will alleviate the distress that follows redundancy.</P>
    <P>It is rather regrettable, however, that the extension of the limit of £1,200 was not finalised before the introduction of this Bill.  It is regrettable that the Minister is not in a position to make a statement at this moment because it would give a fair indication of the extent to which this legislation will be effectively applied in the coming years.  It is difficult for Deputies to assess a situation in relation to a figure undisclosed in this House in regard to legislation coming before it.  For that reason I think that the sooner this extended figure is made known to the Deputies the better because Deputies will then be in a better position to assess the real factors in relation to the legislation.</P>
    <P>I think the suggestion made by Deputy Tully in relation to written notice is very important and something to which the Minister might give consideration. It is absolutely essential and unless there are very good reasons why it should be left over it would be worth while for the Minister to re-examine the situation.</P>
    <P>The call on the Fund over the years has shown how effective this piece of legislation has been.  The 11,450 notified redundancies represents quite a substantial number of people who have been assisted.  It is interesting to note that the number of redundancies over the years has not varied to any great extent&mdash;3,863 in 1968, 3,696 in 1969 and 3,896 in 1970, and that £1,600,000 was paid in lump sum payments and almost £1,000,000 in weekly payments, and lump sums paid ranged from £15 to almost £1,000.</P>
    <P>This shows the Department's constructive outlook in relation to the problems that affect people at times of stress and strain.  The continuing updating of the Act is something that must be welcomed by workers and by those who represent the workers.  If <Col N="977" /> there are defects and if these defects can only be remedied by an increase in contributions, then I see no reason why bigger contributions should not be sought.  It is desirable that we make the best job we can of this Bill to ensure that the maximum benefits will accrue from it and if it is necessary to increase contributions there is no reason why they should not be increased.</P>
    <P>Once again I would ask the Minister to ensure that the review of the £1,200 limit should be completed at a very early date so that Members of this House will, in relation to legislation of this type, be fully aware of the extent to which it will apply in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was generally impressed by the approach to the Bill.  As I expected, most of the points raised were points which will be appropriate to the Committee Stage.  I do not propose at this stage to go into the details with regard to the various smaller points that are appropriate to Committee Stage such as the question of whether a notice should be in writing or given verbally. These are matters that one must necessarily have a look at to see whether they are valid.  Very often there are very good reasons for some of these things which are not obvious.  Very often it is to the advantage of the employees that they are not included. Examination very often can reveal the real purpose and benefit of having them there.</P>
      <P>The general criticism of the Bill, of course, as I prophesied in my introductory statement, was that it does not go far enough.  That was to be expected from people who would like to do better, or for good propaganda reasons. I suppose if I were on the other side of the House I would be saying the same.  I can assure the House that our approach to this, my examination of the proposals from the earliest stages, the departmental assessment of the situation, an actuarial assessment so far as it was possible to make it, went as far as it would be possible to go since a good many of the assessments must be conjectural anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not sufficient to look at the surplus in the fund at this stage and <Col N="978" /> the payments made from the fund over the past few years and say they ran quite evenly.  One must always be prepared to accept that unforeseen circumstances can arise in which there would be an extra call on the fund.  We have only to look at the experience in Britain to realise this.  What happened there was sufficient in itself to make me very wary about the extent to which I am prepared to play with the surplus now available to me in the redundancy fund.  In Britain they have had to raise the contribution at least twice, I think, and to make amendments to meet an unforeseen situation.  They too went along fairly evenly at the start.  There was very little variation in the payments and the annual outgoings from the fund, but they suddenly found that they could run into a period in which there would be a very heavy call on it.</P>
    <P>To those people who facetiously or otherwise suggested that I was making allowances against the possibility of redundancies that would arise due to our entry into the EEC or, indeed, the coming to maturity of the British Free Trade Agreement, I should like to point out that one must accept without question that the more industries there are in a country the more redundancies and the more shuffling around one is likely to have.  The more industries we have the greater will be the disbursements from the redundancy fund.  It is not sufficient to say that there will be many redundancies due to the closing down of concerns, or firms, or factories, or other types of employment.  The average number of redundancies in any country is based on the amount of industrial development they have and the number of people in employment.  The greater the number, naturally, the more redundancies they will have.</P>
    <P>I would be quite foolish if I did not anticipate that on our going into the EEC there is bound to be a certain shuffling around.  I can see a lot of industries coming here due to our going in, which would never think of coming here otherwise.  Already people are inquiring in this respect.  We can also visualise people being rendered redundant if the industry in which they are employed is proved not to be viable under the new conditions.  It is inevitable <Col N="979" /> that we will have a good deal of shuffling and shuttling that will call on the fund for the necessary payments, certainly lump sums but perhaps not the weekly payments.  When a person is rendered redundant he is entitled to a lump sum but if he goes straight into employment, or there is little delay before he receives alternative employment, there is no weekly payment.</P>
    <P>By and large, unless you are very unwise, you must make provision for the eventualities that could occur in any circumstances, particularly having regard to the experience they had in Great Britain where they had an even period at the start of the redundancy scheme and then found that the figures were moving up rapidly and that the fund was unable to carry them.  While our fund is quite buoyant at the moment and our surplus would seem at first sight to justify making better provisions, it would be unwise to take any further chances for the time being.</P>
    <P>This has been referred to as a complicated Bill.  I do not really think there are any great complications in it.  The essential qualifications are fairly obvious but, in the interests of varying the benefits, and in order to lean, as this Bill does, towards the older and longer employed classes, one must make some provisions that might seem to be a little complicated at first sight.  In fact they are not really complicated. One of the things I find&mdash; and I think all Members of the House will agree with me&mdash;is that workers are very quick to discover what their entitlements are under any piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>None of the Members who spoke criticised the Redundancy Tribunal and I would not expect them to because I find that it works very well. We are making provision in this Bill where in certain circumstances the right is presumed on the part of the employee, until it is proven otherwise, which gives him a tremendous advantage in having a case straightened out by the Redundancy Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to the improvements we are making in the resettlement allowances.  I am sure he was not serious when he suggested <Col N="980" /> that we should apply resettlement allowances to people going abroad to work.  In my introductory statement I referred to the fact that the mobility of labour in this country is rather limited.  People are reluctant to move within the country, perhaps with the exception of coming to the city.  A case in point is that of female workers who frequently could find employment in many parts of the country although perhaps not in the particular place where they are living.  Very often they prefer to emigrate rather than move to Shannon, or Cork, or Limerick, or some other part of the country, where there is ample employment for female workers and thus no need whatever for them to emigrate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be a point.  We made provision for extending the resettlement allowances scheme and I referred to its being extended to cover those who come back from abroad.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully questioned the wisdom of bringing people back when we have so many thousand unemployed at home and he referred to a statement I made in the Dáil some time ago to the effect that the shortages in employment are in the service industries and the shortages in unemployment, generally, are in the sphere of skilled workers.  Right now there are vacancies for 600 skilled people in different industries in the country.  The director of the IDA made reference to this last night or the night before at Trinity or elsewhere and I think one can rightly assert that there is not an unemployed skilled man in this country and that if there is it is his own fault. That is an important statement and a true one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputies who said that AnCO and all others responsible for operating the training programme have an important task, one which I hope we will be able to speed up and to expand as time goes on.  We have only three training centres at the moment, Galway, Waterford and Shannon, but we hope to get the Dublin centre going as soon as possible. <Col N="981" /> The actual construction operations are about to begin.  We have to get a centre going in Cork.  We need more centres.  If they do work as well &mdash;I am glad Deputy Belton paid tribute to them&mdash;in the new centres as they have been doing in the three existing ones an excellent job will be done in training and retraining our people to fit them for employment.</P>
    <P>It is quite a common thing, and Deputies are well aware of it, that a large number of unemployed people are in fact unemployable in some special way.  One can take an example of where there may be 300 people signing at a local labour exchange in a provincial town.  If a factory employing twice that number is set up tomorrow we will still see the same number signing at the exchange either because they are not the type of workers the factory may be looking for or because the work is not the type those people are suited for: they may be small farmers who want to work their land at certain periods or they may take on work for the county council or with other farmers or local builders.  I would be rather naive if I said otherwise, but a large number of the people drawing unemployment benefit are not ready for employment that may offer.  One of the problems that applies, therefore, in the matter of training for employment is represented in the older labour force who are chronically unemployed.  They must be trained as well as the school-leavers.</P>
    <P>Then there is the point about retraining redundant workers.  There were many points made in regard to this which I will be better able to deal with as each section comes before the House in Committee.  Deputy Cluskey referred to shortsightedness when my predecessor was bringing in the Act of 1967.  I looked over the debate at that time, as any Minister in my position will do, and while Deputy Cluskey was boasting about the great suggestions the Labour Party were making, I learned that not many of them seemed to be sure at that time that the shilling per week would cover the provisions of the Bill.  They were not sure that it would cover the redundancies that <Col N="982" /> would occur let alone provide the surplus we now have.</P>
    <P>Matters of this kind are all by way of conjecture at the time because it is never possible to make an exact estimate. I do not think anybody in the House blamed the responsible Minister at that time.  Although naturally suggesting he should have done better, as far as I can recall and as far as my memory serves me from my occupancy of another Department at the time, nobody suggested or nobody was sanguine that the shilling a week would meet redundancies that would occur.</P>
    <P>All Deputies asked this afternoon why we should have a limit of 30 weeks&mdash;why not take every week the man worked into the reckoning.  It is simply a matter of cost, for one thing. After all, a man who has had 51 years' employment has been very fortunate as compared with a man who has had only ten years and became redundant. The former is a very lucky man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>He will not be fortunate if he is more than 70 because then he will not be covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>He has all the social welfare benefits available to him. He will not be badly off.  I consider 30 weeks to be a reasonable limit.  What we are doing is ensuring that there will not be an overspill which will erode the redundancy fund.  What must be taken into consideration is that every single benefit in the 1967 Act is being improved.  It is very easy for Deputies to be cynical about Deputy Burke's remarks, about his boasting about this very advanced legislation. It has been proved to work well in the past, quite unexpectedly from the point of view of many people at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully asked me to refer to the insurability limit when I was introducing this Bill.  All I can say is that it is before the Government and that there was some brief discussion on it.  I was hoping this would have concluded by today.  I was pressed to mention the limit&mdash;to what limit I will increase the £1,200 at present set down.  I will not mention any figure. <Col N="983" /> I may not get away with the figure I am looking for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assert that the four years we allow non-manual workers over the limit to continue to be eligible for benefit under this Bill fully covers redundant people.  I would say there is no reason to complain on that score.  I had meetings with the Irish Employers' Confederation and with the workers' representatives and it is quite true that I did not give any of them all they wanted.  If I did, I am afraid we would have to raise the amount of the contribution on the one hand while on the other hand we would still have a very great surplus, because some people think we are going too far while others think we are not going far enough.  I have followed a middle course and I do not think we are doing too badly at all.  I thought I was doing very well when the social welfare waiting period was reduced to three days, but Deputies who have spoken did not seem to be satisfied even with that and they asked why should the three days not be abolished.  I am becoming a little tired of the three days in relation to social welfare legislation and one of these days I shall abolish it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In saying that I am not giving away anything but that is my own opinion.  However, there is a reason for all such legislation and in this case the three days act as a deterrent to people claiming benefit because they were ill on one or two days in a week.  They are not likely to make application for payment in respect of sickness of a short duration. The three days period has survived during the lifetime of several Governments here and, like all social <Col N="984" /> welfare benefits, it was introduced by Fianna Fáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended dealing with the question of retrospection at Committee Stage but I can say now that I do not intend making these measures retrospective.  To do this would bring in all sorts of anomalies. If one goes back one week one will be expected to go back two and so on. Who is to fix the date where one should start?  If one were to go back over a period people would say that at one time they were redundant and would have qualified and this would <Col N="985" /> lead to a lot of confusion.  Most of our people are intelligent enough to know whether they qualified and this applied in particular to the four-year period. We could not make it retrospective and go back on the applications we had received.  Many people did not apply because they knew they did not qualify so that they would have to be asked to come in and make application for a time in the past during which they were redundant for a couple of weeks.  Redundancy retrospection is not possible under this Act.</P>
      <P>I thank the House for the fairly good reception that has been given to the Second Reading of this Bill, although it was received with a certain amount of jealousy and, as might be expected, a little prodding to do better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the estimated net cost over and above the existing redundancy payments scheme of (a) relating the lump-sum to twice weekly pay under age 41, (b) relating the lump-sum to twice weekly pay over age 41 and (c) relating the lump-sum to 1½ weekly pay over age 41 (with a lump-sum limit in each case of 30 weeks).</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated annual costs (including employers' costs) of implementing the three proposals referred to by the Deputy are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  £700,000;</P>
      <P>(b)  £420,000;</P>
      <P>(c)  £280,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 60 per cent of each amount would be borne by the redundancy fund.  These estimates do not take into account additional costs which would arise in respect of additional workers who will become eligible for redundancy payments as a result of the changes in conditions as to eligibility provided in the Redundancy Payments Bill, 1970.  The estimates are based on the assumption that experience as to the numbers of redundancies, proportion of men and women, rates of pay, <Col N="883" /><i>et cetera,</i> will be substantially similar to the current situation.</P>
