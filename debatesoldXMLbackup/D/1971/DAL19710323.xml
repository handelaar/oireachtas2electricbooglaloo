    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to reports (details supplied) that there are at present over 70,000 unemployed in the Republic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of 70,000 quoted by the Deputy represents the number on the live register at local employment offices in mid-February, 1971.  It does not represent the total number of genuinely unemployed people because it contains an unknown proportion who are not available for work.  Because of this it is not meaningful to equate the number on the live register with total unemployment as it is generally understood.  As I stated in my reply to questions by Deputies Collins and O'Connell on the 27th January last, the lingering effects of the <Col N="980" /> cement and banks' disputes and the existence of certain structural factors related to improved social welfare payments have tended to increase the live register figures in recent months.  While these effects are now tapering off, it is likely that they still had some influence on the February, 1971, position.  In addition, the economic difficulties of the past year, which have resulted in a slowing down of overall growth, have had an effect.  A factor of importance here has been the rise in costs resulting from excessive income increases, which may have hampered competitiveness in some areas.</P>
      <P>The national pay agreement gives hope that the rise in unit wage costs should not be as great in 1971 as in 1970.  Provided the agreement is observed, the outlook is for a larger rise in the volume of national output in 1971 than in 1970, with consequent improvement in employment opportunities. I should like to reaffirm the Government's view that the solution of the problems of employment and emigration is to be found primarily in the creation of new opportunities for employment in industry.  The rise in employment in industry over the past few years has been substantial and it is Government policy to continue to press ahead with the encouragement of new industry and the expansion of existing industry, and thereby reduce unemployment and emigration to more acceptable levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if the Government will give special consideration to the western region where most of this unemployment exists?  That region has not got any consideration down through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must disagree with the Deputy.  We do give special consideration in many ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned many reasons which, in his view, are responsible for an increase in unemployment. He referred to the banks' dispute and the cement strike.  I think he saved himself when he said that the effects of these were tapering off.  I do not believe they are responsible for the 70,000 unemployed.  Would the Taoiseach <Col N="981" /> now care to comment on the effects of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement on certain of our industries which are either closing down or laying off some hundreds?  Nobody disagrees with the Taoiseach when he says there are more engaged in industrial employment now than there were three years ago but, again, we cannot ignore those who cannot find employment on the land.  The fact is that this is the highest unemployment figure for the last four, five or six years.  The Taoiseach should at least say what the effects of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement have been, particularly on the textile, footwear and motor industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied, as far as the textile industry is concerned, that this is a world-wide problem at the present time.  It applies not only here but in Europe and in the United States also.  I had evidence of that on my recent trip to the States.  The recession in employment in individual firms in the footwear industry is due to structural problems within these firms.  The motor car industry is being well maintained and the present recession in that industry at the Ford plant in Cork is due mainly to the prolonged strike at the Ford factories in Dagenham and in other parts of England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister for Industry and Commerce could tell the Taoiseach what is the effect of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement on the textile trade?  More foreign clothing is being imported into this country now than ever before and this is having a big effect on the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially, the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement had a considerable bolstering effect on the textile industry because of the removal of the restriction on man-made fibres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a factor which was to the advantage of Irish manufactures but in the overall they have lost out because of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I understood the Taoiseach to say that included in this figure of 70,000 was a <Col N="982" /> number who are not generally available for work.  Would the Taoiseach like to be more specific and define this group? Further, would he say whether this category remains static or whether the figure fluctuates from time to time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few categories to which I could refer.  One includes people whose age exceeds 65 years and of whom the total number on the unemployment register is about 5,000.  I think it can be said that in many cases these people are not in a position to take up work.  Also, there are 2,500 farmers and the number of relatives assisting farmers amounts to 8,700.  I am speaking in round figures. I think it will be accepted that not all of these would be able to take up industrial employment of a permanent nature.  There are married women who sign after they have married because by so doing they are entitled to certain benefits.  In many cases they are not available for employment.  There are older redundant workers whose numbers are not available and, as the Deputy is aware, there are also chronically unemployable persons.  These are the main headings.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I asked the Taoiseach whether the group remains static or whether it fluctuates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say it remains relatively static.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> So that it does not affect the overall figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach says that special measures have been taken to provide employment for the West of Ireland, is it appreciated by him that in the main any measures that have been taken have failed to a large extent particularly in relation to the West?  Would the Taoiseach be prepared to give special consideration to that region with a view to solving the problem?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

      <P>I am aware of the provisions of Public Law 91-601 of the US which is enabling legislation permitting the US Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare to make regulations establishing standards for the special packaging of certain substances.</P>
      <P>Legislation on these specific lines is not contemplated here at present.</P>
      <P>I consider that the greatest safeguard against mishaps to children is the vigilance of those in charge.  My strong advice to parents and others is to keep dangerous substances at all times out of the reach of children.  This matter has been emphasised in my Department's leaflet on home hazards. Home accidents will be the theme of a special health education promotion in the autumn in the course of which a revised leaflet will be widely issued emphasising once again the need to take extra precautions to protect the young.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to a report (details supplied) regarding the recent escape of five patients from the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, Dublin; if he will make a statement on the circumstances of the escape; and if he will now hold a public inquiry into the conditions prevailing in that institution with particular reference to security.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I already advised the House, following previous escapes, I set up a group to advise me on the additional measures which were necessary to prevent further escapes.  I received the report of the group on 13th January and I immediately took steps to have their recommendations implemented. Included in their recommendations was the carrying out of certain building works on the wall surrounding the hospital.  Some of this work was being carried out by the Office of Public Works on 11th instant and a ladder was in use.  The Office of Public Works did not advise the hospital staff of the exact nature of the work as it did not regard it as a security risk, owing to the distance from the place where it was being carried out to the places used by patients.  A number of patients were at recreation in the grounds, 150/200 yards from the place where the work was in progress.  A group of six, apparently in accordance with a preconceived <Col N="989" /> plan, suddenly dashed for the ladder and, in spite of the efforts of the hospital and building staff, five succeeded in climbing up the ladder and getting across the wall.</P>
    <P>Let me say that I am very perturbed by these escapes.  I have already had the matter fully investigated by my medical inspectors.  I am not satisfied that the staff of the hospital gave sufficient thought to the possible dangers created by the work in progress, particularly the availability of a ladder within the hospital grounds.  It is easy, however, to have hindsight in a case like this and I have had to look at the matter from all angles.  It must be borne in mind that the patients involved are young and active.  They are of the psychopathic type who are notoriously difficult to treat or manage and they are capable of plotting and of combining together to effect escapes. At the same time they are patients and an effort must be made to treat them as such.  If all were kept continuously locked up in their rooms, or were kept continuously under heavy sedation escapes would be unlikely to occur but then the staff, rightly, would be accused of inhuman treatment.  In trying to draw a reasonable line between what was required in the interests of security and the interests of humane treatment an error of judgement occurred, in my opinion.  I am satisfied, however, that there was no culpable neglect of duty.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have already been made that the Office of Public Works will in future keep the hospital staff fully advised of all work in progress.  I have also drawn the attention of the hospital staff to the need to be particularly vigilant to ensure, as far as possible, that conditions which permit of escapes do not occur again.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is the Minister aware that a report appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 15th instant in which it was stated that members of the staff have stated that there is more security in a kindergarten school than there is in this hospital, that the 45 wardens there have made representations to the Minister with a view to getting the staff strengthened, and that they have also suggested that <Col N="990" /> some of the patients there should be sent back to prison?

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am asking a question.  May I ask the Minister if he is aware that at least a number of the patients who are in this hospital have been sent there by juries in murder trials and that it is quite likely that the juries extended the benefit of the doubt to these patients, having been faced with conflicting medical evidence, with one medical man saying they were insane and another medical man saying they were sane, and that it is quite unreasonable to treat these patients, as apparently the Minister is doing, as ordinary mental patients?</P>

I have already indicated to the House that a revision is being made in relation to some of the people in the hospital as to whether they should be there or in a mental hospital.  It will come up for the decision of myself and the Minister for Justice as to whether it would be possible to transfer certain prisoners to ordinary mental hospitals.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan deserves an answer because he has been studying the matter a long time.  I should like to say for the information of the House that the rules of trade between members of the Community do not have any anti-dumping content.  If an applicant country does not want to join the Community with the rules as they are it need not join.  Negotiations will not change the rules of the Community and no action of mine or of any of the other negotiators would change the rules within the Community.  I have tried to get special treatment for Ireland because of her small island position but this is not available.  I have taken it up again personally since the last time it was raised in this House.  It is not possible for us to get special treatment for Ireland in the Common Market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The options open to me are to accept the rules of the Community as they are or to stay out of it. The Commission and the Community were anxious to make sure that we would be aware of the rules of the Community which would give such protection.  A very extensive study was made by officials from this country with officials of the Community of Articles 7, 85, 86 and 92.  From consultations they have had with people in industry here the officials have confirmed what the Community officials say their experience is namely, that dumping of that type is very rare. There have been 26 cases in the 12 years the Community have been in existence and 22 of these took place in <Col N="996" /> the first four years.  As I say, the Community members themselves already under these rules are quite satisfied that actions of a dumping nature will not take place and are not taking place. The other applicant countries are also satisfied.  The Community are positive that they will not be able to treat any nation differently from the other nine members.  If we are considering whether we should or should not join the Community with its rules, these Articles are there under which we can find protection.  Information available to me from experts in this country about that type of activity is that there is adequate protection in these Articles.</P>

      <P>There is no provision in the Social Welfare Acts that enables benefit to be paid where the contribution <Col N="1002" /> conditions are not satisfied for the reason that contributions have not been paid by employers who have become bankrupt, insolvent or who are in liquidation.  However, as I stated in reply to recent previous questions in this matter I intend at the first opportunity to amend the existing legislation to ensure that no insured person who is himself blameless in the matter will lose benefit solely by reason of an employer's failure or neglect to pay insurance contributions due.  In the meantime I have amended the Statutory Regulations governing the payment and crediting of social insurance contributions to provide, so far as is possible to do so under existing legislation, against loss of benefit by insured persons in the circumstances mentioned by the Deputy.  These amending regulations, while not covering every situation in which loss of benefit could occur in the circumstances mentioned by the Deputy, will have the effect of greatly reducing the number of such cases.</P>

The Government have repeatedly stressed in recent years that rates of increase in earnings in excess of the growth of national production tend to cause inflationary cost and price increases and lessen competitiveness.  To the extent that competitiveness declines there is an automatic reduction of the industrial employment which would otherwise be available.</P>

      <P>Tairgim go léifear an Bille an Dara hUair.</P>
      <P>Is é príomhchuspóir an Bhille seo an uasteorainn a ardú ó £2 mhilliún go £6 mhilliún do na hairleachain as an bPríomh-Chiste chuig Gaeltarra Éireann.  Tá foráil dá réir sin in alt 4.  Uasteorainn £500,000 a leagadh síos sa bhliain 1957 agus ardaíodh í go dtí £2 mhilliún sa bhliain 1965.  Is mithid í a ardú arís anois toisc go bhfuil an £2 mhilliún íoctha le Gaeltarra cheana féin.  Caiteachas caipitil ar fad atá i gceist agus is iad na príomhshuimeanna atá san áireamh go dtí seo ná&mdash;</P>
      <P>£900,000 ar fhoirgnimh agus ar ghléasra do na tionscail atá á reachtáil ag Gaeltarra féin.</P>
      <P>£760,000 ar mhonarchana lena gcur ar cíos, agus</P>
      <P>£340,000 ar scaireanna i gcomhlachtaí ina bhfuil Gaeltarra agus daoine eile i gcomhar lena cheile chun comhthionscail a reachtáil.</P>
      <P>Beidh £4 mhilliún breise ar fáil do na cúrsaí sin faoin mBille seo agus, nuair a bheidh an méid sin caite i gceann tamaill de bhlianta, cuirfear an scéal faoi bhráid na Dála arís.  Ar ndóigh, bíonn caiteachas caipitil i gceist chomh maith sna deontais tionscail a thugann Gaeltarra ó 1965 i leith, agus is amhlaidh a chuirtear an t-airgead sin ar fáil trí Vóta Roinn na Gaeltachta gach bliain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an deis á glacadh chun roinnt leasuithe eile a dhéanamh sa Bhille seo.  Ó 1965 i leith tá cumhacht ag Gaeltarra deontais a thabhairt chun miontionscadail shomhaoineacha a chur chun cinn&mdash;gan dul i bpáirtíocht leis na daoine ina mbun.  Bhí uasteorainn £2,000 leis na deontais sin ar dtús agus ardaíodh í go dtí £10,000 sa bliain <Col N="1018" /> 1968.  Anois, le halt 2 (a) den Bhille, tá an uasteorainn á cur ar ceal ionas go mbeidh Gaeltarra in ann tionscail bheaga a bhreithniú faoi mar a dhéanann an tÚdarás Forbartha Tionscail agus deontais níos mó ná £10,000 a thabhairt i gcásanna cuí.  Ar ndóigh, níl i gceist go dtabharfadh Gaeltarra agus an tÚdarás Forbartha Tionscail deontais sa chás céanna agus tá sé sin á chinntiú le halt 2 (b).</P>
    <P>Tá foráil thábhachtach eile in alt 5 den Bhille chun go bhféadfaidh údaráis áitiúla dhá thrian de na rátaí a mhaitheamh go ceann deich mbliana ar áitribh thionscail is ábhar cúnaimh ó Ghaeltarra&mdash;faoi mar atá i bhfeidhm d'áitribh a sholáthraítear i limistéir ainmnithe le cúnamh ón Údarás Forbartha Tionscail.  Baineann an fhoráil seo le háitribh a tógadh, a méadaíodh nó a feabhsaíodh ó leathnaíodh cumhachtaí Ghaeltarra sa bhliain 1965.  Bhí faoiseamh ó rátaí le fáil cheana go ceann tréimhse nach faide ná seacht mbliana, faoi na hAchtanna Rialtais Áitiúil (Luacháil a Laghdú go Sealadach), 1954 go 1970, ach tá na hAchtanna sin ag dul in éag.</P>
    <P>Le cúig bliana anuas níor ceapadh aon chomhalta de Bhord Gaeltarra ina stiúrthóir bainistí: is amhlaidh a fágadh faoin mbord bainisteoir ginearálta a fhostú agus leanfar den nós imeachta sin.  Dá réir sin tá na tagairtí do stiúrthóir bainistí á mbaint amach as an Acht bunaidh le halt 3 den Bhille.</P>
    <P>Sin a bhfuil d'fhorálacha sa Bhille seo seachas mínithe in alt 1 agus gearrtheideal agus comhlua in alt 6. Ach beidh an Dáil ag súil le heolas uaim faoin dul chun cinn atá á dhéanamh ó tugadh cumhachtaí breise do Ghaeltarra.</P>
    <P>Luaigh mé cheana na deontais&mdash; nach dtéann thar £10,000 go dtí seo&mdash; a thugann Gaeltarra chun miontionscadail shomhaoineacha a chur chun sinn gan dul i bpáirtíocht leis na daoine a bhíonn ina mbun: tá breis agus céad de na miondeontais sin ceadaithe. Luaigh mé freisin na comhlachtaí ina mbíonn scaireanna ag Gaeltarra i gcomhar le daoine eile chun comhthionscail a reachtáil: tá sé cinn déag de na comhthionscail sin bunaithe, nó le bunú go luath, agus tá eolas foilsithe <Col N="1019" /> cheana faoina bhformhór.  Ba mhaith liom glacadh leis an deis seo chun na cúig cinn is déanaí a fhógairt&mdash; comhthionscail a thabharfaidh fostaíocht do chúpla céad duine ar ball má éiríonn go maith leo :&mdash;</P>
    <P>diansaothrú gairneoireachta i gceantar Bhaile an Sceilg;</P>
    <P>muisiriúin i nGaeltacht na Mí agus i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe;</P>
    <P>earraí plaisteacha a dhéanamh ar an gCeathrú Rua;</P>
    <P>comhpháirteanna do thithe réamhdhéanta a tháirgeadh ar an gCeathrú Rua; agus</P>
    <P>biúró ríomhaireachta sna Forbacha.</P>
    <P>Na tionscail, idir mhór agus bheag, a bhfuil cúnamh ceadaithe ag Gaeltarra dóibh le blianta beaga anuas meastar, ach iad a bheith faoi lánseol, go gcuirfidh siad fostaíocht bhreise lánaimsire ar fáil do suas le 1,500 cainteoir Gaeilge ina gceantair dhúchais.  Is ábhar spéise é go bhfuil níos mó daoine fostaithe cheana sna tionscail sin ná mar atá sna tionscail atá á reachtáil ag Gaeltarra féin.</P>
    <P>Is é mo thuairimse gurb é tuilleadh fostaíochta fós príomhriachtanas na Gaeltachta ag an bpointe seo.  Dá bhrí sin tá lánfhostaíocht sna seachtóidí do na cainteoirí Gaeilge leagtha amach mar chuspóir agam agus tá iarrtha agam ar Ghaeltarra plean chuige sin a ullmhú agus a chur chugam a luaithe is féidir.  Is mar chabhair chun plean mar sin a chur i bhfeidhm atá mé ag iarraidh ar an Dáil glacadh leis an mBille seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim failte roimh an mBille.  Is mór an trua nach raibh a leithéid ann 50 nó 40 bliain ó shin.  Dá mbeadh b'fhéidir nach mbeadh an Ghaeltacht chomh beag is atá sí anois. Ag éisteacht leis an Aire cheapfadh éinne go raibh gach rud i gceart sa Ghaeltacht.  Go deimhin, ní mar sin atá. Caithidh gach duine a admháil go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag dul i laghad agus cén fá?  Im thuairimse agus i dtuairim Chomhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge agus Chonradh na Gaeilge easpa oibre is cúis leis.  Bunaíodh Gaeltarra Éireann sa bhliain 1956 agus is é an cuspóir a bhí aige an Ghaeltacht a <Col N="1020" /> choimeád beo ach is amhlaidh atá sí á bánú.  Cén fá arís?  Sin í an cheist.  An é easpa airgid a bhí ag Gaeltarra Éireann nó easpa misnigh ag na daoine atá i gceannas?  Níor tháinig aon athrú ar dhaonra Dhún na nGall agus deinim comhgáirdeachas le Gaeltarra Éireann i dtaobh na contae sin mar tá cúpla monarcha i nDún na nGall.  Is mór an trua nach bhfuil ach trí lá oibre sa tseachtain ag na cailíní agus na buachaillí atá ag obair sna monarchan úd.</P>
      <P>Níl a fhios agam cén fá nár dhein Gaeltarra Éireann rud éigin ar son Gaeltacht Chiarraí.  Tá rud éigin á dhéanamh i gcás Bhaile na Sceilge.  Is mithid dúinn i gCiarraí rud éigin d'fháil ó Ghaeltarra Éireann.  Cén fá nár dheineadar rud éigin do Chorca Dhuibhne?  Muna ndeintear rud éigin go tapaidh ní bheidh Gaeltacht ann faoi cheann cúig bliain mar ní bheidh fágtha ach daoine aosta agus paistí scoile. Chíonn na paistí scoile an bochtanas atá mór-thimpeall agus ní bheidh siad sásta fanacht ann nuair a fhágann siad an scoil.  Caithfidh siad dul go Baile Átha Cliath nó London.  Níl an seansprid i muintir na Gaeltachta.  Molaim don Aire rud éigin a dhéanamh chun an misneach a mhúscailt iontu arís.  Tá seanfhocal ann ar bhain mé úsáid as cheana: ní chothaíonn na briathra na bráithre.  Tá súil agam go bhfuil a fhios ag gach Teachta cad is brí leis an seanfhocal seo, sé sin, go bhfuil caint bhreá bhog do na daoine sa Ghaeltacht ach níl an caighdeán ceart acu in aon chor ar an bpointe seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh don laghdú mór a tháinig ar an daonra ó 1926 go dtí na seascaidí i gcuid de na ceantair ar tugadh &ldquo;Fíor-Ghaeltacht&rdquo; orthu sa bhliain 1926.  I gContae an Chláir i 1926 ba é 3,434 an líon daoine san Fhíor-Ghaeltacht sin; i 1946 bhí sé síos go dtí 2,934; i 1961, bhí sé sin síos go dtí 2,451.  Anois tá sé níos lú arís.  I gContae Chiarraí san Fhíor-Ghaeltacht chéanna: i 1926 bhí 25,384; i 1946, 19,292; i 1962, 15,184. Tá a fhios ag an Aire go bhfuil sé i bhfad níos lú anois.  I gContae Mhaigh Eo, i 1926 bhí 24,723; i 1946, 23,137; i 1961, 19,265 agus ag an bpointe seo tá sé níos ísle arís.  I gContae na Gaillimhe: 1926, 51,660; i 1946, 48,395; i 1961, 42,854.  Is léir ó na <Col N="1021" /> figiúirí sin nach mbeidh aon Ghaeltacht ann fá cheann 20 bliain eile má leanann an scéal amhlaidh.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh an tAire agus an Rialtas cás speisialta a dhéanamh de na contaethe seo a leanas&mdash; Ciarraí, Corcaigh, Portláirge, an Chlár, Gaillimh, Muigheo, Dún na nGall agus de Chontae ar bith ina bhfuil Gaeltacht. Caithfear &ldquo;advance factories&rdquo;&mdash;ní raibh an téarma sin ann in aon chor nuair a bhí an Ghaoluinn ann ar dtús &mdash;a chur sna háiteanna sin.  Ní ceart gach rud a chur go dtí Cúige Laighean mar caithfidh na daoine maireachaint i gContae Mhuigheo, i gContae na Gaillimhe, i gContae Chiarraí, i gContae Chorcaigh, i gContae an chlár agus i gContae Dhún na nGall. Ba cheart don Aire daoine a bhfuil monarcha acu a ghríosadh agus a mhealladh chun dul isteach sna háitteanna atá luaite agam.</P>
    <P>Chun na daoine a choimeád sa Ghaeltacht ní mór, mar adubhairt an tAire, obair a chur ar fáil dóibh.  Tá an Ghaoluinn go maith ag an Aire agus tá a fhios agam go raibh an tAire mór-thimpeall na Gaeltachta le déanaí agus is dócha go bhfaca sé féin cad a bhí bun os cionn agus cad a bhí air a dhéanamh.  Tá ceist agam le cur chuige.  An bhfuil cuid den airgead seo caite cheana féin?  Cé go bhfuil Gaeltarra Éireann ag déanamh rudaí maithe don Ghaeltacht, go mór mhór i gContae Dhún na nGall agus i gContae Mhuigheo&mdash;agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil roinnt mhaith déanta acu i gContae na Gaillimhe&mdash;níl mé cinnte go bhfuiltear ag caitheamh an airgead i gceart nuair atáid ag tabhairt airgead d'óstáin.  Tá óstán sa Daingean againn agus fuair na daoine a chuir suas é timpeall 35% ón mBord Fáilte, 25 faoin gcéad ó Roinn na Gaeltachta nó 20 faoin gcéad agus 25 faoin gcéad arís den mhéid a bhí fágtha ó Ghaeltarra Éireann.  Thug an Rialtas suas le 70 faoin gcéad.  Nuair a chaitheadh an méid sin airgid ar an óstán ba cheart don Stát an óstán a choimeád dó féin.</P>
    <P>Deinim comhgáirdeachas leo gur chuireadar an óstán ann ach siúd is go bhfuil 65 faoin gcéad nó 70 faoin gcéad den airgead tar éis teacht ón Stát ba cheart an óstán a bheith ag Gaeltarra <Col N="1022" /> Éireann.  Sin é mo thuairim.  Níl sé ceart do dhaoine nach bhfuil sa Ghaeltacht&mdash;nílim chun aon duine a ainmniú, ní gá é&mdash;an méid sin airgid a thabhairt dóibh mar nuair a d'osclaíodar an óstán do thugadar geallúint&mdash;ní raibh an tAire ann an lá sin; níl a fhios agam cé bhí ann&mdash;do na daoine a bhí ann go rabhadar chun na cailíní go léir a bhí ag obair ann a choimeád ag obair sa Gheimhreadh ag déanamh &ldquo;souvenirs&rdquo; agus bréagán.  Bhí ar na cailíní dul go dtí an &ldquo;labour exchange&rdquo; le dhá bhliain anuas mar nach raibh aon ní ar siúl san óstán agus ní fheadar sa diail nuair a fuaireadar an tairgead i dtosach ar thugadar an gheallúint úd don Rialtas go rabhadar chun obair a chur ar fáil do na buachaillí agus do na cailíní i rith na bliana go léir.  Níl a fhios agam. B'fhéidir go mbeidh ar chumas an Aire freagra a thabhairt dom.</P>
    <P>Táim a rá arís nach bhfuil mé ag cur mhilleáin ar éinne ach nuair a thug an Stát an oiread sin airgid ba cheart do Ghaeltarra Éireann an óstán a bheith acu féin.</P>
    <P>Chun an Ghaeilge a shlánú caithfimid sprid a chur sna daoine arís agus is é mo ghuí go mbeidh Gaeltarra Éireann in ann an sprid sin d'athbheochan mar tá sé ann agus má tá siad ábalta é sin a dhéanamh beimid go léir buíoch díobh.  Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille agus is é mo ghuí go mbeidh Gaeltarra Éireann ábalta an Ghaeltacht a shlánú mar níl ach cúpla bliain fágtha chun é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words in English now.  Even though the Minister gave us a short note in English on his speech I think he should have spoken in English even briefly.  He may think otherwise. There are many Deputies in this House who are not as lucky as the Minister and I in that we know Irish who would, for purely national reasons, support this Bill, and who would speak in English if the Minister had said a few words in English.  If we are ever to get a break-through with the Irish language we must realise that we will always be a bilingual nation speaking Irish and English.  That is quite clear to everyone. Perhaps the next time the Minister is introducing such a Bill he will say a few words in English because I <Col N="1023" /> should like more Deputies to participate in a debate like this since it is important from the point of view of our culture and heritage.</P>
    <P>At this stage we have reached the cross-roads so far as the Gaeltacht is concerned.  I welcome this Bill and I am delighted that the Minister has brought it in, because it shows that he is sincere so far as the Gaeltacht is concerned.  I want to place that on record.  I know that so long as he and his Parliamentary Secretary are there, there will be some advancements in relation to the Gaeltacht.  This Bill is a step in the right direction.  I believe that if the Gaeltachta are to survive we will have to have a crash programme from Donegal down to Kerry.</P>
    <P>I gave the House certain population statistics during the past ten minutes or so.  It is obvious from those figures, and from the trends, that we are now working to a time limit so far as the Gaeltachta are concerned.  I know the Minister will treat the matter urgently. Even though there are good organisations in the Gaeltacht too many people are setting themselves up as authorities. There are too many Irish organisations and they appear to be at cross-purposes with one another.  The Minister might try to get all these organisations together under the one umbrella because it is about time we had one voice from the Gaeltacht.  Too many people are telling the Minister and everybody else how the Gaeltacht will survive despite the fact that the only time they spend there is during their summer holidays.  If the Gaeltacht is to survive advance factories will have to be set up.  Under this Bill the Minister is looking for a certain sum of money. I do not know whether that money has already been spent or promised to people, but I hope he will build advance factories in Galway, Mayo, Donegal, Kerry and the remaining Gaeltacht in Clare.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that Gaeltarra Éireann seem to ignore my own Gaeltacht.  I do not know why.  As far as I am concerned the people there have as good a knowledge of Irish as people in other parts of the country. If something is not done to keep Irish <Col N="1024" /> speakers at home and encourage them to make their livelihood in the Gaeltacht the Gaeltacht will die out in Kerry just as it has done in Clare because things are reaching a crisis level in West Kerry.  I particularly welcome the industry to Ballinskellig, because like West Kerry, it seems to be dying a peaceful death.  This new industry might revitalise the place so that people will want to get married and settle down there.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for bringing in this Bill, which is long overdue.  If he wants further money he should not hesitate to ask the House. The seventies will be either the making or breaking of the Gaeltacht.  If we do not do something within the next nine years, I believe future generations will curse this Dáil for not acting despite the fact that we knew the Gaeltacht was dying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Níl mórán taithí agamsa faoi láthair i labhairt ár dteanga ach mar sin féin ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo agus ár mbuíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire mar gheall air.  Tá a fhios againn go léir go bhfuil a chroí sáite san obair seo agus is deas a léamh i ndeireadh an méid a dúirt sé:</P>
      <P>Dá bhrí sin tá lánfhostaíocht sna seachtóidí do na cainteoirí Gaeilge leagtha amach mar chuspóir agam...</P>
      <P>Tá sé sin i bhfad níos fearr ná an cuspóir a bhí ag an NIEC ceithre bhliain ó shin nó mar sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will not be debated with any acrimony.  Everybody's heart will <Col N="1025" /> be with the Minister in the hope that he will be able to achieve something by the Bill.  If time permits we should have an opportunity of debating a slightly different aspect of this in the Vote for Roinn na Gaeltachta next week.  Deputy Begley rightly drew attention to the many voices each of which thinks he has the greatest solution to the Irish language or the resurrection of the Gaeltacht and yet all the time the Gaeltacht is becoming weaker and weaker.  Even if we include in the Gaeltacht parts of the country which are called Breac-Ghaeltacht we find it is only a very limited part of the country now.</P>
    <P>This additional £4 million is a modest sum when compared with the amounts of money spent in other industries. Judging from the figures the Minister has given us the cost of putting an additional person in employment in the Gaeltacht has in recent years been much less than in other parts of the country.  I should like to see one major industry in each Gaeltacht area.  We have had toy factories which succeeded in the beginning but usually faded out.  This is not much good.  We want sizable industries in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that Gaeltarra Éireann is to be allowed to exceed the £10,000 limit in the case of industries outside its own control.  In other words, Gaeltarra Éireann will be able to make advances greater than £10,000.  I certainly should hope so.  As the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Is ábhair spéise é go bhfuil níos mó daoine fostaithe cheana sna tionscail sin ná mar atá sna tionscail atá a reachtúil ag Gaeltarra féin.</P>
    <P>It certainly is, because although Gaeltarra Éireann was set up as a separate semi-State body at the time of the establishment of the Department it has not really done very well, to put it mildly.  I do not know the reason for that.  There were times when it looked as though there was a market for the tweeds and toys produced by them but something seems always to happen and they fade away again.  I would hope that the Minister's achievements will equal his hopes.  All my heart is in this <Col N="1026" /> as I would hope the Minister's heart is in it.  I hope that he will succeed in stopping to some extent the gradual wearing away of the Gaeltacht.  There is no use in anybody pretending in this year of 1971 that any of us any longer believes that a real growth in the Gaeltacht is possible but the Minister certainly has the goodwill of everybody in this House in relation to this Bill.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom déileáil leis an bpointe a d'ardaigh an Teachta Ó Beaglaoich nuair a d'iarr sé orm roinnt den óráid a thabhairt as Béarla.  Is dóigh liom go dtuigeann na Teachtaí nach bhfuil aon olc ormsa chuig na Teachtaí a labhrann Béarla agus aontaím leis an Teachta gurbh é an t-aon aidhm réadúil d'fhéadfadh bheith againn, go ceann tamaill mhaith ar aon nós, ná tír dhátheangach a bheith againn.  San am céanna, má chuirtear an méid Béarla a labhartar sa Teach seo i gcomparáid leis an méid Gaeilge a labhartar, níl sé iomarcach dom labhairt i nGaeilge amháin nuair atá mé ag déileáil le cúrsaí Roinn na Gaeltachta sa Teach seo ar an mbonn, ar ndóigh, mar adúirt an Teachta, go bhfuil cóip den óráid curtha trimpeall agam i mBéarla agus go gceapaim go dtuigeann gach Teachta atáa sa Teach anois&mdash;ar aon nós an chuid is mó de bhaill an Tí seo&mdash;go dtuigeann siad an Ghaeilge gan aon dua.  Tá easpa taithí ag cuid acu maidir le labhairt na Gaeilge ach is dóigh liom go dtuigeann siad go léir céard tá á rá agam.  Dá bhrí sin, ba mhaith liom Gaeilge amháin a labhairt sa díospóireacht seo agus ní de dheasca olc a bheith orm chuig na daoine a labhrann Béarla.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom go dtuigfí nach ceapaimse go bhfuil an scéal ar fad i gceart sa Ghaeltacht i láthair na huaire.  Luaigh an Teachta Ó Beaglaoich gur thagair mé do na monarchana atá á dtógáil agus do na mílte punt&mdash;le fírinne na milliúin phunt&mdash; atá á gcaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht ach níor mhaith liom go gceapfadh aon duine go gceapaim féin go bhfuil gach rud ina cheart sa Ghaeltacht.  Ní cheapaim sin.  San am céanna níl mé gan dóchas.  Tá dul chun cinn anmhór déanta sa Ghaeltacht le blianta beaga anuas agus is maith an rud é <Col N="1027" /> go dtuigfimis é sin agus go n-aithneoimis go bhfuil an scéal amhlaidh. Cuidíonn sé le sprid na ndaoine sa Ghaeltacht ar thagair an Teachta Ó Beaglaoich di.  Bhí an ceart aige.  Gan sprid a mhúscailt sna daoine ní thig linn mórán a dhéanamh, ach cuidíonn fírinne an scéil&mdash;maidir leis an dul chun cinn atá déanta&mdash;leis an sprid sin.  Is é mo thuairim féin, agus tuairim roinnt mhaith daoine ar labhair mé leo faoin scéal seo, go bhfuil sprid na ndaoine sa Ghaeltacht múscailte cuid mhaith in áiteanna áirithe níos mó ná in áiteanna eile agus, le fírinne, ní féidir múscailt sprid mhuintir na Gaeltachta a thomhas de réir an chlampair a dhéanann daoine áirithe: ní ionann sin agus sprid.  San cheantar óna dtagann an Teachta Ó Beaglaoich tá feabhas mór i sprid na ndaoine D'fhéadfadh sé bheith níos fearr.  Tá sé i bhfad níos fearr ná mar a bhí sé abair 15 nó 20 bliain ó shin.</P>
    <P>Thagair an Teachta do réamhmhonarchana nó &ldquo;advance factories&rdquo;. Tá sé fíorthábhachtach go mbeadh a leithéid ar fáil sa Ghaeltachta.  Chreid mé é sin i gcónaí mar Aire Tionscail agus Tráchtála toisc go raibh sé antábhachtach tionscail a mhealladh go dtí ceantair áirithe.  Ach ba mhaith liom go mbeadh a fhios ag an Teach go bhfuil siad á gcur ar fáil cheana sa Gaeltacht.  Le fírinne, bhí ceann á chur ar fáil ar an gCeathrú Rua ach fuarthas tionscail dó sula raibh sé críochnaithe agus ní réamh-mhonarcha a bhí ann a tuilleadh! Agus tá ceann le cur ar fáil i gCorca Dhuibhne go han-luath: tá an talamh ceannaithe ag Gaeltarra.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh áthas ar an Teachta Ó Beaglaoich é sin a chloisint.  Níor mhaith liom ach oiread go gceapfadh sé nach bhfuil aon rud eile déanta i gCorca Dhuibhne mar tá rudaí tábhachtacha déanta ann.</P>
    <P>Go háirithe, rinne sé tagairt d'óstáin. Mar is eol dó tá óstán agus roinnt seallaí tógtha ar an mBaile Uachtarach cóngarach do Bhaile an Fheirtéaraigh agus, chomh fada agus is féidir liomsa a fheiscint, is tionscal an-mhaith ar fad atá san óstán agus sna sealaí sin i gceartlár na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>Sin é díreach an rud atá á rá agam.  Thug mé treoir, agus tá sé á leanúint, nach gcaithfí airgead Gaeltachta taobh amuigh den fhíor-Ghaeltacht murab amhlaidh nach raibh aon dul as.  Is é sin, gur cóir an t-airgead atá á chur ar fáil ag an Teach seo don Ghaeltacht a chaitheamh san fhíor-Ghaeltacht amháin.  Tagann cásanna deacra os ár gcomhair dá bharr sin.  Níl sé éasca an treoir a chur i bhfeidhm i gcónaí ach is dócha go n-aontódh an Teach liom go bhfuil an prionsabal ceart.  Sin é an fáth gur thagair mé don óstán sin mar tá daoine áirithe a deir gurb é an feachtas is measa ag Gaeltarra Éireann nó ag Roinn na Gaeltachta feachtas seo na n-óstán.  Tá a fhios agam gurb an chúis a deirtear é sin cuid acu a bheith ar imeall na Gaeltachta.  Tá dream beag a deir nach cóir airgead a chaitheamh ar óstáin ar chor ar bith.  Léiríonn an t-óstán a luaigh mé ar an mBaile Uachtarach an méid is féidir a dhéanamh le hóstán istigh san fhíor-Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Is cóir go mbeadh sé soléir, ach déanann daoine a bhíonn ag plé le ceist na Gaeltachta dearmad air seo go minic, go bhfuil na fadhbanna céanna eacnamaíochta ag goilliúint ar roinnt ceantar bocht sa Ghalltacht agus atá ag goilliúint ar an nGaeltacht.  Is iad na fadhbanna ceanann céanna atá ag goilliúint orthu araon.  An t-airgead atá á chur ar fáil don Ghaeltacht faoi Roinn na Gaeltachta agus Gaeltarra Éireann tá sé á chur ar fáil ar an mbonn go bhfuil sé ag cuidiú leis an Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Dá brí sin, ní sé cheart ag aon cheantar nach fíor-Ghaeltacht é greim a fháil ar an airgead sin a chuirtear ar fáil don Ghaeltacht.  Sin é an chúis ar thug mé an treoir úd don Roinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá rud amháin eile ar mhaith liom é a lua.  Dúirt mé go raibh mé dóchasach go leor.  Luaigh mé go bhfuilimid ag iarraidh plean a leagan amach chun lánfhostaíocht a chur ar fáil.  Tá roinnt mhaith déanta cheana féin ach caithfear an rud a phleanáil i gceart agus tá súil agam go mbeimid in ann an plean seo a chur ar fáil go luath agus ní theastaíonn uaim rialacha an Tí a threasnú trí dhul isteach i gceisteanna eile a bhaineann leis an nGaeltacht a <Col N="1029" /> chothú.  Séard a theastaíonn uaim a rá ná seo&mdash;go bhfuil cruthúnas ann cheanna féin i gceantair áirithe i dTír Chonaill ní amháin go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht a cothú ach go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag fás.  Tá ceantair ansin, a bhí ina mBreac-Ghaeltacht ar imeall fíorGhaeltachta, ina bhfuil i bhfad níos mó Gaeilge á labhairt anois ná mar a bhí deich mblian ó shin.  Tá cúpla cúis leis sin ach is é an phríomhchúis go bhfuil feabhas mór tagtha ar chúrsaí fostaíochta agus go bhfuil monarchana curtha ar fáil.  Ba mhaith liom go dtuigfeadh na Teachtaí go bhfuil léirithe san áit sin gur féidir an Ghaeltacht ní amháin a chothú ach a fhorbairt.  Is deimhin linn, mar sin, go n-éireoidh go maith linn má leanaimid an cúrsa atá leagtha amach againn.  Má éiríonn linn lánfhostaíocht a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht sna seachtóidí, mar aon leis na céimeanna eile atá á dtógáil ach nach bhfuilimid á bplé anois, níl aon amhras ormsa ná gur féidir an Ghaeltacht a fhorbairt.  Dá bhrí sin tá an-áthas ormsa go bhfuil léirithe ag na Teachtaí a labhair thar ceann an dá pháirtí san Fhreasúra go bhfuil fáilte roimh an mBille seo agus go bhfuil áthas orthu dul chun cinn a fheiscint sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá sé sin ag teacht go maith leis an spéis sa Ghaeltacht atá ag tromlach mór an phobail.  Tá dóchas láidir agam gur féidir an-dul chun cinn a dhéanamh sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá mé sásta go gcuideoidh an Bille seo leis an mbeartas sin a chur i gcrích.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points on which I wish to conclude.  I was discussing television and its impact on our society.  We should voice our views on what we would like to see on television.  There is a dearth of drama on television.  I know it can be costly putting on plays but, before the advent of television, Radio Éireann put on plays every Sunday night and it encouraged a great interest in drama.  We might help our dramatists and engender love for the theatre if the RTE Authority encouraged plays on television, particularly Irish plays.</P>
      <P>Television has a great role to play in schools and I am amazed that greater use is not being made of it.  Television is being used at certain hours of the morning but very few schools avail of it.  I have inquired and any schools I have asked do not have these programmes in their schools in the morning. I would like to see certain subjects such as civics and languages taught on television.  These language courses could be extended to adults at night. If Ireland is to participate in the EEC foreign languages will become a very important part of our lives.  I do not think this would involve a tremendous expenditure.  The BBC have available foreign language TV courses and these could be acquired by RTE.  Television should also be used for basic medical education and education in hygiene. For instance, mothers of children could be informed on basic matters by qualified persons.</P>
      <P>The Bunny Carr programme, &ldquo;Encounter&rdquo;, which I saw last Sunday night is a magnificent programme.  It was very informative and gave plenty of scope for thought.  I would like to see more such programmes.  I fail to see why it should be confined to one night a week.  These programmes are discussed for days afterwards and RTE should have regard to the presentation of programmes which are useful and informative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately we are inclined to forget the radio, especially in the city. <Col N="1036" /> Radio should be used to impart information from local authorities.  I asked the Minister for Local Government some years ago about the possibility of radio being used to provide necessary information about housing and so on. I would also like to have more hospitals' request programmes on the radio. I have vivid memories of the radio during the war years when hospitals' request programmes were important to so many people in the sanatoria and other hospitals.  Unfortunately it was only broadcast once a week.  I remember on one occasion there were so many people requesting a particular tune that by the time the announcer got around to reading all the names it was almost three o'clock and there was no time to play the record.  This programme is a valuable link with people in hospitals and should be more frequent.  We should also establish a link with our exiles through a programme like the BBC programme, &ldquo;Forces Favourites&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>We do indeed.  I am delighted the Deputy said that.  I was travelling recently from Dublin to Galway.  I could hear the BBC and I could hear Luxembourg but I could not hear RTE although I tried every wavelength.  I do agree with the Deputy that there is need for something to be done about this.</P>
      <P>In regard to the circulation of the <i>RTE Guide</i> when RTE are increasing their fee, perhaps they would increase it to a figure that would include the <i>RTE Guide</i> so that everyone who paid his fee would receive a copy of each issue of that publication.  Perhaps this would involve a controlled circulation but it would be a tremendous boost and I doubt if licence holders would object to the extra charge to cover this service.</P>

      <P>I understand the fees are to be increased anyway and I am suggesting that there be an all-inclusive fee to cover the cost of the <i>RTE Guide.</i> This would result in extra revenue to the Authority and, also, <Col N="1037" /> they could very justifiably increase the rates for advertising in the Guide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>On this question of RTE, there is a dissident in the Government Party.  Since multi-channel television has been mentioned, I might say that I have noticed the Minister's agreement in relation to piped television. RTE as a contractor are about to provide this.  However, I have had complaints from many people in Ballymun in this regard.  The residents in one area signed a contract with RTE and it was agreed with the association that piped television would be provided by September last.  This was not done and since then they have heard nothing about the matter.  If RTE are serious in this regard and if they wish to enter this field of contracting, they must remember that they will be in competition with private contractors and, therefore, they should make every effort to ensure that they can compete with private contractors.</P>
      <P>In my area, also, I noticed that forms were circulated by RTE for completion by householders but nothing has happened since.  I am wondering whether the Authority are geared to provide this service and, if they are so geared, why they are not providing it? It seems such a pity to forego such a valuable source of revenue.  If RTE do not provide the service, people will become impatient and will avail of private contractors who are vying hard with one another to secure these contracts.</P>
      <P>On the question of public telephones, I recall that the Minister had a change of heart last year and said that public phones were being considered from the point of view of providing a social service rather than being an economic proposition.  I am amazed that that fact was admitted by the Minister only last year because, obviously, public telephones should be available to persons who have not private telephones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had occasion recently to comment on the condition of public telephones in my area.  These have been out of action for many months.  Anybody who is lucky enough to have a private telephone <Col N="1038" /> installed can have no conception of the inconvenience that is caused when public telephones are out of order.  It must be frustrating in an emergency to find that one's local public telephone cannot be used.  I am wondering how often public telephones are inspected.  As soon as they go out of action, they should be repaired.  One public telephone can serve 500 families. If there is repetitive vandalism in the case of any particular telephone, the Department should see to it that the apparatus is installed elsewhere or that a phone is made available at some private house for which some concession could be given to the householder. I notice that by the canal at Inchicore there is merely a shell of one telephone kiosk.  It is a pity that no alternative measures are taken by the Department to combat this vandalism.  The result of this is that local residents are victimised.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider seriously the provision of more public telephones.  They are vital in many areas and especially in housing areas where there are usually a lot of children and where there is a high incidence of illness which often necessitates calling a doctor during the night.</P>
    <P>I might remind the Minister that while we can usually make a phone call to any part of Great Britain with the least possible trouble, it is often very difficult to get through to Donegal or to some place in the west of Ireland. This results because of the fact that the call must go through a number of exchanges.  This problem is a deterrent to industries who might otherwise be encouraged to set up business in these areas.  A telephone link with Europe and Britain would be of great importance. The lack of a proper telephone service would be regarded as a major problem.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to phone the Department about two years ago in connection with the installation of an internal telephone system in a small business and I was astonished when I was told that the post office had not got the equipment in stock.  The Department of Social Welfare have not been able to have a proper exchange installed because of the long delays in the provision of equipment.  On the <Col N="1039" /> occasion on which I telephoned on behalf of the person who required the system for his business&mdash;that was in March&mdash;I was told that supplies had run out the previous September.  I asked what would be done and the reply I received was: &ldquo;We will get around to ordering it.&rdquo;  The Department must be able to compete with private contractors.  They are losing out all the time because these contracts are a source of considerable revenue.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the introduction here of &ldquo;collect&rdquo; telephone calls. Sometimes people may find themselves away from home and not having the money to phone their homes.  If this system were in operation such people could make their phone calls and charge them to the home account.  This system is in operation in Great Britain and America and I see no reason why we could not have it here.  We should not lag so far behind other advanced countries in matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>I have been wondering about the business directory, which is a very good book.  How much revenue accrues to the Department from it?  It is a very valuable source of revenue but we have no information about it. Why not?  Every page is worth money. For how long were the royalties granted to a British firm?  I would think there is a lot of money in it for the Department.  The Minister is laughing. I am suggesting ways whereby the Department could make money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a serious statement I have made but I can substantiate it without any difficulty.  The initial cost of installing a telephone is a terrible deterrent to anyone who is seriously considering having a telephone installed.  It is unjust and immoral to ask for such a fee at the outset.  I realise that the Department have to recoup the money in some way. It should be recouped over a number of years.  I do not believe that the Department are encouraging people to move into this age of telephonic communications. They seem to be trying to stop people from availing of this service. It is a terrible burden on anybody to have to pay that amount.  It was a retrograde step on the part of the Department to introduce the system under which so much is paid in advance. When I think of the way private firms can do it, I wonder why the Department cannot.  When I was in the United States I applied for a telephone in the morning and I had it that afternoon. It cost me £2 10s a month and I did not pay a penny for local calls. That was a private company operating in a town with a population of 69,000. I would appeal to the Minister to consider some other way of getting this money rather than to charge such an exorbitant amount initially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer now to the question of postal deliveries.  The Minister's predecessor said that the question of the public providing post boxes on the <Col N="1041" /> side of the road was very important especially in the rural areas.  He said he might be forced to compel people to do this.  He will have to do this, and it should be done.  We should adopt the system that operates elsewhere. People provide their own post boxes and this makes it easier for the postmen to effect deliveries.  I hasten to disagree with Deputy Tully on the question of early morning deliveries. We live in a very competitive age and there must be early morning deliveries because businesses must be able to operate.  They cannot wait until 9.30 or 10 in the morning to start their business.</P>
    <P>We might be able to streamline the delivery offices.  This should be considered seriously.  An advertisement by the Department for clerical positions for boys and girls between the ages of 15½ and 17½ was brought to my attention recently.  I did not see the advertisement but I got a telephone call about it.  Most of the applicants will come from rural areas.  We advocate that the school leaving age should be 16 years.  I am also wondering about the salary which is offered to these boys and girls coming from rural areas. Is it commensurate with the cost of living and will it enable these people to live in Dublin?  This disturbed the person who took the trouble to telephone me about it and I should like to know about it also.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that girls working in sub-post offices had to attend courses on decimalisation in their own time and at their own expense? It was brought to my attention that they found this extremely difficult. I know the Minister has no control over the sub-post offices but it seems very unfair that those girls, who had to acquaint themselves with decimalisation, should have had to pay their own expenses and give up their own time. They should have got some allowance.</P>
    <P>Would it be possible for the Minister to consider streamlining many of the sub-post offices?  Perhaps if they were larger they would be more efficient and provide a better service for the public.  The Minister might consider this.  The week before last I was prevailing upon him to use more initiative <Col N="1042" /> and to have a little more vision and imagination.  When he leaves that Department I hope he will have left his mark on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputies for the way in which they received this Supplementary Estimate and discussed it and for the tributes paid to the staff.  At the outset I should like to say that I am greateful to Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins for her expression of good wishes to me personally as well as for her contribution to the debate which was on the whole fairly reasonable.  Before dealing with the points raised by Deputies I regret that it is necessary for me to rebut some general charges she made.  It is a pity she allowed herself to be carried away completely at one stage to absurd exaggeration about the quality of postal and telecommunications services. She trotted out the old canard that a carrier pigeon can deliver a letter faster than the post office.  I can say with every confidence that the postal service in this country, while not perfect, is one of the best in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins's illustration of delayed delivery was particularly unhappy.  It referred to the first day issue cover posted by the GPO on decimal day.  I do not know whether the delay she mentioned took place, but it would not surprise me if it did, under such extraordinary circumstances.  The Deputy must have little appreciation of the work involved for post office staffs in connection with decimalisation or the extraordinary trouble taken to postmark carefully by hand every first day cover.  A few days after decimal day a leading city businessman, who has an interest in philately, which moved him to call to a room where special staff were dealing with a big philatelic mail, told me he was most impressed by the efficiency of the arrangements for the first day covers and the great care being exercised by the staff.  It must be clear to everyone that Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins is not a philatelist.  As far as I and my Department are concerned philately is a highly profitable business.  I am quite sure she would not have suggested that someone wishing to send an urgent <Col N="1043" /> business letter would have done so in a first day cover.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins seems ready to believe tall tales about the telephone service and how calls from Manchester, Bolivia and Peru reach her.  The suggestion that our telephone service is the worst in the world is too ridiculous to refute.  While these exaggerated complaints might leave me unmoved they are very unfair to the zealous staff of the post office whether they be directly and immediately concerned with the delivery of letters or connection of telephone calls or, indirectly, in the preparation, execution, planning or supervision of the work of the services.  I shall say no more about these matters because I am confident that Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins was indulging in feminine exaggeration and had no intention of being hurtful to the staff.  In fairness to the staff of the post office services I feel I had to say this much.</P>
    <P>This has been a very lengthy debate and no less useful for having been generally quite and friendly.  For my part I should like to show my appreciation of the attitude of the House by dealing with as many points that were raised as I reasonably and properly can.  As regards the numerous references to particular RTE programmes or series of programmes I recognise quite well that this is the main opportunity Deputies get of expressing their views on such matters.  However, the Oireachtas in its wisdom gave wide powers to the RTE Authority for the control of programmes and concurrently removed that power in relation to the day-to-day affairs from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I retain responsibility for general oversight of the manner in which the Authority carries out its statutory functions, as well as for matters such as the approval of the time fixed for advertisements. In the exercise of my general oversight I would be very slow indeed to interfere with a considered judgement of the Authority, which is a body of responsible people, unless there were serious or compelling reasons for me to do so.  The discussion which has taken place here on the various aspects of RTE's activities has been most <Col N="1044" /> interesting.  Deputies have expressed themselves with a freedom and lack of inhibition about interference with the Authority which I have listened to with respect.  Indeed, I might add, with envy, because I should not dare criticise the Authority in such terms if I wanted to, knowing quite well that charges would be levelled against me. On the whole the consensus of opinion has been that while one item or another may be criticised and while some facets of the Authority's policies are not liked by certain Deputies, the Authority is considered to be doing a good job.  Deputies will understand that it would not be right for me to express views on the various programme matters raised but I have no doubt whatsoever that every word which has fallen from the lips of Deputies during the course of this long debate will be avidly read by members of the Authority and by the Director General and that all suggestions made by Deputies will receive appropriate consideration.</P>
    <P>I shall shortly go on to deal with points raised on various subjects during the debate but clearly it will not be possible for me to deal in my reply with all the points made in a 22 hour debate.  If I omit any point of special interest to a Deputy I should be very happy to get in touch with him if he will let me know what his wishes are.</P>
    <P>Before getting down to the detailed matters raised I should like to make a general observation about the Department's services.  In referring to Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins's comments I have praised our postal services highly and although some Deputies expressed criticisms there has been much favourable comment which was not confined to this side of the House alone.  I do not make any claim in regard to all services provided by the Department whether postal, telephone, telegraph, telex, savings banks or any others that full efficiency has been attained.  Neither my senior officials nor I feel there is any reason for complacency.  We fully appreciate that we live in a highly competitive world and it is essential that post office services are provided for the community with the maximum efficiency and at the lowest cost.  I can <Col N="1045" /> assure the House that continuous efforts are being devoted to working towards these ideals.  Perfection will never be attained but our job in the post office is constantly to work towards it. In my opening statement I described some of the fields in which we are working towards greater efficiency and I should like to assure the House there will be no relaxation of the Department's efforts.  I should like to go further than that and say that these efforts will be intensified in an attempt to offset part of the tide of rising costs.</P>
    <P>To begin with postal matters, my first note has lost some of its topical interest because of the settlement of the British Post Office strike but I shall deal with the points raised as they will appear in the record and the absence of a reply might mislead people as to what my Department has done.  Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins said that people posting letters to Ireland from the United States had been told there was a post office strike here.  Deputy Desmond said there seemed to be an impression at international level that there was a postal strike here and a person in Australia had difficulty in sending a telegram to this country for that reason.  We did have complaints of this nature about the USA and Canada and we immediately advised these administrations by telephone that the British Post Office strike did not affect mails for this country.  We ensured that corrective action was taken by the administrations concerned.  In the case of nine other countries in regard to which we had reason to believe a misunderstanding of the position might exist we advised them by telex or cable of our routing arrangements for mails to them and asked them to confirm their arrangements to us.  The Australian authorities were aware that the British postal strike did not affect us and, in fact, numerous telegrams were received from Australia during the period of the strike.  However, in order to put the matter beyond all doubt, a message was sent to the Australian telegraphic administration confirming the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond asked how much the British post office strike cost us; I understand our postal revenue is down <Col N="1046" /> about £250,000 as a result of the strike there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins mentioned a digest of the new decimal postage charges.  A new digest of postal and telegraphic charges is available at all post offices, including the post office here in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised a number of points in regard to increasing philatelic sales.  Our philatelic policy is under review at present and the points mentioned by the Deputy are among those which will be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully and Deputy Bruton suggested that my Department should request other Government Departments to post early in the day and to avoid heavy postings on Fridays.  We have, of course brought the desirability of early posting to the notice of Government Departments and other heavy posters on several occasions and special collection services have been arranged. I should like to assure Deputy Tully that the position is kept under continual review.</P>

I certainly would welcome a change of practice to eliminate this confusion and I hope local authorities will give some thought to the operations of the post office when naming streets in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coogan mentioned a related problem, namely, the failure of many people to display a number on their front gates as well as on the door of their houses.  I think he could have gone further and pointed out that many people, particularly in urban areas, do not show any number at all.  This is inconsiderate behaviour which greatly hampers the work of delivering mail. The regular postman gets to know the various names and locations but, if he is absent for any reason and a substitute has to take over temporarily, the delivery of mail for the whole neighbourhood <Col N="1047" /> is slowed down.  I would appeal to everyone to show consideration both for the post office and for their neighbours by displaying the number allocated by the local authority in a prominent position.  We all know that local authorities have power to compel occupiers to display the number allocated and, when people fail to respond to appeals for co-operation, it is a matter for the local authority to follow up.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully rather shocked me by his statement that his address was too long and he decided on a short name for his house: &ldquo;Iona&rdquo;.  I notice this is the address given in the Directory of State Services and I hope I am not doing the Deputy an injustice when I say I would have expected that an address at St. Columba's Villas, Laytown East, would have been allocated a street number by the local authority.</P>

      <P>Very good.  Deputy Cott referred to postal mechanisation. Mechanical equipment for postal purposes <Col N="1048" /> is very, very expensive and requires a large volume of traffic to justify its installation.  The Central Sorting Office is mechanised for the handling of parcels and the conveyance of mail bags.  More sophisticated equipment for the coding and automatic sorting of letters is still very much at the development stage.  The Department is keeping in touch with developments in this field but, at the moment, there is little scope for mechanisation of sorting outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donovan referred to the disappearance of late night collection boxes in Dublin.  All postal boxes are cleared at 8 p.m. and a further collection is made at 10.30 p.m. from 76 boxes at selected points throughout the city and suburbs.  At the GPO, St. Andrew's Street and the Central Sorting Office further collections are made during the night.  The final collection is at 3 a.m.  All the collections are despatched to the provinces, to Britain and for first delivery in Dublin the following morning.  I am informed that there has been no worsening of the standard or scope of the late night collection service in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also expressed the view that the present level of postal and telephone charges should remain constant for many years.  No one would be more anxious than I to have this happy situation but the Deputy must realise that no Minister enjoys having to increase charges for post office services. I certainly did not enjoy having to increase charges some months ago. However, it would be quite unrealistic to expect the present rates, which involve a loss of £1 million per annum, to continue indefinitely.  Every effort will be made to pull down losses by increased efficiency and possibly even, if public opinion is prepared to accept some deterioration in postal standards, by introducing economy measures affecting services.  If costs and, in particular, wages continue to increase year by year it would be quite unrealistic to expect in a labour intensive service to offset increased costs by economy measures or by greater efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised the question of a later start to deliveries during the winter months to obviate the necessity <Col N="1049" /> of postmen delivering in darkness.  I think his colleague, Deputy Dr. O'Connell, was on the other side; he does not agree with Deputy Tully.  As Deputies are aware, Britain has decided to revent to GMT next winter.  The question as to whether this country should do so is now under consideration and, if it is decided to revert to GMT, this will certainly meet the Deputy's point.  The Deputy also complained about the supply of lamps to postmen for use on dark mornings. The type of lamp used up to now has gone out of production and, as a temporary measure, it has been necessary to use an ordinary bicycle lamp with a strap to fasten the lamp to the postman's uniform.  Numerous efforts have been made to obtain a suitable type of lamp and there are prospects now of being able to come up with something appropriate.  I hope it will be possible to provide this improved type lamp by next winter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cott suggested delivery into roadside letterboxes.  As far as I am concerned such an arrangement would undoubtedly reduce delivery costs but there are problems as well as attractions associated with it.  It has been considered in the past and is again being considered at present.</P>

      <P>Deputy P. Belton mentioned that the Coolock area is at present served only by a post office located in a caravan.  This is not quite so.  The sub-office in Coolock village has been closed since December 1969 following the resignation of the former sub-postmistress and post office business is being conducted in a caravan staffed by post office clerks as no other accommodation can be obtained. The sub-office appointment was advertised three times, the last occasion being October 1970, and no candidate with suitable accommodation has been <Col N="1050" /> forthcoming.  The vacancy will be readvertised at a suitable opportunity in the near future.  In the meantime, two new sub-offices have been approved for the Coolock area; the first was opened in the Edenmore shopping centre last year and the second will open shortly in the Northside shopping centre.  When this office is operational the area will be well served in the matter of post office facilities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton inquired whether the main services are costed separately with a view to adjusting the charges for them.  Broadly speaking, the three main services&mdash;postal, telegraph and telephone&mdash;are costed separately for the purpose mentioned by the Deputy. If he refers to the commercial accounts for the Department he will find separate income and expenditure for them and also for agency services for other Government Departments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am coming to that.  The telegraph service is uneconomic and has never paid its way but the losses are made good from the profits on the telephone service.  In principle we try to ensure that the postal service independently of the telecommunications service, will pay its way but it is so highly labour intensive that when wages are advancing rapidly this ideal is extremely difficult to achieve.  Coming now to Deputy Tully's question, I should like to thank him for giving me notice of this question.  His question is in connection with agency services; are we charging enough for these and when were these charges last reviewed?  Well, we are quite satisfied that our charges are correct, that they cover our costs, and the latest review was in the financial year 1969-70.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins mentioned the case of a savings bank depositor who lost his book and reported the matter immediately but nevertheless three withdrawals were made from the account.  The House will appreciate that it is quite <Col N="1051" /> difficult to prevent withdrawals by a dishonest person who steals or finds a depositor's book, because withdrawls can be made at about 1,400 different savings bank post offices, but every week an up-to-date &ldquo;stop payment&rdquo; list is issued to all post offices.  The latest such list contains 80 entries concerning books which have been reported stolen or lost.  This system has proved reasonably effective but Deputies will realise that a fraudulent withdrawal can be made before a particular deposit book can be included in the &ldquo;stop payment&rdquo; list and that during times of pressure, such as during the recent banks dispute, a paying officer may occasionally make a repayment in respect of a book on that list. All cases of fraudulent withdrawals are specially investigated and the depositor does not suffer any loss once the Department are satisfied that the withdrawal was made by somebody else without the depositor's knowledge or consent.</P>

      <P>Deputy Coughlan suggested that there should be no limit on withdrawals on demand from post office savings accounts.  The present limit of £30 was increased from £10 as recently as January, 1969.  This was a substantial extension and I am not aware of any public demand for a further extension.  The proposal has the obvious disadvantage that the withdrawal on demand system involves considerable risk of fraud and that any <Col N="1052" /> increase in the limit would increase that risk.  It would also increase the security risk at sub-offices because of the larger amounts of cash that would have to be held.  Some changes and improvements in the position for depositors are under consideration, including an increase in the frequency of on demand withdrawals, possibly say every three days instead of once weekly as it is now.  This change if approved will go far to meet what Deputy Coughlan had in mind.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies made suggestions about the manner of payment of pensions and allowances and suggested they might be posted to the recipients and that some of the children's allowances might be paid in kind.  These are matters for the Minister for Social Welfare and I assume the Deputies will pursue them with the Minister.</P>
      <P>The question of the compilation of the electoral register mentioned by Deputy Coughlan is one for the Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore suggested that the appearances of sub-post offices should be brightened.  The provision and maintenance of sub-post office accommodation is the responsibility of the subpostmaster. Sub-offices are inspected regularly and attention is drawn to the need to improve the appearance of offices where this is considered necessary. The Deputy also suggested the painting of sub-post offices a uniform colour for identification purposes.  Sub-postmasters are not required to paint their offices a uniform colour because sub-post offices are invariably located in shops in which other business is conducted.  Shop fronts are frequently constructed of materials which do not require to be painted and therefore it would be impracticable to have all sub-post offices the same colour.  For identification purposes the names of sub-post offices together with the words &ldquo;Post Office&rdquo; are shown both in Irish and English on a notice board outside each office.  In the case of some offices in towns in which there is also a departmentally staffed post office only the words &ldquo;Post Office, Oifig an Phoist&rdquo; are shown.  It is considered that these notice boards provide sufficient indication of sub-post offices.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooney urged the early introduction of Giro. The possibility of introducing post office Giro has been the subject of a number of references in debates as well as in a number of parliamentary questions in recent years.  Briefly post office Giro is a current account system with cheque facilities operated by the post office.  Many West European countries operate such a system.  There is now one in Great Britain which has not yet been successful from a financial point of view.</P>

      <P>Giro would be a major innovation and serious financial and organisational problems would have to be solved.  The view has been taken that until such time as there is a strong public demand for such a service and a clear indication that the service could pay its way, the introduction of Giro, although a possibility to be kept in mind, cannot be given a high priority among the demands on the Department's and the State's resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann approves of a policy to be carried out by the Land Commission which will ensure that in the allocation of land, the claims of local deserving applicants should be satisfied, before persons from outside areas are considered.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for putting down this motion is that the Land Commission, which was set up long before the founding of this State for the purpose of doing two things: (1) vesting unvested holdings; and (2) relieving a certain amount of congestion in certain areas <Col N="1054" /> has developed over the years into a tremendous-sized organisation, and problems naturally have arisen over the working of the Land Commission and particularly in regard to the acquisition and division of land.</P>
    <P>Over the years the Land Commission has had introduced in this House by various Ministers for Lands a number of different Land Acts.  These Land Acts were introduced for the purpose, or were supposed to be for the purpose, of dealing in a fairer way than had previously been the case, with the acquisition and division of land.  However, one often has reservations about whether or not the net result of the new Bill passing through the House is an improvement on what went before; and when we come to the way in which certain persons in this country are dealt with in regard to land division, the question mark is very big indeed.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Land Commission officials, I suppose for their own convenience, introduced a system whereby a landless man within half a mile of an estate to be divided, or an uneconomic holder within a mile of such an estate, could be considered for portion of that estate.  Having introduced it, as far as I am aware of their own accord, and it not having the force of law&mdash;they relied merely on the fact of its having been introduced and, shall I say, getting away with it&mdash;the Land Commission officials began to treat it as the &ldquo;Bible&rdquo;, the rule of thumb which applied to all land division. The result is when an estate is being divided there may be a number of people living around the estate who expect that they will benefit.  In many cases they are people who have taken land for crops from the previous owner; in some cases they have worked on and off on the estate over the years.  When the Land Commission come to divide the estate they strictly apply their rule of thumb and exclude anybody who is an uneconomic holder living over a mile away and they rule out anybody who is a landless man over half a mile by road from the estate.</P>
    <P>On one occasion the Minister's predecessor in answer to a question from me in the House as to whether or not <Col N="1055" /> the half mile or mile referred to was by road or by land gave what he considered to be a truthful answer when he said it referred to the nearest point whether by road or otherwise.  The Land Commission officials have refused to accept that ruling and have strictly adhered to the ruling that it must be half a mile or a mile by road. Therefore one can find somebody living within 100 yards of an estate but if the road does not run by them down to the estate but takes a roundabout route which leaves that person outside the limit laid down by the officials, he is out of luck and cannot be considered.</P>
    <P>This has caused a great deal of annoyance and over the last couple of years has resulted in the formation in areas where land has been divided of various organisations with the object of putting pressure on the Land Commission to allocate the land to the people concerned and not to outsiders.</P>
    <P>Who is an outsider?  If the Land Commission say that a man who lives one mile and 100 yards from the estate and who in fact has been trying to rear a family on a small farm is not entitled to an addition to that farm when the estate is being divided, surely it is unreasonable that a man who may never have engaged in farming at all, who may be in possession of as small a holding as half an acre or of a couple of hundred acres of bog rated at 2d an acre, as has occurred in some cases, can be brought 100 or 150 miles and made the vested owner of such a holding while the people living beside the estate are ruled out?</P>
    <P>On more than one occasion when I have made statements like this, the Minister here and his predecessor have accused me of being anti-migrant and of insulting their former colleagues from the West of Ireland who have been brought over to Meath and other places.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  As they and their officials must know, when migrants come into County Meath and are given holdings &mdash;I do not think there is another place in the world where the same thing could occur&mdash;these people become as the people who have been living there all their lives and are accepted as such <Col N="1056" /> More than that, they themselves within a very short period consider themselves as local and come to me and possibly to Deputy Bruton, Deputy Hilliard and people like us to complain about the unfairness of bringing other people from outside the area and giving them portions of land which they require in order to live.</P>
    <P>The Minister as recently as a week ago objected to a statement I made here about migrants some of whom I said came to Meath, got farms and moved away leaving a house idle and perhaps selling the land.  He said it just could not happen; migrants did not do that&mdash;or words to that effect.  I had a question down which unfortunately was not reached.  I was hoping the Minister would reach it before this debate took place because I was asking were there any records kept.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in answer to something I said.  However, perhaps the Minister did not mean that.  I have before me a letter I received today from a person who is complaining about a farm at Cullentra, which is in the Longwood area of County Meath.  This is a case of a man who got a house and farm some time ago.  Since then he has died and his wife has shut up the house and gone to live in England but she has set the land.  This land had been in the possession of those people for only a few years.  The house, as a result of being closed up, is deteriorating. Why should this be allowed to happen while men who have no holdings <Col N="1057" /> but who require land for stock have to pay as much as £300 per year for grass on the 11-month system?</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister can understand the amount of discontent that practices of this nature can cause to people who have spent all their lives in an area, who are trying to eke out an existence on a small holding, who may be given six or seven acres while somebody brought in from outside is given 35 to 40 acres but later moves to England and sets the land.</P>
      <P>That is one instance but there was another instance where a farm was put up for sale.  The Land Commission were asked if they would be prepared to buy this farm, adjoining which were two people whose holdings were uneconomic. These people would have been very glad to have got that farm and, although the rent would have been high, they would have been prepared to pay it.  However, what happened was that two speculators from outside were allowed to buy the farm. One of them bought it as a park for cattle he would be bringing to fairs a few miles away.  The other man was the local veterinary surgeon.  Perhaps he might stable a horse or two on it.  In any case, they bought the land that was required by other people who wished to make a living from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, Deputies Hilliard, Bruton and I accompanied a deputation to the Minister in connection with the Kolln estate.  That deputation represented 30 or 40 people who were living within a few miles of the estate and who were anxious to obtain a portion of the land. Some of them had cattle for which they were forced to rent land and some of this rented land was part of the Kolln estate.  These were the type of people to whom the Minister has referred time and again as excellent people.  In my part of the country they would be referred to as &ldquo;snug&rdquo; people. Some of them take up employment but put part of what they earn into building up their holdings so that they will have something for their children. However, this land was divided in a way that appeared to those of us who knew the area to be stupid.  As a result of the deputation I understand that some of the people concerned were <Col N="1058" /> accommodated, but others were not. They were ruled out, not because they were not entitled to be considered but because they were living more than the half mile or the mile distance which the Commissioners have laid down.</P>
    <P>As I have asked time and again, can anybody show me anything in the legislation dealing with land that stipulates that people outside that radius should not be eligible for land?  There is no such regulation; it was simply thought of by somebody who considered it to be an easy way out.  Of course, it is much easier to deal with a radius of a mile or a half mile, but the result of this is that resentment has turned to anger and into a determination that this must not continue.  I do not believe in breaking the law but I see people in the cities and towns organising themselves into various organisations for the purpose of fighting for what they consider to be their rights and certainly I would be the last person to condemn small farmers and landless men for fighting for what they consider to be their right&mdash;the right to be given portion of an estate that is being divided.</P>
    <P>When the 1965 Act was being put through the House, one of the penal clauses was that which stipulated that a local person who was given land would have to pay a full annuity while a migrant or certain others would have to pay only a half annuity.  At the end of the economic war, Fianna Fáil made a great song and dance of being able to announce that annuities were being halved but there was not such a song and dance when the position was being reversed so that certain people would be charged a full annuity.  We now have the situation whereby a local man who is given a protion of land may have to pay as much as £20 in rent alone per acre per annum while a man who may be living beside him but who came from outside the area will have to pay only £10.  That is not just.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of lands not being available, as I can point out from a list I have before me.  This information was given by the Minister recently.  It will be seen from this list that certain farms have been in the hands of the Land Commission for a very long time.  The Land Commission <Col N="1059" /> officials have told me time and again &mdash;of course, I believe what they tell me because I have no reason to do otherwise and I have no complaints to make in relation to my dealings with them&mdash;that they lose money on the farms they have in their possession but which for one reason or another they cannot divide immediately after acquisition or even shortly afterwards.</P>
    <P>I quote figures from columns 1816, 1817 and 1818 of the Official Report for the 23rd February, 1971.  I should be interested to know why the Booth estate of 42 acres at Baconstown, which was acquired on the 5/6/63 has not been divided.  Also, the Daly estate of 231 acres which was taken over shortly after 1963.  Also, the following: Kolln, 450 acres, 11/9/64; Curran estate at Loughanstown, 58 acres, 3/12/63; Byrne estate at Curraghtown, 44 acres, 10/9/64.  Portion of those and of the four I shall mention now has been allocated.  There was the Smith estate at Clonardan of 100 acres which was acquired on the 7/12/64, the Develter estate at Craigs of 15 acres, acquired on the 1/12/64.  There is the Austin estate of 62 acres at Balnagon which was acquired on the 14/12/64 and the Plastics estate of 237 acres at Grennanstown which was acquired on the 26/2/65.  There was also the Smyth estate at Mellifont.  This estate comprises 801 acres and was acquired on the 5/8/65.  I do not know why nothing has been done about that.  Also, the Smyth estate at Rathmanoo which comprises 143 acres and was taken over on the 31/8/65.  I was told that this estate has not been divided because there was some difficulty in deciding how it could be divided in order to ensure that it be used properly, but six years later the position is the same.  There is the Jeffers estate of 120 acres at Glassallen, acquired on the 2/11/64; the Naper estate of 77 acres at Loughcrew, most of which has been divided; the Coffey estate of 21 acres at Drissoge acquired on the 16/3/66; the Higgins estate of 34 acres at Baconstown, acquired on the 12/12/66, and so on.  Further down the list we see an estate of 208 acres that was acquired on the 24/4/67, 288 acres acquired on the 4/12/67 and many <Col N="1060" /> others.  The acreages are 109, 174, 29, 152, 136, 192, 81, 282, 76, 77, 124, 20, 28, 45, 66, 23, 69, 197, 52, 101, 66, 34, 27, 240, 212, and 341.  That brings us up to the 31st December, 1969.</P>
    <P>All these farms in County Meath are in the possession of the Land Commission. Added on are the estates taken in 1970, the O'Malley estate, Allenstown, 28 acres; Chambers estate, Laracer, 251 acres; O'Connell estate, Gibstown Demesne, 30 acres; Carroll estate, Hallstown, 281 acres; Dublin Wine Ltd. estate, Dogstown, 143 acres; Keppel estate, Drewstown Great, 287 acres; Bury estate, Drewstown, 287 acres; FitzSimons estate, Cloncarreel, 55 acres; McGuinness estate, Gibstown, 22 acres; and the Ward estate, Cloghreagh, 28 acres.  That brings us to 2nd December, 1970.  All this land in County Meath is in the possession of the Land Commission and they tell me they are losing money on land which they hold over any period and that if they let the land they are losing so much on it.  Will anyone tell me why it is that, that being so, the land is still held?</P>
    <P>There is one reason and it is that the Land Commission have a policy of bringing migrants from the west of Ireland and giving them farms in County Meath and other areas, and they are finding it extremely difficult to persuade such migrants to come over because, while they are asking the local people to pay the full annuity, the migrants are not prepared to pay even half the annuity.  They do not consider it good value.  I mentioned here before that when they bring a man and his wife and a number of children and put them on to a farm on an estate, many of them have absolutely no idea of how to work that farm. Some of them have a hazy idea of how to work the farms they left and in a very short time they realise that what they were told&mdash;and some of them came to me and told me this&mdash;that there was plenty of employment available in the area for themselves and their families, is not correct.  When they arrive they find that the only employment available is the employment held by the local people and their children. Either their children must emigrate, <Col N="1061" /> and sometimes the parents, or the local people must emigrate.</P>
    <P>I do not think this is the purpose for which the Land Commission were set up.  They are not doing the job they were set up to do.  I want to say here and now that the Land Commission must change their policies.  They must ensure that people who live within three, four or five miles of an estate that is being divided are considered.  It will be found in most cases that they will turn out to be excellent farmers. They know the area.  They know the land.  They have worked on land.  It is very important that people working in agriculture should know the type of land they are working, the type of crops that will grow well on it, where the best market is for their produce and should have all the other knowledge which cannot be given to migrants with the farms.</P>
    <P>It is terribly unfair for the Land Commission to start what is, in fact, a civil war between the migrants and the people of the locality.  We have now reached the stage where in some areas &mdash;and I should like the Minister to comment on this if he thinks I am telling an untruth&mdash;land cannot be set because the local people picket the area and picket the auction and say : &ldquo;This cannot be done.&rdquo;  They offer a price which is not acceptable and in some cases the land is allowed lie fallow for 12 months.</P>
    <P>In quite a number of cases the Department have been very reasonable and when approaches were made in the proper way they did a deal with the local people and let the land to them. Apparently the position has hardened now and either they take it from the local auctioneer or they do not take it at all.  If the local auctioneer is unable to get a bid which suits the Land Commission the land must just lie there.  I wonder who the Department of Lands consider they are serving by this sort of attitude.  I do not know who decided this.  I should very much like to know whether this was a decision by the Minister or the Commissioners or the senior officials of the Department.  Who decided that this should be the position?</P>
    <P>I honestly believe that the country <Col N="1062" /> would be much better off if there were much more co-operation and if, for instance, before a farm was divided the Commissioners got people together instead of saying: &ldquo;This is your bit. Sign for that.&rdquo;  If they do not want to sign for it that is just too bad.  I know one man who got a nice little farm on top of a hill.  It was cut short a couple of perches from the only river in the area and he was left without water while his neighbour had more water than he wanted.  Obviously, somebody looked at the map and decided that was the right thing to do, that he was getting a certain number of acres and that was the way he should get them. In other cases people have been cut off from roads which they could have used. Recently a man told me he got a farm which ran within a couple of perches of a ditch.  He said he could fence the ditch himself for £2 10s but the Land Commission decided to give him some land out from the ditch and they had to fence the lot, and God knows what it cost.</P>
    <P>There is not enough co-operation between the Land Commission and the applicants for land.  The Land Commission must make up their minds that the people in the areas where land is being divided have rights, like everybody else, and that when it comes to the division of land people who live within striking distance of it, people who can use it, are considered and are given portions of land.  If they do not use it properly it can be taken from them.  That is an easy thing to do.  The idea of refusing to give it to them because they are over a set distance away is pure codology.</P>
    <P>Over the past 12 or 18 months or two years, there has been quite an uproar particularly from a group who call themselves the National Land League.  Many people would like to criticise them and treat them as if they were like the illegal organisations who go around with guns, holding up people, or threatening to shoot them, or robbing banks.  They are not.  They are a normal decent group of people who claim that they have rights.  As long as they stay within the law, as I believe they do, they are entitled to do what they are doing.  They picketed a farm which somebody wanted to divide <Col N="1063" /> to build houses for migrants.  I should like to ask the Minister what he would do if he had a business in his own town and he found that because of the action of a Government body he would be left without the use of that business.  I think he would be very angry.  These people I am talking about are very angry.  The fact that they have got the support of most of the people in the area, including the clergy, proves that their cause is just.</P>
    <P>As of now the Land Commission should attempt to make arrangements with the local organisations who have been agitating for land division, many of whom, as a result of their agitation, had farms taken over only to find they were given to people who do not belong to the area at all.  The Land Commission have got to make their peace with these people.  They are reasonable people.  I have proved that it can be done and I think the officials will agree that this is so.  The idea must be scrapped that locals must be beside the farms before they can be considered, whereas people from hundreds of miles away can be considered before them.  If the Land Commission do that they will find, in a short time, that there will be none of this ill feeling and people looking for land will get what they are entitled to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding this motion I want to make it clear, as my colleague Deputy Tully did, that this is not a case of Deputies from eastern counties trying to deprive people in the West of a living anywhere in the country.  We want to make a claim for the people in our constituency who we believe are just as badly off living on the land as those in the western part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure every Deputy has visited the County of Wicklow, which I represent, at one time or another either on business or pleasure.  Because of its proximity to Dublin it is the county most visited by tourists who come to the capital city.  Some people might be under the impression, having visited Wicklow, that everybody there is reasonably well off compared with other counties.  The eastern portion of the county is the most wealthy side and <Col N="1064" /> most of the industry is situated in Bray, Wicklow and Arklow.  There is a very good strip of land which runs down the east side and along the southern part of the county.  It is somewhat similar to the way the country as a whole is made up, with the better land in the east and the south and the poorer class land in the north and west.</P>
    <P>We must have been badly represented when the 1906 Congested Districts Boards were being set up because Wicklow was not included.  I do not know who represented Wicklow at that time but certainly he did not make a very good case for Wicklow.  Wicklow has some of the most congested and poorest land in Leinster.  I make that point to compare Wicklow with the counties from which migrants come to Wicklow.  People living and farming in Wicklow are faced with problems which are every bit as difficult as those in Mayo, Galway or other congested areas in the West.</P>
    <P>When people from Wicklow approach me about getting land or getting a portion of an estate in Wicklow, I am inclined to compare the problems with which they will be faced, if they are successful, with those of the people who come from outside the county who are successful in getting land.  The first thing that strikes me is this business of the double annuity structure which is applied to locals who are successful in their applications.  If the annuity of a local is £400 a migrant will pay £200 for the same area of land.  The ability to pay is not taken into account and neither is the background of the individuals concerned. They both have the same capacity for earning because they hold equal portions of land, but one is expected to pay exactly double the other because of the application of the Act in the county.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully has mentioned the application of the mile and half mile limit.  I understood this was part of an Act which said that local applicants had to be within a mile of the estate, if they were smallholders, and within half a mile, if they were landless men or cottiers.  This perimeter is applied to locals in Wicklow as it is to locals in Meath and other counties and it <Col N="1065" /> has been used to deprive many a man of a portion of land to which he was qualified in every other respect.  The classic anomaly was quoted during the debate on the Department of Lands by Deputy L'Estrange.  A bachelor was given a piece of land because he was within a mile while a married man with six children was not given it because he was 100 yards outside the limit.  This type of application of the mile and half mile limit is ludicrous in our eyes.  If it is not part of the Act, there should be much more elasticity in the application of it so that people who are in close proximity to the estates being divided can be included.  Deputy Tully has suggested that a limit of three, four or five miles would not unduly stretch the distance a farmer would have to travel if he was successful in his application for land.  The days of the horse and cart are gone in most areas and farmers can be seen using tractors in every county in order to get from place to place. This type of conveyance can bring the limits of men in respect of land within a wider circumference than that which applied when the mile limit was first put into effect.</P>
    <P>There are a number of farms in the hands of the Land Commission awaiting division.  The total acreage in Wicklow is in excess of 2,000 acres.  In many cases this land has been rented out and, like Deputy Tully in regard to Meath, I am at a loss to understand why there should be a deficit in the renting of lands in Wicklow.  Recently, one portion of land was rented in Wicklow at the rate of £30 per acre. The renting of land is a bad thing from many points of view.  If the Land Commission are in receipt of £30 per acre and if there is a deficit from other counties, it is unlikely they will be in a rush to divide the better and more lucrative holdings and estates. This is apparently the reason why some estates in my county have not been divided for four, five and six years.  I can point to one estate not too far from me where the Land Commission came into ownership of a property&mdash;it was the Farrell estate near Rathnew&mdash;and there was a fine house and good outbuildings, with piped water to both; the condition of the <Col N="1066" /> estate today would almost make one weep.  A man who rents land opposite it visited it recently and he told me the galvanised iron has been removed from the sheds, the windows are broken, the interior of the house has been ransacked, piping and fittings have been torn out and the whole place is derelict.  Anybody who sees this happening, a viable farm which was in top-class condition when taken over, must feel aggrieved.  The correct thing for the Land Commission to do would be either to set the land on a long-term basis or keep it in proper condition. The house should be given to people in the area in need of housing to prevent this kind of vandalism.  This is not an isolated incident.  It must be remembered that land suffers if it is neglected.  The Minister has admitted that this does happen.  Those who rent land do not have the same interest in it because there is always the feeling that someone else may come along next year and offer a higher price.  For that reason those who rent will not keep the land in good heart and the land suffers.  Indeed, everybody suffers when land is allowed to remain undivided. The person who would like to rent the land under the conacre system suffers. The migrant or the local smallholder who is looking for land suffers.  Above all, the land suffers.</P>
    <P>To suggest there is no congestion in Wicklow is ridiculous.  Investigations were made recently into the Naughton estate near Dunlavin.  I understand prospective migrants have visited the estate.  I have here a circular from the Dunlavin Smallholders Association; 32 smallholders have added their names to the circular which says that they are anxious to be considered for portion of this land.  I assume these 32 are within the mile radius and if all 32 have some portion of land that shows the congestion that exists on the western side of the county.  The claims of many of those on the list&mdash; I do not say all because I am not familiar with all of them&mdash;are as genuine as are the claims of anybody in any part of the country.  It is for that reason I have added my name to this motion.</P>
    <P>In his speech on the Estimate for <Col N="1067" /> 1969 the Minister said that 9,300 acres of land had been sold to non-nationals in two years&mdash;I take it he meant the two previous years&mdash;with the consent of the Land Commission.  He suggested that 5,000 acres of that land would not have been attractive to Irish purchasers. I wonder how many of these acres could have been divided amongst people from the west, thereby providing them with viable holdings.  Not all the 9,300 acres could have been unattractive, or so unattractive that it would not have been as good as some of the land being divided currently in Wicklow.  The Minister admits that at least 4,300 acres were attractive.  The policy of the Land Commission in regard to the sale of this type of land should be clearly stated remembering the demand there is in every county for land.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Love estate in Ahascragh 200 acres were sold to one individual.  I am sure that 200 acres would have made economic holdings for several farmers in that area, thereby saving them from being uprooted and transferred to the eastern part of the country.  I do not think the Minister has told us why that estate was sold to one individual.  That estate could have been divided amongst smallholders in the area.</P>
    <P>I should not like to give the impression that non-nationals are the only people to buy land.  There is a good deal of native speculation in land. Wicklow, being in close proximity to Dublin, suffers more from this abuse than do other parts of the country.  It is within easy reach of the industries and businesses for the new breed of gentlemen farmers in and around the city of Dublin.  The Minister should keep an eye on this situation.  This kind of speculation is rampant in Wicklow, Kildare and Meath.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not been afraid to come in here and give the House his own ideas.  In the debate on his Estimate in 1969 he made several worthwhile suggestions.  His suggestion with regard to afforestation received a great deal of publicity.  Another suggestion he made was part-time farming in the west and a reversal of the role of the Land Commission to enable the provision <Col N="1068" /> of industry in the west in order to allow farmers and their families to have part-time occupations whilst continuing farming on their uneconomic holdings.  This was a worthwhile suggestion. It may have gone against the thinking set down in the Buchanan and other reports and it may also go against the thinking in the Mansholt Plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so, from my reading of a recent Mansholt Plan survey, which would mean that farms would have to become larger rather than remain small, that there would have to be a denuding of the population on the land in order to make the Mansholt ideas viable.  What the Minister was suggesting was not Mansholt in any shape or form.  On that occasion he went so far as to say that. In the Official Report for 20th November, 1969, at column 1415, when he was talking about Deputy L'Estrange, he said :</P>
      <P>It took him a while to come around to the logic of his own argument but I think he accepts, as I do, that it is unthinkable that we should develop in this country anything on the lines of a Mansholt Plan.</P>
      <P>In putting forward his proposal for part-time farmers he introduced it with that statement.  He went on to say :</P>
      <P>I consider it largely irrelevant what an economic holding of land is. It may be 60 acres or 70 acres or it may be more.  Candidly I do not think it has any relevance to the west of Ireland in particular, and instead of setting out to give economic holdings to people we should, instead, try to set up a system of part-time farming through which we would have a rapid increase in industrial employment and in employment in forestry and we should leave as many of our people as possible on their small 20-acre farms.</P>

      <P>I was quoting again from the same volume of the Official <Col N="1069" /> Report, for 20th November, 1969, column 1416.  The Minister made a worthwhile suggestion and indicated that he was anxious to have a reversal of the Land Commission policy which has been followed for many years.  In doing so he was coming around to the idea of what we have in this motion, to try to keep people in their own areas, to try to provide employment where the people are rather than move them to some other place.  If people move from the west to the east the people in the east, in Meath and Wicklow, who cannot get this land cannot move to the west and instead they have to move somewhere else.  Unfortunately too often it has been to England or America or to Australia where they have to turn to some other trade or occupation.  I welcome the Minister's change of ideas which I do not think has been debated since.  As I said, this runs somewhat counter to the Buchanan Plan because the basis of that plan was to centre industrial complexes in a particular area or areas.  Finally, I should like to quote the Minister again from the same debate at column 1417 where he was detailing how the west could be kept populated.  He said :</P>
      <P>In order to restore the vitality that is needed to be restored in certain parts of the west of Ireland we should change our policy from one of trying to give everybody an economic holding to one of trying to provide suitable employment in industry or forestry and leave our people with their small farms.</P>
      <P>I wholeheartedly agree with that.  This applies equally to my county as to any part of the west.  The only way to provide employment in Wicklow, for instance, is to give them employment on the land and consider them for estates which are being divided, whether they are within the mile limit or not.  I commend this motion to the House and it should be adopted for the Land Commission's future direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is somewhat vague but it is worth discussing. It does not say whether the limit should be a mile, two miles, three miles, six miles or even ten miles.  I <Col N="1070" /> do not believe in the mile limit.  As I have stated on numerous occasions, I know of a farm which was divided and a bachelor of 60 and a few other bachelors in the 50 years bracket received land while two young married men, one with a family of four and the other with five, were not considered because they were 100 or 200 yards outside the limit.  That is unfair and unjust.  The mile limit is undoubtedly completely outdated.  The majority of farmers have tractors and cars and they can farm efficiently land which is two, three or four miles away.  I am in favour of the mile limit being abolished. The Land Commission should give the land to young, hardworking farmers, certainly to people who would make the best possible use of it. Where there are young married farmers with families, even if they are 100 or 200 yards outside the limit, they are more entitled to land than men who are 60 years of age living inside the limit.</P>
      <P>All parties here stand for the maximum number of farmers living on the land and earning as good a living as other sections of the community.  All of us would like to see the farming community having parity with urban sections. There is no aspect of national life on which a clear, long-term statement of Government policy is more urgently needed than in regard to the land.  The failure by successive Governments and by successive Fianna Fáil Governments to formulate a long-term plan for the people on the land has, more than any other single factor, been responsible for our failure adequately to deal with the nation's chronic social and economic problems.</P>

      <P>In any case, we have failed to arrest the chronic social and economic problems, to arrest the social and economic disintegration of large areas of this country and especially the west.</P>
      <P>The Minister has the responsibility of dealing as fairly as he can with farmers and with land problems.  The Proclamation of 1916 speaks about cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  We on all sides of the House accept that the people of the west are all Irishmen and we do not want to see another Border in this country.  At one time they were sent to hell or to Connaught.  I want to say this for the Minister, that he certainly seems to have an excellent plan.  He mentioned it here in the House and I mentioned it briefly in my opening remarks.  The Minister also mentioned it at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  His plan, if implemented, would have far-reaching consequences. It would be of tremendous benefit to the country if the people of the west who have small holdings could be given part-time employment in industry, tourism and forestry.  It would be unfair to give effect to this motion until such time as that plan was in hand.  However, if the two things could operate at the same time the whole country would benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker referred to the Mansholt Plan.  This is certainly in keeping with EEC policy irrespective of what Mansholt may have stated or even is stating at the present time.  As far as I know from reading the plan, the idea is to protect the poorer regions of the countries that are in the EEC, to make the people in those areas more prosperous and to raise their standard of living.  Somebody who was recently in Ireland and whose name I have forgotten spoke about this very problem of regions and expressed the hope that we would not do in Ireland what had been done in Italy.  In Italy they took the people out of the poorer areas and brought them long distances to industries. What the EEC intend to do now is to try to bring these small industries to the villages.  Our villages and small towns are dying.  What is needed is that the people in our towns would have small rural industries within an <Col N="1072" /> eight to ten-mile region, within cycling distance, so that they could work two or three days if necessary on their small farms as well as having part-time employment in those industries. That would be an ideal solution for this country.  The dole has done a lot of harm, although certain people need it.  I know a farmer whose mother wanted to give him a bit of land.  He said: &ldquo;For goodness' sake do not give it to me because it would put me over the valuation limit and I would not get the dole.  Give it to my brother.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point that in an undeveloped country like ours work should be available for these people, because so much work needs to be done in drainage, afforestation and so on.  As far as rural Ireland is concerned the work of this Department is of major importance.  In this House we devote much time to the discussion of agriculture, the need for increased production and possible returns for our farmers.  If the holdings are uneconomic and if they are insufficient to give the owner a reasonable living, then no matter how good the agricultural policy may be it is of no avail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people are still leaving the land. I have figures here: in 1955 there were 378,676 holdings; in 1966 there were 280,000 holdings, a reduction of 98,676.  The number of males engaged in farming has dropped by 127,000 during this period.  In my own county of Westmeath, out of 6,935 holdings, 3,199 are under 30 acres.  At one time 20 acres was considered to be a viable farm.  From time to time it increased from 30 to 50 acres; now we realise it would take almost 70 acres of wellfarmed land to make a viable holding, to give the man and his family working on that farm as good a standard of living as other sections of our community have.  However, the Minister cannot wave a magic wand and provide land that is not there.  In County Longford, out of 5,645 agricultural holdings, 3,163 are under 30 acres. Again, there is the problem of where <Col N="1073" /> the land would come from to make these holdings viable.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to speculators. Certainly there will be no land for anybody, particularly in the midlands, if speculators are allowed to continue buying up land as they are doing at the present time.  Land has become dear.  When the Land Commission purchases land the annuity they have to place on the land makes it too dear for potential owners.  I know one farm beside me to which the Land Commission have brought at least ten families from the west within the last year and they have all refused it.  While it has a lovely house and beautiful outoffices, the land, according to these people, is too dear.</P>
    <P>At the same time there are speculators, local veterinary surgeons, business people, doctors and people who have other ways of earning their livelihood buying up this land.  It is definitely creating a problem.  In my county there is an organisation known as the Land League who are agitating.  I have never advised anyone to break the law and any advice I have given to these people has been within the law.  The majority of property owners know that if the law is broken and there is a further drift to violence they and their neighbours have to pay for it.  Perhaps there is very little that can be done but this is a problem that is affecting many small farmers in the area.  A man may go to his bank manager when 20 or 30 acres of land adjoining his holding are put on the market and he may make arrangements to buy the land but he may find that the land will be bought by a local solicitor who purchases it on trust for somebody else. Afterwards he may discover that it was bought by a doctor, a veterinary surgeon or a businessman.  This practice is unfair to these smallholders.  The Department should face up to the situation.</P>
    <P>Another factor which militates against many farmers in the midlands is the matter of the double annuity. Deputy Tully has spoken on this question. Again, it is both unfair and unjust that this practice should be operated.  It imposes a very serious hardship on farmers who are given land outside of the congested areas.  Certain counties <Col N="1074" /> have been designated as congested areas fros as far back as 1907.  Farmers from those areas can get land in the midlands and since the enacting of the 1964 Act they can still have the land at the half annuity rate while farmers living beside them and who are locals must pay the full annuity. This amounts to a rack rent on newly-divided land.  Some neighbours of mine are paying £17 or £18 and even more and this imposes a real hardship and, in some cases, it is an unbearable burden on small farmers in the midlands, especially those who have large families. Many of these farmers are anxious to improve their holdings and to acquire a little extra land so that their holdings would be viable but they are unable to do so because of what I call this rack rent, while they are rearing their families.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister promised to look into this matter.  So far, nothing has been done about it.  There are parts of Longford, Cavan and Westmeath and, indeed, parts of Monaghan, where the land is of a much inferior quality than the land in Roscommon or Galway or other congested areas.  In spite of this, however, one may find the case of two farmers on adjoining holdings, where one is from Westmeath and gets 20 acres of land for which he may have to pay £400 in rent, while his neighbour, if he happens to come from a congested area, would have the land for a rent of about £200.  Last year, too, I suggested that the Minister might see his way to extend the years of payment. I am aware that, when certain farmers refused to take land at the price at which it was originally offered, the Minister afterwards reduced the price.  Land that may be offered originally at £300 might be purchased for £220 or £230 after a farmer had put up a fight.</P>
    <P>The question of land division has been raised already.  I agree with the Deputy who said that land is kept in the hands of the Land Commission for far too long a period, sometimes for six years.  Last year the Minister promised that he would endeavour to speed up land division by the Commission. I do not know whether he has succeeded but figures supplied to me last year by the Minister for Lands <Col N="1075" /> show that, out of the 51,000 acres in the possession of the Land Commission, 27,000 acres of this land had been in their possession for two years and the remaining 24,000 acres had been held by them for periods of four, five or six years.  In spite of what I would describe as a rack rent, people in the midlands are crying out for land.  The Minister and his Department have a very important part to play in preserving a viable rural community and in the provision of a better standard of living for small farmers. I am including farmers in all parts of the country in that category.  It is the aim of all of us here that the greatest possible number of people should be able to live on viable units and to see that those units are established throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with the Minister that there is a problem in so far as the western seaboard is concerned.  Certainly, there is a problem in Counties Mayo, Leitrim, Donegal and Galway. It is not the fault of those people that they must try to live on small and infertile holdings.  I suppose they were hunted at one time to hell or to Connaught. Any Minister must have a duty to those people who have a long and rugged history, the majority of whom make the most of what limited opportunities they have.  Recently, however, the tide seems to be turning against them and they are leaving those uneconomic holdings.  Any of these people who have come to the midlands have been welcomed into the various areas.  I do not think any of us here has ever objected to them.  For most of them, the struggle is difficult, but they integrate very well with the local communities.  However, some of those who got holdings of 25 or 30 acres found that, in order to be able to maintain their wives and families, they had to go to England to work.  Others had difficulty in so far as they had been used to a different type of livelihood&mdash; for instance, fishing&mdash;and did not fully understand how to manage the land of the midlands properly.  We all know that the land of the midlands differs greatly from the land of the west. There is a different type of farming. The Minister's programme is a good <Col N="1076" /> one.  He wants to try to bring small industries to the west and to keep those people living on their own small holdings.  While the policy or the plan which the Minister spoke about last year seems to be admirable, it does not seem to be getting full backing from the Government.  That is a pity.</P>

      <P>I intend to do that. It would be unfair to do what we are proposing in this motion unless the Minister is also prepared to put that plan into operation.  As I said earlier, we realise that it is the Minister's duty to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  He has responsibility for the farmers of the west just as he has responsibility for the farmers of the midlands.  It should be his aim and object to see that as many as possible of them earn a decent living in their own country.  It would be unfair for me as a man coming from the midlands to advocate that nobody should be brought from the west of Ireland to the midlands unless there was some other plan for the farmers of the west. I should not like to advocate that.  That is why I claim that the Minister's plan should get full backing from the Government. If it was brought before the House I would say it would get the full backing of the House.  If it were put into operation at the same time, I would certainly be in favour of the motion that the Land Commission should ensure that in the allocation of land the claims of local and deserving applicants should be satisfied before persons from outside areas are considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment the first priority in allocating land is for people who lose their employment on the land.  The second is for those inside the one mile radius.  I have already said that that mile radius should go.  In Meath and Westmeath there are many farmers' sons who showed initiative in their youth.  They started to deal in cattle when they had to attend fairs at 3, 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning.  They worked for 70 or 80 hours a week.  They went down to the west and bought calves and cattle.  They got a bit of money <Col N="1077" /> together and they took land on the 11 months system.</P>

      <P>They made excellent use of the land.  Now, due to the fact that it is almost a crime to let land in the midlands, because of the last Land Act passed, people are not inclined to let land and many are in danger of losing their livelihood.  I was on a deputation to the Minister recently and three of those people were on the deputation.  They are hardworking farmers.  They are married and have families.  They are taking 60 or 70 acres of land on the 11 months system.  There seems to be very little future for those people and yet the Land Commission ignore them.  The Minister should change the Land Act. A young man who has shown initiative, worked hard and earned his living by taking land down through the years, should be entitled to get a farm of land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an interesting motion put forward by Deputy Tully. It is deserving of the careful consideration which I believe it is getting here today.  The motion reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of a policy to be carried out by the Land Commission which will ensure that in the allocation of land, the claims of local deserving applicants should be satisfied, before persons from outside areas are considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of points need to be filled in in relation to this motion so that we can fully understand its import. First, how do you decide who is local and how do you decide who is deserving in the context of this motion?  These are two important points which need to be spelled out.  I understand from Deputy Tully that he would consider people within five, six or seven miles as locals, and that he would also consider landless people to be deserving.  I <Col N="1078" /> would go along with him on both these points.  I believe that those people should be considered for land.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to state the implications of this.  This brings into the net, so to speak, a greater number of people to be considered in relation to a particular estate than are considered at present.  Under the present system only people with land within a mile and without land within a half mile of the estate are considered.  It is fair and just that they should be considered because most people are not in a position in which land is divided within a mile of them.  Therefore, they are never considered. If we widen the net we must realise what it will mean.  It will mean that everyone within five miles, possibly, will have to be interviewed.  The clerical and administrative work involved in that would be very great indeed.  It is possible to argue, too, that people within six or seven miles should be considered and they would have to be interviewed also.</P>
    <P>Another problem arises.  If more people are to be considered and if they are to be satisfied, we will have to have a lot more land than there is in the hands of the Land Commission in the eastern counties.  We must realise that there must be a massive increase in land acquisition by the Land Commission in the eastern counties or, under the new regulations proposed by Deputy Tully, many people will be dissatisfied.  The reverse of this is taking place.  I put down a question to the Minister on 23rd February, 1971, asking him the acreage of land being acquired by the Land Commission in both Kildare and Meath which are the two counties with which I am concerned in this House.  In 1967-68, 2,569 acres were acquired by the Land Commission in Meath.  In 1968-69 this was down to 2,145 acres.  In 1969-70 it was down to 1,234 acres.  In the ten months ended on 31st January, 1971, I think, only 840 acres were acquired by the Land Commission.  So, less and less land is being acquired by the Land Commission and at the same time there is a proposal by Deputy Tully that a larger number of people should be considered.</P>
    <P>I am making a case against myself, but it is only fair that I should do so.  I <Col N="1079" /> go along with Deputy Tully on this, but it is only fair to realise the implications of what we are proposing because we shall either have to leave a great many people dissatisfied or step up acquisition to a significant extent.  It will not be easy for the Land Commission to step up the acquisition of land in Meath and Kildare because the Commission will be trying to buy a very expensive commodity.  The speculation referred to by Deputy Tully and Deputy L'Estrange has, to my mind, inflated the value of land far beyond its actual value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before progress was reported, I had dealt mainly with the postal operations of the Department and I have just one more comment to make on this section of the Department's operations.  Deputy O'Connell complained about the postal facilities available in Ballyfermot and in particular about the absence of a branch post office there.  He stated that Ballyfermot has a larger population than Waterford city and yet is served by only one sub-post office.  I should like to inform the Deputy that there are <Col N="1080" /> two sub-post offices in Ballyfermot, one in Upper Ballyfermot and the other in Lower Ballyfermot.  The volume of postal business transacted in the area is well within the capacity of these offices to handle.  I understand that the offices are within reasonable distance of the residents.  The type of service provided in an area has to be determined by the volume of business transacted and not by the size of the population to be served.  Comparisons based simply on population figures can often be misleading.  I am quite satisfied there is no need for a branch office in Ballyfermot. If additional post office facilities become warranted the solution is to provide a further sub-post office. There is, however, no need for an additional post office at this stage.  Deputy O'Connell also referred to the matter of queuing.  This happens on days when social welfare allowances fall due for payment.  He will realise that queues are unavoidable where a large number of people seek services at the same time.  The public find the same problem in shops, banks and every other walk of business life.</P>
      <P>Moving now to the telecommunications side, some Deputies commented adversely on the backlog of applications for telephones and suggested that the Department, by anticipating the increased demand, should have been geared to meet it.  Planning has been on the basis of rapid growth in demand; but, with the resources available and procurable, it simply was not possible to meet demands in full.  I may mention that the rate of demand for telephones increased by 90 per cent between 1960 and 1965.  It is very difficult to expand a telecommunications system sufficiently quickly to cater fully for growth at this rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past 15 years and longer the Department have recruited every suitable engineer willing to accept employment with no restrictions of numbers.  To supplement the numbers coming from universities scholarship schemes were launched six years ago under which young men already employed by the Department can get university training or equivalent to degree standard.  Youths entering on the early stages of their training at university are given valuable scholarships, <Col N="1081" /> subject to their agreeing to take up employment with the Department on completion of their degree courses.</P>
    <P>Below the professional level the intake of trainees for technician grades, who constitute the skilled working force of the Department, was increased fourfold in the early sixties and has been further expanded by 50 per cent in the past year or two.  The limiting factor of recruitment was the capacity of vocational colleges to provide the technical training.  Since it takes four years to train a skilled technician, the full benefits of the huge increase in intake have only appeared in the past year or two.</P>
    <P>Apart from the problem of getting sufficient qualified staff, it has to be remembered that the growth of demand stimulated by national prosperity, industrial expansion and rising living standards requires extension of the whole basic exchange, trunk and cable network, securing sites and erecting buildings to house the additional equipment.  Even under favourable conditions it takes five years from the time it is decided to provide an exchange before the site can be acquired, the building erected and the exchange installed.  A seven year gap is not abnormal and in cases where problems about the site arise much longer may elapse between a decision and the realisation of the plans.</P>
    <P>I could go on at length to describe the various other measures adopted over the years to increase the number of staff and improve the technical skill at the disposal of the Department and the use of outside contractors to the best advantage, but after the marathon debate we have had I feel it is not a very good time to weary the House with a detailed account of all that has been done.  Those facts I have mentioned are given to indicate that, despite the expansive planning of the past ten years or more, we cannot meet the demand fully.  I have for the moment omitted reference to a limiting factor of increasing importance nowdays: the availability of capital required for expansion.  I shall refer to that presently.</P>
    <P>The backlog in respect of telephone communications at the end of 1970 is not as formidable as might appear at <Col N="1082" /> first sight.  It is certainly higher than what I would wish, but in relative terms the position is much better than it was five years ago.  At the end of 1965 the number waiting represented over ten months connection at the then current rate, whereas the 14,000 applicants at the end of 1970 represented about seven months connections on the basis of the connection rate in 1970.  Every telephone administration we know of has a waiting list for telephones.  For example, in 1970 over a quarter of a million people were waiting for a telephone in Britain, over half a million in Germany and over 400,000 in France.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley asked for a breakdown of the 14,000 applicants waiting for telephones.  Of the 14,000 applications not disposed of at the end of December, 1970, 5,500 lines were either in course of provision or terms had been quoted as a preliminary to service; 8,000 of the remaining 8,500 applications were received during 1970; 494 were received in 1969; four in 1968, one in 1967 and one in 1966.  It is expected that terms will be quoted shortly to the 1967 applicant, terms were quoted to the four 1968 applicants and over 200 of the 1969 applicants during January/February, 1971, leaving 300 pre-1970 applications at the end of February, 1971.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that if the Deputy has a little patience. Special attention has been given to the older applications in order to clear them as quickly as possible.  Of the 8,500 applications which had not been processed at the end of December, 4,500 were in the Dublin area and 4,000 in provincial areas.  The 1967 applicant is in County Donegal and the 1966 applicant is in County Mayo. There is a very special difficulty in providing service in these cases owing to the nature of the terrain in one case and to wayleave difficulty in the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Begley suggested the Department should stop accepting applications for telephones until all those awaiting telephones for three years have been serviced.  At the end of December, 1970, only two applicants <Col N="1083" /> had been waiting for three years, or more, and at the end of December, 1970, only about 8 per cent of applicants were waiting for a year or more and arrangements were in hands to provide service for more than a half of these.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully seemed to suggest that priority in the installation of telephones depended on other than objective criteria.  The categories of applicants to receive priority are clearly laid down and I would be very surprised to learn of any instance in which priority was wrongly afforded.  If Deputy Tully, or any other Deputy, sends particulars either direct to me, or to my Department, of any case in which he believes priority treatment was granted irregularly, the matter will be thoroughly and properly investigated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins, Deputy J. Lenehan and Deputy Finn made special reference to a bad telephone service in the West of Ireland.  The service is regarded in most areas as being satisfactory, the principal exception being Clifden and Belmullet which are served by circuits carried on wires over very exposed and very long routes. I am glad to say that trunk cables between Ballina and Belmullet and Galway and Clifden are due to be completed later this year and will enable a high quality telephone service to be provided in these areas.  In order to cater for future growth, plans have been made to lay an underground cable from Athlone to Galway.  The cable will also serve the Ballinasloe/Loughrea/Athenry/Portumna areas.  It is expected it will be completed in two or three years time.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy O'Hara in the course of a very fair and generous speech pay tribute to the improvements made in the telephone service in County Mayo in the past year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins referred to the delay in calls to Dundalk. Normally there is no delay in calls to or from Dundalk, but the northern coaxial trunk cable which carries the great bulk of calls in and out of Dundalk has suffered an entirely abnormal amount of interruption in recent months.  There were five interruptions <Col N="1084" /> in January and two in February, mostly caused by roadworks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde stated that if he wants to ring someone in his own constituency, who may be only ten or 20 miles away, the service is appalling. If Deputy Esmonde would be good enough to give me particulars of the difficulties he has encountered I shall certainly have the matter investigated.</P>
    <P>Complaints of discourtesy on the part of telephone operators are relatively few but any that are made are thoroughly investigated and the Department, in proven cases, take suitable action against offending operators. During training and at refresher courses the importance of courtesy and helpfulness to callers is impressed on all operators and constant care is taken by supervisors to ensure that the good name and reputation of operators for courtesy is not injured by the occasional operator who might tend to offend.  That, of course, is only one side of the coin.  On the other side, I am afraid that the telephone is for many people an exasperating instrument and some are inclined to criticise and abuse operators for failures which are outside the operators' control. Many callers do not seem to realise that delay in answering or connecting calls, or other difficulties sometimes experienced, are not due to any fault of the operators.  Indeed, many otherwise reasonable and courteous people often become annoyed when a number they want is engaged or there is no reply. Operators naturally resent abusive criticism in such circumstances.  As we say, one word borrows another and it can happen, although it is quite wrong, that an operator may reply in kind to discourtesy, but it should be remembered that courtesy is a two-way exercise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Joe Dowling commented on the Walkinstown exchange.  The switch capacity there is overtaxed because of the very heavy volume of traffic at certain times.  Considerable delay was encountered in arranging a contract for the supply and installation of the additional automatic switch equipment required.  By special arrangement with the contractor portion of this equipment was installed in March, 1970, but the relief afforded was rapidly offset by <Col N="1085" /> a further growth in the volume of traffic.  Work on the installation of the remainder of the order was to have been completed this month but it has, unfortunately, been suspended since 1st February as a result of strike action by the contractor's staff.  Special attention is given to ensure that the service provided by the existing equipment is maintained at the highest possible level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins referred to delay in answering at the Dublin exchange.  During the recent British postal strike there was naturally a marked increase in the volume of telephone calls to both cross-channel and Northern Ireland destinations which resulted in abnormally busy conditions in both the Dublin and provincial exchanges.  Despite the best efforts of the staff abnormal delays in answering were unavoidable.  I understand the service has improved significantly since the strike ended.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton complained about the unsatisfactory telephone service in An Uaimh and Trim areas.  The position at An Uaimh has improved somewhat over the past few months following the installation of portion of the additional switching equipment. Installation of the balance of this equipment is expected to be completed by next June.  The shortage of switching equipment at An Uaimh has also had an effect on the Trim service, particularly on calls between Trim and An Uaimh.  The equipment in the Trim exchange is no longer adequate for the increased volume of traffic and a new exchange has been ordered to replace it; completion is expected in about two years time.  In the meantime everything possible will be done to maintain a satisfactory service from the existing exchange.</P>
    <P>In determining the amount of switching equipment required in an automatic telephone exchange generous provision is made at the design stage for the growth of traffic but occasionally, as happened in the case of An Uaimh, an unexpected increase in calling rate develops quite suddenly and, when this happens, it can only be remedied by the installation of additional equipment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the good telephone service he experienced in the <Col N="1086" /> United States last summer.  Far be it from me to suggest that the United States in its telephone service, as in many other fields of technology, is not ahead of us.  In fact, the telephone service there is universally accepted as the best in the world.  If, however, Deputy Bruton thinks this means it is free from defects and does not come in for serious criticism now and again, then his experience last summer must have been very limited.  I suggest that the Deputy should consult the Bell Telephone Company, New York, or its customers, and he will find that in the past few years they have experienced all sorts of difficulties in dialling, crossed lines, <i>et cetera</i>, which he says he experienced in some areas here.  He also said that in all but one of our prospective EEC partner countries the telephones are automatic.  Apart from France, there is a lower percentage of automatic telephone service as compared with here.  The percentage is slightly more in Norway, 91.4 per cent, and little different in Denmark where it is 85.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully suggested that some exchanges provided a few years ago are now inadequate and he asked why bigger exchanges were not provided. The policy is to acquire telephone exchange sites large enough to meet maximum development in the areas to be served by the exchanges in question.</P>
    <P>The buildings erected initially are normally designed to cater for estimated requirements for 15 to 20 years with provision for extensions if necessary. However, in individual cases, particularly in urban areas, it is not always possible to adhere to this policy.  Owing to difficulties in obtaining suitable sites and to planning restrictions compromise solutions must be adopted in these cases.  Forward forecasting of exchange buildings and equipment requirements is on a generous basis, nevertheless, there will be instances in which the provisions made will have a much shorter life because of new developments, such as factories or housing schemes not planned and unforeseeable at the time the estimate was being made.  Exchange requirements are kept under constant review and extensions arranged as far as possible to avoid a shortage of situations. <Col N="1087" /> Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Esmonde mentioned that industrial estates located outside the main centres depend to a critical extent on efficient telephone and telex services and urged that expenditure of capital on supplying and maintaining these services at a high level of efficiency should not be stinted.  I am in complete agreement with the Deputies and I am quite convinced that there is nothing on which State capital could be expended to better advantage than on the development of telephone and telex services.  Some Deputies thought that more capital should be available for these services if they were taken out of the Department and a semi-State body instituted to conduct them.  Apart from any other consideration that could arise in connection with this suggestion, and which is fully dealt with by the Devlin group, the public capital programme, including expenditure by semi-State bodies, is controlled by the Minister for Finance and the Government so that it is unlikely that semi-State status in itself would be of much help in securing a bigger capital allocation in a period of scarcity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney referred to my statement that the amount of capital available in the coming year for telephone development had not yet been settled and he inquired how there could be planning if the Minister did not know how much would be available in the next year.  I fully agree with the implication in the Deputy's remarks that efficient development and planning of the telephone service can proceed with far greater efficiency if the telephone allocation for the coming year is always known in advance.  I can go further and say that for fully effective planning it is desirable that the amount of capital that will be available during each of the next five to ten years should be known.  Unfortunately, the amount of capital that can be made available for the various highly desirable State projects depends on a variety of factors which vary from year to year and the Minister for Finance and the Government do not find it possible to commit the Exchequer firmly to the expenditure for telephone development for a <Col N="1088" /> long period ahead as would be desirable if circumstances permitted them to do so.  We must face the unpleasant fact that sufficient capital cannot be made available for telephone development if this service, which is so important to the whole community, is to be as efficient as subscribers and users rightly expect it to be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney pointed out that in the past ten years expenditure on the telephone service had increased almost fourfold and that the surplus had only doubled.  He took the view that this surplus should have increased at the same pace as expenditure.  I am afraid the Deputy may have overlooked the fact that the surplus is determined after charging interest on capital as well, of course, as full depreciation.  He will find on page 14 of the notes circulated for the guidance of Deputies that the return on net telephone assets was 8.9 per cent in 1969-70 compared with 7.4 per cent in 1960-61.  These figures may be more meaningful than the surplus considered by itself.  He also took up my reference to the fact that equipment for installation which was ordered a considerable time ago was still awaited.  The Deputy thought that such delays on the part of the contractor should not be tolerated and that where they occured we should take our business elsewhere.  I certainly wish that the problem could be solved as easily as the Deputy thinks it could be.  Unfortunately, as the Deputy is evidently unaware, suppliers of telephone equipment are in a sellers market.  Owing to the enormous demand in recent years for telephone communication equipment, most equipment now being installed in exchanges was ordered two to five years ago.  However, by the time a contractor is found to be falling behind in delivery it would cause even far greater delay if efforts were made to get replacements elsewhere. Where an existing exchange is being extended it is not possible to switch freely from one manufacturer to another.  Indeed, under present conditions all manufacturers tend to be behind in their deliveries.  The Deputy may be interested in a quotation from the leading article in the London <i>Times</i> of the 3rd February, 1971 which stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1089" /> More than 1,000 contracts for the supply of telephone exchange equipment are running eight months behind Post Office delivery schedules. The strenuous collaborative efforts of manufacturers and Post Office purchasing executives are not making any significant improvement to the overall rate of installation programme.</P>
    <P>That quotation is descriptive of the position in Britain but the British Post Office is not alone in finding great difficulty in securing execution of contracts for telecommunication equipment because of the huge demand.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies, including Deputy Crowley, suggested that more kiosks should be provided in remote areas. The desirability of a more rapid extension of kiosk facilities in rural areas was recognised by my Department in 1969 when the extension of their rural kiosk programme was announced. Prior to that kiosks were erected only where they would pay their way and many rural areas did not qualify for kiosks.  It was decided in 1969 to change the policy particularly in the case of rural kiosks and to extend kiosk facilities more rapidly by replacing call office telephones which were used to a fair extent by kiosks.  Kiosks were selected for inclusion in the programme on the basis of the use being made of the call office telephone in the local post office.  Those areas with the highest call office user are being dealt with first.  A substantial increase in the number of kiosks provided in rural areas is envisaged under this programme. For example, 112 rural kiosks were provided in 1970 compared with 40 or 50 in the previous year.  This programme involves very heavy expenditure of engineering staff time and of the limited capital available to the Department having regard to all the urgent tasks on hand, such as the provision of new lines and the automation programme, and expenditure on the basic exchange trunk and junction network and I can see no hope of our being in a position to employ any additional engineering staff time or scarce capital to provide kiosks in rural areas.  However, when local authorities decide to guarantee a kiosk against <Col N="1090" /> loss an exception might be made.  We provided three on that basis for one local authority recently and a further two are under consideration for the same authority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling suggested that in new urban housing areas kiosks should be planned and paid for by the local authorities.  My Department would certainly be very glad to cooperate in any cases in which the local authorities might wish to pay for the provision of kiosks as an amenity in new housing estates.  The present position is that the Department provide kiosks in urban areas in new housing estates where they will pay their way and where the existing public telephone facilities in the area are insufficient to cope with the demand placed on them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney apparently found difficulty in following the figures quoted regarding the telephone kiosks in the notes circulated to Deputies some weeks ago and in my opening statement.  I had thought the position was clear but to help the Deputy I shall try to clarify it further.  Prior to 1969 the average number of rural kiosks being erected was 40 to 50 a year.  In 1969 a scheme for the more rapid expansion of kiosk facilities in rural areas was approved in principle, aimed at raising to a level of installation of about 115 rural kiosks on average annually.  In 1969-70 65 rural kiosks were provided and as the scheme gained momentum 73 rural kiosks were provided in the nine months ended December, 1970.  Therefore, as the Deputy will appreciate, the build-up to a programme of 150 rural kiosks annually is going ahead quite well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan spoke on the need for kiosks in new housing estates in Limerick.  The Deputy will be very glad to hear that arrangements have already been made to provide two kiosks to serve new housing estates in the city, one at Dooradoyle and the other at O'Malley Park.  It is expected that the kiosks will be in service within the next three to six months and the need for further kiosks in the Limerick area will be examined in the normal course when the future kiosk programmes are being prepared.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies, and in particular <Col N="1091" /> Deputy Dowling, referred to the damage caused by vandals to telephone kiosks and equipment and the serious inconvenience caused to people who may wish to make emergency calls.  In the past year the cost of repairing damage has been close on £10,000.  When kiosks are being provided in cities and towns sites are allocated where the kiosk is likely to be least vulnerable to vandalism. Normally these sites are in well-lighted thoroughfares, at shopping centres or near Garda stations, places that would seem to be pretty safe. Kiosks subjected to excessive vandalism are removed to alternative sites or recovered altogether.  At present there are 39 kiosks in the Dublin area where the entire installations have been stolen and these are closed up temporarily. Experimental measures have been taken in the past year to reduce the incidence of vandalism with some degree of success. These include the replacement of the small glass panes in more than 100 structures by sheets of very strong plastic material and fitting steel plates to the backs of some 300 kiosks to enable the coin boxes to be more strongly secured.  Damage of this sort is also a problem in many other countries where, in fact, it is more serious than it is here.  No country has yet found a complete cure, but we are keeping in touch with the technical developments abroad and will adopt any new measures that seem useful. My Department will also consider the constructive suggestions put forward by Deputies in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hara referred to the need for silence facilities for public telephones. There are 1,800 telephone kiosks all of which are sound proofed, and about 1,000 call offices and sub-post offices have silence facilities.  There are about 600 call offices at which the Department have not provided silence facilities.  A number of these call offices will be replaced by kiosks under the expanded rural programme, and the sub-postmasters have provided wooden enclosures for a number also.  The remainder are, in the main, places where little use is made of call offices, one or two calls a day, and the provision of silence facilities in places like this is not warranted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> On 11th February I told Deputy Cooney in reply to a Parliamentary question that the cost of converting telephone coin boxes consequent on the increase of the local call charge to sixpence was approximately £40,000. Deputy Cooney questioned the wisdom of incurring that expenditure on changing coin box mechanisms such a short time before coin boxes would have to be changed again for decimal working and suggested that this indicated a lack of proper planning by the Department. The facts are that the increase in the local call charge to 6d produced extra revenue of approximately £400,000 in the period of about 15 months before 15th February, 1971 and the decision to make this increase at the time was taken in the clear knowledge that coin boxes would have to be modified again to take decimal coins.</P>
    <P>In my reply to Deputy Cooney's Parliamentary question I also said that the time required to complete the conversion for decimal currency was about three months.  Deputy Cooney now seems to regard this forecast as incredible. The fact is that in the first five weeks since decimal day over 8,400 coin boxes were converted, which is pretty nearly on the target which we set for ourselves.  The job will be completed within three months as forecast unless failure on the part of the contractor responsible for the manufacture of the equipment to maintain contractual deliveries prevents this being done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan spoke about the deposits for call charges.  I do not accept that the deposits which are required by my Department are excessive. A substantial deposit is sought from new subscribers only where they default on a telephone they rented previously or where the type of business conducted is regarded as speculative or where the subscriber is likely to make a considerable number of calls abroad.  The deposit for an existing subscriber is increased only in special circumstances such as slowness in paying his bill.  In seeking deposits against call charges the Department is merely exercising normal commercial prudence. Telephone subscribers get a very generous measure of credit.  With the exception of calls from Britain, in respect of which accounts are issued <Col N="1093" /> monthly, calls for one quarter are not charged for until well into the next quarter, and in general where a higher than normal deposit is asked for it is designed to be broadly equivalent to the amount of credit afforded to the subscriber.  Moreover the amount of such deposits is reviewed on request and may be reduced after a period if the circumstances warrant it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins inquired about the hours of telephone service at sub-office exchanges.  The hours of attendance depend on the size of the exchange and in most small exchanges telephone attendance is given between 8 o'clock in the morning and 10 o'clock at night on week days and from 9 in the morning to 10.30 and from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Sundays. At the bigger exchanges, there is a continuous service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley complained about the lack of secrecy on telephone lines in the Dingle area&mdash;lines that are switched through on a party line basis during the night hours.  At small exchanges where the hours of service are restricted, it is practicable to provide a 24-hour service at a small extra fee for a number of subscribers by switching their lines through on a party-line basis to another exchange, when their own exchange closes, at which other exchange continuous attendance is provided. In the case of the Dingle peninsula, the exchange would be at Dingle or Tralee.  For technical reasons not more than four subscribers can be swithched through on one trunk line and calls for the subscriber concerned are distinguishable by a code system. Unfortunately, when lines are switched through in this way it is not possible to guard against over-hearing by other subscribers who are switched over on the same lines.</P>
    <P>The cost of providing a continuous 24-hour attendance at small exchanges would be out of proportion entirely to the revenue that would accrue from calls made during the additional hours for which service would be provided. In many cases, the extra cost of attendance would exceed the total rental being paid by all subscribers connected to the exchange.  The solution lies in the replacement of manual exchanges <Col N="1094" /> by small automatic units and ultimately all exchanges will have automatic units.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Finn said that the large areas in his county have no night telephone service.  I presume that what he meant to convey is that there are several exchanges in County Mayo where a continuous service is not provided.  There are 1,650 subscribers served by sub-post office exchanges in County Mayo and, of these, more than 950 are connected with exchanges at which a continuous service is provided and almost 400 others have continuous service on a party-line basis when their local exchanges have closed.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, telephone kiosks which provide an all-night service are available in most of the places concerned. Seventeen subscribers at Hollymount and 12 at Knock have continuous service on a party-line basis and several more can be accommodated similarly at both places.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that Deputy Cott has been misled by someone in relation to prospective telephone development in Britain.  He said that within the next two years both the number of daily telephone calls and the number of telephones in Britain are expected to increase by 50 per cent.  In fact, the British Post Office expect the number of telephone calls and the number of telephones to double in ten years.  In relation to the type of automatic exchange equipment in use here, Deputy Cott referred to the present use of crossbar exchanges by the British Post Office and he suggested that we are behind the times in using equipment which he described as being of an antiquated design.</P>
      <P>I am happy to be able to tell Deputy Cott that we were more than 12 years ahead of the British in the use of the crossbar exchanges.  Almost all of the new automatic exchanges installed here during the past 15 years have been the crossbar type while the British Post Office introduced crossbar equipment in their system only within the past two or three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supplies of pulse code modulation equipment which were ordered more <Col N="1095" /> than a year ago have now been received and are being fitted on certain cables.</P>
    <P>Deputies Desmond and Tully commented on the classified directory.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs decided not to produce the classified directory because it was considered that a venture of this kind, the success of which would depend primarily on the sale of advertising space, could best be handled by commercial concerns specialising in this field.  The directory is produced by a contractor who is responsible for all the costs involved. He pays the Department a percentage of his gross advertising revenue or a minimum guaranteed royalty, whichever is the greater.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond suggested that a better cover should be provided for the telephone directory.  The quality of the cover compares favourably with the type of directory cover used by many other telephone administrations and I do not consider that the expenditure that would be involved in providing a cover of a better quality would be justified.  More than 90 per cent of the directories are supplied to private subscribers and there have been no complaints as to the cover being inadequate.  I agree that the covers of directories in kiosks and call offices often become torn but directories in these places have to be replaced very frequently in any event, either because they have been removed altogether or because pages have been removed or defaced.  The provision of a better cover for directories in kiosks would only add to the cost while there would be no worthwhile resultant benefit. Furthermore, the question of introducing gradually a stronger cover for directories in certain localities where kiosks and call offices are less subject to abuse is under consideration by me.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell said that this year's ordinary telephone directory will not last longer than four or five months.  The binding is similar to that of last year and Members of this House will know from personal ex-experience of the directories in their homes how much credit should be given to the Deputy's opinion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> Deputy O'Connell went on to say, in relation to the printing of the directory, that he was horrified that a proof-reader failed to pick up an erroneous entry.  It is quite clear from his various comments that this representative of the Labour Party has a very low opinion of the quality of product of Irish workers and, certainly, I do not share his opinion.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy continued, in the course of his ill-informed speech, to be highly critical of the many aspects of the Irish telephone service, while sounding the praises in extravagant terms, to which I have already referred, of private telephone communication companies in Britain, Europe and Japan.  He is dissatisfied with the presentation in the directory preface of information relating to emergency services. He says that this information is buried somewhere in the green section at the beginning.</P>

      <P>With regard to a comment by Deputy Finn I am afraid it is not practicable in present circumstances to abolish the additional rental beyond the minimum payable by applicants who live more than three miles radially from the exchange.  The provision of telephones involving long lines is very costly and most of these telephones are heavily subsidised.  A recent analysis indicated that the total annual revenue from telephones which involved heavy construction work, amounted to only about half the annual <Col N="1100" /> cost to the Department of providing and maintaining the telephones.  However, the distances covered by the minimum rental was increased from two to three miles 11 years ago, and the amount payable is £1.6 per furlong per year.  This has been the figure for the past 18 years.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to the fact that a telegram cannot be sent from the Ballyfermot sub-post office and asked had an examination been made of the number of telegrams sent from kiosks in the area.  A return taken at the time Deputy O'Connell raised this matter in 1969, showed that a total of only five telegrams were sent from the nine telephone kiosks in Ballyfermot over a four-week period.  Two of these were sent at a time when the sub-office was closed.  According to a more recent return, the number of telegrams sent from kiosks in Ballyfermot was even less than in the four-week period in 1969.  These figures clearly demonstrate the lack of demand for telegraph facilities in Ballyfermot, and the provision of telegraph facilities at the sub-office there is not warranted.</P>

Deputy O'Connell also mentioned that it was inconvenient for local people to send a telegram from a kiosk.  The process of sending a telegram from a kiosk is no more inconvenient than making a trunk call from the same kiosk.  All the person has to do is to dial 10, tell the operator the contents of the telegram and to whom it is to be sent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Coogan had some comments to make on special greetings and sympathy telegrams.  On many occasions the Department have considered the desirability of introducing specially designed greetings and sympathy telegrams but decided against it.  The production of suitably designed forms would be expensive and it is not at all certain that the public would be prepared to pay the higher costs involved. As well as that, many telegrams are prepared in manuscript and it would be quite difficult to ensure that the handwriting used was of an adequate standard for a specially designed telegram form, particularly during periods of heavy pressure such as occur on occasion in the Central Telegraph Office where over 700 telegrams are received for local delivery in one morning.  A special service of this kind would be introduced only if a satisfactory standard of telegram could be provided commensurate with the higher charge which would have to be levied on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan put forward the interesting suggestion that telephone rentals for individual subscribers, having been fixed by reference to the cost at the time of installation, should not be increased in later years.  He recognised that this would cause administrative difficulties but in pure equity there could be a theoretical case for isolating and maintaining unchanged that element of the rental charge which relates to the capital cost of original installation but this is very much in the realm of theory because the capital cost of an exchange line can vary from between £100 and £500 and occasionally it is much more.  As the subscriber will pay the same rental from the outset, there is a wide measure of averaging continuing year in, year out, which overrules even the apparent ease in equity made by Deputy O'Donovan.  In addition the suggestion does not take account of the fact that the rental covers maintenance and <Col N="1102" /> renewal costs which rise with the passage of time.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hara mentioned the need for a telephone kiosk at Meelick and Bonniconlon.  Deputy Finn also asked about a kiosk at Meelick.  I am afraid I cannot add anything to what I have already said in reply to parliamentary question on the same subject.  A kiosk will be provided at Bonniconlon under the five year extended rural scheme programme, but the provision of a kiosk at Meelick where there is no post office is not envisaged under the programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan suggested there should be a hole at the corner of directories.

      <P>I dealt with that when Deputy O'Connell was not in the House.  Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins referred to a call from England to Galway being routed via Athlone.  Calls to Galway numbers are normally dialled by operators in the United Kingdom over direct Dublin/Galway lines.  In the event of difficulty a UK operator will ask the Dublin operator for assistance and the Dublin operator would route the call via the Athlone trunk and transit exchange if all the Dublin/Galway lines were engaged.  It is normal practice to have alternative routes of this kind available at all major centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins said she had difficulty in making calls to Scariff.  I assume the Deputy was referring to calls from Portumna or Kilrickle to Scariff.  These calls are passed to the Birr or Loughrea operator who <Col N="1103" /> can call the Scariff operator direct by dialling over the trunk transit network. Occasional delays may arise in busy periods but the Department have had no complaints about such delays.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde seemed to be under the impression that all applicants for a telephone service had to pay three or four years rental in advance.  This is not so.  Over 80 per cent of new subscribers pay only one year's rent in advance and less than 1 per cent pay more than three years rent in advance.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell mentioned the case of a hospital department in Jervis Street having its number duplicated with that of a café and he stated that the café was being inundated with calls for the hospital and as a result people were unable to contact the hospital.</P>

      <P>The telephone numbers for Jervis Street hospital are correctly shown in the 1971 directory but unfortunately, owing to a mistake by the printers, the number of a café in Denmark Street was also shown under the entry for the professor in charge of the department in Jervis Street Hospital.  Immediately the mistake was brought to our notice steps were taken to remedy the position.  Arrangements were made for calls to the duplicated number to be intercepted by the exchange operator who would advise the <Col N="1104" /> callers as appropriate either of the professor's correct number or of the new number allocated to the café owner.  This arrangement has been working satisfactory.  The café is not receiving any calls for the hospital and anyone trying to contact the hospital should have no difficulty in doing so. It is regrettable that the mistake occurred but in a volume the size of the telephone directory containing over 200,000 entries, including over 50,000 changed entries, it is impossible to guard against a small number of errors occuring.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton questions the basis on which the extended rural kiosk programme is being implemented.  He suggested that places with no post office should have preference for the provision of kiosks, that distance from an existing kiosk should be borne in mind and the use made of the call office telephone in the local post office is not an adequate criterion for selection of places for inclusion in the programme. My Department devoted an amount of time to devising a fair basis for the selection of places for inclusion in the extended rural kiosk programme. As only a limited amount of money can be spent on providing kiosks and the subsidy allowed in the case of rural kiosks is modest, there must be a good prospect that the kiosk when provided will be used to a fair extent so that the revenue will make up the difference between the subsidy and the cost of providing and maintaining the kiosk. In fairness the limited number of kiosks which can be erected should be placed so that they will be of benefit to the greatest number of rural dwellers.  The Department considers that while the present basis of selection is not perfect it meets these conditions fairly but if Deputy Bruton can suggest an alternative method of selecting places for inclusion in the programme which will also fulfil these conditions my Department will certainly consider it.  He mentioned the case of Carbury village with a population of 45 where not more than three calls are made each day.  Even though Carbury is seven miles from the nearest kiosk, the circumstances in the village are not such as to warrant the provision of a kiosk there.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> Deputy Desmond talked at length about the Devlin Report and its effects as far as my Department is concerned. The recommendations of Devlin have been under consideration by my Department and in particular those related to the separation of policy making from the day-to-day execution of policy; those related to the general coordination, organisation and management of the public service and those related to the setting up of a new public service department have been studied.  The recommendation that the post office should be merged with the Department of Transport and Power in a new Department of Transport and Communications was made within the framework of the major recommendations that policy making should be separated from the execution of policy and, pending a decision on the major recommendation, consideration of the amalgamation proposed has not been undertaken.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised the question as to whether or not sub-postmasters are adequately remunerated for the work they do.  By agreement between the Minister and the sub-postmasters union there is a scheme of conciliation and arbitration for sub-postmasters which enables the union to process claims relating to remuneration and conditions of employment generally.  The union avails itself fully of the opportunities accorded to it under such a scheme and sub-postmasters have benefited from all the national rounds of pay increases and, in addition, they have had several aspects of their work revalued in recent years, as well as securing improvements in other conditions, such as retirement gratuities.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, and Deputy Tully in particular, dwelt on the question of the political rights of post office grades and expressed the view that the present bar which prohibits them from taking part in politics should be lifted for the non-executive class and he asked what was being done about this. He went on to contrast the difference in treatment between post office staff and teachers and staff in the ESB from the point of view of participation in politics.  Deputy Bruton also made some comments on the existing regulations on the subject of participation <Col N="1106" /> by post office staff in politics and in public affairs generally.  The position is that claims on behalf of a number of grades in the post office to be allowed to participate in politics are being considered by the departmental council under the scheme for conciliation and arbitration and I believe it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the existing regulations while the staff claims to amend them are under consideration by the departmental council.  I can say, however, that examination of these schemes will be expedited as far as possible, but I cannot say when it will be concluded.</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond is under a misapprehension in regard to the secondment of post office officials to trade unions.  At column 2168 of volume 251 of the Official Report the Deputy said:</P>
      <P>...some consideration might be given by the Government to the insistence under the conciliation and arbitration system, that the negotiating officers in the postal unions should at all times be civil servants who are seconded to the postal union to act in that capacity.  I would not think the independence of these officers is in any way prejudiced but this insistence on the Government's side can give rise to unfair allegations against such officers and can act to the detriment of the relations between them and their fellow members of the general body.  If the Government were to abandon the insistence on such a rigid formal relationship under the conciliation and arbitration system, then some of the highly selective, half-truth propaganda which has been aimed at these officers would not carry conviction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> I do not know where Deputy Desmond got his information, but there is no question under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Civil Service of insisting that all trade union representatives must be officials seconded from the Department.  Full-time officers of staff organisations can participate fully in the scheme without ever having served in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan suggested the training of post office technicians in Limerick and asked that special classes to train people as post office technicians should be provided in Limerick. In fact, such classes are already provided in Limerick.  It is one of the centres in which the local vocational school provides, by arrangement with the Department, for full-time day release courses for technician trainees in the post office.  If there is a demand for some other courses of a kind which would be useful to persons anxious to secure employment on engineering work in the post office I expect local vocational schools will respond to such a demand, if they are made aware of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully asked why the Department was not prepared to give employment to a man who was recommended by him as a fully trained technician.  He referred to a shortage of technicians. By agreement with the Post Office Engineering Union vacancies are reserved for the promotion of serving staff.  The recruitment grades are technician trainee, trainee installer and labourer.  A man can be recruited only through these grades and advance through them to technician.  The number of trainees recruited has increased steadily over the years to match the growing requirements of the telephone service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This man would have taken employment as a labourer and the Minister had told me he had not got enough staff and that is the reason I raised the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, it is normal practice to take on these people as labourers and they are normally given priority.  If the Deputy will let me have the details I shall certainly <Col N="1108" /> see that this man gets the same treatment as everybody else.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond referred to the setting up of a consultative council in the Dublin postal district and I was glad to hear him say that he approved of this development.  He asked how the council was functioning.  Deputy Tully had some comments to make on the operation of councils of this kind in general.  The council in the Dublin postal district has been in operation for over a year now and, although neither staff nor management claim it is working perfectly, both are satisfied it is serving a useful purpose.  The success of councils of this kind depends on mutual trust and confidence between staff and management and this is something which cannot be achieved overnight. My hope is that, with the passage of time and as council members gain experience and staff realise its potential, it will fulfil an increasingly important role.  Both Deputies inquired about the introduction of similar councils in other centres.  Three other councils have been set up in the last three months and it has been agreed with staff representatives to establish councils at 12 other centres catering for all the major staff groups and I expect these will be established within the next few months.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully, when talking about the five-day week for postmen, said he was sure the public would be agreeable to giving postmen a five-day week. Deputy Cooney did not share his view. A staff claim for the introduction of a five-day week for postmen has been under discussion at departmental council level for quite a long time now. There are special problems involved but, despite these, it has been possible to give more than half the 3,000 full-time postmen a five-day week.  I understand the question of what can be done for the remainder is under active consideration by the departmental council at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer not to comment on that at the moment. <Col N="1109" /> Deputy Dowling was by no means enamoured with the Department's use of industrial psychologists but I am told that their employment is experimental and we shall review the question of using them in the light of our experience on the pilot training for which they have been engaged.  It is only right that we should explore whether their employment can be of value to both the staff and the Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully raised the question of exempting drivers in my Department from the driving test prescribed under the Road Traffic Act.  The determination of what class of persons may be exempted from such tests in order to secure a driving licence is not a matter for me; it is a matter for the Minister for Local Government who has indicated that he is not prepared to exempt drivers of post office vehicles from the test.</P>

      <P>Deputy Begley asked that an extra allowance be paid to sub-postmasters in tourist areas to enable them to employ extra staff to cope with the extra business during the summer.  The position is that the pay of sub-postmasters is related to the volume of business transacted and extra business arising in these circumstances is taken into account in determining the remuneration of the sub-postmasters concerned.  Deputy Dowling mentioned the question of the employment of disabled by my Department.  Subject to the requirements of the work, the Department do what they can in this regard.  What the Deputy said will be borne in mind and if anything further can be done the possibility will be sympathetically considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins stressed the difficulty, which she believed to exist, in regard to the recruiting of staff.  The Department is a very big employer and large numbers of new staff are needed each year to meet <Col N="1110" /> normal wastage and expansion.  Generally speaking, the Department succeed in meeting staff needs but difficulties arise from time to time in regard to certain grades.  I have already described the measures which it has been felt necessary to undertake to improve the recruitment of professional engineers. The same Deputy also raised the question of payment for providing telephone services on Sunday evenings in smaller exchanges.  The attendance is two hours and not four hours as the Deputy stated; the payments for this attendance are those agreed with the sub-postmasters union and consist of a minimum payment plus an allowance in respect of traffic handled.  The minimum payment is 4/- and not 2/- as the Deputy stated and as I say the total payment depends on the volume of traffic handled.  Deputy Tully referred to Christmas overtime by postmen.  The detailed information he requested in a recent question is being prepared and I hope to let him have it soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>On the question of the control of the overtime I just wish to say that there is no arbitrary limit on the amount that may be allowed. Overtime work in rural areas cannot be supervised or directly checked and each claim must be decided on locally. If a postman is not satisfied with the time allowed he may appeal to the postmaster.  In the occasional case in which agreement cannot be reached he can appeal to headquarters.  The number of appeals which go to headquarters from a total of about 7,000 postmen who work overtime at Christmas is small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that there have been cases where sub-postmasters have certified the amount of overtime worked but postmasters have <Col N="1111" /> then reduced the amount.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I have spelt out the position quite clearly.  In regard to the income tax problem which arises when income tax is not sufficiently evenly spread over a long period and can cause an excessive burden over a short term, my Department have been in touch with the Revenue Commissioners trying to seek a solution and I am hopeful that it will be possible to make some arrangement that will be administratively practicable.</P>

      <P>Various Deputies raised the question of giving established appointments to temporary postmen. Permanent established status can be obtained only through success in a competition conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners.  Suitable competitions confined to serving temporary or auxiliary postmen are conducted from time to time.  One was held in 1970 for men in the provinces and another will shortly be held for temporary postmen in Dublin.  Deputy Tully referred to pensions and asked that they be introduced for temporary full-time and part-time postmen.  A claim for pensions on behalf of part-time and unestablished full-time civil servants is before the general council under the arbitration and conciliation scheme and such grades would benefit from any improvement that might be agreed on arising from that claim.</P>
      <P>In regard to the new Donegal post office in which Deputy Tully was interested it was necessary to revise earlier plans for the new post office because of the need to retain an existing house in which the manual telephone exchange was accommodated. Revised plans were recently received from the Office of Public Works and are under examination and local staff will be consulted on them.  It is too early yet to say when tenders will be invited but the Deputy can rest assured that everything possible will be done to keep the project moving quickly.</P>

As regards new premises all known sites were investigated and for one known reason or another were not obtainable or would not satisfy planning conditions.  The question of providing for the office by leasing accommodation in a new block to be erected in the area was considered but owing to delays encountered by the developer a solution has not been finally reached. Getting back to the central sorting office and the elimination of dust and the ventilation problem, on which Deputy Tully touched, all possible measures have been taken to eliminate dust from this office.  These measures included the raising of cleaning standards and fairly good results have been achieved.  Mechanical ventilators have been installed in various parts about which the staff complained. Last year the installation of a mechanically assisted ventilation system was decided on as the most effective way of eliminating the problem in the whole building.  Plans for the installation in the office block portion are advanced and it is expected that tenders will be invited by the end of the year with the prospect that installation work will commence by April or May, 1972.  A date cannot be fixed yet for the installation of ventilation equipment in the main sorting floors but every effort will be made to put the work in hands as near as possible to the dates quoted for the office block.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully also asked if there was consultation with staff in regard to building plans.  When planning new buildings or alterations to existing buildings, it is standard <Col N="1113" /> practice to consult with staff representatives and to supply them with copies of the plans for inspection.  Suggestions from staff are welcomed and are carefully considered at all stages.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully had another query in regard to reconstruction and the extension of the post office at Mullingar.  When planning of a scheme for the reconstruction and the extension of Mullingar post office was under consideration in December, 1968 a suggestion was made that accommodation for other Government Departments should be included in the scheme. This proposal was examined and incorporated in preliminary architectural plans which at a later stage did not find favour with the Departments concerned. New plans for an exclusive post office building were necessary and arrangements accordingly have been initiated.  It is not possible yet to forecast when building works are likely to commence.</P>

The question of replacing the black paramatic coats worn by postmen drivers by a yellow or white plastic coat is one of a number of proposals due to be considered by a departmental committee on road safety, shortly, I hope.</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond is unhappy, as are many other people, <Col N="1114" /> that RTE should be dependent on advertising for as much as 60 per cent of its income.  He has suggested that the percentage of time given to advertising should be reduced to half and considers that the Irish people would be in favour of such a reduction even if it meant an increase in the licence fee.  The increase in the licence fee that would follow the adoption of Deputy Desmond's recommendation would be approximately £4 for a television licence, which would then cost £10.  While this would, perhaps, be a small matter to many people such as Deputies, it might be hard on a great numbers of viewers of more limited means who might prefer to put up with the present level of advertising rather than face the extra fee for its reduction.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keating thought that the volume of advertising should be reduced and that the money should be found in some other way.  Deputy Desmond also expressed the view that the RTE service should not necessarily pay its way and he was confident that the taxpayer would not resent having to meet a substantial deficit on the service.  I do not share his confidence and I certainly consider that the very great number of citizens who have not television sets either because they do not want them or because they cannot afford them would feel ill used at having to subsidise those people who have television sets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling suggested that some standards should be established to govern television advertising.  The authority apply a comprehensive code of standards for television and sound advertising.  This code is published in the form of a booklet.  The code sets out the minimum standards to be observed, but the authority reserve the right to impose stricter standards should this be considered necessary.  It is fully conscious of the unique position of television as a medium which penetrates into the family circle and that it has, therefore, to maintain higher standards than would be acceptable in other advertising media.  Deputy Dowling suggested that advertising should be confined to the beginning or the end of programmes and should not <Col N="1115" /> be inserted in the middle of them.  I have much sympathy with this suggestion. It is obviously irritating to viewers that programmes, especially serious ones, are interrupted by breaks, but the authority cannot, however, ignore the question of revenue.  Advertising charges for peak periods are very high and obviously there would be a serious loss of revenue if the Deputy's suggestion was accepted completely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, I am sure the authority exercise discretion in the placing of advertisements and as far as is reasonably practicable will avoid obtrusive interruptions of programmes by advertisements.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling also suggested that there was possibly dictation by advertisers as to when and how their advertisements would be presented.  There is no question of such dictation and the best advertising spots, that is the times and programmes that attract maximum viewing, are charged for at higher rates, and the people who pay these rates naturally get the best spots. Deputy Keating thought that the RTE Authority should not be nominated by the Government as at present.  The present arrangement is laid down by the Broadcasting Authority Act and any change, even if considered desirable, would require legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully, Deputy Desmond and Deputy O'Donnell expressed a wish that party political broadcasts be resumed and urged that the political parties involved should get together for discussions with a view to reaching agreement.  This, of course, is a matter between the parties, and RTE, as Deputy Desmond commented, is willing to provide the service if agreement is reached between the parties.  Deputy Desmond also urged that RTE, when reporting the proceedings of the Dáil and Seanad, should be in a position to show viewers and let them hear the highlights of proceedings in Leinster House.  This is also a matter which would need to be discussed between the parties and, perhaps, the Ceann Comhairle before RTE could take any action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> In my opening statement I mentioned the costs incurred in connection with the inquiry into the RTE &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; television programme on illegal moneylending. Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins expressed concern regarding this matter. As I said, the total amount paid to date is £29,390 and liability has been accepted for other items amounting to over £3,000.  These payments are in respect of legal costs and official expenditure on stenography, witnesses' expenses, press advertising, printing, <i>et cetera.</i> The legal costs which account for £24,428 are fees paid to State-employed counsel only, that is, counsel representing the Attorney General, Garda Síochána and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Some claims have been made for the legal expenses of other parties who were represented at the tribunal but no decision has yet been taken as to whether any of these costs will be borne by the State.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion on which we discussed the matter, I suggested to Deputy O'Donovan that he should do that.  With regard to the pending legislation to amend the 1960 Act, it would appear from Deputy Desmond's contribution that he possibly misunderstood some references I made here on the Second Stage of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1971.  In order to remove any doubt or misconception I should now make it clear that the specific changes I have in mind relate only to such matters as the authority's powers of borrowing and investment in the scope of RTE's superannuation scheme.  It is yet too early for me to say whether these changes will be made at all or whether they will be such as will require special legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> Speaking in relation to the Gaeltacht radio station, Deputy Begley expressed concern about the extent to which the people of the Gaeltacht will have a say in the selection of programmes broadcast by the new Gaeltacht station which it has been decided to establish.  I would like to assure the Deputy it is firmly intended that there will be effective consultation with the people of the Gaeltacht communities in order to ensure that the programmes broadcast will make the maximum contribution to their social and cultural life.  Methods of ensuring this, as well as various other questions bearing on control of the new service, are at present under consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Joe Lenehan asked why the new Gaeltacht station was being located in Galway instead of Donegal or Mayo. In fact, Mayo is getting two transmitters, one at Bangor Erris and the other at Tourmakeady.  There will also be one at Gweedore in Donegal.  The location of all the transmitters has been carefully planned so as to give the desired coverage.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Begley's reference to Comhaltas Cheoltóirí Éireann, I was happy to learn that talks between RTE and Comhaltas Cheoltóirí Éireann were resumed about a month ago and discussions are going on regarding a proposed series of programmes in early summer.  I understand that there are a number of other matters under discussion also between the two bodies.</P>

      <P>Deputy Begley referred to television reception in the Dingle peninsula area and, in particular, in the Dún Chaoin area.  I understand that there has been a general improvement in West Kerry as a result of modification carried out to the Cahirciveen transposer last year but there are certain mountain districts where reception is still less than adequate.  In view of the difficult terrain and the relatively small population to be served, RTE say they are unlikely for some time to come to be able to fit these areas for extended reception.</P>

Naturally, this assists all three services and it helps RTE in presenting a balanced and impartial account of events.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crowley expressed strong views as to the provision of a second television station.  I have to tell the Deputy that there are no plans for a second television channel because the cost involved would be extremely high. Transmitters and other equipment would cost far more than the existing plant costs because ultra-frequency bands would have to be used for the second channel and more transmitters and greater power would be required for national coverage.  I agree that the present television service has some imperfections and unfulfilled needs which, to my mind, should receive priority over a second service. Therefore, the question of a second station has not been considered seriously in detail.</P>

      <P>A Deputy referred to the need for a shortwave station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> It was decided in the 1940s to set up a shortwave service mainly for the Americas, Australia and European countries.  The equipment for that purpose was purchased and installed.  In April, 1948, when work on this station had not been completed, it was decided to discontinue the project.  Some years later the equipment was disposed of on the best terms available and the situation was that the shortwave listening had become negligible because of poor listening conditions and the general absence of shortwave bands on receiving sets; also, because of the spread of television.  I am sure the Deputy will be aware that I did say in the Seanad when speaking on the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill, 1971, that I am having the matter re-examined at the moment.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; inquiry.  In referring briefly to this subject in my opening statement, I expressed the hope that the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; affair would be disposed of without the heat which the matter generated for some time after it was first raised.  In saying this, I have no wish whatsoever to stifle discussion if Deputies wish to discuss the matter but I am glad that discussion has been calm.</P>

      <P>Deputy FitzGerald, unlike most other Deputies, was very anxious to revive the acrimony which surrounded the early stages of the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; affair.  He made his appearance in this debate to talk from an Olympian height about the inappropriateness of having had the inquiry. He suggested that the purpose in setting it up was to muzzle freedom of speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He went on to say that it was evident <Col N="1121" /> that there should have been an inquiry.  He referred to an amendment to the terms of reference proposed by the leader of his party which was accepted by the Taoiseach.  He conveniently overlooked the fact that his party had claimed the credit for demanding the inquiry.  He criticised the terms of reference.  He said he made no criticism whatever of the tribunal and generally he went around in circles at a rate sufficient to make dizzy a less eloquent performer.  Perhaps he even made himself dizzy because, as Deputy O'Donovan said, he departed at once from the House having delivered himself of his words of wisdom.</P>
    <P>Having somewhat more respect for the rules of the House than Deputy FitzGerald, I do not intend to criticise or, indeed, to express any opinion on the wisdom of the Oireachtas in deciding that the tribunal should be set up, or in settling its terms of reference but, reluctant though I am to revive animosity, I cannot let Deputy FitzGerald get away altogether with his pontifications about the events leading to the setting up of the tribunal of inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, the facts which are well known to the House are that, shortly after the controversial programme appeared, a number of questions were asked and answered in the House.  Various allegations were made and the Opposition parties demanded an inquiry, Deputy FitzGerald among others asking&mdash;and I quote from volume 242 of the Official Report of Wednesday 26th November, 1969, column 1873: &ldquo;Is it not clear that there must be a sworn inquiry?&rdquo; It became evident that, as the Taoiseach stated on 2nd December, 1969, there was a conflict between the evidence available to the Minister for Justice and the RTE Authority on the authenticity of the content of the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme and on the question of whether people who took part in the portrayal of the social evil of illegal moneylending were genuine or merely acting a part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach decided to yield to <Col N="1122" /> the Opposition demands that a judicial inquiry be set up.  On behalf of his party, Deputy Corish welcomed the decision by the Taoiseach.  The late Deputy Sweetman reminded the House that it was Deputy Cosgrave who first asked for the inquiry.  On 16th December, the Taoiseach moved a motion for the establishment of a tribunal with terms of reference set out in that motion.  During the debate in this House he accepted an amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition which asked that the terms should include an examination by the tribunal as to whether or not the statements, comments and implications of the programme reflected reasonable journalistic care on the part of those responsible for the programme.  The resolution, as amended, was passed by both Houses and the tribunal was set up in due course.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald had the temerity to say that the Taoiseach had some reason to apologise for his part in the discussions which preceded his decision to accept the Opposition demands for an inquiry.  He quoted some of the words used by the Taoiseach but, with his usual dexterity, he avoided referring to the most material statement made in the debate of 16th December in which the Taoiseach said that if what he believed to be the case was found not to be correct he would, of course, be satisfied with the tribunal's findings.  The Taoiseach said he would not in any way accuse RTE or their staff of misrepresenting facts or of misrepresenting the situation.  He added that this would be a matter entirely for the tribunal.  He went on to say that the issue was clearly to decide whether or not what RTE said or what the Garda said was the truth.  The Taoiseach's remarks expressed clearly his desire that the conflicting statements made about this unfortunate programme&mdash;and the application of the word &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; I leave to each Deputy to interpret in his own way&mdash; should be cleared up by eliciting all the facts from all quarters as fully as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald went on to work himself into a high state of excitement with allegations about his interpretation <Col N="1123" /> of what the Minister for Transport and Power said in the Seanad, what counsel for the State said before the tribunal, and with demands for this and demands for that.  I am not at all sure whether Deputy FitzGerald wanted the resignation of the Government for having met his party's demand for the inquiry or whether he was really criticising his party leader for making the demand.  Deputy FitzGerald expressed his high-minded concern lest the findings of the tribunal, of which he expressed his full approval, should cause a serious loss of morale amongst newspaper men.  He said, too, that the judges were asked to apply their legal minds to the question of whether RTE had proved, or could prove, their case in a court of law or had prepared themselves to prove it before the programme was put on. The tribunal were not asked any such thing.</P>
    <P>The nearest approach I can get to identifying what Deputy FitzGerald seems to be referring to is the part of the terms of reference saying: &ldquo;whether or not these statements, comments and implications reflected reasonable journalistic care on the part of those responsible for the programme&rdquo;. As Deputies will recall, this part of the terms of reference was inserted at the request of the leader of the Fine Gael Party.  In passing, I may add that I can well understand Deputy FitzGerald's alarm at the suggestion that a criterion such as that proposed in his leader's amendment to the resolution should gain any wide acceptance. The adoption of such a criterion would make life very, very difficult for Deputy FitzGerald.  As for the suggestion that a result of the tribunal would be to undermine freedom of speech, I can only say that the Deputy's imagination is over-heated these days.</P>
    <P>Apart from Deputy FitzGerald's excited contribution, comments by other Deputies were in a lower key.  I think there was a wide measure of, although not universal, agreement with the view expressed in my opening statement that we should look to the future rather than dwell on the past.  Deputy <Col N="1124" /> FitzGerald, looking down as usual on the political scene from his self-satisfied position on a lonely height, feels that there has been an extraordinary deterioration in parliamentary life over the past 18 months.  The temptation to deal severely with Deputy FitzGerald's contribution to this debate is a very enticing one, and a difficult one to resist, but being the very easy-going person that I am, and looking to the season in which we find ourseves, I will resist that temptation.  I will confine myself to the remark that one would search hard to find anything in Deputy FitzGerald's speech on this debate contributing in the slightest degree to raising the level of the standard of parliamentary life.</P>
    <P>I have deliberately and carefully refrained from making any comment either in support of or in opposition to what Deputies have said on that matter in the course of the debate.  We know the history of the setting up of the tribunal and each of us can agree to interpret it in his own way.  The tribunal's findings have been published for everyone to read.</P>
    <P>They are clearly stated and the tribunal gave their reasons for each finding equally clearly.  I prefer to let the tribunal's report speak for itself. As I said in my opening statement, I am confident that the Authority has taken or will take any action arising out of the tribunal's findings.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Members of the House for their tributes to the staffs of the post office throughout the country.  I should like to join in their tributes and refer to the headquarters officers concerned with these and all other services given by the Department. I thank our customers for the business they give the post office and for the forbearance they show when occasional failures occur as is inevitable in a service handling hundreds of millions of transactions and for their general goodwill to the post office.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £657,300 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1971, for salaries and expenses in connection with Forestry, and for payment of certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate comprises two main items under subheads A and C 2 aggregating £607,300 which arise entirely on the score of wage and salary increases, a new provision of £100,000 for conservation and an off-setting increase of £50,000 in revenue under Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>Subhead A.&mdash;Salaries, wages and allowances&mdash;revised by the Supplementary Estimate to a figure of £1,352,700 shows an increase of £195,110 over the provision for 1969-70.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1126" /> Subhead C 2.&mdash;Forest Development and Management&mdash;is revised by Supplementary Estimate to £4,343,000. This is, of course, the main expenditure subhead in this Vote.  The major provisions in the subhead relate to the raising of nursery stock in the State forest nurseries, the establishment costs of all new planting including ground preparation and fencing, road and bridge contruction, the purchase and maintenance of all forest machinery and the hire of suitable machinery from outside sources, the general cost of maintaining and protecting all our existing acreage of forest plantations, now standing at 531,000 acres in extent, and finally the cost of such timber felling and conversion as we now undertake by direct labour in our forests.</P>
    <P>As to new planting, a programme of some 22,500 acres this year imposes a severe strain on our reserve of land. There are, however, indications of a continuing upward trend in land acquisition, and I am hopeful that over the next few years real progress will be made towards alleviating the difficulties of our land reserve position.</P>
    <P>The provision in the subhead as revised by Supplementary Estimate shows an overall increase of £457,000 on the provision for 1969-70.  This increase arises entirely from wage costs due to the impact of the 11th round of wage increases over a full year and now the additional cost of 12th round wage increases to forestry workers under which they were awarded an increase of 50s per week effective from 1st April, 1970 and a further 34s per week from 1st January, 1971.</P>
    <P>These increases in labour costs make it necessary to continue pursuit of the objective of cost reduction which has always been of primary concern to the forest service.  Advances in technology both in the mechanisation of forest operations and in the use of chemicals are constantly being studied and introduced. Emphasis is at present being placed on better methods of harvesting timber and a comprehensive study of the whole approach to the harvesting of forest produce is in hands.  This study will involve an examination in detail of plant spacings, thinning procedures including line thinning, and <Col N="1127" /> the spacing and construction of forest roads.  New equipment for the extraction of timber is under development in various countries abroad and we must ensure that our forest service will be in a position to take prompt advantage of any advances in these fields.  The only other aspect of work covered by this subhead to which I should, perhaps, specifically refer is the provision for amenity development in the State forests.  Among the amenity projects in hands is the major development at Lough Key jointly with Bord Fáilte. Other important developments are being pursued at Doonaree, County Cavan, at Ards, County Donegal, at Killakee, County Dublin and at Devil's Glen, County Wicklow.  In addition, facilities such as car-parks, picnic sites, access to viewing points have been or are currently being provided in over 150 forest areas throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Subhead I&mdash;Conservation (Grant-in-Aid). This is a new head for which a provision of £100,000 is made in the Supplementary Estimate.  The costs incurred by my Department&mdash;small in relation to the level of activity engendered&mdash;in organising European Conservation Year were borne on subhead F of the Forestry Vote.  It is too soon to assess the results of Conservation Year but I believe that a significant advance has been made. To a great extent our work in Conservation Year has been concerned with people's attitudes; to lay the foundation of proper planning for conservation it is necessary that people should believe in the objectives that have been set before them in the past year.  I am satisfied that a real foundation of goodwill has been laid down and that on such a foundation one can build with security for the future.</P>
    <P>The practical job of building from that foundation begins with the provision in the Supplementary Estimate of a sum of £100,000 for a new subhead I, Conservation.  The provision is made in pursuance of an undertaking in the Budget statement of April last that this sum would be provided to defray the organisational costs of a comprehensive national programme for conservation.  Many Departments and <Col N="1128" /> agencies are engaged in various aspects of conservation.  The account which will be set up under this Supplementary Estimate will be administered by my Department, i.e. funds therefrom can also be made available to finance conservation projects by other Departments. One project which can now be advanced through the availability of these funds is the development of field study centres.  The proposed field study centre at Gartan Lough, County Donegal, is a high priority.  On the broader plane and apart from my own Department's direct involvement in practical conservation work, other projects have already been suggested which merit careful consideration.  The use of grant-in-aid procedure will enable projects to be planned ahead on the basis of entering into commitments which will not always mature within a given year.</P>
    <P>As a further development in this field, the services in relation to game development which have hitherto been funded by subhead L of the Lands Vote are now transferred to the Forestry Division and the subhead will appear in the Forestry Vote for 1971-72.  The game and wildlife branch hitherto operating in the Department of Lands has been amalgamated with the corresponding service in the Forestry Division to form a composite forest and wildlife service.  I am satisfied that this arrangement will give greater organisational strength and will provide a basic framework which can be developed to meet requirements for conservation of both fauna and flora in the context of the new wildlife legislation which I hope to bring before the House in the near future.</P>
    <P>Subhead H &mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid &mdash;as revised by Supplementary Estimate, allows for a total income of £1,000,000 an increase of £108,000 over the 1969-70 Estimate provision. Actual income in 1969-70 came to £811,500 so that this year's Estimate represents an increase of £188,500 over last year's income.</P>
    <P>Markets this year for both sawlog material and pulpwood have been buoyant.  Sales of sawlogs have increased slightly in the current year and prices have been well maintained.  Input <Col N="1129" /> of material to the four major processing industries has continued to expand&mdash;the major extension of processing facilities by Waterford Chipboard Ltd. being a major factor.</P>
    <P>Deputies will no doubt rejoice to see the &ldquo;magic million&rdquo; achieved in State forest receipts for the first time ever and we look forward to further steady annual increases on this head.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that any gains from improvement in receipts have been far outweighed by the incidence of increased wage costs on the expenditure side of the enterprise.  We must, however, live with the fact that at our present stage of building up the country's forest estate, labour costs will be the dominant factor and the price of timber as a primary raw material cannot be expected to react and move upwards simultaneously with the sharp upward trend in labour costs which has been experienced in recent years.  It is, of course, a fact that economy viability is not affected provided the long-term trend of prices balances out the higher input costs which occur largely at the beginning of rotation.</P>
    <P>A long-term production forecast prepared by the forest service is now complete and has been released to all sectors of the industry.  The forecast is based on a thorough and very careful appraisal of all our growing stock and was a sophisticated exercise on scientific lines using modern computerised techniques.  It will provide valuable data for long-term planning of industry in both the sawmilling and processing sectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, I think, common case on both sides of the House that we would all like to see forestry activity prosper and grow.  In fact, as long ago as 1907, a committee on Irish forestry said that all the men of experience and expert knowledge were agreed that in soil and climate Ireland, for forestry purposes, was particularly well favoured; on the question of our capacity to grow timber as well as any other country in Northern Europe they stated there could be no doubt whatsoever. Nobody could take issue with that statement and we are anxious that <Col N="1130" /> the sentiments expressed then should be translated into action and that we should reap the fruits of that action.</P>
      <P>The first essential in putting these pious thoughts into active and fruitful operation is to ensure that staffing within the Forestry Division is adequate. I have some worries about the recruitment of professional staff, graduates in agriculture, specialists in forestry.  I understand that each year there are four vacancies in the Division. This norm was set quite a number of years ago before the activities of the Division had expanded to their present size.  It could happen that in some years the number of graduates with the requisite qualifications might exceed by one or two, perhaps, the norm and that one or two might have to emigrate since, apart from forestry, there are very few openings here for professional foresters.  Having regard to the importance of forestry in our economy, it would be a pity to permit people with the requisite qualifications to emigrate. In this age of sophistication it is essential that the Forestry Division should be staffed as far as possible with men holding professional qualifications.  I suggest to the Minister that recruiting policy might now be looked at anew. The Division is expanding into conservation and, to ensure conservation, it is vital that highly qualified and professional experts on this matter should be available.  I shall come back to this later.</P>
      <P>With regard to unskilled staff, if anybody who works in a forest can be termed unskilled, there is one point I should like to mention.  On a wet day when the men are unable to work they have to take shelter in unheated huts. If they go home they lose a day's pay. It is unhealthy that they should have to shelter in such conditions.  It should be neither difficult nor expensive to supply a simple boiler which could be fuelled with forest thinnings and waste wood so that the men might enjoy modest comfort in wet weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next logical step to the provision of professional staff is the provision of land.  The Minister's statement was vague on this particular matter.  He talks of an indication of a general upward trend in land acquisition and <Col N="1131" /> he is hopeful that over the next few years real progress will be made towards alleviating the difficulties of our land reserve position.  The Minister must concede that our land reserve position is in a critical condition.  If we do not have enough land on hands to take full advantage of our forest potential the net cause of that is the bad price paid for land.  I concede that the type of land bought for forestry is marginal land, not the sort of land to command any sort of high price.  I understand that the Department is limited to a maximum figure of £40 per acre for the best land.  This figure is quite unrealistic in this day and age.  It means that in the vast majority of cases the price given for land is in the region of £6 to £7 to £10 an acre.  That is no attraction to a man who has ten or 20 acres of bog; it is no attraction to him to be offered £60 or £100 for it.  The question of an adequate land reserve will not be solved until such time as a more realistic figure is paid for land by the Department of Lands.  I also think that it would be an inducement, in view of the comparatively small price the Department have to pay for holdings, if the Department made it invariably a condition of sale that the vendor's costs would be paid.  These in relation to the total purchase price are small but in view of the relatively small size of the total purchase price they inhibit free dealing between owners of marginal land and the Department.</P>
    <P>The land acquisition procedure will have to be looked at in relation to the prices paid.  I understand that a steady annual acquisition of 20,000 to 25,000 acres is needed in order to keep the land reserve at an economic position with regard to forward planning and forward planting.  It cannot be and will not be acquired, and past experience has proved this, until a more realistic price per acre is paid by the Department. Up to now the emphasis in regard to land acquisition has been on the purchase of bog or marginal land. A tree is like a crop and the better the land the higher quality crop you will have.  The result of buying only marginal land is that the biggest part of our <Col N="1132" /> planting consists of evergreens.  It is a commercial timber and there is nothing wrong with it but at this stage we should begin to consider a variation in the type of planting and an expansion into other species.  For instance, hardwoods&mdash;beech and oak&mdash;should be planted on a greater scale but to plant these you need better land.  Of course, none of us will ever see these trees nearing maturity but for the future we should ensure that there will be an ample covering of deciduous timber. We cannot do that unless we plant now and we cannot plant unless we get land that will grow that type of timber. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to look into the question of improving the quality of the land being bought and increasing the price being paid for it.</P>
    <P>The question of grants for private planting will also have to be looked at again.  I do not think the Minister mentioned private planting but I should like to point out that the grant, which is £20, was fixed ten, 12 or even a longer number of years ago and having regard to the devaluation of money its real value is considerably less than £20. Its value to the farmers as an incentive is further diminished by the fact that the grant is payable in two sums, £10 on planting and £10 after five years following an inspection to see that the forest is developing in an adequate way.  I submit that this would not induce a person with suitable land to go in for private planting.  The grant will have to be increased and paid in a more realistic way.  Timber is a slow crop and five years is not long to wait but for a small farmer with only a few acres of marginal land it is too long a prospect.  At the start of the five years, it looks so long that generally it is a factor that will compel him not to plant.  Another matter that might be looked at is the minimum area that has to be planted to qualify for a grant in relation to private planting.  At the moment the minimum is one acre, apart from the so-called underdeveloped areas where half an acre will qualify.  It is so important to encourage private planting in order to provide timber cover in all parts that the minimum area should be half an acre all over.  This might have the effect of encouraging <Col N="1133" /> people residing on good land to plant half an acre here and half an acre there of deciduous timber.  For generations to come it will mean an immense difference with regard to the visual prospects of our land.</P>
    <P>The Department might consider a grant for amenity planting.  One can visualise a situation in which a landowner might have small pockets of land that would not come to half an acre in extent but which he would like to plant with trees, evergreens or hardwoods.  At the moment there is no grant for this type of amenity planting done privately.  I am not speaking now of amenity planting at approaches to towns or villages which is dealt with by local authorities and public-spirited citizens.  A farmer who would have suitable mearings should be encouraged to plant them.  This would add to the appearance of the countryside. It would encourage wild life and provide shelter.  Grants could be made available to encourage hardwood planting and the grant could be on the basis of a grant per tree.  This would also entail expert assistance from the Department for any farmer who might be contemplating such planting.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to deal with is in regard to planting and felling State forests.  The Minister said that markets this year for both sawlogs material and pulpwood have been buoyant.  I take it that this means that there is a good market for trees at the moment. He said that sales of sawlogs have increased slightly in the current year and prices have been well maintained. In a buoyant market sales should not have increased only slightly.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why sales should not have taken advantage of the market and increased enormously.  We have enormous stocks of sufficiently mature timber for sale.  Our original plantations are 30 or 40 years old and would be sufficiently mature for commercial sale.  I wonder are we face to face with a question of policy in the Department in the sense that there is a deliberate policy to hoard our State forests against a rainy day or a national or worldwide emergency.  There must be such a policy otherwise sales would have increased last year.  It is a wrong <Col N="1134" /> policy to hold commercially mature timber against such an emergency because if we are to have an emergency again it will be an atomic emergency and nobody need bother hoarding anything. The sales of our commercially-mature timber should be increased. Apart from the much needed revenue which such sales would bring to the Exchequer they would also have other effects on the operations of the Department.</P>
    <P>Take a forest of 300 acres of com-mercially-mature timber.  Such forests are to be found all over the country but some of these are not being touched.  There should be a programme of selling, say, 10 per cent per annum of such a forest.</P>
    <P>Instead of, perhaps, selling the whole 300 acres, in ten years time there should be gradual selling.  This would have a number of advantages.  There would be a more staggered cycle of replanting and this in turn would mean that the overall age-distribution of our forests would be varied and there would be a good age-distribution all over the country.</P>
    <P>It would have a further very important effect on the question of forest staff.  At the moment many of our forests are in areas of high emigration. If the present pattern of emigration in these areas continues one can foresee a situation where there could be a shortage of labour.  At the moment too much of the work provided in the forests is on a temporary basis.  If these men could get all-the-year-round employment they would stay and there would be staff at all times for our forests.  One way of ensuring all-the-year-round work is to carry out in our forests continual felling of small lots of mature trees.  It is very important, with an eye to the future, to ensure that in these areas there would be adequate and competent staff to deal with all the activities of our forests. If some plan like this is not devised one can see a situation where men will have to be brought from 25 or 30 miles away, with high transport costs, to work in some of the more remote forests.  This plan of felling in small lots on a continual basis would provide <Col N="1135" /> permanent work for the men, would provide revenue for forestry and ensure that planting would be on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>A further point is that if the felling is gradual the replanting will be gradual and you will not have naked scars up the side of mountains.  If we leave some of our 30 to 40 year old forests for another 10 years these will have to be felled <i>in toto</i> and that will have a disastrous effect on the appearance of large areas of our scenic countryside.  This should be avoided and can be avoided if there is a change in the policy of the Department.  The Minister does not say anything about this but there must be some reason for the present policy.  The only reason I can opine is that it is a policy of hoarding our forests for a rainy day. That is wrong policy.  The trees should be felled when they are commercially mature, not altogether but in lots.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a long-term production forecast prepared for the forestry service.  I do not know how that was published or to whom it was sent.  Perhaps it is a very technical document and only of concern to people in the trade.  However, it would be a very interesting document for Deputies to read and I would be disappointed if a document which is obviously of such importance to the forestry service was not readily and easily available and if it is a very technical document, that there would not be a layman's comment available for Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Minister has rightly said that conservation is an important aspect of the operations of his Department.  He says: &ldquo;It is too soon to assess the results of Conservation Year but I believe that a significant advance has been made.&rdquo;  I would respectfully disagree with the Minister.  I would agree with him if the long-promised wild life legislation were before the House but without that legislation no real advance can be made in conservation.  We are as we were a number of years ago before there was any publicity on the subject at all.  Public opinion is more educated on the subject but I cannot agree when the Minister says a significant <Col N="1136" /> advance has been made.  It is very disappointing to many dedicated people who are working in voluntary organisations up and down the country on animal protection and on various aspects of wild life conservation that they have not got statutory backing for their efforts.</P>
    <P>It is essential that this legislation would be introduced quickly because the pace of pollution is not being checked and cannot be checked until such time as legislation is in being.  I use &ldquo;pollution&rdquo; in a wide sense and I would include many continental sportsmen coming over to shoot everything that flies.  They pollute our countryside and there should be some means, through Bord Fáilte via the Minister for Justice, of informing these gentlemen that a shooting holiday here entitles them to shoot only game birds. This is another reason for the urgent introduction of legislation.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that it was as long ago as 7th March, 1970, that he stated at a conference which is referred to in the Bulletin of the Department of External Affairs, No. 826:</P>
    <P>A detailed outline of comprehensive legislation on wild life conservation was in the course of completion.</P>
    <P>Twelve months ago the outline was being completed and I am disappointed that the legislation following that is not available to this House.  Next to legislation the most important thing the Department can do under the heading of conservation is to educate the public, adults and children.  The caravan that went around the countryside was an excellent idea but its appeal was mainly to children.  They are the coming generation.  They must be educated and it is a highly commendable thing that efforts have been made in that regard.  However, with the increase in the pace of pollution and its danger to our wild life, the education of the adult is equally important and equally urgent.  I would urge the conservation section of the Department to plan more courses of education for this coming year that would bring home both to the urban and rural populations <Col N="1137" /> of Ireland the value of our great national heritage and what they must do in their individual ways to see that it is not diminished; in fact to see that it is enhanced.</P>
    <P>One sometimes is surprised at the lack of knowledge in rural Ireland relating to many aspects of wild life. There is very little real knowledge of birds and their habits, very little knowledge of the fauna of the country. Unfortunately it was a common thing that ring forts were destroyed in the course of land reclamation works purely through lack of knowledge on the part of the landowner that these were prehistoric sites and could contain things of the highest value.  The Ardagh Chalice was found in a common field.  All of this stems from a lack of knowledge.  One of the most rewarding tasks that the conservation section of the Department could undertake during the coming year would be to devise and implement, as a matter of urgency, a crash programme of education for the Irish people on their wonderful heritage.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, development of forestry should be commended and encouraged.  In connection with it, an expansion in conservation is equally to be commended and encouraged.  It will mean that in the future our forests will have to be considered not merely as places where trees are grown for the provision of timber but in the light of a conserve for wild life, as places to encourage the habitation of rare species and as high class recreational areas, offering a particular type of recreation. They should be used in a restrained manner but this, again, will require education.  In developing these places it will be necessary for the Department to employ highly qualified persons to ensure that the ecology of our forests will be studied fully and will be greatly expanded.  It will mean the recruitment of suitably qualified scientists who will have to take advantage of the experiences of their colleagues in other lands.  It was people like these I had in mind when, in my opening remarks, I referred to the need for other types of professional staff. These suitably qualified scientists are necessary if we are to ensure that what <Col N="1138" /> we have here in terms of wild life will not be disturbed and that it will be increased and expanded.</P>
    <P>I do not think we realise the potential paradise we have here.  We have a tremendous variety of scenery, lots of open country and clear skies as well as a great variety of wild life.  If conservation were dealt with in a very serious way, this country of ours could be the most desirable place in Europe in which to live.  To put that on a base commercial level, it could become a paradise where Europeans would spend their holidays.  I would urge that conservation would have an urgency about it and that, above all, the outstanding legislation would be introduced immediately.</P>
    <P>The opening of the forests to the public during the past year must be commended and encouraged.  People should be encouraged to visit the forests and to take part in walks.  So far as I know, only one day for forest walks was arranged last year on a national basis but I would hope that during the coming summer arrangements would be made to have more of these.  The more people go through the forests and listen to knowledgeable men talk about the wild life there, the more respect there will be for our natural resources generally.</P>
    <P>The Forestry Division of the Department must be a very attractive place in which to work.  I am sure it has its drawbacks like anywhere else but because the potential it has for doing good is such an exciting prospect, together with the goodwill it has from this House and from the public there can be no excuse for failing to do a good job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity of speaking this evening in this debate because, I presume, the Minister will be replying tomorrow and I would like him to be in a position to answer the few questions which I wish to put to him now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At Question Time today when the Taoiseach was asked to give the number of people in the country who are unemployed, he agreed that the number was in the region of 70,000.  He enumerated a number of factors which <Col N="1139" /> contributed to this high figure this year &mdash;the banks strike, the cement strike and so on.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware that his Department are preparing to add to that list from the 1st April a substantial number of people who are not able to find other employment.  These are not people who were taken on for a couple of weeks or a couple of months but people, some of whom have been employed for a number of years.  I do not know what is the reason for this but it displays an utter sense of irresponsibility on the part of the Government Department who have decided to lay off people.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister if he is aware of this.  I ask him, also, is this because of the fact that these people were given a wage increase last year as were all other workers?  Is there to be a corresponding reduction in indoor staff, in engineering staff and others or is it the usual practice that only the fellow with the spade and shovel must suffer when the question of economy must be considered?  I am tired of trying to deal with people in public employment who apparently have the idea that the man at the bottom of the ladder must make the sacrifice all the time but that if he moves up the ladder a bit, he is sheltered and cannot be touched.</P>
    <P>These people were given an increase last year as a result of negotiation between the trade union and the Government Department but now they are to be laid off because there is not enough money to pay them.  Cannot provision be made by way of a supplementary estimate to ensure that these people who, obviously, have been necessary up to now, are retained in their employment?  Is there a suggestion that the system of direct employment should be changed?  Recently the case of a tractor driver came to my notice.  This man tells me that his tractor has been left idle while a hired one is being used in the same job.  If this is so, it represents a change in employment and I would like to know if this is to be the policy in the future. The area I am referring to is in Donegal and I would not raise the matter here but for the fact that while <Col N="1140" /> the Department officials have been giving me replies they have been very courteous, and have always replied to my letters, but for some reason there are certain rather major objects on which I do not seem to be able to get a decision.  I get an acknowledgment, but I do not seem to be able to get a decision.</P>
    <P>Times have changed.  The Department are in the same position as outside employment and, if the members of a trade union are not satisfied with what is happening, they are entitled to take their case to the Labour Court.  I do not want to be responsible for dashing into the Labour Court with a case particularly against the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands who have been very reasonable over the years in discussions with us but, if I cannot get a decision on matters which I raise as a trade union official, I have no option but to go to the Labour Court and state why I am going there.</P>
    <P>I regret having to raise this matter tonight but there does not appear to be any other way.  Unless the Minister can do something about it quite a substantial number of people will be without jobs in a week's time.  That is not good enough.  Secondly, it will affect them in more ways than one because of the fact that at present there is under negotiation&mdash;it is almost completed and, as a matter of fact, it should be completed&mdash;a new pension and superannuation scheme for certain employees which this lay-off may affect.  Possibly I will be told that it is because of the increased costs involved in this that the men cannot be kept on, and that because their comrades are to get a small pension, they have to subscribe to it by losing their jobs.  If this is the case, somebody must do something about it.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to what happens when men have to stay in huts on bad days.  Surely it is ridiculous that in 1971 no provision seems to be made for heating those huts.  I have raised this matter again and again.  I can show a large file of letters written to the Minister's Department complaining about the huts, about the fact that there is not adequate heating and about the fact that huts are almost <Col N="1141" /> non-existent in some forests.  I get an acknowledgment saying that the matter is being looked into and if I write again the matter is still being looked into.  This has gone beyond a joke and I want a decision on it.</P>
    <P>I have been writing to the Minister's Department about the question of differentials.  In outside employment it has been possible to get a differntial increase for supervisory workers.  It has not been possible to get a decision on this matter from the Minister's Department. On the question of hours of work we have asked again and again if arrangements could be made which would be more convenient for hours of work.  I do not seem to be able to get a reply.  Why cannot a decision be given on these matters?  Does the Minister's Department think that it is all right to send an acknowledgment and to leave it at that?</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the system of selling timber.  The Minister said that the magic million has been reached.  I am delighted to hear that it has.  With the previous speaker, I believe that there must be some reason why more timber is not being sold. It is not that there is not more mature timber available.  I understand from those who work in the forests that there appears to be quite a lot of mature timber at present.  Possibly there is a good reason for this and the Minister should spell it out.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the cost of replacement.  It should be remembered that the cost of the land which was purchased for the purpose of planting timber originally, and the cost of the planting of the trees at that time, were a fraction of what it costs now, so it is not right to say that the cost of planting is so high now that it does not pay.  I am sure the Minister would agree that a very substantial profit must be made on timber which is being cut now.  In addition, if the timber is cut&mdash;and here I would differ from Deputy Cooney&mdash;and if a complete area is cleared, it should be possible to replant.  If the Forestry Division are going to replant they have that land for nothing.</P>
    <P>In 1955 another magic figure was reached with the planting of 25,000 <Col N="1142" /> acres.  The Minister now says that last year it was possible to plant 22,500 acres.  Why was it not possible to keep up the planting?  Surely land can be acquired?  Surely it is not a question of land not being available?  We know that there are areas of land which do not appear to be of much use which are held by some people on the grounds that they still want to use them.  They want them for sheep or for this, that or the other thing.  I am quite sure that if the Forestry Division went after the land it would be possible to acquire it.</P>
    <P>Cutaway bog was very much talked about a few years ago.  It was said that there should be co-operation with Bord na Móna in regard to cutaway bog where the land and the men would be available for planting timber.  Apparently this was not pursued and apparently not much was done about it. An extra effort should be made to acquire land.  I can understand the necessity to have a pool of land available, but it does not make sense to me if, because of the fact that a pool of land is not available, a lesser amount is being planted as the years go on. Eventually it will peter out and we will not be planting any more.  I do not think that is the correct approach.  As has been said by Deputy Cooney, if more money has to be paid for it, surely if the land is needed something has got to be done to acquire it.</P>
    <P>I would also agree that the opening of the forests for forest walks was an excellent idea.  As I said last year, great precautions will have to be taken to ensure that the fire risk is not greater than it is at present.  It is too bad that either deliberately or through carelessness people should burn forests and, in many cases, mature forests.  No punishment can be too severe for those who do that sort of thing.  It is vandalism of the highest degree and every effort should be made to prevent it.</P>
    <P>Conservation is mentioned in the Minister's speech.  Indeed, I am afraid that while the Conservation Year got a great deal of publicity in certain quarters, it did not seem to bring home to the people of this country the fact, that, if we are to believe some of the experts, it is not conservation we will be worrying about shortly but survival. <Col N="1143" /> We all know that rivers and streams in certain parts of the country have become so polluted that no form of life can exist in them.  A couple of years ago it was unheard of that streams would become so polluted. Who is polluting them?  We are.  There are major towns that are pumping raw sewage into streams, and nobody seems to worry about it.  It seems to be the done thing.  Some of them are close to the coast where the raw sewage appears again on the beaches, and again nobody seems to worry about it.</P>
    <P>We have the effluent from industrial concerns being pumped into rivers. Occasionally an inspection is carried out and it is discovered where the effluent is coming from; a prosecution is threatened but there is always innocence on the part of the people responsible.  They did not know it was happening and yet the next day the <Col N="1144" /> very same thing happens again, or at the first opportunity.  There will have to be far more strict control over this. Take our ordinary woodlands beside some of the forests.  People consider that they are perfectly entitled to drive out from towns with loads of rubbish, which could be put in the town dump, but which instead they dump on the side of the road or into the side of the forest.  We see this happening in various parts of the country.  Somebody comes along, cleans it up and takes it away and the next week the same thing happens again.  I believe that the reason for this is that sterner measures are not taken to prevent it.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday 24th March, 1971.</P>
