      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is now in a position to say whether a definite decision has been taken to raise the terms of the Compton Report at the European Commission of Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="An Tánaiste Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are gravely concerned by the allegations of brutality, <Col N="2" /> torture, inhuman and degrading treatment and unlawful deprivation of life in the North&mdash;concern which has not in any way been alleviated by the Compton report.  The work of collecting and evaluating evidence to support a reference to the European Commission of Human Rights is nearing completion and the Government will take a decision within a matter of days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Tánaiste say whether, independently of any question of referring the matter to the European Commission on Human Rights, it is proposed to make an official protest on the matter to the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="An Tánaiste Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have let their attitude towards brutality be known but I am answering a question in regard to the human rights situation. I should say that the procedure at the Commission of Human Rights is lengthy and time consuming and that a decision to raise the details of the Compton Report and to bring evidence <Col N="3" /> of brutality to the notice of the Commission would, in the first place, have no immediate specific effect on the practice of British security forces when carrying out detention and interrogation; moreover, the Government have been engaged on the diplomatic front and through public speeches on the far more urgent task of exhorting the British Government to promulgate political short and long term solutions which are of crucial and vital importance to the future of the Northern Ireland community.  A debate on this matter in the House indicated a general concensus of opinion.  In view of what I have said, the House will understand the need for preparing as fully as possible all the evidence and arguments before taking a decision.  A decision on the matter will be taken within five or six days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  Is it proposed formally to make a protest to the British Government about the manner in which the Compton investigation was conducted and the general findings in the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="An Tánaiste Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will be considering that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was to ask the Taoiseach if it is his intention to have discussions with the British Government on this matter.  Is the Taoiseach seeking a meeting with the British Prime Minister on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="An Tánaiste Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that at the moment the more important question is that of the short and long term solution of the Northern problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Tánaiste not agree that, important though that is, there is an element of urgency about requesting the British Government to abandon the methods of interrogation they are using and will the Government take immediate action to ask the British Government to so act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="An Tánaiste Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, we would if we thought it would be effective but then the British Government have had the Compton Report and they know very well that that report dealt only <Col N="4" /> with incidents up to 9th August.  They have taken no steps whatever to introduce any other form of inquiry or intervention in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take it that the Taoiseach did as I did on Friday last &mdash;convey to Mr. Wilson my views and the views of my Party on the Compton Report?  I suppose it is correct to assume that Mr. Wilson reported to Mr. Heath.  According to the news media he did.  Can I take it that the Government, through the Taoiseach, made their views known to Mr. Wilson while he was here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="An Tánaiste Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>All these matters were discussed with Mr. Wilson, the former British Labour Prime Minister, while he was here.  The question of brutality and all these other questions were discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>And a protest made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="An Tánaiste Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste aware that this matter is more serious than has been indicated either in the Compton Report or in the Press?  Is he aware that there is a deliberate attempt by the British Army to intimidate the civilian population in the North? British soldiers who are detailed for duty in Northern Ireland regard themselves as going on an expedition of &ldquo;Paddy bashing&rdquo; as they refer to it and this is an indication that they are actually being trained for this purpose. It will only be a matter of a very short time before people will be saying that the only British soldiers we want here are dead ones.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have a speech on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="An Tánaiste Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of this, but as the House will appreciate, the bringing of this matter before the European Commission of Human Rights cannot influence the British Government in any act they may undertake or cannot change the performance of the British security forces during detention manoeuvres and in relation to interrogation, because it is a long-term examination which can last for as long as 12 months or two years.</P>

      <P>Question No. 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of reference to the Human Rights Commission, should there not be direct representation made immediately to the British Prime Minister on this matter, more particularly as there have been serious allegations that in the past fortnight such methods still remained an integral part of interrogation procedures, namely, the extraction of information by means of violence?  This must stop and surely we must demand its cessation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Tánaiste kindly tell the House what he means when he says that the bringing of this matter before the European Commission of Human Rights will not influence the British Government? Surely he is aware that it is only public opinion, and especially world opinion when such opinion turns against them, that can change the attitude of the British Government?  Are Fianna Fáil afraid of embarrassing the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="An Tánaiste Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said there may be some propaganda effect from bringing this matter before the Commission of Human Rights; it might perhaps influence the British Government to conduct an immediate inquiry on their own; but it does not necessarily have any immediate practical effect because it is an extremely lengthy procedure. All the evidence will take months to be presented to whoever the persons are who are elected to examine this brutality.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Tánaiste accept that this is precisely why we feel that the Government should take immediate action to talk to the British Government about it directly and to ask them to abandon these methods? It is just because it is going to take such a long time that it is necessary to take that kind of action immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="An Tánaiste Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, when the Government make a final examination of this matter they will take into account all the relevant considerations, <Col N="6" /> including our immediate diplomatic procedures in relation to the British Government.  Quite naturally we will do this.</P>

      <P>How many days of further ill-treatment will there be before that decision is taken?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We appreciate the way the Government are handling this matter, but may I ask the Tánaiste if they will consider taking this matter not only to Strasbourg but to the United Nations in order to show once again the atrocities being committed by the British Army in the Six Counties and to try to focus world attention on the Black-and-Tan methods the British are using in the North?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Tánaiste's reply to Deputy Dr. O'Connell's question in particular, the Tánaiste said that there were more important matters to discuss than these. That may be, but would the Tánaiste not agree that the question of internment without trial has an integral connection with the whole range of political problems in the North and is, in fact, the barrier in the log-jam now and that the Government ought to be getting down to a discussion with the British Government, as asked in Deputy Dr. O'Connell's question about this? Would the Tánaiste not agree to all that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="An Tánaiste Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have approached the British Government on all these matters, including internment and including long-term and short-term solutions.  All this has been indicated in the course of the debate we had in this House.  The Government have never ceased making all possible diplomatic approaches and leading members of the Government have made speeches in regard to what they consider to be the short- and long-term solution of this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not obvious now that the publication of the Compton Report highlights the gravity of the methods that have been adopted to such an extent that responsible organs in Britain condemn the British Government on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="An Tánaiste Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fact and, as I have said, the Government within the next five or six days will make their final decision and they will take into account all the relevant matters mentioned in this House, whether it will be possible or wise to bring the matter to the attention of the United Nations, whether it would serve any purpose, what steps should be taken in relation to the British Government and all the matters concerning these brutalities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach what percentage increase in the consumer price index took place in the three years ended 1961; and what percentage increase will have taken place in the three years ended 1971 if no further increase takes place in the index between August and November, 1971.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The yearly average of the consumer price index for the year ended November, 1961, was 3.2 per cent above the corresponding 1958 figure.  If no increase took place between August and November, 1971, the yearly average for 1971 would be 26.0 per cent above the 1968 figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary say, in the light of his reply to this question, why he replied in the negative to a supplementary question of mine last week when I asked him was he aware that the increase in this three-year period was nine times what it was in the previous three-year period?  Do the figures he has now given not confirm that?</P>

      <P>Discussions are held in my Department every year with the <Col N="13" /> chief psychiatrists on this question and on the desirability of reducing the numbers permanently institutionalised. As the Deputy is aware, there are a variety of sociological factors and there is a variety in the character of the patients in the hospitals, including patients of a psycho-geriatric or geriatric character.

      <P>I presume the Deputy has in mind the specialist clinics in Dublin hospitals.  Such clinics are arranged between the health boards and the hospitals concerned and my functions are limited to approving the financial arrangements.  Nevertheless, I am anxious to ensure that such clinics operate efficiently.  A recent survey conducted by my Department elicited the information that while, for various reasons, a uniform appointments system is not feasible, 18 of the 22 hospitals in Dublin, where specialist <Col N="16" /> clinics are held, have varying systems of appointment in operation.</P>
      <P>Complaints concerning such clinics are rare and I am always willing to investigate specific complaints.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he is aware that, far from there being, as he describes, varying systems of appointment in such clinics, there seems to be a completely haphazard and general indication given to people to come along at 11 a.m. and that people come along, as I personally had to do in relation to my own family, and hang around until 1 o'clock and until 2 o'clock when somebody would deign to see them and that this kind of treatment under the health services brings our services into disrepute and creates considerable public disquiet about their effectiveness and would he not agree that there should be a uniform straightforward system of appointments in operation?</P>

Is he, or are the officials who inspected, satisfied that they are efficient and that a person who comes at 10 a.m. will be out by 11.30 a.m. or 12 noon?  Is he satisfied that that is the case generally now in hospitals?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think the appointments system is perfect, I will agree.  Delays in dealing with patients are due to multiple causes including patients not attending on time, doctors being delayed in the examination of patients and doctors being called away to emergency cases. It is a very difficult matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestions made by my Department to the Institute of Advertising Practitioners for improvement of the code of advertising standards for alcoholic beverages were (a) that the reference in one of the clauses to the prohibition of advertisements in &ldquo;publications especially directed to children&rdquo; is unsatisfactory and should surely read &ldquo;publications especially directed to young persons&rdquo;, (b) that the Minister is absolutely opposed to the advertising of intoxicating drink to schools and is seriously concerned, therefore, regarding a qualification in one of the clauses which <Col N="18" /> would permit advertisements for drink to be placed in or distributed to schools if specifically requested by a member of the academic staff, and (c) that some of the provisions relating to the advertising of cigarettes could, with advantage, be incorporated in the advertising of alcoholic beverages.  As the Deputies may be aware, the code of advertising of cigarettes includes the following stipulations: that persons featured in advertisements should be obviously over 21 years of age; that advertisements should not present young people in romantic situations in a manner that obviously ties the enjoyment of smoking to the pleasures of these situations; that advertisements should not feature smoking by conventional heroes of the young; that advertisements should not convey the impression that to be grown-up one should smoke cigarettes; that advertisements should not give the impression that smoking is smart and sophisticated; and that advertisements should not over-emphasise the pleasure of smoking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement issued to the Press on 12th November which I circulated to Deputies.  As indicated therein, it has been my practice to meet representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for consultations and briefings so as to ensure that the trade union movement are consulted and kept fully informed on our negotiations with the EEC and particularly on matters of special interest to the unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that the president of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union&mdash;Senator F. Kennedy <Col N="21" />&mdash;was a member of the congress delegation which met me for consultations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister answer the latter portion of the question, namely, the part which refers to the dates on which formal consultations took place with the ITGWU?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The dates on which I met representatives of the congress were 28th July, 18th October and 27th October.  There were representatives of the motor trade union in the congress at the consultation in July.  The officials of the Department of Finance accompanied by officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Labour met on 4/9/70, 22/4/71, 23/6/71 and 29/7/71, to report on the progress of the negotiations and the ITGWU workers' representatives were present at some of these, but there were no separate consultations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Were there any requests by the members of the ITGWU for separate consultations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no record of that.  The point being made was, I think, that there was no participation by the union in these negotiations and this point is made by me and by the spokesman the Deputy mentioned.  It was only consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>But the IDA officials and the fishermen were there in Brussels in a certain capacity.  Is that not so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I asked members of the IDA and representatives of the fishermen to come in case at any stage of the negotiations I needed technical advice.  The consultations with the trade unions were here at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no question of excluding them from Brussels.  If congress wished to meet me in Brussels this could have been arranged, <Col N="22" /> but what business we had to do together could be done in Dublin.  The need for the technical knowledge of the IDA and the fishermen might have arisen in the course of negotiations on technical aspects of a particular question.  The relationship of the congress to me was one of giving information and keeping them up-to-date on events and likely events and getting their opinion of what should be the outcome.  I do not think the presence of these people in Brussels would have made any difference to the information that was exchanged between us.  There could be no question of the Congress of Trade Unions or anybody else participating in the negotiations because this is not just possible.  The statement issued seemed to me to dispel any doubt that may have existed in people's minds that there were members of the trade unions in the negotiations.  Nobody but Governments get into these negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that had the trade union members been represented in Brussels at the time the protocol was negotiated the unfortunate and serious blunder of the omission both from the protocol and from the Minister's speech of any reference to increased employment might have been avoided?  Would the Minister also agree that the failure to take advice may have contributed to his failure to grasp the importance of this point and ensure, either in the protocol itself or in his speech, which referred to such matters as under-employment and living standards, that there would have been a specific reference to expanding employment, the one really crucial issue the Minister omitted to deal with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is in the protocol. The Deputy will see in the protocol that the Community accept the Irish aims in this matter.  There was no blunder.  This is a useful protocol and its interpretation by the representatives of the Community, which was published last week, indicates that the Community under this protocol take on themselves the aims for employment and development. <Col N="23" /> Representatives of the trade unions have commented on the protocol on that basis.  The Deputy need have no fears whatever that there is anything lacking in this protocol. This is exactly what we want.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think there was any need for it.  It is spelled out in the speech of the president to the Council and in the protocol.  There is no need to have any doubts whatever about the usefulness of the protocol. It is an excellent protocol and it has been favourably commented upon even by countries outside Europe and also by the trade unions.</P>

      <P>The official in question is now in Brussels, but I have a report on the meeting.  I understand a great deal of anxiety exists in the area about which the Deputy is concerned.  We shall have to dispel this anxiety because we can solve our employment problems in the Community, but we cannot solve them outside the Community.

At these negotiations there are foreign Ministers with their staffs and the applicant country's Foreign Minister.  Nobody else is in the room.

      <P>I am not so aware.  In any event, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, the question as to whether a person is available for employment in connection with a claim to unemployment benefit is determined by a deciding officer or, in regard to an appeal, by an appeals officer.</P>

In the last 12 months a large number of cases have been brought to my attention where deciding officers and appeals officers have been saying automatically to women, &ldquo;Look, I am telling you, you are not available for work&rdquo; when in fact these married women repeatedly assure the deciding officer they are available.</P>

      <P>There is no special policy in regard to this matter.  I have answered questions about this matter on many occasions.  The same conditions apply for qualifying for unemployment benefit as apply in any other individual case.  I also have had a number of complaints from my own constituents.  In seeking to ascertain whether they comply with the required regulations that is, being capable of, available for and generally seeking work, the Department usually have recourse to the firm with which they worked before they became unemployed. In many cases the position is that the work which they had before they started to draw the maternity allowances, which they draw for a number of weeks before and after childbirth, is available to them.  The <Col N="29" /> position is difficult and every Deputy can see it quite easily: as soon as they have exhausted the maternity benefit allowance they apply for unemployment benefit.  The firm with which they worked, and to which they intend returning must say, &ldquo;We have no work for them now but by the time they have finished drawing unemployment benefit we will have work&rdquo;.  Any conscientious officer will find it difficult to read these people as qualifying under the required conditions.</P>

Would he not accept that if a Deputy goes in with a woman who is appealing on an unemployment benefit question and is able to give evidence that not alone her former employer but a number of other employers have no work for her, and if somebody is willing to give a written undertaking that she will look after the baby, surely that is evidence that she is available for work?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for a deserted wife's allowance a woman must naturally be a wife.  In arriving at a decision in the case of women who have been divorced in England the deciding officer took into account legal advice to the effect that under our law the divorce in England of a person domiciled in England is effective to dissolve the marriage and the dissolution is recognised as being effective in this country.  The applications for the deserted wife's allowances of a number of women so divorced have been rejected.  A number of them have, however, appealed against the decision and their appeals have not yet been determined by the appeals officer. Pending his decision, I would not like to make any final statement in the matter.  I should mention, however, that the scheme of deserted wife's allowances which is now a little over a year in operation is being reviewed with a view to making such improvements in it as experience has shown to be desirable.  In this review consideration will be given to the position of women divorced in the circumstances mentioned.</P>

Deputy Corish asked me if I was distinguishing between machinery for negotiating disputes and that of participation.  I know there is a difference between the joint industrial council and the workers council.  I would prefer that it would evolve from works councils.  While it has been said that we are not interested, I want to say that I am deeply interested but I have not any great pressure from workers or trade unions in this matter.  Any participation that will evolve from the present system of having works councils established&mdash;a number of firms already have them&mdash; will be welcomed and will be more effective due to its evolving by mutual consent and agreement rather than being enforced by me.  We are in constant touch with the ILO and with the OECD.  Both of these have a very fixed conception of worker participation not in line with what the Deputies have been talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>You did.  The Deputy will remember pointing out that the White Paper will not necessarily have any influence on the holding of a referendum.  There has to be a referendum for the public as to whether or not we join the Community whatever the result of negotiations.  We are making provision for the holding of a referendum. There will be a White Paper which, I think, will now be delayed because of delays in the negotiations. The White Paper will be discussed in the House.  There will be a discussion on the merits of the negotiations and of the package achieved in the negotiations. Whatever the opinion on the achievements or otherwise in the negotiations, a referendum will be necessary, and the legislation to make that possible so that the public can give a decision will take place no matter what the outcome of the White Paper is. Deputy Corish made this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a delay in the negotiations which means that the White Paper on which the Dáil could discuss the merits or otherwise of the package achieved will be delayed.  This will delay the starting of the preparing of legislation for the holding of the referendum.  As Deputy Corish pointed out in the House, the questions put on the change in the Constitution are not in any way dependent on the negotiations. The merits on which the people will make the decision whether or not they want to join will be after the negotiations, and after the White Paper.  That will be published before the people are asked to vote.</P>

      <P>May I ask An Tánaiste to clarify something that happened earlier?  I understood from an earlier exchange that the Leader of the Labour Party asked whether time would be given for a motion or Bill that the Labour Party would bring forward between now and Christmas. I further understood the answer to be &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and, indeed, that any such motion or Bill would be allowed.  I seemed to hear things said subsequently which suggested going back on that and that if a Bill were introduced time would not be given for it.  Have I misunderstood the position?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The response to the financial difficulty has been a decision to curtail services so that the <Col N="49" /> whole output is limited.  This appears to be a rather dangerous development in regard to such a powerful and important part of the educational system of the community.  We recall the extraordinary urgency with which the television station was introduced in the first instance.  Most of us were impressed at that time by the speed at which it was created, but we were also, of course, impressed because we knew the Government knew of the necessity to devise and to take control of, to the extent that that was possible here, some kind of a television service which would be a creation of our own, as a people, a community, a society, and which would provide an alternative form of education and entertainment to those available then from other countries.</P>
      <P>I must confess I was not concerned by the fact that we then had begun to breach the famous paper wall around our cocoon society.  This development of television meant the creation of an enormous gap leading to what is now clearly to be seen as the complete fragmentation of the very rigid, nearly impenetrable censorship of social ideas, cultural ideas, political ideas, ideas in relation to literature and art and every other form of human activity.</P>
      <P>As I said the last day on which I spoke, it would be a very valuable activity on the part of the Government to carry out a comprehensive social study or assessment of the changes which have taken place in our society as a result of the advent of television in our community.  In the light of the fact that the Government knew of the urgency of the need for the provision of a service and knew of the, to them, considerable dangers involved in the breaching of the censorship of ideas here held so rigidly during the past 50 years in the Press and radio and in our educational system, it is strange that they should now appear to feel that this protection of our people which was implicit in the establishment of our national television service should not be any longer as important as it once was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The home output contribution has been run down, reduced in response to a shortage of money.  I am sorry in <Col N="50" /> many ways this has been done.  I think it is the incorrect response to the situation. I am sorry because of its implications in regard to the standard and quality of the service.  I am sorry for the people who may lose their employment&mdash;for the artists, the creative workers of all kinds, who may be denied outlets for their art and creativity in our national television service.  But it seems strange that this sense of urgency which was there when the service was established seems to have left the Government, who do not appear to believe any longer that the exposure of our people to very powerful outside influences is much more severe, much more serious, much more greatly expanded than when our service was set up in the first instance; and that if the service is to be run down this action is not being taken in a vacuum but at a time when the counter pressures, when the outside distractive influences, are greatly increased.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the full implications of this are understood by the Government. We have a situation in which our people now press a button on a television set and can tune in to the Northern Ireland services of UTV and BBC, to BBC 1 and 2, to the Independent Television service from Harlech&mdash; to the various forms of alternative viewing, both intellectual and entertainment programmes.  These are being made available readily and widely throughout the whole community.</P>
    <P>As I have said, if one carried out a social survey on the changes that have been made by what one could call the minimal impact of outside entertainment and educational influences of one kind or another in the time since our service was established, what will the likely effects in our community be when we have a greatly increased number of alternatives to those already available when we accede to the Common Market?  No doubt with scientific advances our viewers will be able not only to tune to Belfast and London but to Paris and Berlin.  Bonn and Rome.  Amsterdam and Copenhagen. Stockholm and Helsinki&mdash;all very powerful communities and societies culturally.</P>
    <P>In that sort of situation is it not <Col N="51" /> extraordinary to find that the decision of Telefís Éireann, simply on the basis of the idea that the Government are losing money on the service, is to run down the service.  Is there any idea at all as to the repercussions of that?</P>
    <P>We already start with the limitation of a television service which necessarily must be less attractive because we simply cannot afford to compete with the great and wealthy nations, particularly Great Britain and, later on, France, Italy, Germany and the Scandanavian countries.  The Government do not appear to be able to take into consideration the changes that are likely to take place as a result of the fact that our home station must become less and less attractive to the Irish viewer and that they will look for alternatives around Great Britain, around Europe and not only around the United States but, most interesting of all, because of the development and, no doubt, improvement of satellite transmission of the television services, around Russia, China and Hungary, and all of these other societies who have attitudes, values and political ideologies which for so long we have ignored here as not existing at all, presumably on the principle that if we ignored them long enough they would go away.  It seems to me that it is Telefís Éireann who are going away and it will be these other television services who will take over.  I am sorry in some ways; in other ways, it must lead to a great measure of enlightenment in our community, and for that reason I must welcome it to some extent.</P>
    <P>On nearly every Estimate I must raise this corollary of the Government's belief in the capacity of private enterprise capitalism to create the wealth needed to provide the quality of services we require, whether it is health, education, care in old age, employment or any other service.  We now see it as it affects the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and, in particular, as it affects this very powerful influence in any contemporary community, our television service.</P>
    <P>I should be interested to know what are the figures in relation to the viewing <Col N="52" /> pattern in the community where alternatives are already available. Would the Minister give us some information on the reasons for the recent resignation of the man in charge of the consumer research department whose job it was, I understand, to try to find out how much Telefís Éireann was looked at, where, what particular programmes were important.  I should imagine this was a vital part of any service, to find out the extent and popularity of the programmes put out by Telefís Éireann in informing them how they might go ahead in the future and how they might alter any system they might have or any programmes which they might think were popular and which, in fact, were not popular.</P>
    <P>Before coming to the matter of the Minister's intervention in Telefís Éireann, I should like to digress for a moment to ask him some questions.  I understand he is responsible for the Radio Éireann Orchestra, although I see very few, if any, references to it.  I should be glad to know what is his personal attitude.  Deputy Hilliard took an intense personal interest in the orchestra.  I am involved with other Deputies in the Kennedy Memorial Hall, and I wonder if the Minister would give us any information about what plans he has or how he would look on the proposal to provide facilities for the very fine Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra, or what is likely to happen in the event of the Gaiety ceasing to become available. It is, as the Minister probably knows, acoustically a very inadequate concert hall at best, but there is a possibility that it may go in the whole process of the development of Dublin, or the destruction of Dublin, by the developers.</P>
    <P>What is likely to happen, in that event, in regard to the activities of the symphony orchestra?  One of the tributes to the people of Dublin in spite of the inadequacy of musical education in our schools and elsewhere, is the degree of popularity of the concerts given by the symphony orchestra.  Would the Minister tell us what is his attitude to the symphony orchestra?  What is the total complement? <Col N="53" /> What is its present complement? What is the status of the people employed in the orchestra?  How many of them are temporary; how many of them are permanent?  As regards the temporary ones, why are they temporary, and does the Minister intend to keep them that way?  There are many Government Departments, as the Minister probably knows, in which this problem exists.  The recent conflict in the psychiatric hospitals arose out of this question of temporary employment. I think he is also responsible for a certain amount of this in relation to the orchestra and I wonder would he look into this whole matter.</P>
    <P>There is a slight element of fear in relation to the orchestra and this goes back a very long time.  I remember that my colleague in Clann na Poblachta years ago, Mr. Michael Fitzpatrick, was rather angry at the fact that we had foreign musicians in our orchestra.  Of course, the truth was that we had no native musicians because of the inadequacy of our educational system.  If the foreign musician happened to be qualified for the work he had to be employed even if we did not wish to employ him.</P>
    <P>One of the things that has always fascinated me is this peculiar national bigotry about foreigners.  I met it recently in the Department of Foreign Affairs when I was inquiring about the extension of the passport of a young North African friend of mine.  The general impression was that this was another of these impecunious foreigners who would be left on our hands. It struck me, and it always strikes me, that as a nation which must have many more of its people as foreigners in somebody's country as a result of our emigration over half a century and more, we are very intolerant of this concept of the foreigner in a strange country and instead of being understanding about it we tend to exploit the fact that some of them are here and cannot complain because, for some reason, they are not able to go back to their own country.  I should be glad if the Minister would answer some of those questions.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the new radio station very briefly because we dealt <Col N="54" /> with it the other day on the Gaeltacht Estimate.  As I said then, this station is something that I think could have been useful about 20 years ago, before television, but even now it is better to have it than to have nothing.  I hope the Minister will insist that the Gaeltacht people are given as much authority as possible over the station.  I recently read a statement by the board that they were about to give the Gaeltacht this service.  I dislike that attitude.  Considering the disabilities under which many of them have lived and the disabilities of the educational system up to very recently in the Gaeltacht areas, they are a wonderfully talented people in the Gaeltacht and we want to see them use the radio station and ideally use the television service very much more than they do.  They should have access to both services.  There is an element of paternalism about the approach to the radio station which I think is unwarranted but is inherent in the attitude of the Civil Service over the years to the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>I remember Colm Ó Gaoire who was a colleague of Pearse's years ago and he had the greatest difficulty in being accepted as a teacher.  He, with Pearse, spent a great deal of time teaching Irish in the Gaeltacht areas.  He had the greatest difficulty in being accepted as a teacher of Irish in his area.  He was a difficult man in some ways, a very charming and attractive person but apparently difficult to deal with and for that reason even he found it hard to be accepted as a person who could be trusted to teach the language in a recognised school.  I sincerely hope native speakers will be given full and continuous access not only to radio programmes but especially to control of the radio station also.</P>
    <P>I should like to protest at the continous exhibition of violence on television. There is an extraordinary acceptance of this pattern of violence, unthinkingly apparently, by those who control the television service.  It appears that violence constitutes a very high percentage of the average television programme and particularly on the programmes beamed at children.  Our service in relation to children carries an extraordinary amount of violence <Col N="55" /> even in the puppet shorts in which aggression and assault always seem to predominate in the relationship between the people portrayed in these shows and caricatures and there is the sense of creating fun out of people's disabilities or the fact that they have been hit over the head, or have fallen and hurt themselves or whatever it may be.  There are very unpleasant overtones in the programmes directed at little children.  In relation to the whole pattern of cowboys and Indians and gangster pictures, general violence seems to be endemic.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how adults can justify this indulgence in the portrayal of violence continually on such a powerful medium as television.  We spend our lives as parents, as teachers, as legislators, as members of the judiciary, as clerics and so on, and in all our adult capacities telling children that we know best.  The whole approach in the child-adult relationship in Ireland, in our culture and in that of Britain and most other countries is the presumption of adult omniscience and whatever the adult does is correct. Possibly that is true to some extent although I have never understood how we can talk to the younger generation about our wisdom and omniscience or the reliability of our judgment on any serious, significant issue with our record of at least two major world wars and all the horrors associated with them and say: &ldquo;We know best&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, we own and control the propaganda and to that extent we have been able to establish up to the present that general thesis as valid. Having done that, we then show adults in various films and displays of one kind or another in relationships with one another where violence is nearly always the final sanction.  It always solves the question when somebody shoots somebody, hangs somebody or pushes somebody over a cliff or knocks somebody out.  What is the general conclusion of the average child looking at us in our relationship with one another in the cinemas and on television and, to some extent in the theatre&mdash;they do not go to the theatre very much?</P>
    <P>When we think of Vietnam, of <Col N="56" /> Europe during the Second World War, or of India/Pakistan today, can we say it is surprising that children get the impression that the adult solution to almost every problem is to be found in the gun or in violence of one form or other?  Is it surprising that there should be increasing violence among young people?  In the schools in New York there is the &ldquo;concrete jungle&rdquo;. In schools generally there is an extraordinary escalation of violence among children.  The reasons for this cannot be attributed solely to television because there are other reasons for it that I shall not develop now; but one of the very powerful factors involved in developing a pattern of behaviour is watching what adults do in a particular situation.  It is accepted that children learn from their parents by absorbing the attitudes of the parents. This must apply, too, to television and to films.  I understand that in Britain there is now an extraordinary increase in violence among schoolchildren. Only the other day we read of an incident in which three or four children tried to hang another.  Similar incidents have occurred here.  Children have hanged themselves by mistake while trying to imitate something they had seen on a screen.</P>
    <P>Recently we carried out a scientific study in a new housing area in relation to psychopathic behaviour, that is, disturbed behaviour among young people. We expected the results to be in the region of 5 per cent but instead it was a very frightening 20 per cent.  This evolution of violence among young people must go back to some extent to the powerful influence of television. The extraordinary power of this wonderful but dangerous medium has been emphasised time and again.  We have some control in respect of our own television station but, of course, we will have no control over the programmes that it will be possible to view when we join the Common Market and when scientific development enables us to have access to the television broadcasts of many other countries.</P>
    <P>At page 31 of his statement the Minister said in relation to &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; and I quote:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> On the 28th September, 1971, members of an illegal organisation were interviewed on a television programme &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; in a way which I, and the Government, considered to be prejudicial to the public interest. Following full consideration, and with the approval of the Government, I issued a written direction to the Authority on 1st October, 1971, &ldquo;to refrain from broadcasting any matter of the following class, i.e., any matter that could be calculated to promote the aims or activities of any organisation which engages in, promotes, encourages or advocates the attaining of any particular objective by violent means&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Why is it a question of the Minister swallowing the camel but straining at the gnat?  The Minister has removed the IRA and their violence from our screens.  Later I will deal with my attitudes to that.  The Minister is impressed by the implications of the appearance of these people on our screens and of the dangers inherent in such appearances but yet he disregards all the other programmes in which violence is practically continual from beginning to end.  I do not watch television very often and as time goes on I tend to limit my viewing further. This may sound critical but it is meant to be critical.  However, regardless of which channel one may be watching, one will notice the continual banality associated with violence, the banality of the plots and the general programme material.</P>
    <P>There is also this exhibition of violence which is very difficult to tolerate.  It is difficult to understand, too, why it should continue to be perpetrated. I had hoped that we would have adopted a different attitude to this problem and that as part of our contribution towards a new pattern of human relations which is long overdue, we might have concentrated on a completely different approach in relation to the exhibition of violence in human relationships.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt of the influence of this portrayal of violence on children whether that violence relates to North or South Vietnam, or to any other place.  There is no doubt of the <Col N="58" /> influence of the Second World War on youngsters particularly in post-war Poland which, as everybody knows, was a country that suffered greatly during the war.  Also on the psychiatric side we are now experiencing the effects of violence on children here at home in the Falls and in the Bogside.  Some people will accept this situation and say that it is simply a matter of the children sublimating their own frustration or inability to cope with the appalling emotional stress of watching adult human beings fighting and killing one another but general opinion is that the influence is likely to be lasting and also that it is likely to be very damaging.</P>
    <P>One of the interesting sides of violence in cinemas is that it is a gross betrayal of the youngster because in a cowboy film when a person is shot he collapses on the floor and it is all very harmless.  There is none of the agony, pain and stress of violent death.  We lead the child to believe that violence is like this, that there is nothing like the loss of a limb, the loss of sight or maiming, that there are no people left behind to mourn, that there is no widow or widower, no children.  Violent death is portrayed as a very ordinary everyday experience.  This is what allows youngsters to grow up believing in violence and service in armies.  I have never understood why anybody goes into an army.  I know the patriotic reasons given but that anybody could dedicate his life to learning how to kill other people cleverly seems an extraordinary thing.  It has been the experience of various people involved in wars over the years that it is the difference between real violent death, that is war, and the mock affair they see on television or in the cinema which is the great betrayal of young human beings. If they knew what it, in fact, is like you would never recruit a soldier into anybody's army.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that I would ask the Minister to seriously consider his responsibility as a Minister in indirect control of this very important medium.  It is not simple; I know it is a very complicated problem, but it is very hard to tell young people who <Col N="59" /> have been brought up in our society, a very authoritarian society in which both in the home and in school there is physical violence&mdash;everybody knows my views on that&mdash;that violence is bad. There is the essential indoctrination of the idea that there is always a violent solution for any problem starting with a slap on the hand and ending with a bullet in the head.  This aspect of the portrayal of violence on our television screen is all part of a composite picture of violence which permeates our whole society and which conditions the youngster into readily accepting the idea of a violent solution for his most difficult problems.</P>
    <P>There is the lurid, emotive, at times hysterical portrayal of our admittedly dreadful history of oppression, punitive exploitation; there is the belief in violence, the sense of grievance created by history and then the belief that violence is a relatively harmless thing; simply a question of somebody going &ldquo;pop&rdquo; with a gun and somebody keels over.  All these things taken together make the young person who listens to the boy or girl on television who is in the IRA, in the Provisionals or in the Officials, whichever the Minister has taken exception to, advocate violence, ready material for the argument because he has heard that argument all his life.  He has suffered from that argument in various ways.  Therefore, it is not really strange that young people, seeing or feeling that we politicians have not found a political solution for a long-standing grievance, when they are told that there is a solution through violence are ready to take it up and use it.</P>
    <P>This decision which the Minister has taken to supress the exhibition of certain pictures on the television screen is reacting in much too simple a way to a very complicated situation.  While I favour anything which will reduce or preferably eliminate the existence of violence between Irishmen, this simplistic solution accepted by the Minister to simply show no more of these people on the television screen is not really the answer to the problem with which he is faced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> The dilemma, of course, is if we had not seen or if the British public had not seen the excesses of the British troops in the North, the violence in the North, the appalling consequences of the bombings and the killings, the funerals, the people widowed, the children, it is possible that we might not have got the Compton Report.  To that extent, somebody could make the case that this has had the beneficial effect of making somebody take action.  To what extent is the reaction a controllable reaction? Where does it end?  This, of course, is the Minister's problem.  What is the impact on us, sitting down here in relative safety and security, when we watch our people killing one another, maiming one another, inflicting violence on one another?</P>
    <P>Also, of course, there is the effect of seeing an army from outside come in and behave in the way the British Army has done latterly&mdash;not in the early days&mdash;but latterly.  The immediate response is one of anger but anger can lead to what the Minister has cited&mdash;the youngster going North and taking reprisal.  The mature response is very much more complicated. The mature response is to find out why people are behaving in this way.  That, of course, brings up only part of what I dealt with in relation to the child's upbringing, background, education, parental relationship, adultchild relationship.  Only in part does that deal with the problem of the individual's response.</P>
    <P>With censorship in the way the Minister has imposed it, would we now have had the Compton Report?  Would these terrible things be going on still if the television cameras had not been there?  Have they not done some good as well as, presumably, some damage? Would those of us who lived through the thirties have been helped if we had known about the excesses of the Nazis on the Jewish population in Germany in the early thirties up to the terrible Second World War?  Would we have been helped if we had known of the behaviour of the Nazis and of Mussolini in Italy?  I refer to that only because we did not know.  It was not until I visited Germany in the mid thirties that I began to question what <Col N="61" /> was going on in Germany and I then stopped going there.</P>
    <P>It was the fact that the German Government had the right to censor, to suppress facts that they felt would not do credit to their government, this extraordinary power of censorship of news and information, which made it possible for the appalling anti-semitic campaign to go on, leading up to Auschwitz and the other concentration camps and the horrors associated with them.  If there had been television, would my generation have known earlier?  Would we have reacted earlier?  Would we have understood? Would we have been able to avoid the Second World War?  These are relevant problems in the whole question of the use of television and the use of censorship, in particular in relation to television, or in relation to any of the news media.</P>
    <P>The Minister dismisses his Censorship Act in just one paragraph. Referring to section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, he said:</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that it was with great reluctance that I came to the conclusion that it was necessary in the public interest to invoke that section of the Act.</P>
    <P>It is a very dangerous thing to have done.  It is a very dangerous power for a Minister to have.  Since the beginning of time man has been acting &ldquo;in the best public interest&rdquo; or, the phrase used by the Minister, &ldquo;It was necessary in the public interest&rdquo;.  There was, for example, the Defence of the Realm Act.  There were all these ideas going back to the beginning of time. Socrates took his cup of hemlock, remember, because he was corrupting the youth.  That was a long time ago. That was another form of suppression, censorship, because he was saying the wrong thing.  Right through history we have had authorities or governments or political parties or dictators&mdash;I am not saying the Minister is a dictator&mdash; people, who decide that they have this absolute right to determine about the use of censorship.</P>
    <P>I often feel that the censor&mdash;and I am very fascinated by Lord Longford's activities in this regard although <Col N="62" /> the particular phrase I use does not apply to him personally&mdash;is to a considerable extent like the pharisee in the Temple: &ldquo;I am not like the rest of men.  I am incorruptible&rdquo;.  In some way or other he feels that he is able to know of something which will do him no damage but which will damage the public interest.  That is a very arrogant, paternalistic, supercilious approach for any human being to take.</P>
    <P>The trouble is, of course, that under the Act establishing the service this power is vested in the Government and, being vested in the Government, is vested, in fact, in a political party.  I wonder if when the Minister is considering reassessing his position or the Government's position in relation to television he will bear in mind the fact that times are changing from the political point of view and will he be as content to find himself sitting on the opposite side of the House and some other Minister for Posts and Telegraphs deciding as to what he shall censor, what he shall suppress and the limits to what he considers are his powers of censorship?</P>
    <P>A very interesting development now, of course, is that the whole of the North of Ireland trouble has created very widespread debate, in Great Britain in particular, about this whole problem of television news and television censorship.  There are many television journalists in particular who are disturbed by a recent trend away from the right of the journalist to edit, to have the final say in editing any particular piece of journalism, be it for television or Press, and the vesting of this particular power in management rather than with the journalist.  The British Minister, Mr. Chattaway, said that television must back the law and radio and television are required to strike an even balance between the IRA and the Ulster Government or the Army and the &ldquo;terrorists&rdquo;, as he called them.  He said that impartiality could never mean the difference between right and wrong, between tolerance and intolerance, between the criminal and the law.  I am quoting <i>The Observer</i> of last Sunday.  He imposes on the editor of the television <Col N="63" /> news service the responsibility of making the final decision.  In relation to ITA, I understand Lord Hailsham has been interviewed by Mr. Maudling and been advised that he too must use great care and discrimination in the use of any report sent in to him by his staff. The effects of the report must be weighed carefully.  But who can be trusted to weigh?  Who should be trusted?</P>
    <P>We are still, I suppose, a little overawed by television and the power of television.  We must, of course, look at it in the context of the evolution of man's relationship to man.  No doubt the first demagogue was a frightened person.  The printing press had very great terrors when it was first introduced and it was extraordinarily influential ultimately in leading to remarkable changes in society.  Wireless in its day was very powerful.  The television link to satellite support services is enormously powerful and, because it is so complex and so complicated, I doubt if it will respond to simple suppression.  That appears to be the answer in the case of a programme one dislikes or something a Minister does not regard as in the public interest.  The Minister is not, of course, the only politician looking at television. The Tories are looking at it too; they want what they describe as a patriotic censorship.  Presumably the British Army will be shown in a good light and those who oppose it in a bad light. It is the goodies and the baddies all over again, a rather infantile approach to this very complicated problem; yet this is the approach adopted by many politicians.  It saves them from examining the problem in depth.  I do not think any such examination has been done.  It has certainly not been done in our television service.</P>
    <P>What one would really like to see is something on the lines of the extraordinarily generous space given by <i>The Sunday Times</i> to an analysis of the problem in the North.  This is the kind of examination that should be carried out by television.  It was quite remarkable to find <i>The Sunday Times</i> reporting at such length and so intensively because one would imagine <Col N="64" /> the British public could not possibly be as interested in the situation there as we would be.  Indeed, if a similar study in depth were carried out by one of our national newspapers into the India/Pakistan conflict I doubt if a great many of us would read it.  No examination of the problem in depth has been carried out by our television service.  The Northern Ireland television service always tries to include one or more Southern politicians in their discussions.  To me that is a definite advance.  Where there is such suspicion between North and South this does represent an advance.  In our coverage of the problems we seem to concentrate on what they have done wrong, what they have failed to do, and what they must do&mdash;they being invariably the Stormont Government.  Very rarely does one hear any serious discussion on our television service of what needs to be done and what must be done here in order to attempt to exorcise the fear of the Unionists in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Our television service, to my knowledge at any rate, has not been used to the extent it should be used; in fact, the reverse is the case.  The Minister's own directive followed the interviewing of certain members of the physical force movement in the North of Ireland in what he appears to have believed was a favourable light.  To issue a directive saying, &ldquo;By order of the Minister&rdquo; is oversimplifying the problem.  The difficulty is the suppression of the minority point of view which has commonly occurred here over the years.  Why are we afraid of a minority point of view on television? Why is it so rarely heard?  Have we no answer to it?</P>
    <P>I was very interested to see an old friend of mine, Mick O'Riordan, being interviewed on television the other day. It is the first time I have ever seen him on television.  All his life he has been a most articulate, Marxist, humanitarian, kindly, compassionate apologist for the Communist way of life.  Why has he not appeared on television before?  Why has the minority point of view hardly ever appeared on our television screen?  Why are we so frightened of it?  Is there no answer to <Col N="65" /> it?  Are our television interviewers frightened of such a confrontation? Obviously Paddy Gallagher was not, but are the majority frightened of such a confrontation?  Why has this great debate which now divides the world &mdash;the left-right, socialist-communistcapitalist conflict&mdash;never been seriously discussed by people with a serious interest on our television screens?  Like so many other problems which have occurred here over the years we believe, if we ignore it, it will go away; but of course that is not happening and it is most certainly not going away.</P>
    <P>The extent to which one is concerned for minority opinions, whether they be Mick O'Riordan's or Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht, seems to me to determine the calibre of one's attitude to the whole democratic idea in society.  In relation to the development of a Gaeltacht radio station my colleague, Deputy Tully, said he did not think it was worth giving them the money, that was an aside which he did not give much thought to, but again they are a minority.</P>
    <P>There have been very great changes in Telefís Éireann over the years.  The Government thought they had everything fixed and that by appointing a board, the majority of whose members were well-known supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party, everything would be all right.  What happened was quite different.  As television is a new medium most of the people involved were young people, and to that extent they were pretty iconoclastic and not very dependable when it came to recognising the laws and the rights of the Establishment.  It was a very lively television service for a number of years but then great changes took place, as we all know.  For the unfortunate people involved we had the very frightening experience of the &ldquo;7 Davs&rdquo; Inquiry, the loss of Lelia Doolan, Jack Dowling and eventually Maurice McGonigle.  This had a sort of Admiral Byng effect <i>pour encourager les autres.</i>  One can hardly blame those who survived, and who sat down and were counted on that famous occasion, for being circumspect about the questions they ask and the kind of programmes they devise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="66" /> They tended inevitably to end up with fairly right wing views.  For that reason it was not a bit surprising to me that they would feel well-disposed to the neofascism of the &ldquo;Provos&rdquo; or the views of the &ldquo;Officials&rdquo; in their sympathetic handling of these people on television.  But again this problem was created by the Minister and by the policies followed by the Government over the years.  The people isolated in these very important positions in the television service happened to be people who in some cases were sympathetically disposed to violent action of this kind in the North of Ireland.  They used their position as key journalists to put forward these points of views.  We all know full well that this occurs.  Politicians are lucky because when they have a political point of view they can at least join with people who, while they may not all share the same views, are likeminded: Fine Gael, Labour or Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>A journalist who has political points of view is in a difficult position because the Press in our society, the radio and now television, are predominantly conservative.  For that reason whatever the journalist's own private views may be he feels to earn his living he has to keep quiet about things but I do not think there is any one of us who has contact with public life who does not know what the private political views of most of the journalists concerned in public life in Ireland are.  It must come through in the end but that then brings us to the position where we are again faced with the dilemma of &ldquo;Is it they who have to decide, is it to them we leave the power of deciding that something or other was put in or left out&rdquo; because it was, to use the Minister's words, necessary in the public interest to do that.</P>
    <P>I have always accepted that all of the communications media in our society are predominantly conservative or predominantly right wing in their orientation.  In fact, recently when Eamonn McCann appeared on a programme and criticised, quite rightly, the censorship, I was surprised at the naivety of somebody who would not, <Col N="67" /> as a serious socialist, accept that it is the function of these various media, controlled by conservative groups, boards, directors, or whatever they may be as they are predominantly in our society, certainly in relation to the mass circulation press, radio and television to put forward certain viewpoints.  It is rather naïve to expect them to put forward anything but the right wing conservative point of view because it is the function of these media to preserve the establishment in this vertical class structure organisation.</P>
    <P>The rather crude act of censorship by the Minister where he comes in and tells us about it, appealing to section 31, in some ways is nearly more welcome than the very much more sophisticated, but equally effective censorship of the individuals, who happening to have particular points of view, whether pro- or anti-violence, right, left, liberal or whatever they may be, happening to be in these positions of authority, use them.  It is possible, instead of coming in and saying that you may not say that, to apply precisely the same effects in rather more, as I say, complicated, sophisticated ways than the Minister's blank suppression to the tarring and feathering of the IRA.  I suppose that is a form of censorship.</P>
    <P>You may not hold a particular point of view, take a particular decision.  In the present context of the situation in the North of Ireland and of all the other factors to which I referred, of the conditioning of the minds of youngsters, of our own failure to provide a political answer and their sense of frustration, if it prevents some of them from attempting to use violence or to suffer the results of violence, then it seems to me that must be justified but conditional as I have said on the very many other factors involved.  I wonder if the Minister fully appreciates the extraordinary responsibility which he has as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, which is a very recent one because everybody knows the time was when the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs went through with a few cursory remarks from somebody or other about <Col N="68" /> the bad telephone service and that was the end of it.  Now the Minister is really in an extraordinarily important Department.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, looking back on what has happened as a result of the introduction of television, the changes which have taken place, I believe they are remarkable changes in my experience at any rate.  I believe people are very much more enlightened, less afraid and frightened than they were.  They are very much more prepared to consider ideas that prior to that they would not have thought of at all.  Prior to television conditions here were such that I frequently, speaking to the public would say, with 90 per cent certainty, that if I was to ask any audience I was addressing, a student audience particularly, to give me the answers to ten or 11 particular questions on capital punishment, corporal punishment, communism, liberalism or whatever it might be that you would probably get 90 per cent unanimity in the answers, there was such a magnificent form of censorship here of suppression of information from outside, of opinions other than those put forward in our educational system, in all of our universities, all equally conservative in their outlook and in their teaching methods, all giving precisely the same answers.  One can go to a university debating society and one is likely to hear any idea put forward and defended.  There is a much better understanding of the complexity of life.  The old ideas are being questioned in the community, even if they are being less questioned in our television service.</P>
    <P>Quite soon it will be possible to tune in to practically any television station in any capital in the world and listen to views emanating from these places. Unfortunately because of the rigid, authoritarian, didacticism of our educational system, many of our young people will not be fully prepared for the wide range and scope of ideas with which they will be faced when they can look at and listen to programmes from Stockholm, Helsinki, Peking, Moscow, Paris, Munich, Vienna, the Middle East and Africa.  For those people who <Col N="69" /> had such an enjoyable time in the dear old cocooned society where all was best, a rather frightening time is ahead.</P>
    <P>Much as I welcome the intellectual and political advances that must follow access to world opinion, I should not like to see Telefís Éireann fail.  I believe we must create something unique and special to us and to our culture.  In spite of the cross words I have uttered frequently about life in our society, I believe we are capable of doing this.  One of the things that might be considered a defect in our character, but which is a quality also, is the power of creativity, of mythmaking, the great story tellers we are known to be.  To that extent we can create such a television service that it is conceivable that not only will our own people tune in to Telefís Éireann but people from abroad from Peking, Moscow, Budapest, Paris and other places would tune in to Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister seriously believe this will happen having regard to the programme he has put forward here for Telefís Éireann?  There is a running down of our services, a cutting down of supplies and there has been a loss of magnificent, talented, brilliant and artistic individuals like Lelia Doolan, Jack Dowling and Muiris MacConghail and, indeed, Thornley and Keating.  By denying the television service funds and talent we will see the time when no one in Europe will be concerned about what is going on in Dublin and precious few in Dublin will be concerned about what is happening at Montrose.</P>

    <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire.  Tá sé tar éis a gheallúint dúinn go mbeidh Radio na Gaeltachta againn tar éis tamall.  Nuair a thiocfaidh Radio na Gaeltachta tá súil agam gurab iad gnáth-mhuintir na Gaeltachta ar leo is cosúil mé féin&mdash; ní maith liom an téarma sin; is gnáthdhaoine sinn go léir dar liom ach le déanaí tá an difríocht sin ann agus <Col N="70" /> caithfidh mé tagairt a dhéanamh di&mdash; a bhéas ar na cláracha seaches daoine gairmiúla na Gaeltachta.  Aontaím leis an Teachta Browne.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister and his staff for the unfailing courtesy and efficiency they have always shown to me.  It does not necessarily follow that all my representations have ended satisfactorily but the courtesy I have received and the indications I got that the best has been done about the matter help considerably.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the matter of telephonic communications and, in particular, to the private telephone. The invention and introduction of the telephone brought satisfaction and advantages to people.  Apart from the fact that it enabled them to communicate with people who were a long distance away, the fact that this communication was private was an important part of the service.  In so far as the service is no longer as private as it should be, I would ask the Minister to investigate this problem.  I am sure I am speaking for many other people when I state that at times I am reluctant to speak on the telephone in my home or on the telephones in this House.  On several occasions I have lifted the receiver in both places and have been introduced unwittingly to conversations taking place between other people.  I have discussed this with some of the technical men in the Department and they say this should not happen.  However, this has happened, and worse has happened.  There have been occasions when, having found myself as an unwanted listener to a conversation, I have endeavoured to convey to the people that I was on the line and they seemed to carry on oblivious of the fact that I was still listening.  I do not know what the technical problems are, but, while I see the merits of the phone, I think that socially, economically and, indeed, politically, we must be assured that, except on very rare occasions, we can speak on the phone without wondering whether or not we have an unwelcome audience.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> Notwithstanding those difficulties about which I speak, I should like to appeal to the Minister to deal as best he can with the 9,000 telephone applications by people in or around the city of Dublin.  I appreciate the scarcity of capital resources, and I do not want to impose any additional worries on the Minister, but I would suggest that there should be a certain priority in making telephones available to these applicants. I should like to see him give special consideration to people to whom the telephone is vital because of age or ill health.  There are several cases I know of in the city of Dublin where members of the family have got married and left home, with the result that the two old folk are there, not very mobile and not in a position to travel any distance to see their married offspring.  The easiest way for them to maintain communications is for the old people to have a telephone.  I should like old people to have a telephone so that when they retire at night they can, if there is need, readily summon medical assistance.</P>
    <P>I must express my disappointment as a Dublin man at the incidence of vandalism in regard to telephone kiosks in the city.  Unfortunately, I cannot suggest any cure for the problem.  Most of this destruction is caused through the desire of the delinquents to get whatever money is in the coinbox.  Would it be possible for the technical staff to design a system which would require the subscriber to place the money in some apparatus presumably at kneelevel; the money could subsequently be passed down a chute under the ground, which would be a concrete slab.  This would obviate the vandalism whereby those in search of money pull out the whole apparatus.  People have often gone to a telephone kiosk beside them only to discover that it is broken; they move on another half mile and find that is broken as well.</P>
    <P>I should like to relate the television service to this vandalism.  It should be possible to present on television a programme on the telephone service, indicating the cost of labour and material involved in erecting a telephone kiosk in any area in Dublin, <Col N="72" /> then showing how in two or three moments of destruction all that disappears, and then indicating the many other ways in which that same money could be spent.  This could be followed up by a picture of someone in some special difficulty going to a telephone kiosk to find that vandals have damaged it, thus causing death.  I think such a programme is preferable to the programmes to which Deputy Dr. Browne referred and which admittedly may have some appeal to morbidity, sordidness and emotionalism, or to this peculiar streak in us where we are more inclined to see the &ldquo;off&rdquo; rather than the &ldquo;on&rdquo;, the negative for the positive.  I mention this to show how RTE could produce a positive programme which would be complementary to the other services provided by the Department.</P>
    <P>Television is concerned in the business of news.  There is no written regulation that the reporters must at all times be careful.  I do not believe there are standing instructions to the reporters to keep within certain limits. I prefer newspaper reporting to news reporting on television or radio.  Sometimes on radio I detect a note of disappointment in some reporters who have been sent to areas where developments were expected but did not materialise.  A note of apology or disappointment can be detected in the voice of the reporter on the radio or television.  Perhaps I am wrong but on certain occasions I have been led to expect great happenings in early news bulletins but the later news bulletins indicated that the expected events did not happen.  I would have been relieved to hear the reporters say something like the following: &ldquo;Notwithstanding what happened earlier when group A were in one place and group B elsewhere and the fact that a confrontation with bricks, stones, bottles and bullets seemed inevitable, I am happy to report that no such confrontation took place and everything is peaceful.&rdquo; Instead of giving such wholesome news in a wholesome way, we have been left with the thought that our morbid feelings could not be satisfied.</P>
    <P>Radio and television could perform a useful function in many homes. <Col N="73" /> Many hard-working parents are not what one would call intellectuals or academics.  Their children have been led to believe that they are welleducated while in point of fact they have a small amount of specialised knowledge as a result of our narrow educational system.  A hard-working man has made and is making a contribution to society.  Such a man may have more wisdom than many of our educationalists.  His children may know that he did not pass the Primary Certificate.  In many homes with which I am familiar the parents may become irrelevant to their children because of the lack of formal education.  Programmes could be provided on television which would lead to discussions between parents and children and generate interest among them all. In some homes there is an embarrassing position when a programme finishes because the parent realises that although his offspring have enjoyed the programme it does not fit in with his own idea of how he felt he should rear his children.  The children may be enlightened and educated and understand that the programme showed the &ldquo;in thing&rdquo;. The children may be led to believe that passing pleasures are more important than lasting satisfaction.  There can be little understanding between the parents and the children at such times.  I appeal to the personnel in radio and television to consider the effect of the programmes on the parents and teenagers.  While I do not wish to appear insular I must admit that I am more interested in what is happening here than in what is happening abroad.  The programme should appeal to Irish people and if they are intellectual programmes we must not condemn them.  People may feel that such programmes represent that which is best for Ireland but I suggest that it is wrong of them to do so.  That is a claim that cannot be substantiated.  RTE should realise in respect of both radio and television that their successful programmes are not necessarily those which have contributors who can demonstrate certain articulation and can indulge in certain linguistic gymnastics and who can <Col N="74" /> spend an hour saying the same thing in different ways.</P>
    <P>I should like to see some of those contributors replaced by a sound farmer, a small shopkeeper or a factory worker who has acquired that old skill, <i>multum in parvo</i>, who can convey in five minutes what it would take the other type of contributor half an hour to convey.  He might do so less grammatically but more clearly than some of the professional contributors I have been speaking about.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I spent some time in the field of drama and I would be anxious to co-operate with RTE in making suggestions to them if I thought such suggestions would get a welcome from them.  My point is that I would be happy to see them preparing a programme&mdash;I could bring them to characters in my constituency&mdash; which would go to show the complete dedication of parents to a daughter afflicted by polio.  I am not suggesting this should be done as a tear-jerker but it would be an indication that we have in Dublin and throughout Ireland people who are not concerned solely with themselves&mdash;that we have unselfish people outside the walls of monasteries and convents, outside the ranks of those we are normally inclined to look upon as dedicated people.  Looking at the clock, I wonder whether I will continue.  The position is that we interrupt business at 6.30 p.m. and I would ask the House to bear with me while I fill in the gap between now and 6.30.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a word or two on Telefís Scoile.  It is an excellent programme, but here, again, I would be a little critical about this leaning towards what could be described as academic subjects.  For far too long has education been regarded as that which is concerned solely with academic subjects, and I would be hoping for an extension of Telefís Scoile to include programmes more in the field of technology.  Before reaching technology itself I would hope we could have programmes on mechanical drawing, metalwork and woodwork.  I would hope that such programmes would be put on at times when secondary school students could view them.  There is a realisation now that these subjects have a part in the curriculum of what were regarded formerly as secondary schools, and there is an anxiety and a desire on the part of these schools to include such subjects in their timetables.  Unfortunately, for one reason or another, perhaps because of lack of qualified teachers or lack of classrooms, this has been impossible.  Until the introduction of such subjects in the curriculum of secondary schools it would be advantageous if students could get an introduction to them by way of suitable Telefís Scoile programmes.  Such subjects were described as manual and for the uneducated but it is now realised they are necessary for the educated.</P>
      <P>As far as radio is concerned, I should not like to let the opportunity pass without expressing hope for the continued presence of the Ciarán Mac Mathúna programme.  Some years ago when Séamus Ennis introduced such programmes to Radio Éireann, when he travelled the length and breadth of Ireland collecting Irish music, it was an unfashionable thing to do.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Co-operative dairy societies, often <Col N="76" /> known as creameries, are industrial and provident societies, that is, societies which are registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893. Section 53 of that Act provides that two or more industrial and provident societies may amalgamate by passing a special resolution.  Under paragraph (a) of section 51 of the Act, a special resolution must be passed at a general meeting by not less than three-fourths of the members who vote, and under paragraph (b) of that section, the resolution must be confirmed at a subsequent general meeting by a majority of the members voting.  Voting in either case may be in person or by proxy.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend section 51 (a) of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893, to enable the passing of a special resolution for the amalgamation of co-operative dairy societies by a simple majority instead of by a minimum three-fourths majority as at present.  The amendment was proposed by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, and I am sponsoring the amendment as I am responsible for administration of the Acts dealing with industrial and provident societies.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development, the rationalisation and diversification of the creamery and milk processing industry is regarded by the Government as an essential and urgent objective of agricultural policy. The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has stated that, although some amalgamations of co-operative dairy societies have taken place over the past few years in furtherance of this policy objective, progress in this direction has been much slower than had been hoped for and than is now especially called for with the prospect of early accession to the European Economic Community.  At meetings which he had with the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society Limited and with other farming organisations, it had been strongly represented to him that the passing of a resolution for amalgamation by the required minimum three-fourths majority had proved a serious retarding factor in the <Col N="77" /> amalgamation of co-operative dairy societies and in the rationalisation of the creamery industry.  I understand that these organisations support the proposed change to a simple majority requirement.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has informed me that he is convinced of the force of the arguments made by the farming organisations. Numerous instances have come to his notice where resolutions for amalgamation, although supported by a substantial majority of members at meetings, have failed to become effective because of the three-fourths majority requirement.  These instances have been notable particularly in Kilkenny and in the Golden Vale area of County Limerick and North Cork. It would be only in an exceptional case that all members of a co-operative dairy society would derive their living solely or mainly from farming.  Consequently, it is in some cases a relatively easy matter to secure 25 per cent support, on a variety of personal grounds, for an opposition motion to an amalgamation resolution.  The result is that the real economic interests of the majority of members of such societies are thwarted and measures calculated to further Government policy and agricultural development are negatived.</P>
    <P>I support the view of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries that, in so far as co-operative dairy societies are concerned, it is urgently necessary that the requirements of section 51 (a) of the Act of 1893 should be amended to enable a resolution for amalgamation to be passed by a simple majority.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that the proposed amendment will not alter, in any way, the existing requirement for a confirmatory resolution as set out in paragraph (b) of section 51 of the Act, and it will not affect any other matters which, under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, require the passing of a special resolution.  For example, the amalgamation of registered societies, other than co-operative dairy societies, would still require the passing of a special resolution by a minimum three-fourths majority.</P>

      <P>We in Fine Gael accept this Bill wholeheartedly as a good step forward and our only criticism might be that it should have been introduced many months if not a year or more ago.  Those of us who are familiar with agricultural matters know of the necessity for the amalgamation of creameries and it is not necessary to go into detail in this regard in connection with this Bill.  Human nature being what it is, there are many occasions when people would wish to retain their independence when this would not be in the best interests of the country, the area or even the members. This could be due to personal reasons, as the Minister said, or because people believed their own efforts were better than would result from amalgamation. This is the age of amalgamation and, perhaps, of take-overs and while these things may not appeal to all of us, in the interests of rationalisation they are necessary if we are to make progress in the present-day world.</P>
      <P>Also, there are various factors that have been mentioned in a general way by the Minister such as the cost of machinery for the manufacture of milk products.  This is mainly stainless steel machinery for hygienic reasons and is highly expensive and in the size of units now being used it is beyond the reach of small creameries.  Yet, people who might be in a commanding position as regards votes in small creameries might hold up amalgamation for some reason, perhaps because they would get agricultural goods at a lower rate or something of that kind, while the fact would be that for their own good and the good of the area and its people amalgamation would be absolutely necessary.</P>
      <P>Another factor is the cost of marketing. Nowadays one does not buy butter or cheese or even cheddar cheese; one buys a brand name.  Perhaps this brand is sold to us by advertising, again at a huge cost.  When we buy the brand product we expect to get absolute uniformity of quality and taste, the taste and quality which pleases and which was advertised.  This is not possible with a proliferation of small creameries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is correct when he says it is sometimes extremely easy to get <Col N="79" /> 25 per cent of the members objecting among the shareholders in a creamery and that percentage can stand in the way of a great majority who have other things in mind.</P>
    <P>I think the House should pass this Bill tonight and ensure that the rationalisation of our creameries proceeds with due haste.  No personal matters should be allowed to interfere and it is in the interests of all concerned that the amending Bill becomes law.  The safety factors mentioned by the Minister near the end of his speech, where he draws attention to the fact that a general meeting must be held to confirm the decision and that section 51 paragraph (b) of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893 will stand, appear to me to be a guarantee that the amending legislation would not be used for any other than a good purpose. I have no hesitation in saying that this is proper legislation and should be passed tonight.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that, in general, there is no criticism of the proposal and that Deputy Donegan has welcomed the Bill and spoken in its favour, I have nothing specific to add to what I have already said.  Deputy Donegan mentioned that the Bill does not intend interfering in any way with various other societies that are registered under this Act and this is specifically spelled out in the Bill in order to avoid any danger of the intention behind this legislation being extended into any other field.  I am happy that the House accepts this Bill and I share with the Deputy the view that it is necessary that the Bill be passed as quickly as possible so that its benefits can be put into operation.</P>

      <P>In relation to the order referred to by the Minister, that is, S.I. No. 133 of 1970, I understand that this is the fifth reduction of protective duties that has been effected as a result of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and that we are debating it in retrospection since it occurred in July of last year.  However, at this stage I would again like to reiterate my anxiety that the Minister would make every effort to ensure that, where there is unemployment or where there is harship being caused to manufacturers or where there is disruption of trade because of these tariffs in any particular sector, their effects would be alleviated.  I would like the Minister to give us his views on that and let us know what has been done in that regard.</P>

      <P>In relation to any action that can be taken under articles 15 or 19 of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement with a view to protecting employment, I can assure the Deputy and the House that such action is being taken currently.  As I have indicated already, we had a review and there has been continuous discussion, both prior to the 1st July and since then, and our officials and officials from Britain are in constant communication in relation to this matter.  I assure the Deputy that any action that it is possible for me to take will be taken.</P>

      <P>I am glad of that undertaking and I appreciate that the Minister must be careful not to indicate specific industries or areas of difficulty because we must not point to our weaknesses in regard to particular companies.  However, it would be my hope that there would be more than discussion and I would press that every avenue be explored in relation to the agreement so that any unemployment or disruption of trade would be obviated if possible.  I accept that there is much redundancy and unemployment now which cannot be attributed to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement but for which there are other <Col N="81" /> underlying reasons.  However, there are certain items and instances which it would be unwise to discuss in detail here.  I hope the Minister will make every effort to help in those cases.</P>

      <P>In relation to Statutory Instrument No. 133 of 1970, the position in relation to knitted and crocheted fabrics, and in particular those fabrics which come from Northern Ireland, is one that is causing me considerable anxiety.  Perhaps the Minister is in a position to indicate more specifically if there is anything he can do to help alleviate the present difficulties in respect of these fabrics. It may well be that this is an area in which amalgamation is necessary.</P>
      <P>The imposition of duties raises the question of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and, as the Minister has indicated, brings in the safety clauses.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on the question of knitted and crocheted fabrics.  I should like to hear his views also on the preference accorded to the importation of these fabrics from Northern Ireland and on the difficulties being caused here and whether anything is being done in the context of the agreement to help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Technically, Statutory Instrument No. 133 is the withdrawal of the 10 per cent on the overall, but I do not understand exactly what the Deputy is asking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the fact that there is a preference on knitted and crocheted fabrics imported from Northern Ireland, but I want to emphasise that I have no objection to such preference.  I have been indicating also that there is serious difficulty in the entire textile trade. While I referred in a general way to the application of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement in respect of the reduction of tariffs, I should like to know in particular about the textile trade and especially about <Col N="82" /> items that are imported from Northern Ireland.  I want to know if the Minister has applied the safety clauses in this respect and, if so, whether we can expect results soon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in this regard is that up to now we have had the position whereby, arising from the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, there was an additional preference by way of a further reduction of 10 per cent of duty applied to articles from Northern Ireland. This has been maintained in the order we are discussing.  In addition, any specific industry here that can be affected adversely by imports of articles manufactured in the North of Ireland is considered in exactly the same way as industries here that are affected by imports from the United Kingdom as a whole.  It is natural that, even with the best will in the world and despite my anxiety, I should endeavour to aim at a sort of free trade situation between the Six Counties and ourselves.  However, I have, of necessity, to take steps to prevent any duty free importation from the Six County area that would have the effect of creating any serious unemployment here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the cases I made here was that the volume of people employed in the footwear industry in the time under review, in 1970, was not less than the number of people employed in the footwear industry in 1965&mdash;that there had not been a falling off in total employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must take the Minister up on that.  It may have been possible for him to give figures to show that there was not a reduction in employment but there was at that time a grave danger of reduction and such danger has since become fact and serious redundancy has taken place.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to something.  He finds it difficult to remember exactly what happened.  What happened was that we did not have the 10 per cent reduction in tariffs but we had the removal of quota which was a very severe&mdash;we are all quoting from memory&mdash;factor affecting our footwear industry here. Of course, the problem is not leather footwear.  The problem is cheap footwear from abroad, not only from Britain, but from the Continent where the prices are so low for the wholesale purchase of such footwear that they <Col N="84" /> can bear any tariff.  The only effective instrument there was was quota and that instrument was removed.  It is true that footwear is a very sensitive area and one where discussions going on under article 1, subsection (5), and article 19 of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement should be concluded as soon as possible and something done.  In my constituency I can see two to three footwear factories in serious difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that the Minister has consistently opposed any suggestion that the footwear industry was affected in any way by the Free Trade Agreement on the grounds that there were exports and that there were other causes.  For the first time tonight the Minister has said he agrees that it had an effect.  He says he remembers that there were as many in employment in 1970 as there had been previously.  I should like him to check on 1971 and see what the effect has been.  This is the end of 1971 and he must know we are now reaching the dregs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy Donegan has said is correct.  There is an amount of cheap footwear coming in here.  The Minister knows this because I went to the trouble of sending to his office a pair of ladies' shoes which were bought marked &ldquo;Made in Ireland&rdquo;.  They were assembled in Ireland.  They had an Irish brand name on them.  They were Italian shoes sent to this country in pieces.  All the factory did was put them together and send them out under an Irish brand name.  They were sold for £5.  We had this checked to find out what the materials were worth.  They were sent to Ireland at about 15s.  The factory processed them and sold them at something under £2 and they were sold across the counter to an unfortunate workingman's wife for £5.  They had plastic heels which wore away in a short time.  When they were sent back from the Minister's office the firm that assembled them eventually did the big thing&mdash;they put on new plastic heels and said: &ldquo;Hundreds of thousands of pairs of these shoes have been sold to date and there have been only a few complaints.&rdquo;  It was not a case of those shoes being bad.  It was the question <Col N="85" /> of hundreds of thousands of them having been sold in this country and having been sent from Italy while we were supposed to be protecting Irish industry. That is the point.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether everybody has had the same experience as I have had, but at present go out to the city or to any large town and you cannot buy Irish manufactured goods.  You will be offered a half dozen foreign items, in many cases cheaper.  One reason why they are cheaper is that the country from which they are coming is subsidising them just as we were wrapping pounds of butter in postal orders until this year in order to have a sale abroad.  The result is that we are now in a situation where our Irish industries are going to the wall. The Minister says it is not altogether because of the Free Trade Agreement, that there are other causes.  Of course there are; but when Britain found herself in trouble over her balance of payments she had no hesitation in slapping on a tariff.  When we found ourselves in trouble what did we do? We could not insult Britain.  After all Britain was our best customer and we had to be nice to them.  The result is we are reaching a stage where, without officially suffering from European competition, the Irish industrialist is in serious trouble.  The Minister has much more experience of it than anybody else and I am amazed at his attitude to these matters.  He must know the precarious condition in which Irish industries are.  It is all right for his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to say that when we go into the EEC we will have the customs border between here and Northern Ireland removed and everything will be grand.  He did not say the British soldiers will still be there.  Whether the customs border is removed or not the position is bad now, it will get worse unless something is done about it and the present administration are not doing anything to help.  If the Minister wants any evidence of how bad it is, all he has to do is check with the Minister for Labour who could tell him that we are running up to 8,000 redundancies on permanent jobs in factories this year. The Minister might be able to explain <Col N="86" /> what the Government are doing to help.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Deputy says it comes as a shock to him to find the Minister took some action in connection with footwear, because footwear &mdash;leather footwear&mdash;was included in the standstill in relation to reductions which took place on 1st July last. There were certain steel and iron products, leather footwear, hollow ware, joinery, electric domestic appliances and mobile homes.  There were a number of items that were covered in the standstill, if you like, on the reduction in duties this year.  This was an intermediate arrangement that was made in our discussions while a number of other items were being looked at.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully refers to the effect of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and goes on to give an instance of the importation of something from Italy, which would have nothing at all to do with the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, one can fully accept that.  Deputy Donegan raised the question in relation to Order No. 133 and the reference to the duties on certain yarns and certain knitted and crocheted fabrics as to whether these were in accordance with recommendations of the Committee on the De-pyramiding of Tariff Protection.  The committee recommended these specific reductions mentioned on yarns and fabrics in an effort to help the making-up trade from the point of view of making them more competitive.  This was the reason why this was included in that order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I have no objection to the question of the mobile homes because, as the Minister said in his Second Reading speech, this <Col N="88" /> is merely something that happened out of a mistake, perhaps, in drafting or some other thing.  The conversion of rates of currency to the decimal coinage is not of great moment.  It is something that is with us and that we have to accept.  In relation to watches, the number of workers given was 50.  I presume the Minister could tell us that there will not be any fewer watchmakers employed in the industry here than there were because of the inclusion of watches.  I am aware of what the Minister said in his Second Reading speech about the Horological Institute and what the Swiss did for us.  If he could just assure us that we will not have fewer watchmakers employed, I will not have much more to say on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>There are a few questions on this that I tried to ask last week.  First, I was wondering if the Minister had yet got information about the discussions which were taking place between his Department and their counterpart in Northern Ireland.  Unless I am very much wrong, it is my impression that these discussions were to start a year ago or in the early part of this year.  I wondered if the Minister had looked into the problem since.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I wondered had the Minister spelled out exactly the particular items from Northern Ireland which were being given special preference here and if any discussions had taken place about extending the list of goods or items which were getting preferential treatment here because, as I understand, our balance of trade with Northern Ireland is very much in our favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, I asked about the importation of watches.  I have a reply to some of my questions but I presume I will have to wait until tomorrow for a reply to the question about the Horological Institute and its purpose and financing.  I am wondering about the effect on us of granting this special tariff reduction on the watches.  It would appear that there is no special concession to the Swiss watch industry if we must apply it all round to other countries exporting to this country.  I notice that the value in the last year was a little over £250,000 and I am <Col N="89" /> wondering will this result in a reduction in the numbers employed in the watch-assembly industry in this country. Perhaps the Minister would like to answer some of the questions I posed last week in relation to these matters and I should like to give him an opportunity now to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did raise questions last week in relation to discussions between officials of my Department and the Ministry of Commerce in the Six Counties, to which I replied indicating to the Deputy that there have been discussions but not specific discussions in connection with the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement or the operations of that agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussions which took place ranged over a wide variety of subjects relating to the possible opportunities for co-operations between the North and the South.  Certainly, in any wide-ranging discussions of this nature the tariff situation would arise but any discussions on tariffs would be only incidental to the overall discussions as to how my Department could co-operate with the Ministry of Commerce in the North in relation to trying to improve two-way trade.  Also embraced in this would be the Department of Transport and Power in the general field of tourism and interchange.</P>
      <P>Arising from the discussions which took place earlier, my Department are currently engaged in pursuing the various topics discussed with a view to seeing if further progress can be made but I think the House will appreciate that the present atmosphere is not one that is conducive to the continuation at present of wide-ranging discussions between the Minister of Commerce and my Department on general overall improvement.</P>

      <P>The matter should be raised now.  The Minister raised it. I raised it last week.  It is astonishing that the Minister of a Department should confess in this House absolute ignorance of the fact that his officials were engaged in discussions with their counterparts in Northern Ireland.  The Minister comes in now and admits that what I said last week was true: his Department had been involved in discussions. This humiliating confession is made by a Minister who was simply not aware of what was happening in his Department.  It surprises me that I should make known to the Minister that discussions had taken place between his Department and the Department of Commerce in Northern Ireland.  It is disgraceful that the Minister should have known nothing about that.</P>

Since 1964 the Swiss watch industry has contributed something in the region of £10,000 per year towards this institute under an agreement made with the Swiss Federation of Watch Manufacturers.  The agreement was entered into finally with the Department of Education and, under the terms of the agreement, the specialist teaching equipment for the institute was supplied by the Swiss Federation at a cost of over £10,000; the federation has also paid the salaries of the technical teachers as well as the cost of the individual tool kits supplied to the students, plus certain other costs.  Any remaining costs were met by the Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  Last year I introduced an order, following an appeal from the Swiss, reducing the duty by 10 per cent.  I was not aware of the actual complement of the transactions and that is the reason why I was not in a position to give the Deputy the information he sought.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (a), page 2, line 34, after &ldquo;years,&rdquo; to add &ldquo;or&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>(2)  The following are the conditions to be complied with:</P>
      <P>(a)  that&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  the land is held for the purpose of carrying on the sport under a lease for a term of not less than twenty-one years,</P>
      <P>(ii)  the land has been continuously occupied by the sports club for that purpose for the period of not less than twenty-one years immediately preceding the date of the application for a sporting lease, or   </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I read the section as it stands both those provisions have to be complied with, subject, of course, to what the Minister will say.  I, and some people who are interested in this Bill, believe it should be sufficient if the land is held for the purpose of carrying on the sport under a lease for a term of not less than 21 years, or if the land has been continuously occupied by the sports club for that purpose for the period of not less than 21 years immediately preceding the date of the application for a sporting lease.  I <Col N="95" /> suggest the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; should be inserted between (i) and (ii).  The same applies in relation to (2) (b) which deals with the spending of money and sets out that the club shall have spent money:</P>
    <P> (i)  on erecting permanent buildings or structures on the land which are used in connection with the land for that purpose,</P>
    <P>(ii)  on reconstructing, altering, renovating or adapting any permanent buildings or structures on the land which are so used so as to render them more suitable for that purpose. </P>
    <P>I suggest it should be sufficient if the club have spent money on the erecting of permanent buildings or structures on the land which are used in connection with the land for purposes of sport or on reconstructing, altering, renovating or adapting any permanent existing buildings on the land.  Again I invite the Minister to agree to the insertion of &ldquo;or&rdquo; between (b) (i) and (ii).  If he does so it will considerably improve the section and the Bill generally.  I should be glad to have the Minister's views on this.</P>

      <P>In my view the amendments are unnecessary. I have had the matter discussed with the parliamentary draftsmen who are satisfied that the insertion of the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; between subparagraph (i) and (ii) of paragraph 2 (2) (a) is not required.  I am advised that subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) must be read as alternative to one another. Apart from the fact that it is good drafting to have it as it is it is good grammar to have it as it is because if one refers to an alternative of three and says one must pick A, B or C, one does not say one should pick A or B or C.  There is no doubt whatever that (i), (ii) and (iii) in section 2 are alternative and if one comes under any one of them one qualifies so far as that part of it is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete subsection (2) (c), lines 15 to 23, and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) that the total amount so spent was not less than one thousand pounds.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think we have something of substance here and I should like the Minister to give it serious consideration. In order to qualify for a sporting lease the sports club must satisfy the court that it has spent money on erecting permanent buildings or reconstructing existing buildings or developing, improving or adapting the land. Subsection (2) (c) states:</P>
      <P>that the total amount so spent was not less than the greater of the following, namely, one thousand pounds or fifteen times the average yearly amount of any rent or other sum paid or payable in respect of the land in the five years immediately preceding the date of the application for a sporting lease, disregarding any penal rent or other sum payable for any breach of a covenant, condition or agreement and any exceptional rent or sum in respect of a specified period not exceeding five years.</P>
      <P>In the case I have been given I am told that in order to qualify for a sporting lease the club in question will have to prove that it had spent £7,500 under these various headings.  The probability is that it has, indeed, spent £7,500 or much more but the difficulty is to prove that because no records are available, no books have been kept. This money has been spent over a period but they are very fearful that it may not be possible to prove to the satisfaction of the court that 15 times the rent has been spent on these provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This type of argument has been made to me and I think it is quite reasonable.  There is no provision in the Bill for ascertaining the monetary <Col N="98" /> value of money spent.  It is suggested that a clause be inserted in the Bill that where accounts are not available the value of the work done in the case of a dispute between the landlord and the club should be referred to an arbitrator, in the case of a golf club to a golf architect or to some person who would have expert knowledge of the cost and the present value of the work done, otherwise the landlord and the tenant might be arguing for years about the matter.  In the meantime the club would not have the sporting lease which would encourage them to improve the course and the amenities as they would not know whether they would eventually succeed in getting the sporting lease.</P>
    <P>Also, if the present cost of constructing a golf course was taken into account it would run into the region of £1,000 as a whole.  In order to get over that I have put down an amendment saying that where the club can satisfy the court that it has spent £1,000 on this type of improvement that it should qualify for a sporting lease.  The argument has been put to me, and I think it is quite reasonable, that most of these clubs are run in an informal sort of way.  The improvements are made generally over a number of years as money is available and as the necessity arises.  If the Minister cannot see his way to accept my simple way of dealing with this by providing that an expenditure of £1,000 should be adequate, then the matter should be referred to arbitration and the arbitrator should be a person with technical knowledge as otherwise you would have wrangling going on in the court for ages with the landlord naturally anxious to obstruct the granting of the sporting lease.</P>
    <P>The Minister realises that landlords will not be anxious to grant these sporting leases and for that very reason he has introduced this Bill.  I should like to have the Minister's views on that because I think there is a point of substance here.  I was not so confident about the first two amendments because I felt the Minister would put forward the argument that he did which I accept but here I think that we have a point which will be difficult <Col N="99" /> to get over.  A sum in the region of £7,500 is only £500 a year but is not a sum which is too easy to prove especially with a club which is run in the way most of these sporting clubs are run.  I shall be glad to hear the Minister's views on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be inclined to accept the amendment.  The recommendation of the Landlord and Tenant Commission in their second report, paragraph 79 (2) (e), was that the investment of the club in buildings or in land should not be less than 15 times the yearly rent.  An additional requirement that this expenditure should be at least £1,000 was inserted in order to ensure that only clubs with a genuine stake in the land would benefit under the provisions of the Bill. This was so because many clubs hold under a very nominal rent indeed.</P>
      <P>Apart from this and apart from provisions of a purely technical nature, section 2, subsection (2) (c), of the Bill reflects the recommendation of the commission concerning the amount of investment that the club should be required to show.  I feel also there is no need for an evidential provision of the type suggested by Deputy Fitzpatrick. A club which is in difficulty in proving from its own accounts that it fulfils the expenditure requirement can always produce a golf architect or some other suitable expert in the court to give an expert opinion as to the actual expenditure.  That opinion would, of course, be acceptable to the court in the absence of rebutting evidence from some other expert.</P>
      <P>The point I want to make is that it is not essential that a club should be able to produce old ledgers or something of that nature with actual figures in it.  I should point out, too, that the number of cases where the required figure would be in excess of £1,000 would not be all that great.  The figure of £7,500 mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick would be a fairly substantial amount and would be much more than many of these clubs would pay.  Am I correct in thinking this would be a rent of approximately £500 per year?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The reference to £1,000 in the section is the best argument in favour of my amendment.  The Minister has stated that the commission were of opinion that before a club should be entitled to a new lease they should make a worthwhile investment in the land, in erecting buildings, reconstructing old premises or developing the land.  They went on to set out their idea of a substantial investment and, according to the Minister, that investment has been spelled out at £1,000.</P>

      <P>No, the Deputy may have misunderstood me.  The commission recommended 15 times the annual rent but in order to put a minimum figure on it I inserted the figure of £1,000.  The commission may have overlooked the fact that there would be clubs with very nominal rents and it would scarcely be fair to give them a lease on the basis of having spent only a few hundred pounds.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am sorry for having misunderstood the Minister but it does not weaken my argument because the Minister has measured what he considers to be a substantial and worthwhile investment and he puts that investment at £1,000. I would be agreeable to accept that as a figure below which a club would not be entitled to a sporting lease; in other words, the club would not be entitled to a sporting lease if they had not spent at least £1,000.  However, I should like the Minister to come along with me and say that if they could satisfy the court they had spent £1,000 they would qualify under this heading. I was speaking from a brief given to me in respect of Castlerea Golf Club&mdash; at least my informant is from Castlerea and I assume the golf club is in that locality.  As names have been menmise <Col N="101" /> tioned here, I consider I am at liberty to mention that.  These people are of the opinion they will be in difficulty if 15 times the rent is written into the Bill.  If the Minister has agreed to accept £1,000, why not let that amount be the ceiling?  Why provide that they must have expended the greater of the two alternatives, namely, £1,000 or 15 times the rent?  If the Minister had accepted completely the commission's recommendations of 15 times the rent I could understand his reasoning, but if he is satisfied with £1,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is what I am advised.  However, the Minister should not make fish of one and flesh of another.  He should accept, as a principle, that anyone who spends £1,000 should qualify.  What the Minister is saying here is that some will qualify at £1,000 and other people might not qualify unless they spend £7,500.  This is a serious point and it has been raised by a club who think they have a practical difficulty and one they will have to face if the Bill is not amended.  I do not think the Minister would weaken the Bill or take from it in any way if he were to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick should bear in mind that not all clubs are the same either in the activities they undertake or in the size and value of the lands they occupy.  For example, if a club some 20 or 25 years ago rented one acre of land and paid a small rent for it&mdash;perhaps £25 a year &mdash;and then developed it in some way, that club should not be put on the same level as a golf club, for example, who might have 100 or 150 acres.  It would be unfair to impose the same <Col N="102" /> expenditure requirement on a small place of one acre as on a place with a large membership and an area of 100 acres.  The reason the minimum figure was put in was to ensure that in cases where there was a purely nominal rent, unless there was some reasonable development in the small areas involved, it would be unfair to the owner to impose on him liability for this kind of lease.  From the owner's point of view a lease for 99 years is an onerous type of lease.  Therefore, we should bear in mind the distinction between different types of property and we should not seek, as this amendment does, to impose the same requirement regarding expenditure on both the very large and the small type of property.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister will appreciate that some of the sporting clubs we are dealing with have been in existence for 60 years and that money has been expended on them from time to time and some of the labour might be voluntary. When we come to discuss the expenditure of money we should not forget that actual cash might not have been spent as much of the work could have been done by members without payment or reward.  For that reason it will be difficult for the clubs to prove that they expended this amount of money. I know the Minister has said that this might be a matter of evidence, that some architect would inspect the course and say he believed so much money had been expended.  Let us suppose that expenditure took place 30 or 40 years ago.  I think the Minister will agree that £1,000 in those days would do a great amount of work and reconstruction and especially if a voluntary effort were thrown into it it might be very difficult, if not impossible, to prove, in the case of a long standing club where the work was done, as I say, 40 or 50 years ago, that this sort of money running into thousands of pounds had been spent on it.  I know the Minister and the Government are well intentioned in introducing this Bill, that they are introducing it to get over a difficulty which has arisen in recent years by the expanding of towns and cities and because of the demand for land.  However, <Col N="103" /> if the Minister is merely going to create litigation between sporting clubs and landlords, he will not have achieved the object he set out to achieve.  As I say, this club is worried about that.  I think £1,000 expenditure is substantial.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 5, after &ldquo;interest&rdquo; in line 50, to add &ldquo;and the financial position of the sports club applying for the lease and its members&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 6 provides the machinery for fixing the rent in default of agreement. In default of agreement on the rent between the lessor and the sports club, the court shall fix a fair rent for the grant of a lease of the property for the purpose of carrying on the sport. Then subsection (2) goes on to set the guidelines to be taken into account by the court in fixing the rent.  Subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>In fixing the rent the court shall have regard to the general intention of this Act in relation to sports clubs which is the advancement of outdoor sports, games and recreations and the preservation of open spaces for the common good and, without prejudice to such other considerations as it considers relevant, may take into account the rent or other sum previously paid for the property by the sports club and any covenants and conditions under which it was so paid, to the rent paid by other sports clubs of the same kind in the same or a comparable locality, to the contribution made by the sports club to the enhancement of the property, and to price paid by any person who is a necessary party to the granting of the lease in the acquisition of his estate or interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would submit broadly that all those guidelines are weighed in favour of the club, that the court is to take into account and to have regard to the fact that the sports club is advancing outdoor sports, games and recreations and the preservation of open spaces for <Col N="105" /> the common good, and all these other things.  The argument the Minister has just made against my last amendment is, I think, valid against the Minister here.  It might be reasonable that a sports club not in a very affluent financial state should get a lease at a reasonable rent but that an affluent sports club, whose members are people of financial standing, should have to pay nearer the market rent.  Therefore, I put down this amendment which provides that, in addition to all the other guidelines set out there, the court shall also have regard to the financial position of the sports club applying for the lease and of its members.  That will cut both ways.  It is only one of the factors that the court will be obliged to take into account if the Minister accepts my amendment.</P>
    <P>It will mean that the court could take into account that they were a struggling club doing their best to provide these amenities in an area where they did not exist and in which there was not a very big population.  On the other hand, the court could take into account the fact that it might be a club with a huge membership of comparatively wealthy people who could, without undue burden to themselves, contribute to the rent by paying a small increase in their subscriptions. That is the argument that I am putting forward.  Unless the Minister accepts this amendment the section is weighted in favour of the club entirely and it asks the court to bear in mind that the sports club are public benefactors because they are providing amenities for sport in an area.  This also leads to the preservation of open spaces.  My suggestion to the Minister is not an entirely new one.  This has been provided for in the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, as amended by the Rent Restrictions Act, 1967, and as will be amended by this Bill.  There is provision for the court to take into consideration the financial circumstances of the landlord and of the tenant.  There is not any valid argument against this amendment.  If the section read that the court should fix a fair rent for the grant of the lease of the property for the purpose of carrying on sport, there might not be any necessity for this amendment, but it is not left at that. <Col N="106" /> The court is not instructed to fix a fair rent.  The court is instructed:</P>
    <P>(2)  In fixing the rent the court shall have regard to the general intention of this Act in relation to sports clubs which is the advancement of outdoor sports, games and recreations and the preservation of open spaces for the common good and, without prejudice to such other considerations as it considers relevant, may take into account the rent or other sum previously paid for the property by the sports club....</P>
    <P>That might not be very helpful.  The subsection further reads:</P>
    <P>and any covenants and conditions under which it was so paid, to the rent paid by other sports clubs of the same kind....</P>
    <P>It would be difficult enough to get comparisons there.  By and large, there will only be one in each area&mdash;very often in each county&mdash;and they will not be comparable.  The subsection continues:</P>
    <P>in the same or a comparable locality, to the contribution made by the sports club to the enhancement of the property, and to the price paid by any person who is a necessary party to the granting of the lease in the acquisition of his estate or interest.</P>
    <P>I am quite agreeable to that plan, that the price paid to any person should be taken into account.  There could be a case of a person buying the lessor's interest for a small sum and coming in to exploit it and to get a big rent.  That is a valid guideline.  I also think my suggestion is reasonable and even necessary having regard to the stipulations. It is only reasonable that sports clubs should be entitled to sufficient land for their requirements.  Land and houses are very different.  Land is a very valuable commodity at the moment.  It would be unreasonable in a case where there was a wealthy sports club and a comparatively poor lessor or landlord that the landlord should be obliged, as this section in my opinion would oblige him, to subsidise sport in a locality and to subsidise well-off people to enable them to enjoy themselves.  My suggestion would not harm the section, but rather would do it a lot of good.</P>

      <P>I feel that this amendment is not necessary because the section already allows the court in fixing the rent, to take account of:</P>
      <P>such other considerations as it considers relevant.</P>
      <P>That phrase is wide enough to cover any of the factors referred to by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  If in the case of any particular club it or its members are well-off financially it is open to the landlord to argue this consideration before the court.  The further defect in the amendment is that it seeks to take into account the financial position of the club applying for its lease and of its members.  As it reads there appear to be two separate concepts&mdash;the club's own finances and the financial position of the persons who comprise the membership.  I cannot envisage a situation being welcomed by the members of a club in which they will be called into court and asked about their income and their general financial circumstances.  The main point is that all the factors mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick are covered in the subsection as it stands. An owner can make these points if they are relevant to him.  The court must take them into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It appears to me that the considerations which the court must take into consideration in ease of the club are written out in black and white.  It is said that without prejudice to such other considerations as it considers relevant the courts may take these things into account.  A court in interpreting the section would come to the conclusion that the overriding consideration was the benefit that the club was conferring on the locality.  That is a fair summary of the impression a judge would get on reading this section. He would get the impression that the important thing he should take into account was the benefit being conferred on the local community and the area in which the club is by the existence of that club.  That is unreasonable. If we put in considerations in favour of the lease we should also put in reasonable considerations that should be taken into account on behalf <Col N="108" /> of the lessor.  I do not believe that a landlord should exploit the local community by being able to charge a prohibitive or black market rent, or a rent that he might get because of the scarcity of land for the purpose of sports clubs, but I believe that where a club are in reasonably affluent circumstances they should pay a reasonable rent.</P>
      <P>I do not mind if the Minister redrafts the amendment because amendments put down by the Opposition are not always as competently drafted as those put down by the Government or as Bills introduced by the Government because the Minister and the Government in general have at their disposal draftsmen of many years experience who do nothing else but draft Bills and amendments.  Even they produce Bills from time to time which, when they become Acts, give rise to long and learned consideration and argument in the courts.</P>
      <P>If the Minister were to accept my amendment in principle he is quite welcome to tell me he will have it redrafted, as he did in the case of an amendment which will appear later, and have it reintroduced on Report Stage.  I feel very strongly that a judge interpreting this section as it stands will find himself being invited to lean over backwards in favour of the club and I fear that a landlord going into court has the dice loaded against him in this section.  If it were finally left &ldquo;the court shall fix a fair rent&rdquo;, the judge would decide what is a fair rent and take into consideration such matters as he thought fit.  My objection here is that the judge is told he must take into consideration certain matters which in my opinion are loaded in favour of the lessee and against the lessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly urge, therefore, that the Minister should have another look at this.  It is legislation which, I concede, is long overdue.  I also concede that if it were not introduced at this time many sports clubs in the country would find themselves ejected from their lands which would then be built on.  It was pointed out during Second Stage that there is the danger in the Dublin area where there are three racecourses, Leopardstown, Baldoyle <Col N="109" /> and the Phoenix Park, that we would end up with only two and possibly we could end up with only the one controlled by the Racing Board.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am prepared to agree with the Minister that this legislation is necessary, but I think that when the Minister says we had to introduce legislation of this sort for the compelling reasons I have just mentioned, he should be very careful to see that it is fair to all the people who will be affected by it, particularly when he invites the courts to fix a rent and when he provides guidelines for the courts&mdash;that the guidelines should weigh evenly as between both sides. My objection, which I hope I have put fairly clearly, is that this subsection does not do just that.  Indeed, it does the opposite because the other party is not adequately covered by such an omnibus phrase as &ldquo;without prejudice to such other considerations as it (the court) considers relevant&rdquo;.  Judges are human and I think any judge would be right if he said: &ldquo;I have to take the section in its entirety and to read it as it stands.  The impression I get from the section is that the benefit being conferred on the community by the club is the overriding factor that I am to take into consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is why, when I first read the Bill, I thought there was something lacking and I set out to amend it by providing that the court be invited to take into consideration the financial circumstances of the club involved. Indeed, I would go a little further.  If the Minister is concerned with that I would agree that we could invite the court also to take into consideration the financial circumstances of the owner of the land and if he happened to be an exceptionally wealthy man it might have a bearing also.  If the Minister would like to add to the amendment &ldquo;and the financial circumstances of the club concerned and of the owner of the land&rdquo; I would be satisfied. We would then be fair to both sides.</P>
    <P>This is not something new.  If the Minister refers to section 8 of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, he will find that his predecessor and the Landlord and Tenant Commission wrote in <Col N="110" /> similar terms and spelled it out in black and white.  I am not too clear whether this Bill has to go back to the Seanad &mdash;if it originated here it would have to come back to us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I could not accept the amendment in principle.  I still feel it is unnecessary.  Everything he says should be taken into account can be taken into account.  I find it difficult to reconcile his proposals in this amendment with his proposal in the previous amendment which in fact was the direct opposite because he sought there to impose one figure on all clubs.  No matter how rich or how poor or what their circumstances might be, he sought to impose a figure of £1,000 in this amendment.  If a club happens to be particularly wealthy that fact is a relevant matter and a matter which can be brought to the attention of the court by those appearing for the lessor.  I have no doubt they would do that and would be failing in their duty if they did not do it and the court will accordingly take that into account.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> Before section 9 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  Any tenant holding on a lease under fifty years shall be entitled to purchase the freehold, notwithstanding anything in any enactments.</P>
    <P>(b)  Any tenant whose ground rent is greater than the Poor Law Valuation of the property shall be entitled to purchase the freehold.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All these amendments are designed to remedy a situation that has given rise to a good deal of difficulty for a number of tenants on the Proby Estate, which was the subject of a reference by the Minister in introducing the Bill and also of some remarks I made on the Second Stage.  At this stage it is probably only necessary to recapitulate some of the principal facts in the situation.</P>
    <P>During the time when the Rents and Leaseholds Commission, presided over by Judge Conroy, was considering the situation and preparing the report on which the earlier Acts were drafted, the Proby Estate took action against certain tenants whose leases fell in and as a result&mdash;some of the leases were short-term; others had a longer term &mdash;a number of tenants were compelled, because of the circumstances, to take out new leases.  This exercise of <i>force majeure</i> resulted in the tenants concerned being obliged to pay varying sums but in one or two cases considerable sums.  This arose due to a defect in the 1958 Act which when it came to light was the subject of consideration by the Conroy Commission. While the Commision was actually sitting the leases fell in and as a result some tenants had to accept very onerous terms.</P>
    <P>The difficulty about the present amending legislation is that it does not cover some of these cases, and for a simple reason.  The Minister's proposed amendments in section 8 and 9 specify certain periods.  In one case the period is five years.  This means, if the section is enacted as now phrased, that the five-year period would exclude some existing tenants and it was <Col N="112" /> suggested by them, and I have endeavoured to draft amendments to cover it, that the period be extended to eight years.  As the Bill is drafted, the leases will expire and, because the Bill goes back only for a period of five years, the tenants do not qualify.  The other defect is that any tenant whose ground rent is greater than the poor law valuation will not qualify for the purchase of the freehold under the proposed amendment.  Some tenants, as the Minister can understand and as was clearly shown to the Conroy Commission, are in a peculiarly difficult position because at the time when their leases fell in some of them at very considerable cost, resulting in a few cases in very great hardship to themselves and their families, were obliged to come to terms with the landlord.</P>
    <P>In other cases when this matter was brought before the Conroy Commission &mdash;in one specific case it was ventilated on four separate occasions&mdash;ejectment proceedings against tenants were taken by the estate.  Eventually, the estate gave an undertaking to the commission not to issue eviction proceedings against any tenant until the amendment was drafted and implemented.  Prior to that undertaking being given the tenants whose leases had expired were under threat of eviction and they accepted short term leases at exorbitant rents. People who previously had leases of less than 50 years, in some cases leases of 21 years, and in others long leases at small ground rents, will now be denied the right of renewal or the right to purchase because of the circumstances in which they were granted renewals previously.  These should have been covered by the 1958 Act but they were not so covered, although the Rent and Leasehold Commission published advertisements at the time.  Apparently, in certain cases the advertisements were not seen by the people and there was a great deal of delay in having the case presented to the commission.  The commission had completed their work in respect of some aspects before the matter was brought to notice.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to consider the amendment.  I appreciate that, as the Minister said on Second Stage, there are certain aspects that might <Col N="113" /> present difficulties, but the particular proposals involved in these amendments are not designed to widen the situation but are designed solely to giving the same rights to a few excluded tenants as others will have after this Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>The fact that steps were taken to force certain people to enter into agreements and that subsequently, when the matter had been ventilated before both the courts and the Rent and Leasehold Commission, an undertaking had been given not to proceed until after the amending legislation was introduced, indicated that the landlord and his advisers realised that what they were trying to do was unjust and was so regarded by the commission.  Again, I urge the Minister to accept the amendment which is designed to cover particular cases and to give the same rights to those who are affected and who are not covered as to those who will be covered because of the time at which the leases expire.</P>

      <P>I support strongly this amendment, the adoption of which would finally bring to a close the disgraceful position in respect of the tenants of the Proby Estate.  The amendment would give general coverage and would remedy the very serious injustices to which the tenants have been subjected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the Labour Party welcomed the latest report of the Conroy Commission and we were glad that they advocated the repeal of subsection (c) of section 10 of the 1958 Act.  This subsection disqualified the building leases on the Proby Estate and deprived tenants of their rights to purchase the freehold at the well-known 14 times their ground rent.  These tenants were deprived also of their right to arbitration under subsection (1) of section 18 of the 1967 Act.  It must be placed on record again that while the Conroy Commission were preparing their recommendations on the 1967 Act&mdash;this is the nub of the problem in many ways&mdash;Mr. Peter Proby, that well-known Irishman from Eton, issued ejection proceedings against the tenants holding on their expired leases but they refused his <Col N="114" /> demands for full market value of the house, the price of freehold or about £240 per year ground rent for a 21year lease.</P>
    <P>The issuing of ejectment proceedings in some cases brought the threat of eviction on almost every tenant on the estate whose lease had expired or was about to expire.  The result of this was that under this particularly odious form of duress about 80 per cent of the tenants settled for exorbitant rents, and, as we are aware, the report now embodied in legislation states that any tenant who settled is deprived of the benefits of the proposed amendments. This shows a complete disregard for the plight of tenants who sought redress in the courts but who were forced to settle on the landlord's terms.  This is no Irish phenomenon in terms of property relationships.  They were forced to settle on the estate's terms so that they would have a roof over their heads; but, having done so, they are deprived of the general benefits of the law of the land.</P>
    <P>The Minister advances two reasons as to why he is not prepared to give coverage to the remaining Proby Estate tenants.  He says that in principle he is opposed to retrospective legislation. I remember spending many a weary hour in this House, in the total absence of the Fianna Fáil trade union group, trying to persuade the Minister for Labour to allow retrospection on the Redundancy Payments Act.  Again, in principle, the Minister concerned told us he could not possibly agree to retrospection.  However, within six months he gave us substantial retrospection on that legislation.  The amendments proposed by Deputy Cosgrave and supported by us would meet the wishes of the Proby Estate Tenants' Association and more particularly the wishes of those who are badly done by.  It has been the best part of seven years since the majority of Proby leases expired.  Unfortunately, the period recommended by the Minister is only five years.  There is nothing sacrosanct about five years and the Minister could accept the amendment. No great loss would accrue to the Proby Estate as such.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> Any tenant with a lease under 50 years does not qualify for the purchase of freehold under the proposed amendment. That position should be remedied.  Any tenant whose ground rent is greater than his valuation does not qualify for the purchase of freehold under the proposed amendment. On these scores a good many of the tenants of the Proby Estate are disqualified. Specific instances have been given to the Minister.  Like Deputy Cosgrave on Second Stage I have no desire to name any tenant.  This is an issue of principle.  However, there have been cases of hardship.  I know of two cases which could be fully vouched for.  The information is in the hands of the Minister and he has the opportunity of redressing the situation.</P>
    <P>Tenants whose leases expired in or around 1965 and whose leases were for a term of over 50 years, with ground rent less than their valuation and who had to accept the new short leases at exorbitant ground rents under threat of eviction, should be granted the right to purchase freehold.  I do not think such tenants should be the victims of legislation which has been a long time coming before this House, which is welcomed, and which has been handled very competently by the Minister, if I may say so as a non-lawyer.  I am glad he has brought in this legislation and I am glad that he is not as obdurate as his predecessor, Deputy Ó Moráin, was in relation to representations we made.  Deputy Ó Moráin somehow or other got a bee in his bonnet when we raised this matter and I remember him assuring us here before he was retired that the Fianna Fáil Party had a record which no party could ever hope to touch if they lived for 1,000 years, in dealing with ground rents and landlords. Now is the opportunity for the Fianna Fáil Party to put their principles&mdash;if one might use the crude political term&mdash;where their attitudes of republicanism have been, because when one considers the Proby Estate one must put on record in relation to this amendment that this is an 800acre estate of the rack-renting successors&mdash;the Probys being the successors&mdash;to the Earl of Carysfort including <Col N="116" /> their particular rack-tenting, accumulative, very questionable ownership of lands in the Dalkey area, parts of Sandycove, in Dún Laoghaire, into Blackrock and right up to where I live in Stillorgan.  Their ownership of the land in that area and the leases they have on it, which they have tenaciously held on to, was ironically defended by the former Minister and the present Minister, to my surprise, says that constitutionally he is obliged to defend it.  Coming from a Fianna Fáil Minister I find that rather hard to stomach.  I have before me the endorsement of claim issued to one of the tenants.  I think it is relevant to this amendment.  It is the plaintiff's claim for possession.  This is one of the tenants who was obliged to fix up. He fixed up under duress.  The case is that of Peter Proby and Mr. Boland. It says:</P>
    <P>The plaintiff's claim for possession of the lands of all that part of the lands of Sandycove with the house and premises thereon known as No. &mdash;Ballygihen Ave., Dún Laoghaire in the Barony of Rathdown and County of Dublin, lately held by the Defendant as tenant to the Plaintiff under an indenture of lease made 1st day of Dec. 1905 between the Right Honourable William, Earl of Carysfort of the one part and Michael Doyle of the other part&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>In effect the few remaining leases where grave injustice has been done seem to be defended by the Minister under this piece of legislation.  The Minister has said that where a tenant made a contract he cannot break the contract.  The point is, if I may point it out to a party who signed a treaty apparently under grave duress in the history of this State, these tenants had no option but to sign the contracts or have the roofs removed from over their heads. Having entered into renewals under duress I do not think the Minister should be unduly worried about the constitutional rights of the Probys, of the family who have questionably inherited this extensive piece of property. They have not done too badly. I recall that in 1968 or thereabouts for well over £500,000 they sold 4½ acres in the South City Market estate to a London property speculator.  They <Col N="117" /> can hardly cry that they are in urgent need of a few shillings from the tenants of the Proby area.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accept the amendment and in good republican style take another look at the individual cases involved.  It would be interesting to see the boys travelling over from Eton to the Supreme Court to defend the constitutionality of how they came into possession of this piece of property in the first instance.  It might be an interesting piece of election propaganda for the Minister in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The sympathy one would feel with tenants of the Proby Estate and that would be engendered in one either by one's own knowledge of the circumstances or by what Deputy Cosgrave said tonight, becomes very rapidly whittled away when one has to listen to the sort of contribution we have just had.  It is a pity it is not possible to discuss even a technical matter like this without having that type of speech aimed at the gallery and aimed elsewhere, which betrays a complete ignorance of what is involved in the Bill and in the amendment but seeks to make a point at somebody's expense.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat taken aback when I read Deputy Cosgrave's amendment for the first time last night because the two proposals in this amendment are the direct opposite of the recommendations of the commission; in other words they recommend the very things that the commission recommended should not be done.  Where the commission recommended a lease of 50 years or more Deputy Cosgrave proposes 50 years or less.  Similarly with regard to the question of ground rent and PLV. The amendment says:</P>
      <P>Any tenant holding on a lease under fifty years shall be entitled to purchase the freehold, notwithstanding anything in any enactments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meaning of that is that any tenant, therefore, holding under any sort of instrument for any period of time, even as short as a week, would become entitled to buy out the freehold. I do not think Deputy Cosgrave intended that but I am afraid that <Col N="118" /> would be a consequence.  Similarly in regard to paragraph (b) of amendment No. 5, which says:</P>
    <P>Any tenant whose ground rent is greater than the Poor Law Valuation of the property shall be entitled to purchase the freehold.</P>
    <P>That means a very great many.  It does not cover the sort of situation envisaged by the commission where a sort of informal definition or extralegal definition of ground rent was achieved whereby a rent is a ground rent if it is less than the PLV.  Strictly speaking, there is no such thing at law as a ground rent.  They are all rents. But, by usage, a sort of small rent on a property that is held for a very long time became known as a ground rent and I think it has evolved in recent years that it is generally known as a ground rent if it is less than the PLV and, of course, it is in the vast majority of cases of this type.  In Dublin a house held under a long lease, say, 999 years, might have a PLV of £30 and a ground rent of £20 or thereabouts. The effect, therefore, of (b) would be really almost the same as (a), that it would give any tenant who pays more in rent than the valuation of his property the right to purchase the freehold and in my view that would be practically every tenant, including, of course, weekly tenants, because if you rent, for example, a small shop at £5 a week, that would be £260 a year.  The valuation of that small shop might be £10, possibly £15; the rent would clearly exceed the valuation.</P>
    <P>I do not think, therefore, that Deputy Cosgrave could have intended this sort of consequence because it would mean that practically every piece of property in Ireland that is occupied by a tenant, whether weekly, monthly, or yearly, or held on a 999 year lease, could be compulsorily bought out under the Ground Rents Act, 1967, for 13 times the annual rent or thereabouts and I do not think that that was envisaged.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the figure that was somewhat wildly given by Deputy Desmond, that up to 80 per cent of the Proby tenants were forced to settle with the estate.  This is not so.  In fact, <Col N="119" /> the figure is probably between nine and 12.  Some of them have not come forward to make any fuss about it but I understand the figure lies between nine and 12.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave made what I might call a general speech that would cover really more than one amendment but the type of amendment he wants in order to cover that sort of person is, he will agree, not just on, for very obvious reasons.  I looked at this thing as sympathetically as I could because, as well as having heard from Deputy Cosgrave on it, I have heard a number of times from Deputy Andrews about the problems suffered by these people. I am afraid that the best I can do is to say that, while the present amendment before us is valueless and, in fact, would have incredible implications, I could accept and do propose to accept the next one.  I think the one after that was put down by Deputy Cosgrave on the understanding that it might be consequential on the one before but, for reasons I will explain, in fact, it is not; it is a separate matter.  By accepting amendment No. 6, I may get some of these people&mdash;there are not many of them&mdash;out of their difficulty and without running into the more obvious dangers of trying to set aside executed contracts.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out to me by Deputy Andrews and by others that, because this report came out some time in 1968 and a five-year period was recommended in respect of that, a lot of people thought the five years ran back from there and they did not understand, because not many people understand much about this sort of law, that it would of course have to run back from the enactment of the Bill and, in order to preserve what they thought was their position, it would not be any great injustice to anyone to add the three years and make the &ldquo;five&rdquo;&ldquo;eight&rdquo;.  I will accept that and will get some of the people out of their difficulty but I know Deputy Cosgrave will agree with me that some are gone beyond salvation in the sense that unless one sets aside the whole concept of contract and executed contract, one could not <Col N="120" /> do anything for the very small remaining number, probably under nine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said.  In fact, I think it was he himself who made the point earlier, on some amendment or section, that the &ldquo;or&rdquo; applies only at the end. In fact, what I was endeavouring to do, at comparatively short notice and with somewhat inadequate legal briefing, as distinct from briefing about the facts, was to design amendments that would ensure that I would achieve what would result in preserving the position of those tenants who were adversely affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate fully that amendment No. 5 as drafted is wider than anything that probably would be necessary, but it was put down in order to cover the situation and to enable the whole question to be discussed, because there is here the problem that the Minister adverted to at the end of his remarks: that this report when it was produced was understood and accepted by a number of the tenants concerned to apply from the date of its presentation or furnishing.  There is an added difficulty in at least two cases, the case that was referred to, of Mr. Boland, and the case of a Mr. Pentony who is an elderly person.  It so happens that almost all the tenants in this case are fairly advanced in years but in Mr. Boland's case he is a married man with a young family.  In those two cases they were obliged to settle because of the time at which their leases fell in. The Minister will appreciate that difficulties arose here, in respect of reversionary leases and in respect of building leases.  A great difficulty arose because it was impossible to prove, and I think it was accepted all round that there was no proof, that the landlord or his predecessor in title built the houses in question.  In fact, many years ago a leaseholders' organisation that covered a good part of the Proby Estate dealt with this because different parts of the estate had houses erected on it by different builders at different times.  The Proby Estate is a very vast one.  It covers lands in Sandycove, Dalkey, Dún Laoghaire, on to Bray and back down to Stillorgan.  Most of <Col N="121" /> the Bray end of it was developed at a much later period.  The particular portion with which we are concerned was developed at an earlier period and the substitution of eight for five would possibly cover most of those involved.</P>
    <P>I accept Deputy Fitzpatrick's view that the draftsman available to the Minister may be in a better position to frame an amendment to cover the cases in question without broadening the section to such an extent as to include those who could not justifiably be included and without extending the objectives we seek to achieve in these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make a further plea to the Minister in respect of the cases pinpointed by Deputy Cosgrave and referred to earlier by me. I do not think anyone can deny that these particular contracts were signed. The Minister may sneer at &ldquo;Deputy Desmond's legal expertise&rdquo; but no political party can claim to be extra-constitutional. The Minister comes in here and says he is advised that any such exercise by him would run into serious constitutional difficulty.  Where, I should like to know, in my total ignorance, would constitutional difficulty arise for the Minister?  Why is he not prepared to test it or allow those who would test it to do so?  Why not find out how anxious they are to expose themselves to public odium?  A grave injustice is being perpetrated on both Mr. Patrick Boland and Mr. Vincent Pentony the two outstanding cases which will not be covered by substituting eight for five years.  Their case has been well documented.  They were unfortunate enough to give in to the Proby Estate and now the Minister washes his hands of them.  Contracts were executed but the Minister knows the circumstances under which they were executed.  He should be able to draft an appropriate amendment to relieve their position.  I do not think this is as complicated as the Minister thinks.  Lawyers are too ready to assume complications where none exist.  Even if there are complications there is no reason why they should not be overcome.  I would strongly urge the Minister to consider the amendment. All we seek to do is to ameliorate <Col N="122" /> the position of these tenants.  I make no apology to anyone for seeking full redress for them.  This has gone on long enough and it is time the Minister exercised his power and authority in respect of these tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not intend to argue in depth or in detail the problems of the Proby Estate tenants, but it is clear to me that some of these tenants were forced into the unfortunate position of having to come to terms and sign contracts at a time when a change in the law in their favour was under consideration, when the commission were sitting and when, I think, legislation was actually being drafted.  There is a real hardship.  If there is any way out, then the Minister should resolve the problem once and for all.  This has been simmering for a long time and agitation has gone on over a number of years.  The Minister has backdated the Bill to the date when the Government announcement was made last year in order to avoid anyone jumping the gun or taking an unfair advantage of the sports clubs.</P>
      <P>The Minister has gone a considerable distance to solving the problem by accepting Deputy Cosgrave's amendment increasing the period from five years to eight years.  This is welcome. It is a good thing but it will be frustrating to those who will now be excluded.  The number will be few but these are the people who feel they have a real grievance and suffered a grave injustice.  If it was evident, as it probably was, that the law was about to be changed at the time when these people were forced to sign these contracts in order to retain their houses, then I would not have much sympathy for the landlords who reaped this unfair bonanza.  A case can be made, I think, for retrospective legislation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave's amendments&mdash; he freely admits it&mdash;were put down to enable him to argue the case.  He has argued the case admirably and the amendments are a move in the right direction.  Many of the landlords involved purchased the houses 50 or 70 years ago for paltry sums, hundreds of pounds.  They have not since spent one brass farthing on them.  They never occupied them.  They now find themselves, <Col N="123" /> as the law stands, entitled to charge a rent of more per year than they originally paid for the houses.</P>
    <P>That is unreasonable.  With all due respects to the Conroy Commission it is running more or less in favour of those people and is accepting that market rents should be payable to landlords on the expiration of the leases although those landlords, as I say, purchased these houses 50, 70 and 80 years ago for little or nothing and have never spent a penny on them since.  This is like striking gold as far as landlords are concerned.</P>
    <P>I made a suggestion the other day that leases should be renewed on the basis of reversionary leases on a charge of a sixth or an eighth of the market rent.  Maybe I went too far in stipulating a sixth or an eighth, perhaps the landlord should reap some reasonable benefit by way of an increase in the rents, but the rents should not be increased by 500 or 600 per cent as is the case at the moment.</P>
    <P>Some of these landlords engaged in property speculation.  They bought these tenanted dwellings ten or 12 years ago for little or nothing in the knowledge that the leases would be falling in and they could cash in on the falling of the lease and charge a very high rent.  That is an anti-national and anti-social approach to the landlord and tenant code.  I hope the Minister will have a general look at the type of case I have in mind.  The case of the landlord who has owned a property for 60 or 80 years is bad enough but even worse is the case of somebody seeing leases with ten years to run and buying them over the heads of the tenants and then when the leases expire going to court and getting fancy rents fixed.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that in the particular measure we are dealing with &mdash;I do not know whether it is for the first time or not, but it is certainly a move in the right direction&mdash;section 6 stipulates that one of the considerations which the court should be able to take into account in fixing the rent is the price paid by the landlord for the property.  I would invite the Minister and the Conroy Commission to <Col N="124" /> write that into future legislation because it will prevent exploitation of tenants or speculation in tenanted property, I do not think that is too strong an expression.  By &ldquo;speculation in tenanted property&rdquo; I mean purchasing tenanted property whether it is tenanted for the purpose of a residence or the purpose of a business in the knowledge that leases are shortly to expire and then going to court and having the rent considerably increased by 300, 400, 500 and 600 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister has shown considerable sympathy for these Proby Estate tenants. I hope he will tidy up the whole mess and ensure that justice is done to these tenants.  He may have this difficult problem of interfering with binding contracts and creating a precedent, but if an examination shows that these contracts were executed under duress at a time when both the landlord and the tenant knew that the law was in the process of being changed in favour of the tenant, but where the tenant in order to retain possession had no option but to accept the landlord's terms, the Minister could probably make a case for an exceptional amendment or exceptional legislation.</P>

      <P>I wanted to make sure it covered any case affected by the other.  The Minister is familiar with what happens in these cases.  This applied to a limited number of cases because of the time at which the leases under which they held expired. The 1958 Act did not cover them; the Conroy Commission were sitting and prior to the commission's report a number of these tenants had to come to terms.  Because of the fight that was put up by a small number of people&mdash; the two who were put in a very serious position were Mr. Boland and Mr. Pentony&mdash;the Proby Estate gave an undertaking to the commission that no ejection proceedings would be taken or that any proceedings would be held pending the enactment of the amending legislation.  Because of the delay in getting it drafted time has gone by.  The Minister has agreed to the substitution of eight years for five years and I think that amendment will cover all these cases.  This is the proposal that has been put to me by the tenants concerned.  I only hope it covers all of the cases with the exception of a couple of them.  In any event, I presume it covers them now.  I was anxious to ensure that the same rights would apply in respect of some others because there is a difficulty.</P>
      <P>The position of some of these leases was raised at the commission.  There is doubt that they were building leases. There is certainly a doubt as to who built them, whether it was the landlord or his predecessor in title, and that complicates the matter.  There is some obscurity about the particular legal rights and certainly at one stage some of the tenants had difficulty in getting adequate documentary evidence of title.  It is for that reason that I included this in the second amendment but if the Minister is satisfied that it is not necessary and is so advised I am prepared to accept that.  There is no doubt that some of these tenants had considerable difficulty in getting evidence of title and I was anxious to ensure that their rights are preserved but it may not be necessary.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Section 4 (3) of the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1967, which provides a time-limit for applications under section 8 of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, shall, in so far as it affects applications under subsection (1A) (inserted by section 4 (1) of the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1967) of the said section 8, have effect as if for `two years from the passing of this Act' there were substituted `one year from the passing of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1971'.</P>
      <P>(2) A rent determined under section 8 (1A) of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, shall be payable with effect from the date of the determination.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to revive for a period of one year the spent provisions contained in section 8 (1A) of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960. Subsection (1A) was inserted in section 8 of the 1960 Act by section 4 (1) of the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) <Col N="127" /> Act, 1967, and in accordance with section 4 (3) of the 1967 Act it had a life of only two years which expired on 8th May, 1969.  This amendment will enable what may be described as small landlords to have certain basic rents revised during the period of one year from the date of the enactment of this Bill into law.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of section 8 (1A) of the 1960 Rent Act, which this amendment proposes to revive, the District Court will be authorised to review the basic rent on an application by a landlord who owns not more than six controlled houses or self-contained flats with a combined valuation not exceeding £60, in case one at least of them is situated in the Dublin area, or £40, in any other case.  The landlord will be liable for the tenant's costs in the District Court, unless that court considers it proper, having regard in particular to the means of the landlord and the tenant, to order otherwise.  The rent, if adjusted by the court, is to be of such amount as the court considers reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case, but, in particular, to the necessity of avoiding financial hardship to the tenant and the landlord.  It is not to exceed the maximum rent which would be fixed on the renewal of the tenancy under Part III of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.  Only a landlord who owned the premises on 8th June, 1966, that is the date of introduction of the Bill that was enacted into law as the 1967 Rent Act, will benefit from the reactivation of section 8 (1A).  The court will be enabled to deal privately with the whole or any part of an application under the revived provision.  The parties may also agree among themselves on a new basic rent.  The court may, however, alter a rent so agreed, on the application of either party within three months after the service of notice of the agreed rent, where it is established that he has become aware since the agreement that the financial circumstances of the other party at the time of the agreement were substantially better than those by reference to which the agreement was reached. <Col N="128" /> The reactivation for a period of one year of the spent provisions contained in section 8 (1A) of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, will give those small landlords who satisfy the necessary conditions and who are in poor financial circumstances another opportunity to have basic rents revised. Representations have been made to my Department to the effect that many small landlords who would have benefited under the provisions of section 8 (1A) during the two year period when it was in operation failed to do so because they were unaware of its existence.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As the Minister has said, this provision of the 1967 Act enabled small landlords to have their rents adjusted up to 9th May, 1969.  Unfortunately many of the landlords did not appreciate their position and did not move to avail of this section until it expired. If I might say so at this stage this section is a desirable type of section for a number of reasons.  It directs the court to take into consideration the circumstances of the tenants and the circumstances of the landlord.  It specifies that unless the landlord held the house on a date in 1966 he cannot avail of this section, in other words, people cannot come in, buy houses and then move to have the rent adjusted under this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, indeed, some landlords who will benefit considerably by the Minister's action in extending the time for availing of this particular section. On the Second Stage I drew the Minister's attention to the fact that the Bill as then drafted did not deal with section 4 (3) of the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1967, and I pointed out that I understood representations had been made to him from many quarters.  The Minister felt in a difficulty then because he felt this was a Landlord and Tenant Bill whereas the problem with which I was urging him to deal was a rent restrictions problem. I told the Minister I would put down an amendment and I have done so, the effect of which would be more or less the same as that of the Minister's <Col N="129" /> amendment.  It might give two years instead of one from the passage of this Bill to apply to the court but I think one year will be sufficient.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister for getting over that procedural difficulty which might have been presented to him and for disregarding the fact that this amendment might be more appropriately dealt with in another Bill but in a Bill which may not come before us for a number of years.  The Minister has shown himself to be big enough in this respect to say that this amendment should be made in this Bill, whether it is technically the right place to make it or not.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out on Second Stage he had the precedent in that the Bill dealt with one rent restrictions matter in section 10.  The Minister's amendment completely meets the point of my amendment.  I would like to think that I prompted the Minister to put down this amendment but in saying that I am not saying it in any begrudging way.  When what was wrong was drawn to the Minister's attention he remedied the flaw in the previous Act, or at least extended the time for availing of the provisions of the previous Act.  I thank the Minister for doing so and I shall withdraw amendment No.9 on the House accepting amendment No.8.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>Before section 10 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any tenant who held under a twenty-one year lease prior to the enactment of this Act, and who previously held under a long lease, shall now be entitled to purchase the freehold, or be entitled to a renewal on the terms of the original lease.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to cover cases like some of those we have been discussing.  The Minister is aware that there were a number of cases&mdash; in particular there were two&mdash;which were the subject of action by the landlord and where the tenants had to take renewals of leases on onerous terms. <Col N="130" /> Their difficulty arose because of a defect in the 1958 Act and the fact that the 1967 Act had not been enacted when the leases in question expired in 1965.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to cover cases where leases expired at that time and which were for a term of more than 50 years and regarded as long leases.  They had ground rents, or rents as the Minister described as less than the poor law valuation and, because of the circumstances, they had to accept new short leases at exorbitant ground rents under threat of eviction. As was said here on a number of times, because of action taken by a few and the attendant publicity, and the fact that the matter was brought before the commission and in some cases before the courts, no further action was taken in respect of other tenants or was not taken in the terms of the amended legislation.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that the tenants in question either be granted the right to purchase the freehold or be entitled to a renewal on the terms of the original lease, namely, the purchase of the freehold on the terms of the 1967 Act or a renewal on the terms of the original lease.  A strong case can be made, namely, that the people concerned were the victims of a defect in the earlier legislation despite their long leases and it is for the purpose of covering them that I have drafted this amendment. Like the other amendments it had to be drafted with the time factor limiting the opportunity for full investigation of the precise terms but it is designed to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments that applied to amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7 could be applied to this also and the problem is the same.  However, we may have reduced the numbers involved to a mere handful.  One point that strikes me about the amendment is that it would give the right to purchase the freehold but, as I understand it, at least one of the two people mentioned who are in the more extreme difficulties purchased the freehold and, therefore, the amendment would not be of any use to him.  I do not know, but it may be that the other man did the same <Col N="131" /> thing.  It may be that we have reduced the problem to these two people but beyond that we cannot go for the reasons I have given.  This would be an even more blatant setting aside of an executed contract: there would be a conveyance of the fee simple executed and registered and so on, or there would be an executed and registered lease for 21 years or whatever period. It would not be just a matter of setting aside the contract but it would be a matter of setting aside the whole title and I could not see that ever standing up.  I am sure Deputy Cosgrave will appreciate that it would create a most undesirable precedent.  If it were possible to do it in this instance to benefit the people involved we might all be agreeable to do this, but the House must ask itself if we can afford the risk of setting such a precedent in our legislation.  I do not believe we can, not because I think that it would be wrong to do it here in anything other than a constitutional sense but it would give all kinds of people the right to ask us to do it again in other cases.  One does not need much imagination to visualise some of the cases where there might be pressure for it to be done.</P>

      <P>It is important to bear in mind in regard to this and <Col N="132" /> the other amendments that if the sympathy the Minister is now displaying had been shown in the earlier part of 1969 we should not be facing this impasse now.  The Minister's predecessor said that the tenants were getting good value for their money when they signed the contracts and he did not display much sympathy for them.  If the Government had been prepared to say to the Proby Estate that they should desist from insisting on the signing of such contracts we should not have this situation now.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that the &ldquo;mere handful&rdquo; to whom the Minister has referred are the people&mdash; Mr. Patrick E. Boland and Mr. Vincent Pentony in particular&mdash;whose rights are still not recognised by the Minister's acceptance of Deputy Cosgrave's amendment.  Were it not for their agitation and for the fact that they persistently exposed the severe injustices which have become public knowledge and which gained a good deal of notoriety, it is unlikely that any amelioration of their position would have been conceded in this Bill. The minimum assurance we might receive from the Minister is that on the passage of this Bill he might write to Mr. Proby in Eton&mdash;&mdash;</P>

While we appreciate the Minister's constitutional difficulties, he should seek redress on behalf of Irish people who have been badly treated.  Indeed, this raises the whole question to which Deputy Fitzpatrick referred, namely, the moral justification of ground rents.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I agree with the Minister when he says that Deputy Cosgrave's amendment is not confined to cases on the Proby Estate or to the Proby Estate at all.  I rise to support the thinking behind the amendment.  It proposes to move in the direction of enabling tenants or lessees to purchase their landlord's interest. I want to make it perfectly clear that I do not stand for confiscation in any shape or form.  I believe these purchases should be made on reasonable and on equitable terms which would take into consideration the investment of the landlord in the property and that would enable the tenant to buy out on fair and reasonable terms.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentions in connection with this amendment the case of a person holding under a 21-year lease who might have held under a 99-year lease which expired before the coming into operation of the Ground Rents Act.  I do not think such a person is entitled to purchase out.  He would have been entitled if he were holding under a 99-year lease and if there were at least 25 years to run, but he may have held under such a 99-year lease which has expired and may have got a 21-year lease in place of it.  It would be reasonable that such a person should be able to buy out as if he had held under the 99-year lease.  I think the trend should be towards enabling people in occupation of dwellings as tenants or lessees to purchase out those buildings on reasonable and equitable terms, that legislation should be introduced to enable such lessees or tenants to purchase out on reasonable and equitable terms and, failing agreement between the landlord and the occupier, that such terms should be fixed by the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now apparently reduced what I would call the Proby problem to two distinct cases but two cases which present the Minister with constitutional problems and with the question of setting up what he considers dangerous precedents which might be availed of by other people to say: &ldquo;We are entitled to similar treatment.&rdquo;  One does not like using this House to appeal to individuals to <Col N="134" /> do justice, especially when they acted as the law permitted them to act when they so acted.  Nevertheless, this problem of the Proby Estate has been, to my own personal knowledge, cropping up in this House from time to time over the years.  If it is all going to be solved now with the exception of the cases of two people who will go into their graves believing they have been robbed and been the subject of injustice, I would like to add my voice to those of Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Desmond and indeed the Minister in saying that perhaps the owners of the estate might close the chapter by meeting&mdash;I shall not use the word &ldquo;restitution&rdquo; because that might be considered offensive&mdash;these two people who are caught in the trap, by making some payment to them or some compromise with them.  That would close the matter in a dignified, honourable and just way.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Section 10 of the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1967, had effects which were never foreseen by the framers of the section, by the Minister who piloted it through this House or by the Deputies here.  It provided, in effect, that a person could not sell or assign or transfer the house in which he resided without the consent of the landlord.  That apparently had not previously been the law, and immediately the 1967 Act came into force the absurdity of the provision was seen by the legal profession and they immediately drew it to the attention of the Minister's predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also saw that the effects of the section went much further than intended. <Col N="135" /> A promise was given to remedy it at the first opportunity.  Even in matters of urgency it can take much time&mdash;from 1967 to 1971&mdash;to make good a defect like this.  My amendment invites the Minister to go further.  It would enable a person to sell his house without the lessor's consent, but it does not help a man who has his house let for years and ultimately gets possession on the death of the tenant or accepting a lump sum on giving up possession. In such a case he will have to get consent of the lessor unless he goes and resides in the house.  That is the effect of the section.  Section 10 of the Bill reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  Section 10 of the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1967 (which imposes a restriction on the assignment of controlled dwellings) shall be deemed never to have applied to a house which is occupied for the purposes of his own residence by a person who holds it under a lease the term of which is more than twenty-one years. </P>
    <P>That means that, if a person holds a house under a lease for 999 years and has that house let to a tenant, he cannot sell it or assign it without the consent of the landlord because he is not in occupation.  It would also mean that if the landlord were to buy out the tenant or the tenant were to surrender the house or to die leaving no one in the house or if the landlord were to purchase the tenant's interest in the house he still would have to get the consent of his head landlord if he wanted to sell unless he went and took up residence in the house. That is as I understand the section and how an experienced practitioner in this city understands it.  The case has been made that it is absurd that a man holding a lease for 999 years at £5 cannot give a valid assignment without the consent of the lessor. It is difficult to believe that the framers of the Act of 1967 meant to impose such a restriction.</P>
    <P>My amendment will provide that a person who holds under a lease, the term of which is more than 100 years, can assign or sell or transfer without the consent of the head landlord <Col N="136" /> whether he is in occupation or not. That is the case which has been put to me and I accept it and would be glad to hear the Minister's views on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>When I read the amendment I could not see what precise point it was getting at.  It seemed to me to be designed to free the restriction which exists under the Rents Acts on the assignment of controlled dwellings.  This is one effect of it. Having heard Deputy Fitzpatrick I see that he intended the amendment to do something else but, as often happens, the amendment would have an unintended effect because the effect would be to lift considerably the restrictions on the assignment of controlled dwellings.  Deputy Fitzpatrick knows that one of the consequences of that would be to give rights to an enormous number of people who never thought they had rights and to deprive owners who had an expectation of a reversion on the death of a controlled tenant or on a controlled tenant leaving voluntarily, of getting possession. If the words are added &ldquo;which is occupied by a tenant of the lessee where the lessee holds under a lease the term of which is more than 100 years&rdquo; the net effect of what would be done might be to remove the restriction on assignment of a controlled dwelling wherever the head landlord holds under a lease on the term of 100 years or more even though he might have only a year to go.</P>

If A holds a house for 100 years and <Col N="137" /> he occupies the house as the Bill stands he can sell it without the consent of his landlord.  I take it that is clear.  The same A holds a house for 100 years but he has let the house to B.  A cannot sell his interest in the house without the consent of his landlord because it is let to B.  It is even worse than that because he cannot sell to B, his tenant, without the landlord's consent.  That is the position I want to remedy through this amendment.</P>
      <P>A holds from X under a letting for 100 years and he is living in the house. He can sell it to anybody he likes without the consent of X, if the amendment goes through.  But if instead of A living in the house he lets it to W he cannot sell subject to W's tenancy without the consent of X.</P>

      <P>Before progress was reported on the Estimate I was anxious to place on record my tribute to Radio Éireann and to dedicated men like Ciarán Mac Mathúna and Séamus Ennis who during the years, in spite of tremendous adversity, in spite of the fact that at the time of their labours Irish music was not fashionable, continued to cover the length and breadth of Ireland in their travels.  No mountain was too high for them and no valley too steep.  They went and sought out in the crevasses of Ireland that which was best in our music, both instrumental and vocal.  Later on it was fortunate that we had artists of the calibre of Seán Ó Riada who, with those men, was able to dress and to modernise this music and bring it to the place of prominence it now enjoys not only in the cities and towns of Ireland but in Europe and, generally speaking, internationally.</P>
      <P>What they achieved is an indication of the power of the radio and though we may be critical of Radio Éireann in other matters, as far as I am concerned that achievement tends to eliminate a lot of it and I am inclined to forgive Radio Éireann for what I might think of as other shortcomings. The pity is that the same success does not attend the efforts that have been made in the matter of the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I am not without appreciating that in this respect Irish radio and television have played <Col N="139" /> a part.  However, I must express a personal regret in the matter of Irish programmes or, rather, programmes in the Irish language.  I am mildly disappointed that a programme of the importance of &ldquo;Féach,&rdquo; a programme in the Irish language about matters of public interest, has of late changed slightly and has become a programme on which there are far too many: it has now become a platform on which there are far too many people talking not in but about the Irish language. I want as far as possible to hear people on radio and television and in this House and elsewhere talking not so much about as in the Irish language. I suggest that Irish radio and television should take heart from what has been achieved by radio in the matter of Irish music.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention a matter which is of concern to my constituents but which I appreciate is a problem in regard to other constituencies.  I refer to what is known locally as &ldquo;children's allowance day&rdquo;.  That in Dublin is the day on which mothers go to collect what they look on as being an entitlement of motherhood.  Under the law this money is payable to them on a certain date and while they are not obliged to collect it most of them feel obliged to do so.  That places a heavy pressure of work on the local post office.</P>
    <P>I have made inquiries in the Department occasionally on this matter and the reply is understandable, that it is difficult to organise for what is an exceptional day in the post office in that area.  On the other hand, since these women are entitled to collect the money on that particular day, they are entitled to collect it in the same circumstances and comfort as people who do not need to collect it until some time later.  I am asking the Minister, in post offices where the figures show this exceptional volume of work occurs, to examine the situation and if possible provide adequate temporary staff so that we will not have mothers queueing up on public thoroughfares with the appearance of being there to collect something to which they are <Col N="140" /> not entitled.  One is more mindful of this at the present time of the year and until next March or so during the inclement weather.  If people are entitled to this money they should get it without any suggestion of charity or anything tending to detract from human dignity or to increase hardship on these people.</P>
    <P>Now I wish to refer to a political programme.  I have always spoken my mind here maintaining a certain balance between compliment and criticism. If I think compliments are deserved I pay compliments and if I think criticism is merited I criticise.  Each of us is entitled to his own ideas about programmes.  I suppose politicians are especially sensitive to programmes dealing with politics.  Generally speaking, I am impressed by reports I get&mdash;one is not always at home&mdash;of &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; and also by what I hear of &ldquo;This Week in the Dáil&rdquo;.  This was because the commentators and those presenting these programmes appear as questioners and commentators rather than interrogators.  There is a subtle difference. In this searching programme questions are put in a nice, calm and cool manner; they are not, in my opinion, put in with a view to placing any politician irrespective of party under the necessity of being on guard and suspecting that somebody is hunting him.  Because of that, the programme brings out the best in politicians. There is much good in politicians but the tragedy is that often because of the attitude of somebody asking questions we do not get the best but the worst in politicians.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope and I know the Minister will treat this matter in the manner in which I present it to him.  I have a special interest in Gaeltacht areas.  I do not represent one but, to me, the Gaeltacht areas are very important ones.  I am personally annoyed and disappointed when I read of any disharmony in any Gaeltacht area.  I am not familiar with the details but recently I have read and heard a certain amount regarding Litir Mór post office. I should like to have the benefit of the Minister's comment on that position. He is responsible for all post <Col N="141" /> offices irrespective of location and I trust he will enlighten me on the problem which exists in Litir Mór.</P>

      <P>For some years past, through the Estimate for the Minister's Department and more often through question and answer in the Dáil I have been addressing different Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs on the subject of the annoyance people in my home town of Fermoy and that district have suffered because of bad television reception there.  This was a great source of annoyance to the people I represent and I put their grievances clearly and fully in this House.  Various Ministers were annoyed with me because I persisted in my argument.  In fairness to the present Minister he said some time ago, in reply to a Parliamentary Question of mine, that the injustice, as I described it and the faulty reception as he described it, would be soon remedied.  I am glad to say that the matter has now been rectified and on behalf of the people of Fermoy and district I thank the Minister for that. It may not be often that Members on opposite sides of the House pay tributes across the floor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and that is all the more reason for bringing up my next subject&mdash;multi-channel television. I take up this matter not only on behalf of the people of Cork but on behalf also of the people of Limerick, Waterford, Clare and Tipperary. People in these counties have been voicing their annoyance at the Minister's indifference towards them on the question of multi-channel television. They say he is not allowing them to be able to avail of the same facilities in this respect as are available to those living in Dublin and on the east coast generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night in Cork city there was a public meeting which was organised by the Cork Multi-Channel TV Campaign Committee and there is a report on the meeting in today's issue of <i>The Cork Examiner</i> from which I shall quote in a few moments.  Some months ago I attended a meeting of this committee. Subsequently I was one of <Col N="142" /> those appointed, together with other Deputies of Cork city and county, to make representations to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Like all Cork Deputies, I am a very patient man and, having spoken to the Minister on this question, I was happy enough.</P>
    <P>I am not an alarmist but because of what we in Cork describe as the differentiation between Dublin and Cork or, to put it another way, the differentiation between the east coast and the north as against the south and west, I believe that there is another Pale being created.  I wonder whether the Minister has read the report by Dick Brazil in today's <i>Cork Examiner</i> from which I now quote:</P>
    <P>There were amazing scenes outside a Cork hotel last night after a public meeting was called in a bid to bring multi-channel television to the south.  The meeting, organised by the Cork Multi-Channel TV Campaign Committee, drew one of the biggest crowds at the hotel for a meeting, and at one stage it was contemplated calling for Garda assistance.</P>
    <P>The committee called the meeting in protest against the refusal of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to grant a licence for multi-channel viewing in the greater part of the South of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Over 1,000 people turned up for the meeting, arranged for a room in the hotel&mdash;accommodation 80 people&mdash;and long traffic jams formed in the region of the meeting hall. After a short meeting, the committee were forced to abandon the meeting until a later date, because of the hundreds left outside.</P>
    <P>I shall not quote further but in the last paragraph of the article it is said that to date, 10,000 people have signed petitions in support of the campaign. The committee say they are looking for the same rights as those enjoyed by people in Dublin, in the counties on the eastern seaboard and in those bordering the Northern counties.  Last week-end it was reported in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs had told a Fianna Fáil <Col N="143" /> Deputy that it would not be long until there would be multi-channel television in the south.  I have no wish to embarrass the Minister but I should like him to tell us whether what that Deputy was reported as saying was true.  For myself, I am prepared to wait until such time as the Minister of the day, whether that Minister be Deputy Gerry Collins or Deputy Hogan O'Higgins or, perhaps, a member of the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If there is one thing that is disliked by people in the south of Ireland and particularly by Cork people it is to hear someone allege that they have information before any other has it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say in fairness to ex-Deputy <Col N="144" /> John Moher that during his time as a Member of the House we had an honourable arrangement whereby we always discussed together problems affecting our constituency.  He never let me down and I am sure he would be willing to say that I never let him down either.  I am wondering to what depths we have sunk in so far as Irish politics are concerned.  However, we in the south are entitled to know whether we are to have multi-channel television.  A certain Deputy says he has the assurance of the Minister on the matter. Are we, and when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I include, as well as myself, Deputies Liam Burke, Pearse Wyse, Seán French and Michael Pat Murphy, to be codded by a Fianna Fáil Deputy?  Are we to be codded by this amiable, blasé type of person?</P>
