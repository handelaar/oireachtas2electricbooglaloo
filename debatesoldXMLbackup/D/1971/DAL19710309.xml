      <P>and <b>Mr. Begley</b> asked the Minister for Health if he will state the simple procedure by which an Irish citizen can gather mussels in a river estuary, not recommended as a completely clear area, and treat them so as to make them fit for his personal consumption.</P>

      <P>The controls in the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950, regarding the treatment of mussels and other shellfish apply only when the shellfish are intended for sale for human consumption.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health or the local health authority have no functions in the matter where shellfish are being lifted by a person otherwise than for sale within the country.</P>
      <P>A chief medical officer would, however, I am sure be prepared to advise any person in his area as to the procedure to be followed in rendering shellfish fit for human consumption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health when the upward Income limit of £1,200 for general institutional and specialist services provided by local health authorities was set; and if he intends to increase it in line with the decrease in the value of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This limit has applied since September, 1965, in the case of persons insured under the Social Welfare Acts and since April, 1966, in the case of self-employed persons.  The issue as to what future limits should apply to such services is under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider adopting as a policy that income limits such as this should be adjusted annually as a matter of course in the light of changes in the cost of living?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>When the limit was raised to £1,200, an allowance was made presuming that there would be a reduction in the value of money for some considerable period.  I think it would be inadvisable to make annual changes because of administrative difficulties involved.  I can tell the Deputy that the matter is under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy himself calculates, he could arrive at the same conclusion.  He can ask a question about it.</P>

      <P>The limit was £600 in 1953, £800 in 1958 and it was made £1,200 in 1965-66.  In each case some allowance was made for presumed inflation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1959 to 1966 the functions of Ambassador to Belgium and of Head of Mission to the European Communities were performed by the one person.  With a view to the reactivation of this country's application for membership of the EEC and to the consequent stepping up of activity at Brussels it became necessary in October, 1966, to establish a separate Mission to the Communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have added to the Deputy's answer that this has not been negotiated as to the extent, area, and so forth of regional policy but there is nothing in the Community to prevent countries having regional policies of their own.  The Community have attempted so far to co-ordinate them.  Now they have gone a step further and hope to promote them by giving incentives of a community nature to country's policies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the generally accepted view in the Community that, so far as the member States are concerned, regional policy should be a shared concern of the national Governments and the Community itself.  It is, therefore, open to member Governments to pursue their own regional policies but action at community level is not excluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We expect that, during our transitional period, a safeguard provision on the lines of Article 226 of the Treaty of Rome will be available to enable appropriate measures to be taken in the case of Irish industries which might experience difficulties.  The measures to be taken could include derogations from the rules of the Treaty to the extent and for the periods necessary to achieve the objectives envisaged in the article.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must appreciate that we could lose industries in the transitional period and it would be a bit too late then to invoke Article 226.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that we will not discuss this until after the transitional period but we cannot discuss all subjects on the same day. Before we enter into any Treaty we will have ensured, as far as we can, that Article 226 will apply here.  We will not wait until after the transitional period to look for that kind of protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present time we are dealing with transitional arrangements. This is the most important thing at the moment.  The next important thing would be regional policy when we are members and then matters like the protection to be applied during the transitional period.  I expect Article 226 will apply or something of the same terms will apply.  We can negotiate it before we enter into the transitional period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It applied during their own transitional period.  We hope the same measures will apply to our transitional period and will be negotiated. I think the Deputy misunderstands that.  He thought that I would not deal with it until the transitional period was over.  I meant to say that I would not negotiate this one until the transitional periods have been negotiated. <Col N="458" /> We are doing one subject after the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers in EEC countries pay value added tax in cases where such a tax has been introduced in these countries but arrangements exist whereby farmers are compensated for the tax on their inputs by an adjustment on the prices which they receive for their produce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

      <P>The Naas branch of the Grand Canal was closed to navigation <Col N="459" /> by CIE in October, 1961, under the provisions of section 23 of the Transport Act, 1958.  The closure released the board from the obligation to keep the canal open and in a fit condition for navigation, but not from any other obligations to which the board may be liable in regard to the canal, for example, obligations in regard to drainage or the prevention of flooding.</P>
      <P>The Naas branch acts as a feeder canal to the Grand Canal system and the continuity of this supply has to be ensured.  As the branch is closed to navigation, CIE is not obliged to maintain the locks, as such, in repair.  However, retention of lock gates at two points is necessary to maintain proper water levels, to ensure drainage and to provide water supplies.  For safety reasons some of the lock gates on the branch canal have been locked in the open position and some in the closed position and the swing beams have been removed.</P>

      <P>Reliable statistics for bank credit for the past year are not yet available.  For the year to April, 1971 the Central Bank, taking into account the likely increase in deposit resources of the associated banks, advised that total credit extended by them should not increase by more than £75 million. However, as a result of the effects of the bank dispute it is not possible to estimate either the likely increase in credit during this period or its distribution between the public and private sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with all other accounts held in the commercial banks the account of the Exchequer could not be operated during the banks closure and it was not possible to make any issues from the Exchequer. In general it was not found necessary to make capital payments during the closure but money was provided for such essential payments as wages, salaries, social welfare payments and the servicing of foreign debt by borrowing temporarily from sinking funds, the savings certificate reserve fund and particularly from the savings banks' fund which received considerable additional deposits from the public during the period.  These borrowings, which have since been repaid, amounted to some £110 million up to the delayed value date.</P>

      <P>In regard to this £110 million, I do not understand how this transaction was effected.  You borrowed from sinking funds.  There had to be some financial transaction.

If the interest is short interest it is allowed as a deduction in computing profits where the loan has been obtained for the purposes of a trade or business but not otherwise.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan) Sean Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the decision to decimalise the currency, and having regard to the computerisation of the work, it became necessary to reassess the method of collecting annuities.  The ten-year receivable order did not fit easily into the new system of processing payments by computer, nor did it meet the requirements of new machines introduced by the banks.  In addition, each ten-year receivable order would have had to be amended, by hand, to show the decimal equivalent of the half-yearly instalment.</P>
      <P>Accordingly it was decided that the issue of a half-yearly demand which could more efficiently be processed by the computer would best meet future requirements.  There is no basic change in the method of payment of annuities. In the case of a payment made through a bank the counterfoil portion of the new demand will be completed by the bank and returned to the payer, as his receipt, at the time of payment.</P>

Lesser stocks exist between Erris Head and Gola Island, County Donegal, and there are virtually no stocks in the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>There has been a tendency for Irish fishermen to use &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; gear, that is to say, the same gear for fishing lobsters and crawfish, rather than specialised gear in each case.  A large proportion of the fishing for crawfish is conducted from small boats but there is considerable evidence to indicate that the fishery could be exploited more advantageously by the use of larger boats up to, say, 75 feet in length with specialised crawfish gear.  These larger vessels are capable of fishing in greater depths of water, further afield and under a wider range of weather conditions.</P>

      <P>The Government provide generous incentives towards the establishment and development of industries in all areas.  It is primarily a matter for the promoter of an industrial undertaking to choose its location and local interests should do their best to encourage promoters to set up industries in their own areas.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development Authority are aware of the facilities available in the town of Millstreet and advise industrialists of their availability in appropriate cases.  A number of small industries in the area have already received grants under the small industries programme but local interests might consider whether they could make greater use of the programme.  I can assure the Deputy that any sound proposals for the establishment of industry in Millstreet by local or other interests will receive the full support of my Department and of the Industrial Development Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the wide variation in the price of the alcoholic beverage in question.  I should point out, however, that the price of 16 pence mentioned by the Deputy relates to sales by some off-licence retailers. As regards control over drink prices, I should point out that the informal control which I exercise is over public bar prices only.  I do not generally intervene with regard to prices charged by lounges or by hotels on the general principle that, if a customer is dissatisfied with the prices charged in such places, he has the option of drinking elsewhere at lower prices.</P>

I want to know from the Minister whether he is aware <Col N="478" /> that the price of the ordinary pint has gone up by one new penny in the ordinary public bar.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>The nature of the threat in this matter is such that no increase in Garda strength that could possibly be contemplated could make any significant difference.  The onus of taking precautions must rest on each individual owner and it would be misleading for me to suggest otherwise.  Garda activity in this matter must be directed at seeking to apprehend those responsible in cases where fires are malicious rather than by preventive patrols. Owners have, in fact, been advised both privately and in public to this effect by the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Would the Minister agree that evidence which has come to hand to date about these fires appears to indicate clearly that they are deliberate and constitute arson?  Because of the sense of insecurity which has been generated in the city as a result of these fires, the enormous value of the property involved and the likely cost to the ratepayers of this city, will the Minister not agree that this is a matter for some special steps of a crisis nature to be taken&mdash;not just merely telling owners of property to look after themselves&mdash;to track down these people and restore a sense of security to property owners in this city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate, I am sure, that in a threat of this particular kind, no matter how many gardaí are on duty in Dublin city, the repercussions of such a threat cannot be ruled out completely.  I assume the Deputy is aware of the general nature of the threat and the way in which some of these fires have arisen and I think he will agree that, even if gardaí were on duty in the stores themselves, they could still not have prevented some of these fires.  All the gardaí can do is to make very clear <Col N="480" /> to property owners subject to this threat what precautions they should take.  I am glad to say nearly all are taking pretty elaborate precautions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): He seems to regard it as something of a normal situation.  Surely it is the business of the Minister to release a sufficient number of the detective branch or the gardaí, who are specially qualified in this kind of thing, to track down these people and see that they are put behind bars?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The gardaí are quite satisfied that the numbers available to them in respect of this work are perfectly adequate.  I do not want to go into any details, but the Deputy will be aware that the gardaí have issued a description of three persons they think could help them in their inquiries.  I have looked at this matter specially and I do not think it can be alleged that the gardaí are not making every possible effort.</P>

The Garda have made very strenuous efforts, indeed, but, as I have pointed out, with a threat of this nature, even if there were 1,000 gardaí available in <Col N="481" /> the city tomorrow morning they still could not cope with this particular type of arsonist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak about the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; Inquiry as this is the first appropriate opportunity we have had to speak on this subject. Now that we have an opportunity to consider the matter in tranquillity, we should try to sum up what we have learned from this inquiry and whether it was, in fact, an appropriate exercise at all.</P>
      <P>I submit that the inquiry was an inappropriate exercise having regard to the form it took, the terms of reference and the manner in which it was handled.  It was based on the assumption that it is the duty of journalists in presenting programmes, articles or features to apply to their preparatory work the same standards and criteria that would be applied in the presentation of a case in court and the action in referring this to the tribunal to judge whether the allegations were justified inevitably tended towards that result. On this side of the House we endeavoured to mitigate the damage that quite evidently would be done to the whole concept of freedom of speech by introducing into the terms of reference an added criterion to be considered by the judges.  However, we were conscious that that alone would be insufficient to undo the damage done by the basic approach involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That there should have been some inquiry into the conflict between the Minister and RTE was evident.  However, the terms of reference were not drawn up as they should have been, to establish whether the Minister's allegations were true.  The onus of proof should be on the person who made the allegation against a reputable, responsible State body.  Instead, the Government shifted the onus of proof on to RTE&mdash;that everything in the programme was correct, factual and <Col N="499" /> provable in a court of law.  Such a shift in the onus of proof was indefensible and extremely dangerous.  One can only hope that this has now become sufficiently evident to ensure that something of the kind will not recur.  It is important that we discuss this matter here in as detached a manner as possible and make sure that in exploring it on this basis we guard against a repetition of what happened.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the media&mdash;the press, radio and television&mdash;should be free within the limits properly imposed by the laws of libel to expose any social evils in our community, any inequities or injustices perpetrated by any individual or public authority.  In carrying out this function it is vital that the free press, upon which depends live democracy, should be subject only to the laws of libel.  In Ireland and Britain the laws of libel are extremely stringent &mdash;much more so than in continental countries or in the United States.  I am not aware that there is any pressure to make them more stringent.  On the contrary, I am aware that a good case has been made to mitigate the stringency of these laws to some degree because there is a danger that in their present form they may unduly inhibit the communications media.</P>
    <P>So long as the law of libel stands it will safeguard the rights of the individual. If there is any abuse in this matter there is a remedy.  In practice, when juries consider an individual has been done an injustice by a newspaper or other medium of communication, and if there is evidence of this injustice, they tend to be pretty tough with the organisation concerned.  The jury will tend to err on the side of the individual against the institution.  It is a human reaction and a sound one.  This ensures that the necessary safeguards exist for the individual who considers he has been done an injustice.</P>
    <P>However, to try to impose any further requirements on the press, radio or television with regard to the publication of material which criticises any private or public interests for possible abuses is to act against the interests of democracy, freedom and justice. Any pressure of this kind is, of its nature, anti-social if it goes beyond <Col N="500" /> the provisions of the law.  Nothing could be more calculated to prevent justice being done and to undermine democracy than to place the onus of legal proof on the media because this would inhibit disastrously the journalists concerned.</P>
    <P>In this case the onus of proof was shifted on to RTE and judges in the High Court were asked a question they should not have been asked: whether every statement in this programme was factually correct and fully justified and whether the fullest care was taken in everything that was said.  They were asked this despite the fact that, had there been any abuse of power by the medium, any person who suffered by this abuse could take action.  One person did this and we know the consequences of that case&mdash;we know who won.  The judges were asked to apply their legal minds to the question of whether RTE had proved, or could prove their case in a court of law, or had prepared themselves to prove it before the programme was put on.</P>
    <P>There would be no journalism of any consequence in any country where this principle was applied&mdash;where nothing could be printed in a newspaper that could not be proved in court.  I am surprised that the totalitarian regimes in countries such as Greece and Russia have not thought up this technique which would practically obviate the need for censorship.  It would provide such countries with an easy legal way to protect themselves against any criticism.  It took our Government to provide this ingenious way of undermining freedom of speech.  I suspect that the Government did not set out to do this but that it arose out of the action of one member of the Government which other members considered they had to stand over.  I suspect other members of the Government were unsympathetic to what was done but they have done damage by their solidarity with the man who acted improperly in the attack he made.  The Government did wrong in the way they sought to cover that, by drawing up the terms of reference so that any failure to prove a point on the part of RTE would be shown to be a defect, the subject of criticism by the inquiry.  In doing that <Col N="501" /> the Government did a disservice to freedom of speech.</P>
    <P>I want to sum up the conclusions of this inquiry.  I want to list the main things that seem to me to have emerged positively from it.  First of all, the inquiry report says that in making the programme RTE were activated by a desire to draw public attention to what they genuinely considered to be a serious social problem.  They did not act <i>mala fide.</i> They believed there was a social problem and in making this programme what activated them was a desire to draw public attention to what they considered to be a serious social problem.  They acted in good faith.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the tribunal held that the decision to make the programme was justified, that they were right in making such a programme.  Not only did they act in good faith, believing there was a social evil to be exposed but their judgement was correct in that such a programme needed to be made and they were justified in making it.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, they said the programme was authentic in that illegal moneylending does exist and is a problem of serious proportions in certain areas. That is a very important conclusion indeed.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, they said that&mdash;these are matters of detail but they are all important details&mdash;where moneylending does exist the rates of interest are excessive and that the programme was correct in saying this.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, they concluded that children's allowance books are commonly taken as security for loans, as alleged in the programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Sixthly, that repayments are secured by taking advantage of the fear of borrowers.  They went on to say that it was not, as far as they could establish, a fear of violence but a fear of exposure to friends and relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last point which I think is relevant and which the tribunal held in their conclusions&mdash;this is vitally important from the point of view of establishing <Col N="502" /> that there was a social evil to be tackled and that the programme had beneficial effects&mdash;is that before the programme the gardaí had not considered that illegal moneylending was a police problem, whereas as a result of investigations by gardaí which were occasioned by the programme, it was disclosed to them that moneylending is prevalent in the centre city area and that a number of unlicensed moneylenders carry on business in other areas outside the city centre.</P>
    <P>The summing up, therefore, of the tribunal was in these words&mdash;and everything I have said so far is a verbatim quotation from the tribunal's report:</P>
    <P>To this extent, and because the public have been made aware of the problem, the results of the programme have been beneficial.</P>
    <P>By any standards it would be difficult to find higher praise for a journalistic exercise.  It sounds to me the kind of terms in which a Pulitzer award might be made and indeed I think many Pulitzer awards have been given for lesser things than this.  There could not be higher praise of a journalistic exercise.</P>
    <P>That was not all the tribunal did.  I do not want to give merely one side and be selective.  They went on to make criticisms but these criticisms are ones which it seems to me should not have been made, not that the tribunal were in error because they were in fact acting in accordance with their terms of reference but that the criticisms they made were ones they should not have been put into the position to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Deputy that the decisions arrived at by the members of the tribunal are not open for discussion or criticism in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, a Cheann Comhairle, you must not, perhaps, have taken my point.  I am saying that they were entirely justified, given the terms of reference, in going on to do what they did but that the terms of reference should not have been given to them and they should not have been put in the position of having to reach conclusions on these points.  I think that <Col N="503" /> is entirely proper and I am most emphatic about that.  I do not impute to the tribunal in any of its conclusions that they went beyond the terms of reference or that the conclusions were not justified by the terms of reference. What I am concerned about is that the terms of reference led the tribunal into an area into which they should not have been led by politicians presenting them with those terms of reference.  I make no criticism whatever of the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not open to criticism, Deputy, as I have already pointed out.  I want to make it perfectly clear that the decisions they arrived at cannot be discussed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in total agreement on this.  I want to go on to mention the criticisms they made.  The criticisms they made referred to exaggerations in the programme and statements that were not proved.  These were the criticisms and I accept that if the tribunal reached that conclusion that must be factually the case.  It does not surprise me.  It would be surprising if in a journalistic exercise of this kind the case was presented as it would be by senior counsel in the High Court or indeed by the Attorney General prosecuting in the High Court or the Criminal Court with every statement proved and documented to the hilt by direct evidence on oath.  Any idea that journalism is carried on in that way or could be carried on in that way is obviously fundamentally erroneous and while the criticisms may be justified in the sense that they may be factually correct they are entirely improper in that the tribunal was asked to advert to the question of whether there were exaggerations or statements that were not proved which is something they should not be asked to advert to in any journalistic exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course if in respect of any of the other matters to which I have referred they had found the programme to be defective&mdash;if they had found the programme was activated by bad faith; if they had found that the decision was unjustified to make the programme; if they had found that the programme <Col N="504" /> was not authentic; if they had found that the basic facts put forward about excessive interest rates, use of children's allowance books, and fear being used to secure repayments were not correct and that the whole problem was being adequately handled by the gardaí&mdash;if on all these issues which are fundamental or indeed on any significant number of them the programme had been found defective then I think legitimate criticism could be made.  However, the criticisms in the report are confined to criticisms that having done all these things which it was proper to do there were things in the programme which were exaggerated and statements made that were not proved.  &ldquo;Not proved&rdquo;, mind you, not necessarily not correct, but &ldquo;not proved&rdquo;.  To have put a tribunal into the position of having to reach a conclusion on that issue was entirely improper and no journalist should be put into the position that unless he can prove his statements in a court of law he will be sent up before three judges of the High Court and found guilty on that issue even though the exercise is justified, authentic and done in good faith and establishes all the key facts as correct.</P>
    <P>I can only hope that the effect of this exercise will be nil and that there will be sufficient realisation of how inappropriate and improper it was that journalists will feel that it is not something that will ever happen again.  It is our job in this House to try to get this across, to try to ensure that no residual fears remain among journalists on newspapers, in television or radio that if in the future they write an article or put forward a programme that contains something that cannot be proved in a court of law they will be hauled through the courts on this account.  This is a complete reversal of the whole concept of free speech and involves a misconception of the whole purpose of the law of libel which is designed to cover this.  What we have to do is to try to get across that this was a once and for all aberration undertaken by a Government in a misplaced effort of solidarity with a Minister who had behaved improperly and who subsequently and for other reasons left the Cabinet and that there <Col N="505" /> is no likelihood of this happening again; that it is not to be taken as a precedent and that they must feel free to continue to do their work without fear or favour and must not in any circumstances be intimidated by what happened here into not doing their job in the future.</P>
    <P>That is the message that should go out from this House and from this debate and I hope it will.  I have sufficient confidence in the journalists of this country to believe that that is the message they will take from this tribunal and from this debate.  Indeed, I have seen nothing since the tribunal to suggest that Irish journalism has become more mealy-mouthed or unwilling to do its job of exposing incompetence or injustice in the public or private sector because this inquiry was undertaken.  It is important that they should have the reassurance that public opinion, as expressed in this House, is on their side and that in any future exercise, even if they do make mistakes and cannot prove every statement they make, so long as they act in good faith and what they write is authentic and the main points they put forward can be shown to be true, they will have the support of public opinion against every attempt to muzzle them by requiring from them standards of proof such as are required in a court of law.</P>
    <P>There are two other features of this exercise to which I wish to draw attention. One is connected with what I have said.  It arises from statements made by the Minister for Justice at that time and by the Taoiseach in the Dáil as recorded in volume 242, No. 12 of the Official Report.  I want to contrast the statements made by the Minister and the Taoiseach with the findings of the tribunal in this respect.  It will be recalled that what the Minister and the Taoiseach said was not that there was exaggeration in the programme, not that there were statements which might not be proved, but they went far beyond that and challenged the authenticity of the programme which the tribunal found to be authentic, and authentic in that illegal moneylending does exist and is a problem of serious proportions.  What the Minister said is <Col N="506" /> recorded at various points in this volume.  At column 1859 the then Minister for Justice said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I certainly would not question RTE's right to present a work of fiction in order to expose some social evil.  But this programme was not presented as fiction&mdash;it was presented as fact.  The viewers were led to believe, and the great majority undoubtedly accepted, that what they saw on the screen was authentic, factual evidence of a widespread moneylending racket.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At column 1861 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I suggest that, whatever one's views may be as to how far the people responsible were blameworthy in this way, it is unquestionable that, objectively speaking, the evidence was worthless.</P>
    <P>The High Court found this evidence to be authentic, with exaggerations in some points and failure to prove other points, but authentic in the overall picture which was given.  The Minister contradicted the very word &ldquo;authentic &ldquo;used by the tribunal.  At column 1866 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have given, it is clear, beyond question, that the evidence presented in the programme was, as I have said, valueless.</P>
    <P>Much the greater part of the evidence stood up to the examinations in the High Court and to the gruelling experience of many weeks of exposure to attack by senior counsel on one side or the other, each approaching it from a different angle.  These are the kind of statements which were made.  I do not attach too much importance to the statements of a Minister who left office shortly afterwards in circumstances known to us.  I think the Minister was discredited subsequently.  The statement of the Taoiseach at column 1873 concerns me more than the statements of Deputy Ó Moráin.  I think this statement calls for an apology by the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach should be man enough to apologise for this statement made in the heat of the moment.  We can all make mistakes in the heat of the moment, but when one says something which is unjust about a person and when the <Col N="507" /> remark is later shown to be unjust common decency calls for a withdrawal. The Taoiseach is a man with whom the quality of decency is associated by many people.  The Taoiseach should withdraw what he said at column 1873.  After some preliminary remarks he said:</P>
    <P>All this controversy could have been avoided if RTE had said at the outset of this programme that the characters and scenes to be portrayed in it were fictitious; otherwise there is the danger that, in future programmes, no matter how laudable or commendable, no matter how much they are put forward in the public interest, they would cause a cry of &ldquo;wolf, wolf&rdquo;, in other words, that the credibility of any future RTE programme would be brought into question.</P>
    <P>That sounds reasonable enough if, in fact, the programme was found to be fictitious.  The programme was found to be authentic containing exaggerations and unproven statements but basically authentic.  All the main theses in it were shown to be correct.  In those circumstances the word &ldquo;fictitious&rdquo; is clearly inappropriate.  Had the Taoiseach said that it was important in presenting a programme that it should carry conviction and that there should be no exaggeration and that anything in it should have been capable of proof that would have been a legitimate expression of view, but it would be putting the standard of proof too high. The imputation of fiction to the programme was something the Taoiseach was not entitled to make, and which, having been shown to be incorrect, he should withdraw.  I should like to feel that the Taoiseach would withdraw the remark which was very hurtful to the people concerned in RTE who made the programme.  The remark came from the Taoiseach whose view they would respect and be concerned about, which might not necessarily be so about something said by the Minister for Justice.  It was hurtful to everyone, right up to the Director-General and the board of RTE.  I should like to call on the Taoiseach to admit that he said more in the heat of the moment than <Col N="508" /> he should have said and that the view expressed there turned out to be incorrect.</P>
    <P>I have at times been critical of the members of the RTE Authority. To be more precise, I have been critical of the membership of the Authority.  In the Seanad, I can recall pointing out in debate on the Broad-casting Act the predominantly Fianna Fáil composition of the Authority.  By Fianna Fáil I do not mean to say that they vote Fianna Fáil.  People are entitled to vote any way they like. Many of the members had been positively and specifically identified in activities for promoting the Fianna Fáil Party at elections or in other ways.  I went to some trouble not to impute to any of the members of the Authority any dishonesty or to infer that they permitted their political views to influence their decisions.  RTE are independent.  The board have not tried to interfere with programmes.  I recall defending a chairman of the Authority in the Seanad, although his political views were different from mine.  I was concerned that there was a board, the membership of which was obviously, and openly, allied to one political party &mdash;the governing party.  Confidence in the board was likely to be undermined and this might lead to the belief that the Government party were exercising a wrong influence in RTE&mdash;a belief which I said was, and still believe to be, unfounded.  The Government were wrong to have undermined public confidence in this board by giving it such membership.  I think I was correct in that.  It was, and is, a mistake.</P>
    <P>I must say, in fairness, that in this particular affair this board, despite its composition which is so much biased in favour of the Government party, has stood up to the test of integrity imposed by this programme.  The board stood behind their staff and did not let them down as politically some of them might have been tempted to. One thing which has emerged is that it is possible to get a board, although composed mostly of members of one party, which, nevertheless, when put to the test do not necessarily respond to a party Whip but can stand up to the kind of situation which faced them. <Col N="509" /> I must congratulate them on the stand they made.  I think it would have been better if the composition of the Authority were seen to be more evenly balanced and not specifically political so that public confidence would be maintained.  They have recovered public confidence which, perhaps, they had not got by the firm stand they made on this occasion.  It is to their credit and to the discredit of the Government that the kind of conflict which arose should have arisen.  It is an unhappy situation but some positive achievement has come out of it.</P>
    <P>I come now to something less creditable to the Government which deserves to be challenged here.  That is the action of the Minister in giving an assurance to a House of the Oireachtas as to how the tribunal would operate and the fact that, subsequently, that assurance was repudiated by the Government of which he was a Minister and that the Minister did not then resign.  I know of no precedent for this in Parliamentary politics in other countries. There have been a number of unprecedented cases of ministerial misbehaviour in this House in the last year.  This may not be the most outstanding or striking instance but I do not wish it to be overshadowed.  Attention should be drawn to this point.  I think I am entitled to quote from the record of the other House.</P>
    <P>From Volume 67, column 723 I want to quote the speech of a Member of the Seanad, Senator Brugha, and the Minister's reply to him.  Senator Brugha was speaking on this Bill to establish this tribunal.  He said:</P>
    <P>I welcome this because it will enable any of those who may have to give evidence to do so in private.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>It is well known that journalists from time to time must protect their sources of information and indeed that some journalists have elected to go to prison rather than disclose information given to them in confidence. This is something that I support and I presume that when this matter comes before the tribunal this principle will be upheld.</P>
    <Col N="510" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be upheld.</P>
      <P>I do not know of any more unambiguous statement than that particularly from a Minister who is given to a certain amount of ambiguity.  Anybody, including Senator Brugha, could not have been in any doubt as to what was intended.  There was no question of &ldquo;It will be upheld if...&rdquo; referring to something earlier on, because the sentence that precedes it is self-contained. The two sentences preceding it are self-contained.  This particular issue is raised by Senator Brugha: &ldquo;I presume that when this matter&rdquo;&mdash;the question of not sending journalists to jail if they do not disclose information&mdash;&ldquo;comes before the tribunal this principle will be upheld.&rdquo;&ldquo;It will be upheld&rdquo; was the reply given.</P>
      <P>I do not think any Government are entitled to repudiate that kind of assurance. Yet, when this matter came before the court this is in fact what happened.  On 22nd January last year this matter came up in court and there was a long discussion on the subject. Mr. Justice Butler said to Miss Moody in respect of the name and rank of a Garda contact &ldquo;I am afraid you will have to give it.&rdquo;  She had said: &ldquo;I know his name; I will not give his name.&rdquo;  Mr. Justice Butler said: &ldquo;I am afraid you will have to give it.&rdquo;  Mr. John A. Costello, SC for the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; team, asked to be heard and questioned Miss Moody: Did she regard an undertaking not to reveal a source of information as having been given?  Miss Moody replied &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. Mr. Costello said that an undertaking had been given in the Seanad by a Minister of the Government that sources of information would not be revealed during the inquiry.  Mr. Justice Butler said that no such undertaking had been conveyed to the tribunal in its terms of reference.  Mr. Costello read from the Seanad Report, as I have done.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Butler went on to say:</P>
      <P>As you know, there is no legal basis for that&mdash;</P>
      <P>that is, for this principle of journalists' sources being protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am concerned with is <Col N="511" /> whether the Executive gave an undertaking.  If they did give an undertaking which limits the powers of the tribunal such information was not conveyed to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Mr. Costello said:</P>
    <P>I would say that the Minister gave that undertaking.  The motion would not have been passed by the Seanad without that undertaking.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Butler instructed Mr. Peter O'Malley, SC, for the Attorney General, to find out if an undertaking had been given and the tribunal then adjourned.</P>
    <P>When the tribunal resumed the counsel had not been able to contact the Government, I think.  There was some further discussion which went on quite a while.  I shall not detain the House with details of it but, finally, the next morning, on Friday, 23rd January &mdash;I am quoting from the <i>Irish Times</i> of the following day in each case:</P>
    <P>Mr. Niall McCarthy, SC, for the Attorney General said that he had now obtained instructions as to the attitude of the Executive.  The Tribunal is established in pursuance of resolutions of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  If it had been intended that the ordinary rules of evidence were not to apply in full, provisions to that effect would have been made in the terms of reference.  Mr. Justice Butler asked: The Executive did not accept that an undertaking was given by the Minister for Transport and Power in the Seanad?  And Mr. McCarthy said: &ldquo;That would appear to be so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a disreputable and dishonourable action by the Executive or Government because the Minister who took this Bill in the Seanad gave an absolute undertaking not merely to the Opposition but to one of his own Senators who had, very properly, sought such an undertaking.  It could not have been more explicit.  There is no way in which you can say it referred to something else.  It could not have referred to anything else and yet the Executive refused to stand over it.</P>
    <P>How can we proceed in this House or the other House if an undertaking given by a member of the Government <Col N="512" /> in such explicit terms can be repudiated?  Over the last year we have experienced an extraordinary deterioration in the standards of Parliamentary life in this respect.  We are entitled to challenge this and entitled to say that until this situation is remedied, until there is some evidence of a change of heart on the part of the Government, some evidence of a sense of shame when undertakings are repudiated or the truth is not told to this House, we are not in a position to accept what comes from the other side of the House.  And this is a matter which is a source of shame and concern to us all.</P>
    <P>It has been the tradition of this Parliament, despite the deep differences which in earlier decades were very deep indeed arising out of the Civil War, but despite that, that people could accept what was said on the Government side of the House.  If a Government Minister said something in clear and explicit terms, not evasive or ambiguous terms but in clear and explicit terms, one had to accept that. It would have been regarded as quite improper for somebody to say: &ldquo;I do not believe a word the Minister says. I do not believe he will keep his undertaking.&rdquo; We accepted undertakings given and we accepted that when Ministers made specific statements they were true.  We sought very often to find if there was some evasion or ambiguity; had a word been slipped in or a word omitted because we felt that the Minister, while he would stand over what he had said and while he would only tell the truth, might try to twist or turn a little or try to change the sense of the statement he was making in reply to a question when he replied to a different question. These are legitimate evasive tactics of Parliament and are practised by both sides.  That is part of the Parliamentary game, but given that the statement was made, whether in reply to the question asked or not, we had the belief and were entitled to it, that when a Minister said something if it was a statement of fact about the past or about the present it was true, and if it was an undertaking about the future that the Government would honour it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> Both these beliefs have been shattered in the past 12 or 15 months. I do not know which is the more serious.  Certainly, we are dealing with a very serious one because it is not merely a question of a factual misstatement; it is a question of a House of the Oireachtas being led into taking a legislative decision, voting for a Bill on the strength of an assurance given by a responsible Minister in explicit terms and finding then that assurance publicly and openly dishonoured by the Government.  That makes it impossible for us to accept assurances and undertakings from the Government. Yet, how can legislative processes continue if we cannot do that?  Hardly a Bill of any consequence goes through this House that the Opposition does not raise an issue on some point or other which they want to amend to make it more explicit and that the Minister does not say: &ldquo;The Deputy has a point but I can assure him that in the way the Bill will be administered as an Act we will certainly not do such and such.&rdquo;  Or &ldquo;We will do such and such&rdquo;.  The Opposition are not very happy with this at times.  We have our doubts about it in the legislative process. We may often prefer that these matters be included in the Bill in explicit legal language that is binding but frequently because of the problems of drafting or if the Government are reluctant, for reasons they think proper, we accept the undertaking or assurance in the belief that it will be honoured.</P>
    <P>How can we do that in future?  This process of legislation, this process of Parliamentary activity depends so completely on this kind of trust at a particular level&mdash;distrust at political level, distrust of the intentions and policies of the Government and no doubt, on the Government side, similar distrust of the policies and intentions of the Opposition&mdash;but trust that at least if an explicit statement or undertaking is made or given it will be honoured.  How can we continue without that?  I should have thought in this debate Deputy Lenihan might have intervened&mdash;sorry, it is untrue to say that I thought he would; I had rather say that I knew he would not but I think he should have. I think we are entitled to stress that <Col N="514" /> both the Taoiseach and he should have intervened to set things right and to undo the damage the pair of them did, the Taoiseach less blameworthy in an aside, in a remark made in haste using a form of words which no doubt he regretted afterwards but which nevertheless as a matter of honour he should withdraw but the Minister much more seriously and the Taoiseach, as head of the Government responsible for the continuation of the undertaking, much more seriously involved in the matter I am now raising.</P>
    <P>I do not know what action we can take; in fact there is no action that we on this side of the House can take to put this matter right, unless we can get some explicit change of heart on the part of the Government.  It is difficult to see how that could be phrased.  What kind of undertaking can we accept from a Government that they will honour undertakings in future when this undertaking is broken?  We are in a position where I cannot see under what circumstances the Opposition can recover confidence in the integrity of the Government, under what circumstances the Government can maintain and continue to have the confidence of the people in their integrity in these circumstances. I am not choosing, I think, language that is too strong.  Some people who are not concerned with matters like this, who prefer to deal with matters of broader concern, may feel I am picking on minutiae, that I am unduly fussy about a small point, but this is, I insist, an absolute point of principle in Parliament.  We have seen recently in the Norwegian Parliament an example of the Government falling because of a lack of integrity on the part of a Minister, because he told the House he had not leaked a document and he subsequently had to admit that he had.  He went and the Government went in Norway, but there are different standards there from what we have become used to here.</P>
    <P>This is, therefore, a matter of vital importance and in speaking on this debate and confining my remarks to the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; Tribunal I want to end on that point.  I can suggest no solution. I cannot see how we can restore the authority or the integrity of the Government, but it does seem to me that <Col N="515" /> there is one more good reason for removing this Government from office at this time.</P>

      <P>Since the Minister has mentioned it, I happened on Saturday night to come in just as the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; had reached a certain stage to hear a young man in the audience shout: &ldquo;How did Deputy Garret FitzGerald come to occupy that chair?&rdquo; Of course, Deputy FitzGerald is now gone.  He never listens to anyone else but he expects others to listen to him.  The answer to the question asked by the young man did not carry any great conviction to me.  The particular people who were talking about Women's Lib. did not get very much sympathy from me subsequently when one of the people on the panel said: &ldquo;We were around Dáil Éireann last week and of the whole 144 Deputies only six saw us.&rdquo;  The reason they did not get much sympathy from me is that I know who two of the six were: one was Deputy Paddy Malone and the other was myself.  It is a poor thing, if there are supposed to be decent standards of political life by people who are outside politics, that they should make that kind of statement, that only six Deputies saw them and they then had not the common decency to say who the six Deputies were.  Of course this does not surprise me; I am well used to this kind of thing from such people.  I give the Minister the point. As to the explanation given, that when Deputy FitzGerald heard what Miss Mary Kenny said he got so worked up that he charged down and occupied the chair.  Who would believe it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald was talking about a programme, which I never saw by the way, that was the moneylending programme, but from what I heard about it&mdash;and goodness knows we all <Col N="516" /> heard a great deal about it&mdash;I thought that, on the whole, the programme was fair and reasonable.  Anyway I would say that if the Government were to go through it all again they would not have had that investigation, and perhaps there are other investigations that various people are going through at the moment that they would not have if they were to start all over again.  At least I had some wisdom on that point but nobody would listen to me.</P>
    <P>Let me get off the political hook to talk about a much more serious matter in relation to the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs.  I raised with the Minister in the form of a question one official advertisement, or what I regard as an official advertisement, about the payment of licence fees.  The Minister gave me one answer in the House but subsequently in relation to a Bill he said a very different thing which was reported in the daily papers.  His answer to me was that he was not responsible for the particular advertisement, although that was denied by a spokesman on behalf of Telefís Éireann.  I am not blaming the Minister in that respect but I want to refer to his answer in the House&mdash;I was unable to be here at the time&mdash;in which he said: &ldquo;I do not necessarily agree with the Deputy's comments.&rdquo;  However, as I say, within a week in connection, I think, with a new television Bill the Minister did say in public in quite a short statement that he did not agree with this advertisement.</P>
    <P>Since I was not in the House then, I wish to explain to the Minister why I objected to the advertisement.  First of all, I have been told by one of my colleagues that children of eight years of age get great fun out of the advertisement. In other words, it was directed to an eight-year-old level: the fellow who occupies the picture and falls down off the ladder appeals to a certain level of development of the mind.  It was not only that I objected to the bad English in it&mdash;as distinct from bad English there was bad grammar in it&mdash;but that I also objected to the clear inference in it that only poor people and poorly educated people do not pay their television licences.  That very week there was <Col N="517" /> evidence before the Fair Trade Commission from a person representing a supermarket that most of the shop-lifting that goes on&mdash;such as it is; I do not know what the extent of it is&mdash;in supermarkets was done by well-off people.  Therefore, I object personally to that inference.  Certainly the accent in which this advertisement was given out and the language in which it was couched was extremely objectionable in relation to an official advertisement.</P>
    <P>It does not matter whether the advertisement was concocted by Telefís Éireann or the Post Office&mdash;from what I know of these things it is more than likely that it was concocted in Telefís Éireann&mdash;but it was approved by the Post Office.  The Minister shakes his head.  It is not often the case but it could have happened; when the Minister shakes his head I accept his denial. However, the usual thing, when somebody in Telefís Éireann, say, would concoct such an advertisement is that he would read it over to somebody in the Post Office, and the Minister at the top does not necessarily know it was not read over.  It was somebody down the line who said: &ldquo;That is OK&rdquo; and now when a rumpus arises denies that it happened.</P>
    <P>Large organisations have untold tricks they play on the ordinary public: &ldquo;That was done by a junior.&rdquo;  How often have we heard that?  I could give examples from my own experience of such tricks.  One organisation of the State played such a trick on me: &ldquo;You cannot blame us.  That was done by a person way down the line.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another advertisement I want to talk about was also a semi-official one about the coming into existence of the decimal currency programme, where the bus conductor says: &ldquo;Me and the lads&rdquo; are going to do something or other.  The whole emphasis is wrong. I am not going to bother whether it was CIE, Telefís Éireann or anybody else who concocted that advertisement. I suppose it was intended to be racy.  It is strange that I have never come across anything of this sort in a commercial advertisement on RTE.  I challenge the Minister to produce such a case.  It is bad enough to have to put up with the advertising on Telefís <Col N="518" /> Éireann.  It certainly gets under my skin.  For years I did not view Telefís Éireann but, unfortunately, where I am situated now I can only get Telefís Éireann.  I cannot get the BBC at all. At one time I was quite a television addict but I have rather gone off it.  I have seen a great deal of Telefís Éireann recently.  I see an awful lot of Telefís Éireann.  I am a television addict.  I adopt the same attitude towards television as an addict does towards tobacco&mdash;towards television in general, not particularly Telefís Éireann.  At one time it was always BBC.</P>
    <P>However, I wish to speak about a much more serious matter, particularly because of the nature of the speech which preceded mine.  There is considerable public exception being taken to our postal rates.  Our ordinary postal rate for a letter is now 4p, 9.6 old pennies.  The full rate in England is 3p, 7.2 old pennies, or one-third less than ours.  These remarks put me in mind of the fact that one of my children came home from boarding school in 1965 and suddenly over a meal produced this information: &ldquo;When I went to school we could post ten letters for half a grown and now when I leave we can post only six.&rdquo;  That is the kind of thing that can impress children.</P>
    <P>I know it affects old age pensioners and other social welfare classes whether they pay 6p or 3p.  It makes a difference to them.  It may be all right for the bulk of us because we are not affected that seriously.  The point I am making is that the difference in the rate between 1959 and 1965 was quite abnormal.  Formerly the rate was too low.  I am not denying that.  It remained threepence for far too long.  It is possible to say that when one thinks of our rate during the war.  It was twopence. There was penny postage in England at that time and that, too, lasted a long time.</P>
    <P>There is another angle to this, that is to say, the service has disimproved considerably.  There is now no Saturday delivery of letters and this means that you cannot get a letter between the evening of Friday, at least 12 hours before Saturday morning, the whole of Saturday and Sunday, and Monday <Col N="519" /> morning.  In other words, one cannot get a letter during 2½ of the seven days of the week.  During that period one cannot officially communicate by letter in this country.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of objection when the first Government created a system of three-day deliveries.  If you were in the country, you did not get a letter between Friday and Monday. This system was improved gradually and, of course, the inter-Party Government had a lot to do with it.  The following Fianna Fáil Government and the second inter-Party Government improved it further until eventually there was a daily delivery.  That is one angle. There is another but I am not too sure about it.  In the area in which I live letters come as early as I want them, normally at about 8 a.m., but in other parts of the city people have left home long before delivery.  I am not putting undue emphasis on that.  What I want to emphasise is another aspect of the service.  Most of the late collection boxes in the city have all gone.  I am not a barrister, a medical doctor or a businessman working hard who wants to post letters late at night but once in a while there are certain communications which can be made only in writing and I have the greatest difficulty in finding anywhere at which to post a letter late at night.  Last collections are now made at 8 p.m.  There used to be collections at 11 p.m. and there were collections as late as 2 o'clock in the morning.  That is a deterioration in the service.  At the same time, the charge is 4½ times what it was during the war and twice what it was in 1965.</P>
    <P>We have been told that one of the reasons why more frequent deliveries of letters in the country were stopped was that the Post Office were losing money.  It is a long time since they lost money and I am wondering if they will not run into trouble because of these new charges.  I know of organisations which are making other arrangements. The Minister is probably aware that there are large organisations who will have no trouble in passing their letters around themselves, particularly in view of this new charge of 9.6 old pennies. It would be quite remunerative for large organisations to make their own <Col N="520" /> arrangements instead of paying the increased charges and it will not surprise me a bit if the Minister finds the Post Office revenue turning downwards.</P>
    <P>One thing that astounds me is the extent to which people who have had telephones installed for years have to pay substantially increased charges.  I admit it is not easy to have different rates for something like the telephone but where a telephone was installed 25 or 20 years ago and where the rent and the labour have long since been paid for, surely there is a case for not increasing the rent.  What is the case for increasing it?  What I am saying is that if the service charges have long since been paid for, when the cost of installation has been reimbursed, surely the rental charge should remain the same.</P>
    <P>Of course, such a suggestion does not appeal to the present Government. Neither does any suggestion of economy because there is not the slightest evidence of economy at the present time.  Economy may be a dirty word but as far as John O'Donovan is concerned it means looking after things carefully.  Economy is a much more serious matter on this Estimate than is the suggestion that we have too many commissions of inquiry.  We will have untold opportunities for discussing the matter of inquiries and we will have at least one ample opportunity.  Therefore, the Minister should now set about creating a situation of improved productivity, as it is called.  I am not thinking of machines.  I am extremely sceptical of the operation of machines because the fellow who sells you a machine can always prove it will save you this and that, but experience is a different matter.  I urge the Minister to try to bring about a situation in the Post Office where there will be no further increases in postal, telegram or telephone charges for many years to come. Those charges have now reached a point where, to use Mr. Lemass's words, they have reached a new plateau.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the point in his speech on this Estimate that the accounts are compiled in accordance with commercial practice. <Col N="521" /> He made reference to a balance sheet being available but I have not been able to get it.  I have the financial notes prepared for the assistance of Deputies. There is one thing which appears from the Minister's speech and from those notes which cuts across the claim that these are commercial accounts.  It is this: the rate of interest at which money is borrowed for investment purposes in the Post Office is 8½ per cent. This is a rate which is not available to the commercial sector.  If in this instance a non-commercial rate of interest operates in the Post Office, then all their activities are possibly on a non-commercial basis, despite the Minister's claim to the contrary.</P>
      <P>The general picture is a gloomy one because despite the fantastic increases during the year in letter charges, telephone charges and telegraph charges the Minister forecasts a loss of about £1 million this year and a similar figure for next year.  Any commercial venture which would forecast such a loss for this year and for next year must be in very deep water.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The disappointing thing is that there is no indication in the Minister's speech of any remedies that might be taken to reduce that loss next year.  We presume it will not be possible to do anything about it this year because time is too far advanced. Next year we are apparently faced with a loss of £1 million and no apparent remedies are offered to counteract that position.</P>
      <P>It is quite apparent that, were it not for the profitability of the telephone service, the losses would be astronomical altogether.  The expenditure in the postal services has gone up by a steady 10 per cent each year.  Income, according to those figures, has more or less kept apace.  The deficit at the moment on that part of the operation is manageable because of the profitability of the telephone account side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The telegraph accounts show much the same picture.  In the last ten years the surplus on the working of the telephone service has doubled itself, but in the last two years the picture is not <Col N="522" /> so happy.  There is still a growth in that section but the rate of growth is not keeping pace with the rate of expenditure <i>vis-à-vis</i> income.  It will not be too long until we will have warning signs in regard to the telephone accounts as well as the other accounts.  I would compare the telephone accounts in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to the position of the Dublin buses in regard to CIE.  The Dublin buses kept the losses in CIE within a fairly reasonable figure for a good number of years, but this year the surplus on the working of the Dublin buses is away down and there is an anticipated loss.  The same trend seems to be apparent in the money-making section of this Department, that is the telephone section.  When the surplus is there, it is caught up on by expenditure.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why if commercial standards, which is the standard the Minister wants to apply, were applied to the working of the telephones section a surplus would not merely be increased but would be increased vastly.  Two things are necessary in order to do this.  There must be a vastly increased investment in telephones and the operation of the telephone system must be put on a more efficient basis.  The investment must be on a more efficient basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes the point that there a grave shortage of capital, which is something we are all well aware of. Apparently capital for telephone services suffers because of this.  It would seem to me that within the Post Office itself there would be a source of investment. I should like the Minister to state why the funds available within the Post Office, in the savings section, could not be made available for investment in telephones&mdash;the most profitable part of the operation.  There may be some reason why those funds cannot be invested in that manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech dealt in some detail with the savings section. The amount of money which is turned over in this service is quite fantastic. He says:</P>
    <P>The aggregate result for 1969 for the savings media with which my Department is directly concerned <Col N="523" /> was a net saving of £4.8 million exclusive of interest.  Figures for 1970 are not yet available, but it is probable that the corresponding figure will be of the order of £20 million.</P>
    <P>I do not know what precisely that means, but to my mind it must mean that this sum of money was in the Department and was available.  It was a net saving.  If figures of that magnitude are available they should be available to the Department to invest in the sector of that Department which is most profitable, that is the telephones. It defies reason that money is not poured into the telephone service because there is an insatiable demand among the public for telephones and for telephonic services generally.  There is a very long waiting list and when all those people are satisfied it will produce a profit for the Department.  I fail to understand why there should not be a vigorous drive to satisfy that demand and take advantage of the potential profit in that huge list of people waiting for telephones.</P>
    <P>The money for this would appear to be available within the Department. The excuse that there is a shortage of capital would not seem to be relevant in that regard.  The Minister's speech is strangely silent as to the amount that was invested in telephones last year.  He does not say whether it was enough to meet requirements, whether they wanted more but he was not able to give it to them, or whether what he gave them was enough.  He gives no indication whether enough is being provided for next year.  We have no details in regard to what the telephone section feel they could usefully use. We have no indication why they would not get that figure and we have no indication at all about the detailed investment in telephones.</P>
    <P>I am subject to correction on this but I think the Minister said in his statement that he does not yet know how much he is going to get for next year.  How can there be forward, profitable planning unless the Minister and his Department know at an early date how much money will be available? This again cuts across the Minister's claim that the Post Office is run on <Col N="524" /> commercial lines.  It would be an odd business indeed that would be heading into a year without knowing what sum it was going to invest in its most profitable sector to ensure continued growth in it.  It is a great pity that the telephones are neglected in the way they are.  We do not know even whether the available capital is being well spent.</P>
    <P>I have heard a whisper, and no more than a whisper, that there is considerable dissent within the Department about the method of forward planning in regard to telephone equipment, who decides what type of equipment will be purchased, the time it will be purchased and if when it is purchased the engineers and technicians and ancillary equipment will be all available to ensure speedy and efficient installation. I do not know if that is an entirely happy subject within the Department at present but, if it is not, it should be looked into urgently.</P>
    <P>The Minister confesses that in some areas service is below standard because of overloading.  He said that some areas were awaiting installation of equipment which was ordered a considerable time ago.  How long ago? What type of equipment?  Is it extremely sophisticated equipment or is it everyday run of the mill equipment? This again would seem to substantiate the point I am making that the system of buying is not all it should be because equipment ordered by a customer as big as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should be delivered when ordered.  If it cannot be delivered the Department should change their suppliers.  The Minister also said the bad standard of service has been because of difficulty in dealing, within the resources at their disposal, with all the areas in which improvements are needed.  That is another way of saying that he is not making sufficient resources available to meet the demand.  I should like to hear the Minister deal with the point about using the capital available within the Post Office itself.  It does seem extraordinary that the Minister can say that, so far as the telephone service is concerned, the amount of capital available for the coming year, which has not yet been settled, will be a major <Col N="525" /> factor in determining the extent to which it will be possible to implement schemes for improvement and expansion. A major factor.  It is the only factor.  Therefore, the fact that the amount of capital has not yet been settled for the coming year makes it an impossible task to plan ahead.  This may be the reason why supplies are not being delivered: because orders are not being received with any regularity, they are coming too late.</P>
    <P>Another disturbing matter is the increase in expenditure.  Over the past ten years expenditure increased nearly four times on the telephone account but the surplus has only doubled.  It is a disturbing trend and I should like to see a vigorous campaign to arrest expenditure, or certainly to maintain the ratio between the increase in expenditure and the increase in surplus.  In terms of real money the surplus has not doubled and it is a warning sign that the growth in surplus has not matched the growth in expenditure.</P>
    <P>One section of the Department's operations which is being neglected is in regard to the provision of public telephone kiosks.  The Department claim to be a commercial concern but they are first and foremost a Government Department and to that extent must serve the public need.  The provision of kiosks for the general public should be a matter of concern and should get priority.  I find it difficult to know at exactly what rate these are being erected.  The Minister says that over 100 new kiosks, including 65 rural kiosks, were provided in 1969-70 but in the notes which were issued for our guidance it is stated that the average each year is 40 to 50 and that it is hoped to reach 150 rural kiosks each year.  It is difficult to know exactly how many are being erected.  It seems too, that there is very rigid planning in regard to where kiosks should be situated.</P>
    <P>Recently I asked the Department to provide a kiosk for what I might call a suburb of Athlone, Garrycastle, which is a local authority housing scheme.  You might call it a dormitory suburb in modern gobbledygook.  The scheme consists of 100 houses not one of which has a private telephone.  It is <Col N="526" /> a place in which there is a constant demand for public telephones and if one was installed it would have a high rate of use.  But because it is not part of the Department's pre-ordained plan a kiosk cannot be established there.  I was told that there was one at Bunavalley Bridge which is about one and a half miles away on the main Dublin road at a notoriously dangerous section of the road, where three fatal accidents have taken place in the last six months.  The people of Garrycastle have to travel a mile and a half, some of it along this extremely dangerous road, to use that kiosk.  The kiosk is situated in a white collar area in which most of the people in the adjoining houses have their own telephones. It is a matter of social justice that the kiosk should be transferred to the local authority area where none of the houses has its own telephone.  I fail to understand why the Department would not erect a kiosk in a place where there is an obvious demand for it instead of putting the burden on people who have to travel considerable distances and very often over dangerous roads.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a serious imbalance between the number of telephone kiosks in Dublin and the number in the provinces.  In Dublin, there are 500 kiosks while there are 1,280 in the remainder of the country.  The availability of a kiosk is much more important in rural Ireland than in a densely-populated area like Dublin where there are many private telephones available in shops.</P>

      <P>I presume that the position in this regard is better in some parts of the country than in others but I have no doubt that the Minister, not having a Dublin bias, will see to it that the apparent bias as to the installation of kiosks will be reversed and that rural Ireland will receive a greater share in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am somewhat puzzled as to forward planning in the Department and the information made available to Deputies.  On the 11th February last, I asked the Minister what was the cost of converting telephone coin boxes <Col N="527" /> consequent on the increase of local calls to 6d and how long this would take.  In reply, the Minister told me that the cost was about £40,000 and that the time required was within three months.  According to the Minister, there is a total of 24,500 call boxes in the country.  If these boxes were to be converted within three months, the operation would have to be completed within 65 days.  This would mean converting 350 boxes per day.  I raised this point because it seems to me that it would be a tremendous achievement if the Department were able to deal with 350 boxes each day.  If the Department can do this, they should be able to speed up the rate of installation of new telephones.  The cost at £40,000 would work out at approximately £1.75 for each box.  That seems to be tremendous value because I presume at least two men and a van would be required to carry out the operation and if the men were only to drive to where the box was and drive back, it would cost the Department at least £1.75.  Looking at the figure in that light, I am sure the Minister will agree that it seems odd.  I wonder whether the figure is accurate.</P>
    <P>On the same day I was told that the cost of conversion to decimals will be an estimated £127,000 and I was told that the operation would take about three months to complete.  Again, I cannot accept that this can be done in three months.  If it were to be done in this time, every other operation of the telephone section would have to be curtailed seriously if not suspended.</P>
    <P>The important point that arises here is that at the time of the conversion to the sixpenny coin, it was known that decimal currency was on its way so that the Department would have been aware that a further conversion would have to be carried out.  Therefore, this would appear to have been an uneconomic exercise because it necessitated two changes within a comparatively short period of time.  That was bad planning.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister stated that the general operation of his Department was under review.  In this regard, I would appeal to the Minister not to let in McKinsey.  I hope that whoever <Col N="528" /> is carrying out the investigation is not one of these bluff merchants.  I am convinced that there is sufficient intellect and commonsense within the Department to form a competent committee for the purpose of carrying out a review.  It is important, too, that if the investment is to be adequate, it would be properly invested and that there would be advanced buying so that there would not be a situation, such as that mentioned in the Minister's statement, of waiting on supplies. I would have thought that a national Department would be sufficiently big to be able to lay down the law as to their supplies and that they would be able to ensure they would get their supplies in time and as required.  I wonder if the cause of the delays is faulty ordering.  Who plans the buying? Is it planned by the engineers or by some other section?  What arrangements are made or what plans are laid for proper and efficient buying?  There might be something in that respect that could be investigated.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the problem of lack of technical staff is being overcome by the special department scholarship scheme.  That is heartening news.  I would hope that that scheme would be extended both at the engineering and technical-level.  If we are to have an efficient telephone service, we must use sophisticated modern equipment and that cannot be used or installed unless we have sophisticated and modern technicians.</P>
    <P>In regard to the telephone service generally, I would urge that there be no slackening in the rate of investment and that the possibility would be considered of using funds that are within the Department and their savings branch in the extension and improvement of the service.  I would like the Minister to deal with that point when he is replying.  If the investment can be made available, I am sure there is sufficient intelligence within the Department to see that it is used efficiently. It defies reason why a monopoly with a growing demand and having a sizeable and profitable product, should not make every effort to satisfy that demand and take advantage of the profit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="529" /> It would appear from the Minister's statement that the increased charges which were imposed some time ago had to be made to meet increased costs.  However, we are not told why there were such increased costs and neither were we told that these costs are to be contained in the future.  It is no answer to increase charges continually. At some stage there will be a reaction.  As the Minister said, the Post Office is a commercial type of business and is run on a commercial basis. But, no one should take advantage of a monopoly position.  Increases in charges will have to be considered from the point of view of containing them and not from meeting them all the time by way of increased revenue.</P>
    <P>I should not like to see introduced here the British system of first-class and second-class mail.  By and large, our mail collection and delivery service is good.  There are some people in Dublin who regret that there is no longer a Saturday postal delivery. However, this arrangement is realistic because the amount of business now being carried out on Saturdays is becoming less and less and hardly warrants the expense of a Saturday delivery.  Whether the same should apply in rural Ireland is a moot point. I do not think it should apply yet because the five-day week is not sufficiently universal in rural Ireland to do away with Saturday delivery.  This is a comparatively small community, small compared with Britain, and there would be no need for the kind of first-class and second-class mail they have introduced.  In any event, the cost of our ordinary mail is the cost of their first-class mail so the Department would have nothing to gain by introducing any variation of that kind.</P>
    <P>With regard to postal deliveries, deliveries could be done in rural areas if postmen were provided with scooters or autocycles.  Many have their own actually and are allowed to use them. The regulation in that regard has been very sensibly relaxed.  Motorisation would speed up deliveries and possibly effect an economy in the number of postmen employed because, if they were provided with scooters or some kind of mechanical transport, the <Col N="530" /> delivery area could be vastly increased. From the breakdown of expenses manpower is the most expensive element in the operations of the Department.</P>
    <P>In the notes provided I notice that income and expenditure in the case of agency services match exactly and have done so over the past ten years.  I do not understand that and I should be glad if the Minister would explain what exactly is involved and why there is no profit in these agency services.  I think there should be a profit.  It seems to me there could be a great deal of profit in them.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that the value of money orders was £37.7 million and the value of postal orders was £8.9 million. These two figures represent a staggering sum and this should be a most profitable piece of business for the Post Office.  I agree that these agency services should be provided free for the Department of Social Welfare but in the case of money orders and postal orders there is no reason why this should not be a most profitable operation. Would it not also be a source of investment for the telephone service? There is an increasing flow of money and I have no doubt but that it will continue.  I cannot see anything wrong in the Department using that money for investment in its most profitable sector, the telephone.  That would leave other Government capital available for Departments which do not generate capital.</P>
    <P>The time has come when the Department should consider seriously introducing the Giro system.  This has been advocated in the past and consistently rejected.  Why I do not know.  It has a tremendous profit potential.  Whilst the commercial banks were closed the Department acted as the poor man's bank and that is all the Giro system asks one to do.  I join with the Minister in the praise he gave his Department for the work they did during the bank strike.  The services they provided alleviated the hardships caused by that intolerable strike or lock-out.  The Post-Office was able to handle a vastly increased volume of work most efficiently and most competently and, I am certain, with profit when we see the figures <Col N="531" /> next year.  This proves that the Giro system should be introduced into the Post Office.  It is widespread on the Continent and highly successful there. The Department have a duty to what I describe as &ldquo;the small man&rdquo; to ensure that he is no longer dependent on the whims of the directors of our commercial banks.  Basic facilities should be made available to him through the agency of the Post Office.  The reviewing body should seriously consider the establishment of this system.  If it is profitable there should be no hesitation in introducing it.  The Minister and his Department should not be held back by any consideration for the finer feelings of the commercial banks.  They do not deserve any such consideration because of the way in which they deprived the public of their services for the greater part of last year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the tribunal of inquiry into the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme on moneylending, it would appear from the Minister's speech that he has accepted the criticisms in the tribunal's report.  He mentions their lucid analysis of the matters on which they were asked to report and he refers to the severe criticism the report contains. He mentions one specific matter: in presenting a picture of laxity on the part of the Garda the programme was not authentic.  That was the tribunal's findings.  He does not say what passed between himself and the Authority but the implication is clear.  Having accepted the tribunal's findings, noted their severe criticism and their actual finding of something that was not authentic, one must presume that the Minister had something sharp and critical to say to Radio Telefís Éireann. I have read the report and the appendix to the report which contains the programme in question.  It seems to me that the case the tribunal were asked to find against this programme has not been made.  The kernel of the matter is contained in chapter 4 of the report. The title of the chapter is &ldquo;Consideration of the Authenticity of the Programme and the Other Matters referred to in the Tribunal under Heading 2 of the Terms of Reference&rdquo;.  Heading 2 of the terms of reference dealt with the authenticity of the programme and, <Col N="532" /> in particular with the adequacy of the information on which it was based, the number of moneylenders, violence, whether there was reasonable journalistic care on the part of those responsible for the programme.</P>
    <P>On page 62 of the report the tribunal set out certain things the programme stated or implied.  There is a world of difference between a statement and an implication.  A statement is a matter of fact but the meaning of an implication is essentially a subjective judgment.  To this extent the tribunal are themselves open to criticism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I shall comment without being critical.  I take it it is not a criticism to disagree with the tribunal's findings.  The first thing the programme stated or implied was that illegal moneylending represented a social problem of serious proportion in the urban area of Dublin.  The report indicates that this was not so, but it would appear from reading the report that it was, in fact, a social problem of serious proportions in the urban areas of Dublin.  Paragraph 135 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we have indicated we found that the programme was authentic in <Col N="533" /> that illegal moneylending does exist and is a problem of serious proportions in certain areas.</P>
    <P>There is no criticism there of the programme.</P>
    <P>The next thing the tribunal states the programme stated was that moneylending was widespread and pervasive in all areas of the city and that it was expanding.  The tribunal took issue with the programme on that particular fact.  At page 68 of the Report it states that there is little or no moneylending in the majority of corporation estates. There is a world of difference between &ldquo;little&rdquo; or &ldquo;none&rdquo;.  There is either moneylending or there is not.  It is clear from other statements made by the tribunal that they found there was moneylending in the centre of the city, in Crumlin, Cabra, Finglas, Coolock, Whitehall, Raheny and Sallynoggin. This covers the entire working class parts of the city.</P>
    <P>The tribunal admit that the programme was correct when it said that moneylending was widespread and pervasive in all areas of the city.  They take issue with the statement in regard to the number of unlicensed moneylenders. They spent a great deal of time analysing figures brought in by the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Garda, Telefís Éireann and social workers and decide that the number was not 500.  They would appear to have a genuine criticism with regard to that.</P>
    <P>The tribunal said the programme alleged that unlicensed moneylenders preserve anonymity and secrecy of their operations by deliberately inculcating fear and that serious physical violence was, in fact, inflicted on borrowers. Some people who appeared on the programme said that, but none of the commentators did.  They asked leading questions which the tribunal objected to in order to procure answers dealing with physical violence and fear.  When reviewing the evidence the tribunal stated in the case of women borrowers there can be little doubt that lenders do use the threat of disclosure.  They referred to one case where there was evidence of a more serious form of blackmail.  They mentioned that there <Col N="534" /> had been an indication of some form of intimidation.  If the threat of black-mail and the threat of physical intimidation are not calculated to induce fear and preserve the anonymity of the moneylender exercising the threats the language has lost its meaning.  That statement of fact by the programme is admitted by the tribunal as being correct.</P>
    <P>The last statement paid tribute to the programme in which they went on to consider the Garda were guilty of laxity in detecting the operations of unlicensed moneylenders and in prosecuting offenders.  It is a matter of opinion whether the tribunal made that accusation or not.  On reading the programme as a whole, I took the view that the Garda had not brought prosecutions although they might possibly have taken prosecutions, but whether they would have got convictions was another matter.  It would appear that the Garda did not institute prosecutions and I think the programme was entitled to comment on this fact without being criticised by the tribunal as if it had committed some sort of serious offence in criticising the Garda.  If the reporters connected with the programme were able to get evidence to satisfy the tribunal that moneylending was a serious problem in the centre of the city and was taking place in all the working-class suburbs of the city, it is fair comment to ask why the Garda do not do something about it.</P>
    <P>The fact that the tribunal was set up is a disturbing precedent.  The fact that its report appears to have been accepted I can only assume holus bolus by the Minister and criticism on foot of it conveyed to the Department are also disturbing.  It goes very near an unwarrantable censorship of journalists carrying out their duties in a <i>bona fide</i> manner.</P>
    <P>One issue on which the tribunal severely criticised the programme was failure to comply with what they set out as canons of journalistic standard and journalistic care.  They heard from three experienced journalists, two newspapermen and one sub-editor in television and they laid down the norm. I submit that the norm which might be <Col N="535" /> applicable in a theoretical situation cannot be applied to people making a television programme highlighting a social evil of the type this programme highlighted.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that when the Minister is making an introductory speech he highlights the nice things relating to his Department.  He will highlight the matters he wants to draw attention to even though they might not necessarily be the most important.  If a television programme is presented in the same way and in the same manner as a learned article in a technical journal very few people will heed it.  The purpose of television is to entertain and enlighten.  This programme set out to expose a social evil and it appears to me that if it was to be effective it had to be presented dramatically.  In effect, the programme was criticised as being over-dramatic in its presentation.  Its essential authenticity cannot be denied and that is the kernel of the matter.  If the Minister shows any reaction to Telefís Éireann which might in any way inhibit the crusading spirit that made that programme he is doing a serious disservice to the station.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The first matter I wish to deal with is an item in which I have been interested and I raised it on the Adjournment on one occasion.  It is the policy which is in operation by the Minister's Department in regard to the siting of rural telephone kiosks and I think Deputy Cooney also referred to this matter.  The system of selection of areas for the erection of telephone kiosks is unduly rigid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A telephone kiosk is an essential in every rural area because people in those areas are much more isolated from various services than those who live in large centres of population.  For example, in the event of their requiring medical assistance the only method of speedy communication is by telephone. It is important that any policy which seeks to counteract this sense of isolation should be broad in application and sufficiently flexible to suit the peculiar needs of each area. <Col N="537" /> The present policy in regard to the provision of rural telephone kiosks is the reverse.  It is unduly rigid and appears to have been constructed solely for the convenience of civil servants to enable them to take the minimum number of awkward decisions.  They appear to have a readymade formula which determines whether a telephone kiosk should be provided and this formula is not relevant to the needs of the area except in an indirect way.  The use of this formula enables the people concerned to wash their hands of any genuine investigation of the areas requesting kiosks.</P>
    <P>If an area has a post office and the phone in the post office is used to a certain extent, that district will get a kiosk.  If the place has not got a post office it will not be considered for a telephone kiosk, unless the county council are prepared to erect one and bear the loss themselves.  I might add that very few county councils are prepared to do this.  I asked Meath County Council to do this in a few areas in my constituency and they refused.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that areas which do not have post offices are not even given consideration in the matter of the provision of telephone kiosks.  Many of the areas may require a kiosk on social grounds.  The kiosks may not make a profit but the isolation of the areas concerned warrant the provision of this service.  It can be said fairly that if an area has a post office it is not so isolated and, therefore, does not require a telephone kiosk to the same extent as the more remote areas.</P>
    <P>To take the usage of the post office telephone as representative of the actual need for telephonic communication in the area is not fair.  The position could obtain, as it does in many areas, that there are a number of licensed premises and shops which have coin-operated telephones on the premises. During the day-time people in the area might use these telephones, to the exclusion of the post office telephone. However, in an area where the post office telephone is the only telephone available the number of users would be much greater.  Areas such as the latter would get a telephone kiosk <Col N="538" /> much more readily, solely due to the greater number of calls made in the post office.</P>
    <P>The situation in this regard is most unsatisfactory. I have in mind the village of Kilmessan in my constituency which might well be ruled out simply because it has a large number of shops with coin box telephones.  Clonee is another instance.  It is situated on the main road and has a number of licensed premises.  During the day motorists can stop in the village and make telephone calls but from 11.30 p.m. to 10 a.m. it is impossible for motorists to telephone from the village as a kiosk is not provided.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland the authorities provide kiosks both on busy and isolated roads.  I remember travelling to Donegal and on the road past Ennis-killen I noticed a kiosk in the middle of the countryside.  To my mind the provision of a kiosk in such an area is sensible but under our system there is no provision made for the erection of kiosks in isolated areas.  The sole criterion is whether a post office is in the area concerned and the usage of the telephone in the post office.</P>
    <P>I wish now to turn to the question of staff rules 8 and 9 which govern officials in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I asked the Minister nine or ten months ago whether anything was to be done by him to ensure that people, at least in the lower positions in the Department, would be in a position to engage in political activity.  The Minister said he was looking into the matter very sympathetically and he conveyed, by the very concerned expression on his face, that he meant this and that something would be done immediately.</P>

      <P>Last week I was dealing with the question of Partition and I was saying that, as a young man, I disagreed with the idea that this country should be partitioned but that this is no longer an argument.  It is now an established fact that the country is divided in two and therefore we must start the debate from that point.  If we accept that this is a small nation divided into two statelets we must ask ourselves how do we use what Michael Collins called a stepping-stone to reunite this country and also what does a united Ireland mean.  Some people see a united Ireland as merely taking away the Border, closing their eyes and hoping that everything will turn out well.  Some people see it as a republican victory over unionism.  Some people north of the Border see it as a defeat of unionism.  Some people see it as a place where we would all live happily ever after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know well that the troubles that exist north of the Border will not go away if we close our eyes.  They will not disappear overnight.  These problems have bedevilled this nation for far too long.  I believe that a united Ireland is something more than people realise.  If Chichester-Clark arrived tomorrow morning in this capital city of Dublin with all the right-wing elements of the Unionist Party and if they were to say to the Taoiseach: &ldquo;We now accept the tricolour as being our flag.  We accept everything that is republican.  We accept the Soldiers' Song as our National Anthem.  We want you to take away the Border.  We have all been wrong.  At the moment <Col N="540" /> we have free trade with Britain and Britain has free trade with us.  If you take away the Border we want immediate access to the southern Irish market and you can have access to the northern market&rdquo;, if that were to happen I believe that many people south of the Border would suffer.  In fact I would go so far as to say that some people would contemplate suicide.</P>
    <P>This country is not ready for reunification, economically speaking.  We have the example of what is happening in the car industry at the moment.  We know what would happen if the Border were taken away and if the motor assembly plants in Britain were to supply motor vehicles to this country. We know they consider it uneconomic to assemble vehicles in the six north-eastern countries and we know that they would arrive at the same conclusion in relation to the 26 Counties if they had immediate access to our markets. Many more industries would fall.  We know what is happening in the textile industry at the moment.  We know what is happening the shoe manufacturing companies.  To those idealistic republicans who say: &ldquo;Take away the Border and we will change all this&rdquo; I say: &ldquo;Let us change it now before we take away the Border for this is what we should have been doing for the last 50 years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have had conversations with many Unionist people whom I know personally north of the Border.  I had a conversation with a Protestant businessman in the town of Strabane six or seven months ago.  Over a cup of tea in a hotel I expressed my political views and I said that perhaps he would not accept those views.  To my amazement he said: &ldquo;Yes, I do accept them.  When I see advancement, when I see that my business can expand by taking away the Border then I will consider taking away the Border.&rdquo; That man was thinking in terms of progress, and also of the people whom he employed whose positions would be consolidated if he were allowed to develop his business.</P>
    <P>Here is part of the problem as far as I can see it.  We must prepare ourselves economically for a united Ireland. In my humble opinion this country is not ready, economically, for <Col N="541" /> a united Ireland, even if we were to solve all our political differences and all the sidetracks that go with that.  Let me sound this note of warning: If we are not ready for a united Ireland we are certainly not ready for entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>The solution to reunification, as I see it, is to be found north of the Border.  If we can unite the people there then the reunification of this country will be only a matter of time. To get to that position I believe we must be big enough, politically speaking, to recognise that there are a million people north of the Border who have not yet accepted the idea of a 32-county Ireland separated from Britain. While the generation that set up this Parliament may not have shared these views, the generation before them may have shared them.  It was not always Protestants who held the philosophy of unionism.  Unionism is a philosophy, and I recognise that people are quite entitled to hold it.  I do not share it, but I recognise the fact that Irish people north of the Border see a political philosophy in Unionism, that they want close association with Britain and at the moment they stand to gain financially by that close association. They are just as entitled to hold that philosophy as the southern Irish republicans are entitled to hold a philosophy of Sinn Féin.  What has happened north of the Border is that the philosophy of Unionism has got mixed up with the Unionist Party leaders trying to keep themselves in power, trying to perpetuate their own political existence and protect themselves in privileged positions.  This has been tied up with the idea, fairly held by the average Protestant man north of the Border, that he wants close association with Britain.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I recognise that there are many things north of the Border that are very confusing.  It is not easy to grasp what is happening there.  Far be it from me to stand here and say: &ldquo;This is the clear way to reunification.&rdquo;  There is no clear way to reunification that any of us can see.  We will not get instant solutions. The solutions will only be found by trial and error.  We have tried many ways but we have not progressed from <Col N="542" /> where we were when debates took place here some 50 years ago.  Thirty-nine years ago Fianna Fáil took control of this country for the first time.  Two generations of Irish people have been born since then and two of the things which took Fianna Fáil into office still stand unattended to.  They are (1) reunification and (2) restoration of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Last week in the Dáil a question was asked by Deputy Paddy O'Reilly of Cavan.  It was a simple question asking the Minister for Education to grant permission to vocational schools, national schools and secondary schools to have the right to decide whether they would teach subjects through Irish or not.  The Minister for Education, full of Republican idealism, said that everyone must learn the language and that there is no evidence to show that pupils were retarded in their educational standards by learning it or learning other subjects through it. That view may be held by people on both sides of the Border who come from Nationalist homes.  However, there are people on both sides of the Border, who have Sinn Féinism in their subconscious minds and who would love to have a united Ireland, but who question whether it is right to teach other subjects through the medium of Irish.  How can a Government ruling 26 counties tell a Unionist parent that, if he comes into a united Ireland, his child must learn Irish and study other subjects through the medium of Irish?  I agree.  Many Protestant people in the North have learned Irish.  I know of two Presbyterian Ministers who have sent their children to schools where they could learn Irish.  One cannot be educated in a language that one does not understand.</P>
    <P>Politicians in this country must realise that there are two situations in this small island at present.  We are happy south of the Border, but the people north of the Border are not so happy.  As a stepping stone to reunification, we must reunite those people who live north of the Border. Law and order must be restored in the North but it must be the same law for Catholics and for Protestants. <Col N="543" /> There must be the same type of order for the Unionists and the anti-Unionists. Fair standards must be fairly applied. The Irish people, Catholic and Protestant, who consider themselves moderates must come together in the North to replace the Unionist Party, which has failed so miserably to govern a part of this island.  The Unionist Party must be replaced before there can be any semblance of law and order.  The Catholics do not want the Unionist Party; and some Protestants suspect it.  It has never served any useful purpose and must be replaced. The sooner Protestant people or former Unionist supporters realise that in their own interest, they must come together with former Nationalist supporters to form a party to replace the Unionist Party and to provide a democratic system of government, the better.  If we could reach a stage where people could live happily together north of the Border I, for one, would be prepared to give full and absolute recognition to a Stormont Parliament if all those living in that part of the country were prepared to accept it. If that stage could be reached, the reunification of this country would be a mere formality.  Many arguments have been put forward as to how this can be done.  The polarisation of the Left as against the Right has been suggested by some people.  Extreme Left policies will not solve the issue but the ultra conservatives do not have all the answers either.  Irish people in general are not particularly interested in this type of politics.  They desire a broadly-based political system north of the Border which will provide a Just Society which would serve all sections of the people.  If that position is arrived at we will be near reunification.</P>
    <P>My choice would be a united Ireland with one Parliament but that is not possible just now.  So if we could have a peaceful Ireland with two Parliaments I would be prepared to accept the position.  If we were to have a police force which was fair to everybody, and civil servants in close communication with each other, I would see no objection to it.  If we could have Partition as a mere county boundary, what is the difference?  The reunification <Col N="544" /> of this country may not take place in my life time.  Why the rush?  There is no instant solution to this problem. There is a thorny road ahead.  If we stay on the right road the solution to the problem will be found.  There are too many people who wish to be an instant Pádraig Pearse or Michael Collins.  Time does not permit me to develop the arguments on this occasion.</P>
    <P>There have been discussions recently about the Constitution of the country. The leader of the Fine Gael and the chief whip of the party were right when they said that the Constitution enacted at the foundation of this State was a much more liberal Constitution than the one put forward in 1937 by what we can politely term the ultra-republican party.  The Fianna Fáil Party claim that the 1937 Constitution applies to the 32 counties.  How can they justly make this claim when Irishmen in six of the counties have not had the privilege of supporting or rejecting it?  It does not apply to the 32 counties.  We have talked of changing the Constitution.  Changing it will not bring us nearer reunification.  It is necessary that the Taoiseach should say that if the people north of the Border wish to reunite with us when that particular time comes we will have a Constitution which they will participate in making and they will have a right to decide whether they want it or not.  Contraception has been made an issue by some Northern people.  My view on contraception is that, if a person of a particular religion is permitted by his religion to practise it, there is no reason why the laws of the land should interfere with him.  I hold a similar view on divorce.  We fight among ourselves down here as political parties holding certain political views.  I, as a Fine Gael Member, believe that the policies of the Fine Gael Party are much better than the policies of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I recognise that Members of Fianna Fáil are entitled to their views, but I believe that at a certain stage we must be prepared to divorce ourselves from all political affiliations and stand up as Irishmen and speak as Irishmen.  If we are prepared to do that we must also recognise that Protestants north of the Border have the same right to <Col N="545" /> call themselves Irishmen as we have. Therefore, in a pluralist society people should be entitled to take certain decisions and live by certain standards and we should not push our way of life down the throats of a million people who have not yet even indicated that they are interested in uniting with us.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for External Affairs has not already taken up with the British authorities the fact that automatic barriers are appearing along the Border.  They are only reminding people that there is a barrier and a Border in this country. At this time we should be removing barriers instead of erecting them.  The barriers that are being erected are so ridiculous that to put them up is like putting up a glass bottle on a school-yard wall and telling a child: &ldquo;Do not throw stones.&rdquo;  I forecast that as fast as those barriers go up somebody will blast them away.  I have no objection to that provided no lives are lost, but this can happen and therefore erecting barriers can cause additional hazards.</P>
    <P>One of the most interesting evenings I ever spent as a young Deputy was spent listening to the former Deputies Paddy McGilligan and Seán MacEoin reminiscing about what happened years ago.  They told a few Deputies sitting around a table of what Kevin O'Higgins said the day before he was assassinated. There had been a Cabinet meeting and afterwards they were talking.  One member present said that it was so long since anybody has lost his life in the country, north or south, that all the killing was over and no more lives would be lost.  The conversation went along these lines until Kevin O'Higgins said: &ldquo;I am inclined to disagree.  I disagree because I fear Ireland is like a coral reef.&rdquo;  We know how these are formed: the shells fall down on each other until eventually the reef is above high water.  Nature then plays its part. Grass grows, palm trees grow and the sea washes up sand to form beaches. Then rich people from other parts of the world go there for a few hours pleasure.  The story goes that Kevin O'Higgins said: &ldquo;Likewise, I fear Ireland has yet to lose more lives before it becomes the island that other people believe it is.&rdquo;  Twenty-four hours later he was dead.  Now after another 24 <Col N="546" /> years, I ask: How many more Irish lives must be lost before this island becomes the island that other people believe it is?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties in contributing to the debate on this motion is that one must distinguish very sharply between the historic role of the use of revolutionary armed force and the resort today in Northern Ireland to the use of armed force in present political and social circumstances. Force was used to secure the partial political and economic independence we enjoy in the Republic today and, indeed, were it not for the fact that a very small and revolutionary group of quite unknown men in August, 1914, planned and plotted, organised, inspired and executed revolutionary change in the history of Ireland, we would not be talking in an Irish Parliament tonight.  Deputy Cosgrave is to be commended on bringing the motion before the House. The kernel of the debate is whether force should be used today as an instrument to secure Irish unity.  Indeed, this was the kernel of the debate at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, with all its undertones and all the wrangling and argument that went on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that, in the circumstances of Northern Ireland today and in the political evolution of Northern Ireland as seen in 1971, this motion should be formally adopted by the House, rejecting the use of force as an instrument to secure unity.  It is true that past policies of the Northern Ireland Government and many of their current policies have contributed to the present situation.  Likewise, the British Government share historical and current responsibility for this situation also.  The actions of British troops and military authorities&mdash;some of their troops&mdash;in relation to recent events particularly, in regard to selective searches for arms and by certain concentrations in minority areas in Northern Ireland have done very little to heal the wounds that have been reopened. This brings us to the point that we, as Members of the House, must make our views known on whether or not the people of Northern Ireland, any given section of them, should or should not respond to the <Col N="547" /> provocations of agitators in their midst whose views on the history of this country and on the future of the country give no hope whatever of peace or brotherhood among Irish people north and south.  Certainly, the attitude of those who favour the exclusive use of force as an instrument to secure unity seems to exclude, by and large, the promotion of any normal friendship between the people of north and south or the growth of goodwill in its best and truest sense, or the growth of co-operation and understanding so that mental barriers between the peoples of this island are broken down and the more powerful and more obvious physical barriers removed in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the superficial arguments used in favour of force in Northern Ireland today have been based on a great degree of ignorance in regard to the situation in the north.  That level of ignorance is not confined to Northern Ireland.  It is as prevalent in the Fianna Fáil Party as in any other group in the Republic today.  Therefore, this House must go on record as saying that senseless violence and destruction are the surest way of ensuring, whether in the short term or in the long, that the unity of Ireland will not be achieved.  The House must clearly place its views on record in that regard.  All Irishmen, irrespective of their place of residence and of the political outlook or creed they hold, tonight must stand appalled by the pernicious development of Irishmen today and yesterday and in recent months seeking one another out deliberately as Irishmen, as Republicans, and killing one another on the streets of Belfast.</P>
    <P>Those who indulge in this so-called political activity are playing into the hands of those who would be opposed to a united Ireland in the years ahead. It is therefore appropriate that we in this House should make a direct appeal to the Irish Republican Army factions in Northern Ireland, particularly in Belfast, to stop their senseless actions, to stop pitting one Belfast republican against another in the spurious hope that by that process they will achieve a united Ireland.  The situation has now deteriorated into mindless violence <Col N="548" /> which in the short term and in the long term will be completely counter-productive in relation to national unity.</P>
    <P>It is tragic to see that whatever policies the republican movement may have had in relation to civil rights in Northern Ireland, violence and the use of the gun have destroyed that movement and have left it with nothing more than young men who happen to possess guns and who are not quite sure what they might do with them. We have seen in recent months a complicated pattern of reprisals and counter reprisals emerging from those who profess, very superficially I believe, to protect the lives, the property and the civil liberties of the minority in Northern Ireland.  We have also seen a hardening of attitudes among republican factions in Northern Ireland who claim jurisdiction, on an almost tribal, ritualistic basis, over particular streets and areas.  In such a dispute last night Charles Hughes, who lived with his widowed mother in Serbia Street, was sub-machine gunned to death by republicans and at least three others were seriously wounded; another was beaten unconscious; and club premises were fired and destroyed.  A milk roundsman from the Upper Falls area, a trade unionst, a father of seven children, a man reputed to be a republican&mdash;of what shade I am not quite sure&mdash;was machine gunned by three young men as he delivered milk from his van this morning in the streets of Belfast.</P>
    <P>Is it not time that we in this House implored those who are responsible for the internal IRA battles to stop killing their fellow-Irishmen, their fellow-republicans?  We are entitled to make this plea to our fellow-Irishmen because if we fail to do so it would indeed be indicating that there are men in Ireland who lack elementary respect for the opinions of other men, for the families of other men and for their own families and for the future of this country.  It is equally appropriate that those in the south who claim to be republicans, that peculiar amalgam of associated individuals who profess loyalty to republicanism and so on, should be asked to bring their influence to bear on their fellow-republicans in Northern Ireland to stop this senseless killing of one <Col N="549" /> another.  I am quite sure that men of such intelligence and abilities will appreciate the futility of setting young Irishmen with guns against one another.  It is perhaps relevant to record in this House the attitude of a British Army officer last evening as Charles Hughes was shot or about to be shot by fellow-republicans: &ldquo;They are only killing one another and no shots are being fired at us or by us.&rdquo; Surely the relevance of that should not be lost on Irishmen in Northern Ireland?</P>
    <P>In view of the undertones of violence which certain Members of this House have always had in their speeches and in view of the fact that these indiscreet speeches have given rise to hopes in Northern Ireland which have not been and can never be fulfilled, let us assert once and for all that a gun in the hands of a young man does very little to increase the safety or the security of any section of the population in Northern Ireland; in fact we know it immeasurably increases the dangers to the whole community there and ultimately to the whole of the people of this island.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the saddest feature of all is that the braver the young man in Belfast, the more sincerely patriotic he is, the greater danger he represents to his fellow-Irishmen in Northern Ireland and the rest of the country.  It is tragic that there are people in Northern Ireland who believe that all that is required is to fire an anti-tank gun against a British armoured personnel carrier and hey presto a united Ireland is around the corner.  It must be realised that there is a great gulf of understanding between the Irish people North and South.  Let us appreciate that those in Northern Ireland who resort to violence as a solution to the problem are, by virtue of their actions, not capable of doing anything to lessen the realities of Partition and the social and economic consequences of Partition and are in no way lessening the all-pervasive power of the Unionist Party and the Orange Order in Northern Ireland.  On the contrary, every killing, every republican who crucifies a fellow-republican in Northern Ireland, every widow <Col N="550" /> in Northern Ireland arising out of such use of direct physical violence, every orphan in Northern Ireland who emerges from that situation, in fact only presents comfort, cold comfort admittedly, to the extremists in the Unionist Party, in the Orange Order, to persons like the Reverend Ian Paisley and to ultra-extremists like Craig.</P>
    <P>Surely it does not require hundreds of years of history and the years 1969 to 1971 to prove what is so self-evident in Northern Ireland?  It is perhaps inevitable that what is now happening in the North should happen.  It makes it all the more tragic that the placing of guns in the hands of such young men should have now produced the rather bloody by-product of that situation.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to lay particular charges at the door of any Member of this House in relation to such developments, but let it at least be recorded in no uncertain manner in this House&mdash; indeed let it be said from the rooftop of Dáil Éireann&mdash;that Twenty-six County republicans, be they Sinn Féin, official or unofficial, provisional or unprovisional, be they Fianna Fáil, official or unofficial, who obtained and ferried guns to Northern Ireland in the recent past, as we then knew, as we now know, as they now know, have a very grievous responsibility of their own creation which they cannot escape from in this life and which they certainly shall not escape from in the next&mdash;if we are sure such a position exists.</P>
    <P>Therefore, to those in the south who advocate violence, those of the Government party&mdash;we have none in the Opposition and this is a matter of pride in 1970-71&mdash;we say that they should go north and that they should stand before the audience in Northern Ireland now, in the Falls Road preferably, and that they should explain to those men who are fed on an exclusive diet of revolutionary armed insurrection, what they now suggest should be done.  Some of the snide Deputies of the Government party once threw across the floor of this House, &ldquo;Six divisions, six days, six counties&rdquo;.  Let them go north tonight and speak to the family of the father of seven children who was shot tonight by virtue of that kind of peculiar  <Col N="551" /> perversion of the resolution of the problem of national unity.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say much more in relation to that aspect but I should like to say that no real republican and particularly no real socialist republican can afford to become involved in sectarian armed militant confrontation or polarisation during the current situation in that part of our island.  Certainly it should be regarded as anathema by any progressive republican in Northern Ireland.  We have got to explain from the south to Protestant and Catholic workers that they have got to be brought to see they have an awful lot more in common with one another than they have with the Government who rule them now.  Most certainly this is the message that should go out from here by way of the second part of the motion before the House. We will have an extremely difficult problem in getting across to our people in the south that we have on our hands, whether we like it or not, essentially the old religious and social conflicts based on outdated allegations about the Pope and the Papacy, about king and about the monarchy, and we have a kind of morbid legacy of ritualistic religious hate practices which are a throw-back to a period when we as a people were pawns in the spiritual wars fought in Europe.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to get this across to our people.  Our educational system has never explained it properly to our children growing up and in the background of religious and political paranoia now existing in the north.  We have a long haul, decades ahead perhaps, before we manage to get through to that subculture in Northern Ireland in which there is such an extreme rigidity of class and religion and such deep conservatism on the political side.  We have a long way to go before we can get through the political sickness in Northern Ireland and explain to our people that physical force is by no means a solution to the problems of that part of the island.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to speak any further. I had intended to deal at length with civil rights and other aspects.  This motion is appropriate.  It is timely, with current disenchantment, disillusionment <Col N="552" /> and cynicism of a great many people towards the role of Parliament in the Republic, that at least from the position of the limited political independence we have in the Republic Dáil Éireann should be used at this critical time to refute, to reject and to place clearly on record that as far as we are concerned we do not hold out any olive branch, any Mickey Mouse proposition, in relation to contraception and divorce and so on.  They are important in their own right.  They are important in relation to citizens of the Republic, but they will not solve the problem of Partition and I do not think this kind of confusion should be brought into the problem at this point of time.  Therefore, I have pleasure in commending Deputy Cosgrave for moving the motion and I endorse his view that force should not be used as an instrument to secure the future unity of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery) Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>In case there may be any misinterpretation about the Minister for Foreign Affairs speaking to this motion, the Taoiseach asked me to take it on his behalf because he is occupied otherwise.  I do not know whether it is necessary to point out that Dáil Éireann has never, at any time, contemplated the use of force as an instrument to secure the unity of Ireland.  Indeed all parties represented in the Dáil must have exhausted every possible way of saying that the unity of the country should be sought by peaceful means only.  If Members of the Dáil consider it of any value formally to reject the use of force, Fianna Fáil will not oppose that in the hope that the people of Northern Ireland will be able to hear more clearly our unanimous voice in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Government party, the Taoiseach has repeatedly said we have no aggressive attitude or intention towards the north.  If the passing of this motion should help to reassure anyone who doubts us, then I am sure I speak for all members of the Government party in supporting its passage. It gives us an opportunity, perhaps, to comment on the situation at the present time.  We have listened attentively to recent statements of the <Col N="553" /> British Home Secretary, Mr. Maudling, during his visit to Belfast, statements concerning the elimination of discrimination and the application of proper principles of government to the North.</P>
    <P>He said among other things worth noting, that the reform programme is designed to remove claims of discrimination within the economy and the society.  Discrimination came in many shapes, forms and sizes in the north. Even at this short distance in time from August, 1969, it is difficult to understand the sheer folly of Unionist administrations in their determination to leave nothing to the minority that could be taken away from them.  But I do not wish to dwell too much on the past. We are concerned in the terms of the motion before us with the present and the future.  Apart from corrections of defects in civil rights as such it is clear that Mr. Maudling has now understood the need to redress the balance in favour of the minority in economic terms.  Just to mention one matter, the provision of jobs in high unemployment areas, nearly all of which are non-Unionist areas, must be a high priority in development plans in the north.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach made suggestions recently about regional economic development in Border areas he was thinking of this priority.  He said last week in this House that the Ministers and senior officials concerned in such matters are available for consultation with their opposite numbers at Stormont. We were glad to note that all three Fermanagh MPs welcomed the Taoiseach's suggestion.  Major Chichester Clark also expressed a conditional interest.  Perhaps the passage of this motion by Dáil Eireann will help to convince him that the Taoiseach's suggestions were made in good faith.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also referred to the knowledge we have built up here on EEC matters and offered to make it available to the north.  We are moving into an economic community which will bring problems and disadvantages as well as advantages to the whole country.  In so far as we can be helpful to the north, because of our direct contact with Brussels, and the similarity of our problems, the offer is made as a matter of general self-interest, as co-operation <Col N="554" /> between north and south should be helpful to both of us.</P>
    <P>In the Downing Street Declaration of 19th August, 1969, the London and Belfast Governments guaranteed equality of treatment for all persons irrespective of political views or religion. This guarantee has not been withdrawn. It is one to which the minority can always appeal, demanding that it be honoured in practice as well as in the law.  It seems highly doubtful that two Governments would have issued such a declaration merely because they felt that some seeming deficiencies in the north should be seen to be corrected. In any event Lord Cameron's report put an end to any illusions anyone might have had that there did not exist in the north a policy of discrimination against one-third of the community based mainly on religious affiliation.</P>
    <P>I mention this tonight in passing with regret because of some remarks apparently made last night in London by one of the participants at the Downing Street meeting.  He is reported to have said that the Taoiseach refers to the north in sectarian terms as &ldquo;his people&rdquo; or &ldquo;our people&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach, in fact, never uses such expressions. No one has more consistently attempted to explain and to reaffirm that the Irish nation includes all the people of Ireland.  To accuse the Taoiseach of doing otherwise by attributing to him phraseology which he neither uses nor contemplates is appallingly bad faith.  Indeed, I might note that in Major Chichester Clark's statement at Stormont on the 24th February he did not attribute any such sentiments to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The speaker in question, having misrepresented the Taoiseach, then goes on to say that in this way the Taoiseach &ldquo;encourages the rule of force&rdquo; and fosters the notion that the north is in the grip of a sectarian struggle.  Few men have done more than the Taoiseach not merely to condemn the use of force but to demonstrate the folly of it and to show how totally contrary violence is to the concept of peace in Ireland and among Irish people north and south.</P>
    <P>On the 24th February Major Chichester Clark said in Stormont that <Col N="555" /> it is the policy of his Government that there shall be no second-class citizenship for anyone in Northern Ireland. He accepted that this meant something more than mere fairness.  I quote him:</P>
    <P>It means a chance to participate in every level of society and in every aspect of our institutions.</P>
    <P>Mr. Maudling last Thursday said that he saw no alternative to co-existence save co-destruction.  Here he implicitly recognises two communities and the need for each community in the north to pay attention to the needs of the other so that they could co-exist peacefully together.  The greater onus for initiative in this respect rests with the majority for obvious reasons.  But I am sure the minority in the north will welcome this recognition by Mr. Maulding of their rights as a community as well as of their rights as individuals.</P>
    <P>The best thing to do at this time of continuing tension, including further injury and deaths, which we all deplore, is to set about the process of obtaining implementation of those rights through political and peaceful channels.  Before leaving Belfast on Saturday Mr. Maudling said that he supported Major Chichester Clark's statement on participation and mentioned the &ldquo;need to establish a harmonious society in which all feel they have their full opportunity to share in and contribute to the life of the province&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is fully in accord with the terms of the motion before us to welcome this recognition by Mr. Maudling and Major Chichester Clark of the duality of Northern Ireland.  The political and cultural aspirations of two communities within a single jurisdiction can best be regulated by admitting the existence of their differences and finding common ground to a degree and at a level acceptable to both communities.  Sovereign countries&mdash;Belgium for example&mdash; have deemed it to be in their national interest to make the necessary accommodations in this respect.  I am sure that moderate opinion among both communities in the north would heartily welcome the introduction of <Col N="556" /> an institutional framework which would leave the whole community at no risk from extremism from whatever quarter.</P>
    <P>From time to time, and in this House, voices have been raised suggesting that we should recognise the &ldquo;Ulster Constitution&rdquo;.  I would like to make a few remarks on this.  As everyone knows the so-called &ldquo;Ulster Constitution&rdquo; is in fact the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, as amended subsequently.  It was stated to be &ldquo;an Act to provide for the better government of Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;not, be it remarked, an Act to provide a Constitution for Northern Ireland.  The Act has served another purpose than the one originally intended.  It originally included a Council of Ireland, drawn equally from north and south with an independently chosen President, to which powers were to be transferred gradually from both Belfast and Dublin.</P>
    <P>In such a situation the creation of a parliamentary system for the north may have had, in the minds of the authors of the Act, a justification which was not diminished by the circumstance that Parliament would always have a majority drawn from one section of the northern population. Given the existence of a Council of Ireland, to which Stormont would have had to be responsive, the obvious dangers of a rigid provincial autonomy as they developed in the subsequent 50 years could hardly then have been a consideration.</P>
    <P>But we are now dealing with an actuality, an actuality which quite simply is that what remains of the Government of Ireland Act has put the minority in the north into a straitjacket, a straitjacket of which all the strings are pulled by a structure of government in which the minority are not represented.  It is a straitjacket from which they have had, up to now anyhow, only a formal and remote appeal to the better instincts of Britain.</P>
    <P>Any suggestion that we should recognise, as we have been asked, the &ldquo;Ulster Constitution&rdquo; falls down against the hard fact that the said Constitution gives no worthwhile guarantee <Col N="557" /> even of their safety, not to mention their prosperity and happiness, to the Northern minority.  Other similar suggestions have been made that we should in some manner recognise the Stormont Government.  I have answered a Parliamentary question on this.  I do not know what recognition you can give to an administration which has no sovereignty of its own.  If it is implied that we should recognise the legitimacy of Unionist control of the North, all I can say is that more than half of the territory of the North has a Nationalist majority and I am not prepared, now or in the future, to deny this as such a denial would be a falsehood.</P>
    <P>Surprise and disappointment have been expressed about the Taoiseach's statements in a recent BBC interview. There is nothing in what he said which varies in the least the aspirations of the national majority to the unification of Ireland by peaceful means.  I see no reason to apologise for the national aspiration.  At the same time, the national majority, through their elected leaders of all political and other persuasions, have made it abundantly clear that they have no aggressive intent in regard to the North.  Nothing in the Constitution suggests otherwise.</P>
    <P>It was announced in Stormont on the 9th February that a review had been ordered of each individual firearms certificate, the review to be started forthwith and very stringent conditions to be applied to the holding of firearms. It was stated that it was intended to formulate and publish new rules in the matter.  I am not aware that this has yet been done.  Nor does it help the matter to permit the creation of rifle clubs of ex-B Specials. We have to be realistic about this. Everybody knows that there are far too many guns in the North and the position will not be cured by issuing more gun licences, as has been done in the past few months.  The return to peaceful conditions, allied to the conscious implementation of the promise to put an end to second class citizenship, is primarily the responsibility of Government in the North, as legislation in these matters requires action <Col N="558" /> in Stormont.  But it is an obvious corollary that the Stormont authorities should not allow the re-arming of one section of the community as this casts obvious doubt on the intentions of some part of the Northern administration.</P>
    <P>It is right that we should, as Deputy Desmond has done, condemn the current and recent acts of violence in Belfast.  The circumstances of one young man's death last Friday are controversial.  But his death is final. It is another in the already too long list of tragedies.  Innocent people suffer daily, and while I extend, on behalf of the Taoiseach and the Government, our sympathies to the bereaved I must also ask for a restraint and calm on the part of the whole community.  I do not know how far Deputy Desmond's plea will go&mdash;a plea to those who seem bent on destruction. What can I say to them&mdash;except that they tear wantonly at the heart and honour of Ireland?  It is for political leadership to express the people's will. Ireland will not be united by the gun. Irish people will not be governed by the gun.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave in his statement last Wednesday said that we &ldquo;will have to recognise that the political, cultural and religious traditions of the Protestants of Northern Ireland must be given their full weight in the policies and institutions... of a 32-County Ireland&rdquo;. I agree with that.  We should never lose sight of this both in our dealings with the north and in our internal affairs here.  Indeed the phrase in the motion under reference, which &ldquo;looks forward to the establishment of full fundamental rights and freedoms for everyone, irrespective of religion or political opinion&rdquo; is a standard against which we should consciously measure our policies in relation, eventually, to the country as a whole as well as to our performance in the 26 Counties in the meantime.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, acceptable to all of us that the unification of the country should not be attempted to be made by force.  In abjuring the use of force we should also remember that the unification of Ireland by peaceful means and its future social harmony will not be obtained by clinging to the notion <Col N="559" /> that fundamental, statutory or other law should express confessional or even paternalistic attitudes.  Our personal beliefs guide our private activities, but the good governance of Ireland requires us to legislate for the general good, not for our private satisfaction.</P>
    <P>This may make it necessary for us to distinguish between our duties in our capacity as legislators and our personal beliefs about private behaviour. Bearing in mind that individual freedom to decide on matters of private morality does not impose a standard of behaviour on anyone else, the legislature is certainly not bound to express prohibitions in matters on which adult people feel entitled to decide for themselves. To put it bluntly, in a plural society legislators must guard against considering matters solely from the standpoint of their personal religious practices and beliefs.  They have no duty to do so.  Indeed, it could well become impossible in a plural society to obtain a general agreement to social legislation&mdash;and such general agreement is the cement that binds society together&mdash;if legislative matters affecting private morality were to be decided only on the basis of the private conscience of the legislators.  I speak of general agreement and I think everybody here would agree that general agreement is the cement that binds society together.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the possibility of establishing some joint authority in order to bridge the widening gap between the two communities in Northern Ireland.  There is, of course, the Community Relations Commission, much of whose work up to now, however useful it has been, has been masked by the recurring violence.  The creation of the commission, with its enlightened composition, is itself an essential beginning to the easing of community tensions and the gradual creation of community harmony.  It would be better to have its role extended and its authority widened rather than attempt to create some new form of joint authority.</P>
    <P>With these remarks, Sir, I should like to return to what I said, that Dáil Éireann has never at any time contemplated the use of force as an instrument <Col N="560" /> to secure the unity of Ireland, and, as far as the Government Party are concerned, I recommend that this motion be passed unanimously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <P>I wish to make a few remarks before the concluding speech.  This motion is designed to put on record the absolute abnegation of violence as an instrument of policy within this country.  We could have framed this motion in more divisive terms.  We could have put forward the particular viewpoint of the Opposition that the reunification of this country could come only by consent.  Instead of doing that we chose to put forward a motion which could secure the full consent of everyone in this House.  We, on this side of the House, welcome the support of the Minister and his party as, indeed, we welcome the support of the Labour Party for the terms of our motion.  I was impressed also by the terms of the Minister's remarks in relation to a plural society and the duties of legislators in such a society. There are thoughts there that all of us can take away usefully from this debate.</P>
      <P>However, I must say, with respect, that the overall tone of the Minister's speech does not match the gravity of the situation.  Our motion is timely and appropriate but I do not think there is sufficient appreciation on any side of the House of how near things are to disaster in Northern Ireland.  Anybody who is in direct or indirect contact with that area must know of the mood of despair which has gripped the people&mdash;people of goodwill and moderation.  They believe there is no future for them and there is nothing further they can do.  They believe that the coming to power of a right-wing government is inevitable in the near future and that it may be impossible to prevent this happening.  There is grave fear as to what the consequences may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the next few weeks we may be put through a great test in the whole of this country.  We should indicate recognition of this fact.  God knows what would be the result if this should happen but the unity that has been shown in this debate and in agreeing to this motion may be a first step <Col N="561" /> towards that kind of unity of purpose which alone can bring us through the trials that may lie immediately ahead. Anarchy is loose in Northern Ireland. It is not only a question of bigoted men of sectarian views killing each other, of Protestant killing Catholic and <i>vice versa.</i> We know of this internal conflict and of the acts of gangsterism on the streets of Belfast.  In our own part of the country here we have experienced, within the last 12 months, such phenomena as street brawls, kidnappings, fires, explosions and the murder of a policeman.  In this way, the violence of Northern Ireland has spread to us.  It is a contagious violence and we cannot keep ourselves away from it.  If we do not make our contribution to try to end it in Northern Ireland by putting that above all other considerations, we, too, will suffer the consequences of that failure.  If I may make a point of criticism, it has been a mistake, too, for us at this moment to reassert the claim that this part of the country has in the past made of jurisdiction over Northern Ireland even though it is accompanied by an abnegation of violence.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, perhaps, put this in different tones this evening and he has tried to take the harm out of it but, nevertheless, it is a pity that it was said at this time.  From now on, I hope that from all sides of this House there will be a complete concentration on trying to avoid anything that could be misinterpreted and anything that could be said to be unhelpful or untimely. None of us should speak without thinking first of the consequences in Northern Ireland and, indeed, if at all possible, without consulting people of moderate views in Northern Ireland before expressing any viewpoint that could exacerbate the situation there. Not only is this necessary in so far as the North is concerned but it is necessary also in the interests of this part of the country.  Before very long, we may know how necessary this is.</P>
    <P>These are the few points I wish to make at this stage.  I am glad that the motion has given us the opportunity of making it clear at this critical moment that we abjure violence.  I would put it to the Minister that some method must be found in the near <Col N="562" /> future of expressing this unity of purpose in practical form.  If we face trials in the weeks immediately ahead, there must be some method, whether it be in the form of consultation either formal or informal between the parties or otherwise, to ensure that the unity is preserved.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows, as the Taoiseach knows also, that the Government have the support of the Opposition in standing firm against extreme forces and in doing everything possible to maintain peace.</P>

      <P>In the long history of Dáil Éireann, I do not think there has ever been an occasion on which we were so overwhelmed with the development of affairs in our island where, within the past 18 months, some 70 of our fellow Irishmen, or people charged, for the time being, with the responsibility of protecting them have died and during which several hundred people have been injured seriously, a time during which property valued at millions of pounds has been seriously and permanently damaged.</P>
      <P>As we reject the use of force, so also with equal sincerity we extend to the relatives and friends of all those who have been killed in the political battles of Ireland during the past 18 months our sincerest sympathy in that they should have lost people who were dear to them&mdash;that all should have been lost in a futile purpose because force can never achieve the ends which all those who fought and all those who died believed incorrectly they would achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The creation of a separate political entity in Northern Ireland was, of course, a bitter disappointment 50 years ago to those who aspired to an independent Irish State comprising all of this island and its people.  The continued existence of that political entity depresses all Irish people who desire to see Irish men and women, <Col N="563" /> whatever may be their origins or their religious or political convictions, living together in an all-Irish State.</P>
    <P>For too long the way to peace and understanding between all our peoples has been obstructed by bitter denials by some of us of the rights of others to think differently from us, by moaning about what should have happened 50 years ago or since, instead of facing up to the consequences of what did happen; by the eagerness to relate our thoughts and actions, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs did tonight to a half century ago, instead of taking the initiatives available to us now, difficult as it may be to grasp those initiatives.</P>
    <P>I speak as one of a generation who has never known Ireland to be united either under an Irish flag or a foreign flag.  Since this State achieved independence as a result of a treaty between Ireland and Britain, the 50th anniversary of which we will celebrate on the 6th December of this year, 3¼ million people have been born as free men and women into this sovereign independent Irish State which is master of its own destinies.  For the privilege we are grateful to those who went before us and who made such valiant sacrifices that we might be free.  Consideration of our own self interests and the debt we owe to our forefathers confirm us very properly today in the will to remain free.  But in Northern Ireland, too, hundreds of thousands&mdash;I believe over 1,500,000&mdash;have been born since 1920 when that State was first established, the majority of whom are, however, convinced that the obligation they owe to their ancestors, as well as to their own present and future welfare, compels them to live apart from us. But in Northern Ireland there is, too, a very significant minority who desire not a separate life but a life in a unified Irish nation.</P>
    <P>These are the facts which govern our attitudes today, not what was written by some well-meaning but many evilly-bent Westminster politicians in 1920.  We have an immense burden of responsibility today, those of us who hold the authority of the Irish people, a responsibility which we have to both present and future generations. We will fail them miserably, and deserve <Col N="564" /> to be condemned by history, if we dwell too much on the issues which divide the inhabitants of this island. We will be forgiven even less if we dwell upon the divisions which divided them in the past and if, in fits of pique or bouts of propaganda, we assert legalistic claims or infer that injustice can justify death, wounding and destruction, then we will have failed the nation entirely.</P>
    <P>The present troubles in Northern Ireland are a re-emergence of bitter religious bigotries and illogical fears, the results of the crystallisation of prejudice; but the greatest fear of all is, of course, the illogical fear because you can never reason your way out of such a fear.  But do not let us be smug in this part of Ireland, which asserts its right to operate independently of any other nation, and consider ourselves free from prejudice.  It is wise to remember that one man's convictions appear as prejudices to others.  The decisions which these sad times in which we live force us to take are whether or not to find common ground for all Irishmen or to damage the present and future generations by preserving the bitterness which we have inherited for posterity.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to a statute passed in 1920. A great Irishman, whose memory we commemorate in the principal street of this city, has inscribed on the obelisk erected to him that no man has a right to fix the boundary to the march of a nation and no man has the right to say to a nation &ldquo;Thus far shall you go and no further&rdquo; and Acts of Parliament, of our own Parliament or of any other Parliament of 1920, purporting to affect this country do not necessarily and should not limit the strategy which we develop and apply in 1971.  Is long possession nine or any points of the law?  It is considered by most reasonable men as a sensible approach to disputed property, even if the letter of the law subsequently proves that the tenth point is legalistically more tenable than the first.  But can dialogue, much less negotiation, take place between people, one of whom denies the right of the other to have a conflicting view?  I <Col N="565" /> think not.  Negotiations never start between parties if both restate the very principles which first divided them and have ever since kept them apart.  In overlooking this invariable experience of mankind, the Taoiseach was in error in his BBC interview last week in placing emphasis on territorial claims and the Minister for Foreign Affairs was in error tonight in using the 1920 Act as an anchor for the 1971 ship of State, as if different currents had not developed in the meantime.  If you answer positively that all Irishmen are equal you must accept that our relations with the North should be based upon the principle of absolute equality, each side setting aside, or certainly not throwing at the other, its own deeply held convictions in order to understand the other's viewpoint, without necessarily sharing it.</P>
    <P>For half a century Northern Ireland has existed as a separate entity, for longer, indeed, than this State has existed, for Northern Ireland was set up in June of 1920, long before the Treaty between this State and Britain.  Even in the history of nations that is a considerable time.  It is a fact that it was born out of the perversity of a few, but it has become consolidated with the support of the many.  Our principal task now should be to examine whether any actions in this State, or by its people, have contributed to the fears which many Northern Irishmen have about living with us.</P>
    <P>Let us not be smug about our own magnanimity by claiming that we do not have sectarian problems.  Those who believe in the unity of Ireland must accept that the divisions in the north east of this island are our problems. These are Irish problems and all our words and actions must be directed towards the people of the north east just as much as they are to the constituents in each Deputy's own constituency.</P>

      <P>Force used or force justified in Belfast or Derry is force used or force justified in Dublin or in Cork.  It is force used against ourselves. Lack of trust amongst Irishmen is, perhaps, the greatest obstable to unity, <Col N="566" /> a much greater hindrance than the stupidity or meanness or ignorance of Westminster politicians legislating for a problem they never understood and, if one is to judge by the words of Mr. Maudling, still do not fully understand. It may take years yet to measure the harm that was done by the folly of certain politicians and Members of this Parliament in being involved in some way or other in efforts to pass guns into the North of Ireland.  Fortunately some of the consequential damage which has flowed from this folly may have been lessened by the fact that the Taoiseach had before him an Opposition in Fine Gael and Labour that was totally against the use of force for the purpose of settling any outstanding Irish political disputes.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this resolution, which was tabled by Fine Gael in the autumn of 1969, before any action was taken on foot of this move to import arms through Dublin for use in the North, is to obtain from Dáil Éireann a formally binding renunciation of the use of force, a declaration of appreciation of reforms already implemented or promised, and an expression of hope for further reforms. If there be in Dáil Éireann anybody who cannot subscribe to this resolution let him speak out now or forever hold his tongue and his hand from violence, intrigue or subterfuge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Government and the Government party that all members of the Government party support the passage of this resolution.  The corollary to this resolution is that all our efforts should concentrate on what we have in common with the overwhelming mass of Northern Irish men and women, a desire for our children and for ourselves for peace without fear, decent living standards without injustice, freedom of conscience without intimidation of oneself, or the domination of others. We must develop what we have tended to ignore, a positive approach in our relations with Northern Ireland.  We need to develop an informed, consistent policy of friendship with Northern <Col N="567" /> Ireland based upon mutual respect and understanding, free of all temptation to score off one another and impose one's belief or culture to the exclusion or detriment of others.  These are the clear objectives behind the motion of the Leader of the Opposition, the son of the man who was the Leader of this State for ten years, that Dáil Éireann now for the first time in its history formally rejects the use of force as an instrument to secure the unity of Ireland, welcomes the steps so far taken and promised to eliminate discrimination in Northern Ireland, and looks forward, most earnestly, to the establishment of full fundamental rights and freedom for everyone, irrespective of religion or political opinion, may I add, in any part of Ireland.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>

      <P>The Labour Party support section 6 (2) which reads:</P>
      <P>An tÚdarás shall recommend to the Minister the overall provision of student places to be made within the higher education system.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment, which is supported by the Labour Party, is that the words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;having regard to the need to maintain a reasonable balance in the distribution of the total number of students between the institutions of higher education&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>should be added to subsection (2).  This gives greater strength to An tÚdarás in assessing and continuously reviewing the demand and need for higher education. <Col N="568" /> With educational costs rocketing we feel this kind of provision is fair and reasonable.  Expenditure from public funds on education has increased from £18 million in 1959-60 to £70 million today, which is an increase of £52 million over a ten year period.  The percentage of GNP we are now spending on education has gone up from 2.7 per cent to 3.7 per cent, largely as a result of social, political and economic pressures. Because education has proved to be extremely costly we feel measures whereby An tÚdarás would have a decisive say in regard to the distribution of the total number of student places in universities are worthy of consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on university education has increased from £1½ million in 1959-60 to £8 million today.  The number of university students has also increased substantially over that period. At present we have a rather lop-sided educational structure.  UCD, which someone described as a steaming tech, has 10,000 students while the combined total of all other universities: Maynooth, Galway, Cork and Trinity is 10,000.  We do not have an evenly balanced university structure.  It might be argued that some colleges have reached their optimum size while others could do with an injection of students and capital.  The average subsidy from public funds for a university student is in the region of £500 per annum, which includes capital payments averaged out.  The way and the manner in which this money is spent is a matter of public concern.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that £8 million is being spent on university education the Labour Party strongly support the view that An tÚdarás should have some say, under section 6 of this Bill, having regard to the need to maintain a reasonable balance of distribution of the total number of students between the various institutions of higher education.  It would be easy for us to allow the HEA in its wisdom to do what it wants but we suggest it should have stronger powers and a greater say on behalf of the community as a whole.  For these reasons we suggest that this amendment should be given the most serious and careful consideration by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one point which has not been made clearly on the amendment so far.  We need to be clear when the section talks about An tÚdarás recommending to the Minister the overall provision of student places, what this means.  Does it mean overall provision of student places by providing the capital so that there are so many seats for them to sit in or does it mean that there will be adequate provision for that number of students in the matter of staff-student ratio?  The difficulty with the universities has been that until five or seven years ago there was a total absence of capital spending and a growth of appalling congestion. There was a great neglect of the development of staff in line with student numbers.  However, because the problem of congestion was more dramatic it got precedence.  In the last few years the Government have increased the amounts provided for capital purposes and now they are about half the level recommended by the Commission on Higher Education as the level currently required.  They gave a figure of £24 million over a six-year period but the expenditure has been about £2 million per year.  While it may not seem a dramatic achievement to spend half the amount mentioned by the Commission it is an enormous improvement on the expenditure in the 1950s and 1960s.  The increased expenditure has made a striking difference to the universities in varying degrees.  Some are still facing grave problems of congestion but others have had certain reliefs or are in the process of obtaining reliefs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this has concentrated <Col N="570" /> attention on bricks and mortar.  There has not been any corresponding financial provision to enable the recruitment of additional staff to bring the staff-student ratio to a reasonable level.  I am wondering what is the significance of the phrase &ldquo;student places&rdquo;.  I fear it means simply the physical capacity to teach the students in lecture rooms and to provide some place for them to sit.  I should like to hear from the Minister in so far as the recommendation of An tÚdarás is accepted&mdash;which is a matter for the Government to decide&mdash;whether he interprets the phrase as meaning there must be adequate provision both in capital sums, to provide the physical capacity, and in current grants to provide an adequate teacher-student ratio.</P>
    <P>In this latter area we have made no progress.  The latest figures I have relate to the Faculty of Arts in UCD, which is the biggest single area of teaching in our universities as a whole. The figures show that in the 1960s the ratio has deteriorated slightly and today it is at a level about three times the level obtaining in Britain.  In other words, for any given number of students there is available only 40 per cent of the number of staff required. One recognises that with the large classes for general degree purposes it is possible for us to achieve a similar result in terms of student contact by way of tutorials to what is achieved in Britain even with a less favourable staff-student ratio.  I am not suggesting that we should aim at the British figure but I suggest that the Commission on Higher Education took careful account of this and arrived at a target figure of 12 to one as an overall figure within which there would be variations depending on the faculty and college.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister if he regards the phrase &ldquo;student places&rdquo; as meaning providing for students to the given number specified in terms of physical capacity and a teaching force at a staff-student ratio which should reach the figure recommended by the Commission in a reasonable period.  On that point of interpretation, I should like to hear the Minister's views before agreeing to the section in its present form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This casts doubt on the significance of the Minister's acceptance that the reference to student <Col N="572" /> places covers current as well as capital expenditure.  When we speak about providing capacity for students, either we mean we are going to make provision for them in terms of physical plant and teaching or we do not.  If it is not intended to make adequate provision, and if the intention is that the present staff-student ratio is to be maintained in the period ahead, the universities will be obliged to reconsider that ratio and their entrance policy.  It is one thing for a university to accept an inadequate ratio as a temporary measure pending an improvement. However, for a university to accept that it should maintain that position indefinitely although it has not got sufficient staff to teach the present number of students and that it must continue accepting more students without any prospect of achieving an adequate ratio will create problems.</P>
      <P>We all wish to minimise restrictions on entry but the universities must balance the desirability of minimising those restrictions and the requirement that they be in a position to teach adequately.  The universities could not in conscience continue to increase student numbers indefinitely unless they get funds to increase staff so that they can progress to the point where the teaching ratio is adequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that many of the arguments of the universities are partisan and that there is a tendency for university teachers to think in terms of an ideal situation and to give that priority over the practicable desirability of bringing in as many students as possible.  However, it has been wrong in the past of the universities <Col N="573" /> to let the Government get away with the situation whereby they take in more students and the Government does not provide for their instruction. At some stage that problem must be resolved.  I had hoped that the HEA would be the body to resolve it and that they would try to determine the appropriate staff-student ratio and the appropriate time in which to work towards this target.  I had hoped that they would recommend to the Government the provision of capital and current expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the corollary to that would be that if the Government did not provide that expenditure, progress could not be made towards the education of that number of students in a particular period.  Deputy Thornley would be critical of this but I think he may be wrong.  The only way of getting an adequate staff-student ratio is if the Government accept their responsibility. During the years the universities have accepted more students without having adequate accommodation or sufficient numbers of teachers and they have allowed the Government to slide away from their responsibility by not providing adequate funds.  Somebody some time must call a halt and it is my conviction&mdash;if I may convey this through the Chair to Deputy Thornley as well as to the Minister&mdash;that if the HEA did decide on some programme of policy as to what, in fact, would be an appropriate staff-student ratio as well as an appropriate number of square feet per student, which is being done&mdash;I do not see why one is less desirable than the other&mdash; and if as a result of that and the universities working towards that target there has to be a tightening up on the number of students going in that will create the pressures that will extract from the Government enough money to enable the numbers in the universities to go on expanding the way they should.  If that is not done, if no standard is set, then we will go on with the situation where the universities will be probably still to some degree overcrowded despite the building and certainly understaffed.  The HEA has a function here.  Indeed I recall very clearly that when submitting evidence to the Commission on Higher <Col N="574" /> Education over ten years ago it was precisely with this in mind, having a single policy-making body which would bring all these factors together and recommend on a single policy, that the proposal was made which has led to the development of this Higher Education Authority.  I urge on the Minister a more positive policy in this regard than he has shown himself willing to admit to so far.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that the day has come when instead of bringing into the university people who have a knowledge of a subject it is more important that they should know how to teach it.  Here I would castigate some of the lecturers on simple matters such as audibility and the presentation of their lectures.  They have much to learn from teachers at a much lower level.  The idea of a lecturer coming before a class and saying to himself and indeed to them: &ldquo;In spite of you I will deliver this lecture&rdquo; must be looked at.  I hope we will depart from the system which has existed and that the lecturer will adopt a very different attitude and direct the students as to <Col N="575" /> how they might pursue certain matters which he places before them.  The idea of his getting out before them and pouring out a lecture in spite of them is something that must be re-examined very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure who that was addressed to but it seems to have been addressed to me for some reason.  I claim to be at least audible to my students and I do not recall ever having heard a university lecturer telling his students that he would lecture despite them.  Normally the students' attitude is not such as to provoke such an initial comment from the lecturer.</P>
      <P>Having said that, nobody is in doubt about the many deficiencies in the system but I do not think Deputy Tunney meant to suggest that because some university lecturers are inaudible and some lecturers are bad that, therefore, we should not have more teachers, because the problems of which he speaks largely arise from an inadequate staff-student ratio, excessively large lectures and the absence of tutorials.  If the staff were there some of these problems would be eased.  All he says has its validity, of course.</P>

      <P>It would seem that this is becoming a very specialised debate between three teachers.  It is not in fact.  There is a very valid point here.  We are balancing two conflicting but at the same time appropriate academic problems here and it should be written into the record.  Deputy FitzGerald is correct&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>No comment.  Deputy FitzGerald is quite correct in thinking that the staff-student ratios are inadequate. On the other hand, Deputy Tunney has a point and I would be, in some ways, much more in sympathy with him than with Deputy FitzGerald. I would prefer to have a class of a thousand students inside the university who at least were there than a class of ten students who were enjoying some sort of remote academic norm which satisfied the intellectual level to which Deputy FitzGerald is continually referring. <Col N="576" /> In a sense we are chasing each other's tail here.  We are trying to define an educational optimum which is almost indefinable.  Frankly, I would find myself more on Deputy Tunney's side than on Deputy FitzGerald's.  I could go on by talking about lecturers I knew at different universities who did not turn up and did not give their lectures but then we would begin talking about each other and it would become absolutely farcical.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Thornley would refrain from posing false dilemmas the problem could be more easily solved.  It is not a question of whether one chooses to have more students in university or to have selected classes.  Of course, we want more students but I must point to the danger which has been made absolutely evident by the history of the last 20 years that if a university adopts the policy of bringing in more and more students and does not succeed in putting sufficient pressure on the Government to provide funds for additional teachers a growing problem arises and it may be that in the interests of having more students and more students well taught at some stage a university has to say to the Government: &ldquo;We cannot go on with the situation and if you do not give us enough money to provide a reasonable staff-student ratio or even to work towards that, then we will tighten up on entry&rdquo; not with a view to tightening up on entry but with the expectation and confident hope that that little bit of blackmail would yield a result in more money from the Government.  That is what I am talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if he has a view about two or three things.  One concerns the optimum or minimum size of a university as such.  I am in the rare position of being an academic teacher from a Dublin university and a Dublin Deputy trying to wear these two hats at the same time and my interest at the moment is more in thinking of Galway, oddly enough, Cork and ultimately, I would hope, Maynooth.  It seems to me that a university of fewer than 4,000 is too small and that a university of more than 10,000 is too big in a community like ours.</P>
      <P>The second question I should like to put to the Minister is to what extent does he simply see a university as serving a geographical catchment area. It seems to be suggested in the grants system, the way grants are flexibly devised in relation to distance, that a person in Galway should go to UCG. As against that, there is the idea of some specific excellence in some specific sphere&mdash;say, marine biology in Galway and sheer numbers in UCD.  Would the Minister give a view on those two questions&mdash;the size of the maximum and minimum university and, secondly, the extent to which a university should be tied to a specific geographical catchment area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been debating a point which has arisen in every university city in any part of the country and that is whether we should have fewer students per teacher, and what numbers there should be in the classes.  Deputy Tunney has touched on a point which concerns us all. Surely the calibre of the lecturer or teacher is of paramount importance. <Col N="578" /> Very few of us have escaped the criticism of students throughout the years who have complained about lecturers who do not attend and about lecturers who do not prepare their lectures but use the same notes year after year.  Would the Minister have any ideas as to how the staff is recruited and what supervision of the staff exists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I agreed with Deputy Dr. FitzGerald that the minimum size of a university should be in the region of about 4,000 students.  The optimum size is another matter.  I do not know whether I should give my opinion on this, but I am inclined to think that a university would become somewhat unwieldy if it had over 10,000 students.  With regard to the point of whether students living in a particular area should be confined to a particular university, I would be rather slow to say they should.  This might arise in relation to the placement of students.  I would hope that what was mentioned by Deputy Dr. Thornley in relation to spheres of excellence would tend to attract good students from farther afield and, still more important, attract high calibre teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this going to affect the capital financing of specific university colleges?  One cannot have excellence without money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be a matter for the Higher Education Authority to decide.  If they are going to establish centres of excellence in certain areas this will cost more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect and that is whether the grant scheme is sufficiently flexible at present?  If a student in Dublin wishes to study a subject available only at Galway University will he get a higher level grant for being from a district more than 30 miles from Galway?  By virtue of being within 30 miles of a university is he confined to the lower level grant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This is something which will have to be considered.  If a student is doing a special course we <Col N="579" /> will have to consider the question very favourably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I put the most obvious case first.  If there is not a course at one university and if the student is interested in specialising in a particular field and anxious to go to the school which he is advised is the very best for that particular subject he may find himself having to turn to a university outside his own particular area.  In Britain this is carried to incredible extremes. It is almost an unwritten law that one must go to a university away from home.  It is regarded as being an essential part of a student's education to live away from home while studying. I am not suggesting that course, but I put it to the Minister that it is vital that the scheme be flexible and that if any student comes to the Department saying: &ldquo;I am advised that while the course I want to follow exists in the university near where I live, I would do better if I went to another university for this purpose&rdquo; and if he puts forward a reasonable case, his case should be considered.  The Minister should set up a flexible system which would cope generously with the request. Otherwise, there would be great inflexibility with undesirable consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In a case such as that, the student would have to put forward an exceptional case.  The Deputy will accept that something like this would be open to abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>If a course were available in his own area and if the student was informed that the course was better elsewhere an application from him to go elsewhere would have to be considered very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is trying to have it both ways here.  I agree with Deputy Dr. FitzGerald.  If rationalisation of university teaching is going to involve (a) that some subjects are taught solely on certain campuses and (b) that some subjects are taught with greater emphasis on certain campuses than on others, then a student who wants to go to a campus where a subject is taught with the greatest degree <Col N="580" /> of emphasis is entitled to that view. There is a point which is probably totally out of order because I asked a Parliamentary Question before about it and was ruled out of order, and that is the point of travel grants to students which are cut off at 21 years of age. This is the kind of thing Deputy Dr. FitzGerald and I are talking about. There is a human problem here of a student getting a place where he is told, on good authority, that something is done better than anywhere else.  The Minister speaks correctly of rationalisation of faculties but he cannot have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as Deputies Dr. FitzGerald and Dr. Thornley are concerned they are oversimplifying the whole matter.  If we had the finances to provide such alternatives quite possibly we might consider them more favourably. The facts are that at the moment we can only provide grants to certain people subject to a means test and if we were to expend extra money on students simply because they wanted to go to some other university rather than the one nearest to them, this would mean that a number of students who would normally qualify for university education could not have the required money made available to them. We are in a similar position in relation to the provision of free transport to post-primary schools.  Many parents might prefer to send their children to some school other than that nearest to them because they thought it better, but we could not consider making free transport available to a school in whatever area the parents wished.  From a practical point of view, we must come back to the point where we decide whether we have sufficient money or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's remarks strike something approaching despair into my soul.  They suggest an equation of the kind of circumstances which exist in post-primary education with those at university level.  They show a failure to appreciate the nature and character of university education. We may be somewhat to blame for springing this on the Minister, who has not had a chance to consider the position.  The Minister may have an <Col N="581" /> opportunity of considering this further. The Minister's first reaction is the kind of one that can be expected under pressure when a thing is raised without notice and the Minister must reflect the views of the Departments of Education and Finance.  There is much more at stake here than perhaps the Minister has appreciated.  The question of specialisation at university and the level of excellence in different colleges is one of enormous importance.  If we tried to tie down university students to the nearest university regardless of whether the particular subjects there were suited to them&mdash;at the honours level, because this is a problem at that level&mdash;we could do terrible harm. We could damage our whole educational system in the future.  We are talking about the people who are specialising in a relatively small number of subjects at honours level where there is not either any provision for their particular subjects at the local university, or alternatively where there is not sufficient specialisation at such university.  The damage that could be done by forcing such people to go into the wrong place might inhibit their ability to specialise and thereby to serve the community thereafter either in universities or elsewhere.  This could be disastrous.  The Minister should look at this again and should consider whether the very small cost involved is not worth paying.  There are relatively few cases of subjects where this arises, and we are talking of honours students in practice&mdash;as far as I am aware in regard to general students the problem would not arise except in rare and special cases&mdash;we are talking of those few who happen to be located in one place whereas the centre of excellence and specialisation happens to be in another and they happen both to be in different cities&mdash;it is not even a Trinity and UCD problem.  The number of cases involved here could be a handful.  We could be talking of 20 or 30 a year, if that, for all I know, and yet if these 20 or 30 people are forced to go to the place where they cannot study their specialisation and where they do not get the particular kind of teaching that will enable them to become in their turn specialists and to serve the community in the future, <Col N="582" /> the effect on the community and on the whole educational system over a period of years could be disastrous.  I ask the Minister not to feel bound by his initial reaction and if he will study this with sympathy a little further bearing in mind the very small number of cases likely to be involved and the great importance to the community in the long run of adopting a sympathetic attitude to this handful of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has reduced this to a handful of cases, if a good case were made we would favourably consider it but I think I should also draw attention to the fact that, for example, in Britain at present, students do not get into the university of their choice.  There is competition for places and that is quite likely to arise here also. We could find ourselves in a rather difficult situation in relation to that. As the Deputy says, if the number is small and if there is a special reason, I am sure that we would consider that favourably.  That is as far as I would be inclined to go at the moment.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the question of money.  As I see it education in the '70s will not enjoy the affluence prevalent in the '60s.  Consequently I would be very concerned about getting every possible pennyworth of value out of every pound spent.  Here, I revert to the point I tried to make at the beginning.  I do not want to see university education as the intensive development of the abilities of the upper social classes.  I am concerned about fitting into our universities as many as we possibly can. In this respect I suggest that, instead of accepting from lecturers that they can handle only so many students each, we should suggest to lecturers that they should look at themselves and see whether to date they have been indulging in a type of lecture which has done little except antagonise students. Those of us who have been at university will remember certain lectures&mdash;Deputy FitzGerald knows that I had not the good fortune of being a student of his; I was not suggesting that Deputy FitzGerald was inaudible&mdash;and some of the <Col N="583" /> few pleasant memories I have are of the lecturers who were able to instil an enthusiasm for the subject-matter of the lecture.  In this regard university lecturers have something to learn; they should and must realise that the old type of lecture is out with the present day student.</P>

      <P>Let not this debate descend into a discussion between university teachers about university teaching. We are trying to give the Minister some guidance here.  I agree with Deputy Tunney but to discuss the inadequacies of university teachers here is scarcely helpful to the Minister in the context of this Bill which does not empower him to take university lecturers by the scruff of the neck and teach them how to teach.  Perhaps it should. What we are getting at here are two different concepts of teaching.  I think Deputy FitzGerald is referring back, if he does not mind my saying so, to a slightly more middle-class concept of teaching than mine where the emphasis is on excellence, quality, smallness of numbers.  Deputy Tunney is correctly, in my view, speaking about a concept of teaching where the emphasis is on the comprehensiveness, of fitting in people who would otherwise not be taught at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> What we are all trying to get away from is the Kingsley-Amis syndrome that more means worse.  If we go on much longer we shall virtually be talking code language to each other, with respect to Deputy FitzGerald.  What I am saying to the Minister is that he should bear in mind on the one side the fact that Deputy FitzGerald is correct, that teaching breaks down at a certain point where the staff-student ratio is not adequate.  He should also bear in mind that if he administers the Department whose emphasis is on rationalisation of teaching of certain subjects, he cannot have it both ways and evade Deputy FitzGerald's question as to some extent he has evaded it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I interpret the Minister correctly I thought he conceded that if a subject is taught only in one place of course grants must be available but if it is taught in several places and the argument is about excellence or specialisation in that subject, then he is more dubious but on my assuring him that the likely number of people to make a good case for moving to another college when the subject is taught in both would be relatively few, he then conceded that for that purpose also he would be prepared to look at the matter and make some concessions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 15, after &ldquo;other&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If it would suit the House I should be prepared to discuss amendments Nos. 12 and 15 together as they both aim to achieve the same thing.  This might speed up things a little.</P>
      <P>The object of these amendments is to ensure that the requirements of An tÚdarás in the matter of presentation of financial data from the universities are not unreasonable.  As it stands at the moment, An tÚdarás might require an enormous amount of detail beyond what would be practicable or necessary and some limitation on this seems to be desirable.  That view has been expressed by at least one of the university colleges involved.  I put the amendment down with a view to testing out the Minister's attitude on this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>An tÚdarás must have full information on the financial position of each institution with which it is concerned if it is to make a valid assessment of the amount of State aid which will be made available to the institution.  This involves the submission to An tÚdarás by each institution of the full particulars of all forms of its expenditure and of its financial resources.  This is fundamental.  With regard to the Deputy's amendments, first of all, we must assume that An tÚdarás will act in a responsible and a reasonable manner.  I do not think that the amendment could provide an additional guarantee that it would so act, but it could give rise to very considerable conflicts in interpretation and for that reason I cannot accept it.</P>

      <P>I think there is something to be said for that amendment because without it An tÚdarás could seek the information, say, monthly in great detail, which would be impracticable and pointless.

      <P>With regret we cannot support this amendment.  We do <Col N="587" /> suggest to Deputy FitzGerald that its insertion would mean, putting it politely, academic hair-splitting.  If an institution were obliged to submit accounts annually it might well do so, say, on 31st March, 1971.  Subsequently a governing body or the president of an institution might start committing financial mayhem and throw up major proposals on, say, April 15th, a few weeks afterwards. The various governing bodies would then be breathing fire and saying the Minister was looking for information at some period other than what they would consider to be reasonable.  Therefore, the common sense approach is to leave the section to read: An tÚdarás &ldquo;may annually or at such other intervals as it may determine...&rdquo; and I do not think amendments Nos. 12 and 15 should be pressed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that these requirements can only be enforced where an institution is in direct receipt of State funds as distinct from being an institution of higher education which might not be so assisted. The Minister may feel that the link with the definition section 1 may cover this already, but I put the amendment down to make sure it was covered.  I should like to hear his views on whether the terms of definition section 1, (a), (b) and (c) cover this; in other words, if we do not insert this provision, would it be possible to have a body which was an institution of higher education under the definition section, having been designated by the Minister as such, but which did not get any money from the State?  If that is possible, then the protection of <Col N="588" /> this amendment is needed.  If it is impossible the amendment is unnecessary.</P>

      <P>This is just semantics. There is no institution of higher education which is not receiving direct assistance from the State.  Therefore, there is no use in discussing a development which is entirely imaginary and unlikely to occur in this country.  The development is entirely the other way. towards the social approach, the exact opposite of what is suggested in this amendment.  This amendment suggests we may some day have somebody like Cardinal Wolsey establishing a university institution like the established new college at Oxford and Winchester College which supplied the students to it. This is extremely unlikely, and we are not going to be around if it ever happens. I do not see why this Dáil should legislate for an entirely imaginary situation.</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 17, to delete &ldquo;financial position&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;statement of accounts&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises because of the vagueness of the words &ldquo;statement of its financial position&rdquo;.  This seems inadequate because, if I may argue a little in the opposite direction now, if you have an institution being asked by An tÚdarás for their financial position, they might reply very briefly: &ldquo;Our overdraft at the bank is £800,000.&rdquo; That is their financial position.  I think what the Minister wants is a statement of accounts and it seems to me that something more precise is required than what is written into the Bill so that the authority will get the information they reasonably need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the terminology used by me is much broader than the Deputy's.  When we refer to &ldquo;financial&rdquo; here, we mean all information relating to financial resources, whereas a statement of accounts would mean that the body concerned could <Col N="590" /> send in a statement of all money received. What I believe is essential for proper working is that all information in relation to the financial position of the institution should be made available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what my amendment requires but the amendment may not be achieving our joint efforts.  If you ask an institution to submit a statement of what the financial position is it could be very brief indeed indicating whether they owe money or have money in the bank. What the Minister wants is something that would ensure a fuller statement, something more than is required under the section.</P>

      <P>If I may say so, under section 7 an institution is required to submit its financial statement only to An tÚdarás.  I accept Deputy FitzGerald's point in relation to this matter.  My understanding would be that if anybody asked me for a statement I would tell them what my current overdraft is.  Deputy FitzGerald did not speak of an annual statement of accounts.  We are talking about general expenditure and accountability to this House.  There is a figure of £8 million involved.  It was £1½ million in 1959.  What is required is that at any given period An tÚdarás should be able to say to UCD or to any other institution: &ldquo;We want the Belfield statement of accounts.  We want a statement of accounts regarding a particular area&rdquo;.  I think Deputy FitzGerald's proposal is quite fair and reasonable.  It would strengthen the position of An tÚdarás considerably if the Minister took out the ambiguous phrase &ldquo;financial position&rdquo;.  That is rather ambiguous and anomalous.</P>

      <P>With all due respect to my Labour colleague, Deputy Desmond, I know a fair amount about this.  I spent 20 years with the Department of Finance and I did not do so for nothing, and I ended my days there in charge of all State companies.  This House already receives the statement of accounts of every institution of higher education in the country.  Therefore, what is the point of reiterating the same language in this Bill?  When a certain famous Bill was before the House on the last sitting day before Christmas I suggested that we should insert in it a provision in relation to a certain body being capable of administering the oath and I was shouted down by all sides of the House.  The reality is that these statements of accounts are sent to this House every year. Therefore, I think the amendment is nonsense.</P>

      <P>Every bursar of every higher education institution very jealously guards the financial information and accounts relating to his own institution. I remember very well when the Minister's Secretary was chairman of the study on investment in education and one of the most frustrating things about that OECD investigation was the blank wall.  Professor Patrick Lynch can confirm that it was extremely difficult to obtain accurate detailed information regarding the whole role and involvement of the universities and the other higher education bodies in the general expenditure sphere. Therefore, I suggest, with deference to Deputy O'Donovan, that it is desirable this authority, power and influence should be open to the Higher Education Authority, if at all possible.  With that in mind, the Minister might re-examine the position before the Report Stage.</P>

The Minister for Finance was open-minded about it but the motion was defeated in the House. I know of no institutions in the country which are supposed to answer in the fashion Deputy Desmond suggests.  I have listened to all the talk about night lectures.  I gave three night lectures a week for years and I know a great deal more about night lectures than Deputy Desmond or any other Deputy.  I do not like this kind of intrusion into the affairs of bodies which have not yet been proved to be doing their work inadequately.  On the contrary, they have been under great difficulties and for years UCD were the only institution giving night lectures and there was not a word about it until it was decided to do it another way.  Then we have everybody descending on it, putting down questions and all the rest <Col N="593" /> of it.  I am not here to defend UCD but I say they have done a jolly sight more for university education in this country than any other institution.

The inadequacy of university <Col N="594" /> accounts at present, both internally and what is published, from the point of view of giving any indication of the relative costs of the different areas of work has been a matter of concern to many of us for a long time past.  The authority and the universities getting together on this is a very hopeful sign. It is important that we should get some picture of relative costs.  There are some areas of university teaching which are operated at very low cost in this country.  It would be useful to us to have a fuller picture than we have at present.

      <P>On this section it is right that I should indicate what I think of this whole Bill.  It is an outrageous situation in this country that, now that there is real pressure on university education, we should have the State coming in and making that kind of requests, section by section, in a massive piece of legislation that the universities should be required to do this, that and the other.  Now, any request by an institution for State subsidy shall be submitted by that institution to An tÚdarás in such manner as An tÚdarás may require, not, mark you, as the particular university institution shall decide.  Let us not forget that those are institutions that in every country in the western world, where real progress in the education of humanity has been made, have always been independent.  Now we <Col N="595" /> are to make them a kind of subsidiary of a subsidiary of the Department of Education.  This is a typical piece of fascism.  It is extremely symtomatic of the kind of thing we are now meeting with from the Executive.  We have talked about what statements Ministers make and that kind of thing.  I am not interested in what statements Ministers make but I am interested in what becomes the law of the land.  We are doing something very wrong if we pass in this House a Bill of this sort which makes university institutions subsidiaries of subsidiaries of the Executive, the Department of Education being one subsidiary of the Executive, An tÚdarás being a subsidiary of the Department of Education and then the university institutions being small boys who cannot defend themselves.  It may be that Deputies, even in the Labour Party, are all in favour of this kind of thing.  I am speaking for myself, as I am quite entitled to do in this House.  I say that this kind of thing is extremely bad for education.  This kind of legislation is extremely objectionable.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with Deputy O'Donovan here. One of the main purposes of this Bill is to ensure that the best possible use is made of our rather scarce educational facilities and financial resources. Its purpose is to endeavour to eliminate unnecessary duplication and to make overall cost assessments, to which Deputy FitzGerald referred when he was speaking.  For this reason alone, although there are other reasons, there is a need for this section in the Bill that An tÚdarás should have power to require submission of financial requests in such manner as it shall specify.  This will ensure the establishment of regular and expeditious procedures for the assessment of such requirements, for comparisons and so on.  This is essential in the Bill.</P>

Let us take what the Fianna Fáil Party did when they set up two faculties of veterinary medicine in this <Col N="597" /> city.  This is very relevant to it as it is right on the ball.  I spoke at that time to one of the Trinity Senators and I asked him: &ldquo;Could you not make better use of the £30,000 a year than spending it on a faculty of veterinary medicine?&rdquo;&ldquo;Of course we could, John&rdquo;, he said.  He was jolly right.  It is absurd to have two faculties of veterinary medicine in this city.</P>

      <P>First of all, let us get it on the record that it was not the board of Trinity College who killed the merger, if the merger is dead and, please God, it is not.  In case, Sir, you think we have all gone mad let me say that the Committee Stage of a Bill in my limited experience is one on which one seeks constructively to amend legislation and, therefore, the patent difference of view between Deputy O'Donovan and myself is not inappropriate to this Stage.  Quite frankly, Deputy O'Donovan has put his finger on a difficult point which was discussed earlier the other night, the difference between autonomy and fiscal control. This is something which in this whole section Deputy FitzGerald's amendment, now withdrawn, was designed to draw attention to.  On the one side these are institutions responsive to the State, paid for by the State, almost totally now, and legitimately can be argued to be the institutions of the community rather than of the State.  On the other hand, Deputy O'Donovan is reacting understandably&mdash;now I am not saying this in a party sense&mdash;to the kind of statement which a Senator of the Minister's party made about a specific lecturer in a specific college on one occasion.  We have to draw the line somewhere between the two.  It is quite correct for the Minister to say he gives Trinity College, £X00,000 a year, or UCD £X00,000 a year, and that he is entitled to a broad breakdown of how it is spent.  It would be quite wrong for the Minister to be in a position to come to any institution of teaching and say: &ldquo;You will cease to continue the salary of that person; you will run down that area&rdquo;&mdash;this will come up under section 12 much more&mdash;&ldquo;you will disemploy that person because his views are not congenial to us.&rdquo;  What Deputy O'Donovan is looking for&mdash;and here I agree with him&mdash;is an assurance that the Minister's fiscal control of university teaching does not extend to the <Col N="599" /> point where he associates himself with, to put it crudely, the remarks of his senatorial colleague about one specific university teacher.  Can I have that assurance from the Minister?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will see in the section that An tÚdarás may relate annual or other financial requirements of institutions of higher education to financial planning over such periods as it considers suitable.  I mentioned on Second Stage that it was hoped to develop a system of quinquennial budgeting for higher education institutions.  This would involve financial planning for five years ahead and the preparation of a scheme for capital and for recurrent expenditure to which the annual requests for financial assistance within that period would be related.  We did not specify the quinquennial period in the Bill because the arrangements with which An tÚdarás will have to fit in are the budgetary arrangements in relation to the public services generally at any given time, but we felt that if some new course were to be instituted it would take the best part of five years <Col N="600" /> to develop it.  Experience in Britain has shown that five years are necessary to get adequate staff and so on.  The general idea here is that we would plan ahead for five years but that the requests for finance in each year would be related to the overall plan for the five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect to the Minister's opinion and the advice he has received from his officials, I watched the development of the new universities in Britain and it did not take five years to establish a new university; it took ten to 15 years to establish each of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely my comment is germane to what the Minister said. Apparently the Minister had in mind a period of five years but he did not put it in the Bill.  Perhaps it was because if he had done so there might have been some sarcastic comment about five year plans.  However, I hope we are going to have new university institutions and I must say I bitterly regret that nobody had the sense to establish a University College, Limerick, a liberal arts college in Limerick, and to have got that going properly would have taken, judging by experience in Britain, ten years.  It is extraordinary how difficult it is to establish a university.  When that great economist, Alfred Marshall, was president of University College, Cardiff, the total number of students there was 200 and the result was he had plenty of time to study economics.  He became the most famous economist in the world at the time and probably still is the most famous of the modern economists. It is all right to talk about what you can do but you cannot legislate yourself into this kind of situation.  These various sections are just words but they do provide people with power without responsibility.</P>

      <P>I will.  As was said by a very famous Deputy, the prerogative of harlots&mdash;power without <Col N="601" /> responsibility.  This, in effect, is what this means.  I have no hesitation in admitting that I was flabbergasted when I first heard of the setting up by the Government of the Higher Education Authority.  I hope that a future Government will abolish this authority because, personally, I believe that this sort of system pushes people around.  In the first place, there is the Government, then there is the Department of Education as a kind of subordinate of the Department of Finance, and under the Department of Education there is to be An tÚdarás with its resounding title.  It sounds really good, rather like Father Christmas. Then we have these unfortunate people who have the real responsibility, the authorities of the universities, who are to be forced to do this and that.  I do not mind what my colleagues say but I am speaking for myself on this issue, as one who has some knowledge of universities.  I know of universities that are good but I also know ones that are bad and ones that are indifferent.  However, this sort of action on the part of the Government is typical.  I watched it happen in relation to the medical profession when they had ceased to have the kind of staff that they had formerly and when they had ceased, too, to have the kind of incomes that they had formerly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>UCD are attempting to cater for 10,000 students.  Their faculty of agriculture has one head of staff for each five students while the faculty of medicine has one head of staff for each four students.  Both these faculties receive untold money from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries by way of the Agricultural Vote while, on the other hand, the faculty of commerce receives no part whatever of the annual grant from the State although students in that faculty pay more than the total cost of the faculty.  There is no evidence in this Bill of any effort to right this sort of thing.  We hear Deputies from all sides of the House, particularly those in Fianna Fáil and in my own party, attack UCD because that college has endeavoured to create a rational system of night lectures, but there is <Col N="602" /> never a word about TCD which gave up night courses ten or 15 years ago.</P>

      <P>Sorry, I am not saying that Deputy Thornley does not agree.  What I am saying is that there has been a savage attack in the public Press.  In mentioning the Press, I might say that they should be ashamed of themselves for not employing people who can do their work properly.  There have been parliamentary questions during the past couple of months in regard to the universities.  Of course, the Minister got his answer from the board of TCD, who told him they would set up evening courses if they were given £30,000 a year by the State. Any university could provide the courses with that sort of money but, in spite of the carefulness of my colleagues in this House not to ask any questions about the subject, this retort from the college authorities indicates very little concern on their part.  I do not owe so much to the authorities of UCD that I should come here and defend them but, in fairness to them, I must so defend them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (1), page 3, line 28, <Col N="603" /> to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Before explaining the purpose of this amendment, I should like to hear the Minister on the meaning of subsection (1).  It may be that the amendment as drafted is based on a misconception as to the meaning of subsection (1) which is in rather cumbersome English.</P>
    <P>May I ask the Minister whether the intention of this subsection is to say that An tÚdarás may assess amounts of State financial provision either in relation to current or future periods, that it is concerned with offering an option as to how the assessment is made.  If that is the interpretation of the rather cumbersome English, the amendment I have down is misconceived. If, on the other hand, it reads rather differently with the emphasis on &ldquo;may assess amounts of State financial provision&rdquo;, it would be my opinion that they should be required so to do in respect of these bodies.  Therefore, it is a question of what the words mean to begin with before we can attempt to amend it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious to me that An tÚdarás must make recommendations to the Minister concerning the financial provisions to be made for institutions of higher education if they are to carry out their functions.  For some time, I was of the opinion that, perhaps, the mandatory &ldquo;shall&rdquo; might tend to be somewhat unsuitable in conjunction with these assessments, but nevertheless, I accept that An tÚdarás must do this, and I will accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not too sure that I wished to put the amendment at all until I understood what the sentence meant.  The Minister's acceptance of the amendment implies a particular reading but I am not sure whether the Minister has taken my point.  I shall read the sentence, if I may, in two <Col N="604" /> different ways in the hope that my tone of voice will convey to the House the different meanings since, obviously, the record could not do this:</P>
      <P>An tÚdarás may assess amounts of State financial provision, both current and capital, which it recommends for higher education and research or for any part thereof, either in relation to current or future periods.</P>
      <P>If that is the reading, it should be &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  On the other hand, if it means that:</P>
      <P>An tÚdarás may assess amounts of State financial provision, both current and capital, which it recommends for higher education and research or for any part thereof, either in relation to current or future periods.</P>
      <P>In other words, what this is saying is that the method of assessment may be in relation to current or future periods. If the last clause relates back to the first clause instead of being part of the sub-clause beginning &ldquo;which&rdquo;, it would have a different sense altogether. I suggest to the Minister that if the meaning is as implied by his rather premature acceptance of my amendment, the comma after &ldquo;thereof&rdquo; is misplaced and may lead to a complete misreading of the subsection.  The insertion of a comma after &ldquo;thereof&rdquo; would appear to indicate a separation between &ldquo;or&rdquo; and &ldquo;either in relation to current or future periods&rdquo; so that this can be related back to the first sentence.</P>

      <P>I may not be conveying my meaning well but there is a real ambiguity here.  I read the subsection originally as saying simply that An tÚdarás may assess amounts of State Financial provision and that the rest of it simply went on to qualify that.  If that is the case, the word should be &ldquo;shall&rdquo; but if, in fact, the <Col N="605" /> purpose of this is to say that An tÚdarás, in assessing amounts of State financial provision, may do so either in relation to current or future periods, of course it must remain &ldquo;may&rdquo;.

      <P>I wish to speak on the amendment.  This is a typical example of people who have no real experience of administration.  There is, in fact, no difference between &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;may&rdquo; in this context&mdash;none whatever.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in this context is an enabling provision to allow An tÚdarás to do something. The difference is negligible.  It will not arise unless An tÚdarás has money which it is able to spend and, therefore, there is no difference whatever in the meaning.  The provision is an enabling provision and in the next subsection of the section the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; comes in&mdash;&ldquo;shall have regard to the accommodation capacity for students of each institution and to the <Col N="606" /> maintenance of a reasonable balance in the distribution of the total number of students as between institutions&rdquo;. There is no difference whatsoever in the meaning.  The provision is an enabling provision.  The difference is negligible, if there is any difference; in so far as there may be any difference then, in my opinion, the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is preferable to the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; However, the Minister has now accepted it; he will have to weather it and so will his officials.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2), page 3, line 34, after &ldquo;institution&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;the staff-student ratio of each institution, the need to maintain standards, the rate of growth and acceptable ultimate size of each institution&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that An tÚdarás in making assessments in respect of institutions under this section&mdash;&ldquo;may assess amounts of State financial provision, both current and capital&rdquo;&mdash;takes account not only of the factors mentioned here, that is, accommodation capacity for students and the maintenance of a reasonable balance in the distribution of the total number of students as between institutions, but also of other factors which it is important it should bear in mind, one such factor being the staff/student ratio, another being the need to maintain standards, and a third being the rate of growth and acceptable ultimate size of each institution.  I need not speak at length of these because each has been considered already in some different context, but it seems to me <Col N="607" /> appropriate they should all be brought in at this point as the different criteria in taking into account and determining the financial assessment.  The Minister may disagree with any one, but I should like to hear his views and, if he accepts some but not all, I am prepared to consider any reasonable bargain from him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not inclined to accept this.  We had some discussion on this at an earlier stage and, as I said then, undoubtedly the staff/ student ratio and the maintenance of standards are closely linked but the maintenance of standards is not the direct concern of An tÚdarás.  The maintenance of standards is a matter for each institution and I have already pointed out that this proposal would envisage some interference with the autonomy of the institutions of higher education.</P>
      <P>With regard to the staff/student ratio, this is something which varies from one institution to another, depending on the work being done in each institution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

      <P>There could, therefore, be no question of absolute standards in relation to staff/student ratios and we will have to operate on the basis that An tÚdarás, when making its assessments under this particular section, will take every reasonable factor into account.  Some of the matters referred to by the Deputy can, of course, be taken into account, but I do not think they are matters which should be inserted in the Bill for the reasons I have mentioned.  The Deputy was referring to the amendment he put down in relation to the rate of growth and acceptable ultimate scope of each institution.  Here, apart from any other consideration, I think the word &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; makes bad law.  The question would immediately arise as to acceptable to whom and, from a legal point of view, I do not think it would be wise to insert this in this particular section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>When we talk about staff/student ratio, what about the staff/ student ratio in different faculties? That is very much more germane to the discussion here.  As I have already said, you have a staff/student ratio of one head of staff to each four students in veterinary medicine in UCD and, in Trinity College, you have one head of staff for each two students.  In the faculty of commerce in UCD you have one head of staff for each 60 students. The position is all right if we think veterinary medicine is all important and commerce is of no importance whatever but, judging by the way the Government party talk, our future will depend on industry and commerce and it is a pity that the Department, since they have been entering very much on university education in recent years, did not pay some attention to this extremely serious problem.  In the faculty of arts there is roughly one head per 30 students.  In the faculty of medicine it is one head for every ten students.  It is probably the same in Trinity College. There is no question about it; it is of extreme importance that there should be equality as between the different faculties in our universities and equality of treatment of students in the different faculties.</P>
      <P>On the subject of accommodation, the new Arts and Commerce building, as it is called, in University College, Dublin, is already inadequate for the faculties of arts and commerce.  It is crowded to the scuppers.  Are we going to have more and more students coming into that already overcrowded building? Are we going to have University College, Dublin, changed from Earlsfort Terrace to Belfield and still a slum from the point of view of the way in which the students in both arts and commerce are treated?  Are we going to have one part of it provided for by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries on millionaire lines and another part of it provided for by the Department of Education on utterly disgraceful lines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an outrage on decency the way the students in the faculty of commerce have been treated in University College, Dublin, in the last ten years.  The staff/ student ratio is an absurdity.  The <Col N="609" /> accommodation for both staff and students is equally an absurdity.  It is no use putting in nice language like this&mdash;&ldquo;An tÚdarás shall have regard to the accommodation capacity for students of each institution and to the maintenance of a reasonable balance in the distribution of the total number of students as between institutions&rdquo;. Does this mean someone will tell a student: &ldquo;Since UCD is overcrowded you will have to go to TCD&rdquo;?  Is this what this means?  I cannot see what effect it will have except putting into this Bill a bit of verbiage which will have no real effect.</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás cannot direct students from one place to another.  No matter how hard we try there will be massive overcrowding in Belfield in the arts and commerce faculties which are the only open faculties in the college at present.  There will be massive overcrowding and inadequate teaching because the college is understaffed except in faculties like veterinary medicine which is overstaffed in UCD and super-overstaffed in TCD.  What I am saying is reality and not a piece of verbiage in a Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will probably not be amended for at least ten or 20 years after it is passed.  It is, therefore, vital that it should be as comprehensive as possible in order to cope with the anticipated growth in higher education.  Subsection (2) of section 10 does not adequately set out the minimum criteria which An tÚdarás should take into account when assessing the particular needs of a given institution.  It reflects on the student capacity for each institution and the maintenance of a reasonable balance in the distribution of the total number of students as between institutions. Deputy FitzGerald has in this section specifically brought in staff/student ratios, the maintenance of standards, the rate growth and the ultimate size of each institution.  These are four elementary yardsticks which, when handing out £1½ million of taxpayers' money to any body, should be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's comment that the inclusion of the question of maintenance <Col N="610" /> of standards as a criterion in the Bill would unduly impinge on the question of university autonomy is too ingenuous.  If a student is given £25 one week and the following week it is decided to give him £35 the difference in that sum will effect a change in the standard of education he is likely to obtain.  Whether we like it or not, money has a major impact on standards of education in each institution. The allocation of funds by An tÚdarás is going to have, in many areas, depending on the way in which they allocate money, a dramatic impact on standards of education and the need to maintain standards in particular institutions.  It is inexplicable that one should pass a Bill on Higher Education and not mention standards of education. No provision is made for the raising of standards; it merely mentions the maintenance of standards.</P>
    <P>In drafting this amendment Deputy FitzGerald has been circumspect and very understanding towards the Minister. The four criteria he mentions are well worthy of the Minister's consideration. Neither the Minister nor his Department should have any inhibitions about laying down various criteria.  I want here adamantly to assure my colleague, Deputy O'Donovan, that I do not suffer from &ldquo;anti-universityitis&rdquo;. I am concerned with the fact that Dáil Éireann votes £8 million per annum, and it will probably be £10 million by the end of this Dáil's lifetime, for university education.</P>

      <Col N="611" /> We want to see the proposals contained in Deputy FitzGerald's amendment inserted.  Even at this stage the Minister might have another look at the section, if he cannot accept the amendment, and redraft subsection (2) of section 10, because it is very shoddy as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to get involved in this dispute about UCD, but I should like to come back on the Minister's reply to my original brief remarks on the amendment.  I was somewhat disappointed at his reaction. Taking them phrase by phrase, the reference to the staff/student ratio in each institution seems to be necessary and justified to balance the reference to accommodation capacity for students in each institution.  It seems to me irrational to say that they must take account of whether there is sufficient physical capacity but they do not have to take account of whether there is sufficient staff.  This pre-occupation with bricks and mortar is a danger to education today.  We all fall into it, not just in Parliament, but also in the institutions concerned.  If An tÚdarás is to have regard to whether there is enough room physically for students, it must in logic have equal regard to whether there is sufficient staff to teach them.  There is no rational reason for picking one for a criterion to be considered and not the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite willing to be told that the way I expressed it could be improved. As far as I was concerned the staff/student ratio was intended to be the equivalent to accommodation capacity per student; the staff/student modation capacity for students is the capacity per student; the staff-student ratio is the number of students per head of staff.  In deference to Deputy O'Donovan's comments, some of which I agree with on this occasion, his references to the wide disparities between the internal staff/student ratios within each college are very well taken and while it would be wrong to equate them with some point of exact parity&mdash;he does not suggest that&mdash;nevertheless, some of the disparities are quite unjustifiable and <Col N="612" /> have historical causes, in some instances of disreputable origin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A familiar concept in our universities.  It could justifiably be argued&mdash;I am taking Deputy O'Donovan as partly doing this&mdash;that the reference to &ldquo;ratio&rdquo; might better read &ldquo;ratios&rdquo;.  On reflection that might well be a better way of putting it, although if there is another formulation by which the Minister would agree to take account of the staff provision, as he is prepared to take account of the accommodation provision, I would be prepared to consider it.  Logically the Minister must agree that once accommodation comes in as a criterion so also should the matter of staff.</P>
      <P>In regard to the need to maintain standards, I am swayed by both sides. The Minister made the case that the question of standards was an internal academic matter for the universities. If one interprets it in a narrow way the Minister is right and it would be better not to put it in here.  What I had in mind was that standards are affected by the availability of accommodation, staff and the financial resources for the provision of necessary aids, whether laboratory equipment or other teaching aids.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, one could argue that it should go in because financial provision affects the maintenance of standards, even though this might be regarded from the narrow point of view as a purely academic concern. However, Deputy Desmond's support on this issue has left me in some <Col N="613" /> doubt as to which way to proceed. Perhaps if one gets the accommodation capacity and the staff/student ratio, this goes a long way towards ensuring that the necessary financial provision is made to maintain standards and perhaps the phrase itself is not necessary.  On the other hand, I am almost persuaded by Deputy Desmond that I was right to include this matter and I should like to hear the Minister further on this point.</P>
    <P>I did not hear the Minister say much about the rate of growth but he suggested that the concept of an acceptable ultimate size of each institution was void because of its vagueness. If this is so, I suggest that this applies to other amendments he has accepted. The Minister accepted increasing equality of opportunity in higher education and the maintenance of standards in higher education.  In quantitative terms they are substantially less vague than the acceptable terms of each institution and the Minister has accepted that there is such a thing.</P>
    <P>We may not agree as to the precise size or on an absolute limit of 10,000 or 11,000, but there is general agreement that a university can get too big. When the Higher Education Authority are considering what resources to allocate to each college they should take account of this.  I do not think the vagueness is in any way objectionable and it seems substantially less vague than other phrases the Minister has accepted.</P>
    <P>The rate of growth is important. Obviously a college that is growing rapidly, and for which student demand is increasing rapidly, should be given special consideration.  It can be argued that the question of whether it grows rapidly is a matter to be controlled and students may be diverted elsewhere. We heard from the Minister today a flat statement that the students must go to the nearest college except in very rare cases.  It appears to me that the rate of growth of an institution will be determined by student demand, not by external policy other than the policy of creating a new institution in the same area to which the students might be diverted.  Consequently, the rate of growth on the <Col N="614" /> Minister's policy in large measure will be unplanned.</P>
    <P>It is liable to be a reflection of the response of students to greater opportunities for secondary education and ultimately for higher education.  Some colleges may be in a position where the demand for entry will be greater than others.  Some are situated in parts of the country where the population is growing rapidly; another is situated in an area where the population is declining. If therefore, you are going to tie students to the nearest college it is inevitable that there will be different growth rates and the HEA should take account of these growth rates in determining how the assessment should be made.</P>
    <P>Each of the different criteria I have suggested has a validity of its own.  I am willing to reconsider the question of the need to maintain standards.  I am deterred from withdrawing it only by Deputy Desmond's support and I hope that the Minister, in the light of the arguments made by Deputy Desmond and myself, will reconsider his views.  The Minister logically must accept that the reference to staff/student ratio must go in if the accommodation and capacity for students are considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>We may also be excluding the necessity for innovation. The past years have proved that education is amenable to change and hitherto accepted principles and fundamentals have been challenged.  This is particularly the case in the universities.  When I was at university I accepted what I was told but the present-day student is not prepared to accept certain points of knowledge that may be thrown at him.  This change has been accepted in post-primary education and the process of education is being encouraged in many ways.  I see the possibility of not presenting lectures but of presenting questions to students and indicating to <Col N="615" /> them where they might get the knowledge or pursue certain facts and come back with the answers themselves.</P>
      <P>I have the fear that what Deputy FitzGerald has in mind is the continuation of the system which has been in existence.  I fear that the reference to the maintenance of standards and to the staff/student relationship accepts that which hitherto has been the position is the one with which we should continue. The Deputy may not be providing for the innovation which has come at different levels of education and which must come at the higher level.  In the affluence which existed in the last decade the desire to bring people from what might be called the &ldquo;lower social groups&rdquo; into higher education might well have been due to the fact that the reserve in the higher group was not adequate to fulfil our requirements. However, if that need disappeared in this decade I fear we might revert to the situation where only the person who could pay for higher education would receive it.  Instead of broadening the umbrella and bringing more from all classes into education we might be perpetuating that system, which obtained until the last decade, where only a select few could avail of education.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Tunney would be the first to agree that both Deputy FitzGerald and myself have paid full and fair tribute to the changes made in educational matters by Ministers in his party. However, I think Deputy FitzGerald's amendment is acceptable in this instance. Frankly, I do not regard this as a terribly important amendment. It is a little like writing in the equality of opportunity thing.  It is to remind these gentlemen of what their ultimate function is and to put it in a kind of creative, productive way.  Here I do agree with Deputy Tunney that they must be continually reminded that their function is not simply to administer the system as it is at the moment but when Deputy FitzGerald speaks of the need to maintain standards he is correctly as a university teacher, I think, arguing that the greater danger <Col N="616" /> facing the university at the moment is the declension of existing standards rather than the utilisation of a concept of the maintenance of standards to exclude people.  I think Deputy Tunney knows that I share his desire to bring in to university people who are not there at present.  At the same time I think the wording of this amendment is nicely drawn on balance and is acceptable and I do not think it is hostile in any way to the spirit of what Deputy Tunney has just said. I think I am still spokesman on education for the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>The intention is that there should be developed a general policy in relation to staff/student ratio which would apply generally to all institutions.  Therefore, mention of this particular aspect would be out of place in a subsection which is concerned with the taking into account in making assessments of varying circumstances within the institutions in question, something which I have referred to previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I want to refer to the amendment which the Deputy has put down in regard to the rate of growth and acceptable ultimate scope of each institution. This, from a legal point of <Col N="618" /> view, apart from any other consideration, would not be acceptable because of the fact that it could not be defined in law.</P>

      <P>Hitherto in this debate either the Minister has made a good case and we have withdrawn the amendment or we have made a good case and he has accepted it.  It has been a very good debate in that respect.  This is the first time I have heard him totally unconvincing and indeed giving the impression of being unconvinced.  He did not in his reply give any reason for including two criteria and excluding the others.  He may well say: &ldquo;We do not want a whole lot of criteria.  We should leave it free.&rdquo;  Why put in the two he has put in?  On what possible grounds does he say that accommodation capacity must go in but staff capacity must not?  He has not answered that point.  When he has not got an answer to that point I think he is bound to accept that part of the amendment. Either neither of these should go in or they should both go in.  No hint of a reason has been given for putting one in and not the other.  When he says the two go together what he is saying is simply not true.  The Government have in recent years provided the capital to make possible a considerable expansion of university building and the ratio of space to student has been very greatly improved.  Unless of course this is well maintained it could disimprove again though I do not think Deputy O'Donovan is right in suggesting that the new arts building, for example, is too full already.  It could certainly become so very soon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are various replies to that but I do not propose to descend to personalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got increased capacity in our universities.  The ratio of space to students has notably improved in recent years and has done so at great cost to the Exchequer.  The amount of capital involved is quite considerable and all honour to the Government who have provided this additional capital, belatedly it is true, but they have provided it.  The same has not happened <Col N="619" /> with respect to the staff.  I have already pointed out that in respect of the largest single university faculty&mdash;the arts faculty by itself or the arts and commerce faculties together in UCD&mdash;the ratio has disimproved over the years.  We have a very considerable improvement in the ratio of space to student and a disimprovement in the ratio of staff to student.</P>
    <P>For the Minister, therefore, to try to persuade this House that the two necessarily go together is, to say the least, disingenuous.  It simply is not true.  It has not happened.  The opposite has happened and his unwillingness to include staff/student ratio here when he includes accommodation capacity is open to the interpretation that it will not happen in future either.  If, in fact, his assurance given earlier that, although one could not ensure that in every individual year the staff/student ratio would improve, over a period of years the intention was to improve it, means anything it must logically be followed by the inclusion of staff/student ratio here together with the concept of accommodation capacity.  The Minister is bound in logic to accept that part of my amendment.  I put it to him that either he should say why he is making such a distinction or he should accept it.  The other parts of the amendment are justified&mdash; particularly the questions of rate of growth and acceptable ultimate size&mdash;for the reasons I have given.  This is the first occasion in this debate where the arguments of the Opposition have not been answered. The Minister spoke for about five minutes but he did not really reply to the points I made.  I find that is a test of whether I have a good case or not, because if I put up a bad case I get a very quick answer from the Minister. When I put up a good case and the Minister talks for five minutes on something else, I know that I have a good point and that the Minister has no answer to it.  I press the Minister to reconsider the position here unless he can give a reason for not including these amendments.  If the Minister cannot say why they are putting in these two criteria and why this reason does not apply to other criteria he is bound in logic, common sense and common <Col N="620" /> decency to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons why this provision is put in as it is is that, first of all, one must make available accommodation for students.  If accommodation is not available there cannot be students there, or staff.  There is no good having staff without accommodation. The first necessity is accommodation. I have dealt as fairly with Deputy FitzGerald as he has dealt with me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have clearly pointed out that the first need is for the provision of accommodation.  This carries with it the connotation that the staff will also be provided.  The growth in current expenditure has been commensurate, by and large, with the growth in capital expenditure.  This has gone towards the provision of staff and facilities.  It may be true that the number of staff has not been large enough in relation to the number of students.  Extra staff has been provided. It is important we should not put too many details into this section.  The provision of accommodation implies the provision of staff and An tÚdarás would be neglectful of their duties if they were not to take into consideration the question of the staff/student ratio.  There are many other things which could also be put into this section if we were to have a complete, detailed description of everything they might do.  In this particular instance, I feel that the section is sufficiently broad.</P>

      <P>I would like to support Deputy Dr. FitzGerald here for reasons which he himself will not approve of.  This amendment seeks to put teeth into the HEA.  This is a line of reasoning which I have consistently supported in this discussion.  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald would agree that he has not always supported this line of reasoning.  If the Minister thinks about it very carefully he will see that this <Col N="621" /> amendment tends to assist the line of thinking which underlies the view of the Authority in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to the Minister's further reply and he has not answered my points.  I assert that the accommodation capacity per student has increased substantially in the past five or seven years.  I assert equally that there has been no equivalent improvement in the staff/student ratio.  In some important faculties this has disimproved.  To say that increased accommodation capacity implies an increase in staff and an improvement in staff/student ratio, or that it carries with it the connotation of improved staff/student ratio is simply, historically and factually, incorrect as an argument. If the Minister wants to produce facts and figures to refute my arguments he is welcome to do so.  His use of the words &ldquo;implies&rdquo; and &ldquo;connotation&rdquo; is meaningless in the face of the fact that the opposite has happened.  The Minister says that the accommodation must come first.  There is a &ldquo;hen-egg&rdquo; situation here.  You cannot have a university here without both accommodation and students.  It is irrelevant whether the accommodation is built first and then the staff employed, or whether both happen simultaneously, or whether some staff are employed, at the beginning to prepare the groundwork for the courses, and then more accommodation is built.  A university cannot exist without accommodation and staff.  We know of the neglect to increase staff.  If we had to opt for particular things, I would be happy to opt for the staff and not the accommodation. There has been failure to provide extra staff.  Attention must be directed to this point.  The accommodation capacity is the least sensitive point.  In some cases the Minister has accepted amendments freely and in some cases he has given me good arguments which we have immediately accepted without wasting time.  The Minister on this particular issue of staff/student ratio should reconsider the situation.  If the Minister gives me grounds for hope I will withdraw this amendment until Report Stage.  Otherwise I will have to press it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy mentions <Col N="622" /> that the accommodation question is the least sensitive one.  In all probability the reason why it is the least sensitive is that the accommodation has been made available.  I want to assert, as I have done before, that the growth in current expenditure has been, by and large, commensurate with the growth in capital expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister thinks that he must know extraordinarily little about the financing of the university.  Over the recent period, the very fact of providing accommodation itself involves enormous increases in current costs, even if there is no more staff.  One of the biggest problems that UCD has had is that the move to Belfield has enormously increased its current expenditure for an existing staff.  There has been an inflation in current costs and in salaries and wages generally from which university staffs have not been immune. There has been a proportionate increase in salaries.  Because of these factors the increase in staff which we have had has not been commensurate with the growth of students.  The increase in capacity has been more than commensurate with the growth in students. We now have a better ratio of space to students.  The Minister does not deny these facts.  He talks about current and capital expenditure going up as if that relationship meant anything. I would press the Minister to apply his mind to the issue as to whether the ratio of staff and students has been improving at the same rate as capacity to students.  If any criterion is to be put in here, it should be the sensitive one of staff.  Perhaps the Minister would reconsider this matter. In the light of the arguments would he not agree to have another look at this between now and Report Stage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the important thing is to provide the physical accommodation first.  The implication <Col N="623" /> in these amendments is that An tÚdarás would operate in a &ldquo;blinkered&rdquo; fashion unless everything is spelt out for them in the Bill.  We must accept that An tÚdarás will act in a sensible manner. As I have already mentioned, the matters which the Deputy has dealt with in his amendments would be matters which they would have to take into consideration.  I do not think we should spell out every detail for the authority.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Before making any assessment under this section An tÚdarás shall first consult with each institution of higher education regarding its financial and other needs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment was put down to ensure that there is adequate consultation between An tÚdarás and the various institutions before the assessment is made.  I am not clear from the wording in the Bill whether the Minister visualises that the Bill in its present form will have such a process of consultation.  I can see from the Bill that the different bodies would submit their requirements but whether in fact there are to be consultations with the institution about its written submissions or whether an tÚdarás is entitled to go ahead without even telling the institution concerned and to make certain recommendations at variance with the submissions of the different universities and other institutions without any discussions on them is something I am not clear on.  Therefore, before pressing the amendment at all I would like to hear from the Minister how he visualises this whole scheme operating and whether, as he sees it, there is adequate provision in the Bill already to ensure consultation. If he can show me that and the amendment is superfluous I will of course withdraw it; otherwise it may be worth pressing.</P>

      <P>I can assure Deputy FitzGerald there will be consultations between An tÚdarás and the various institutions concerned.  There cannot be any question of An tÚdarás making an assessment without getting the full statement from the institution concerned of their financial and other needs.  In practice it is certain that An tÚdarás will afford each institution an opportunity of supplementing its submissions by oral representations if this is requested.</P>

      <P>When I ask the Minister if there is legal provision in the Bill to require consultation&mdash;it does not seem to me there is but I was open to conviction&mdash;his reply is that there is and then he proceeds to point out there is not.  Let us be clear about this.  There are two considerations. First of all, there is the requirement that there must be a submission from the institution concerned.  The question I asked was: is there anything to require An tÚdarás to consult with the institutions concerned before passing on to the Minister this assessment of needs based on the submissions? The Minister says in practice there will be an opportunity for consultation. When he says &ldquo;in practice&rdquo;, this I take it means there is no legal requirement. Am I right in interpreting the Minister, when he says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; he means &ldquo;no&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I am saying is that the interpretation I am giving is that there will be consultations. The Deputy can take it that it would not be possible for An tÚdarás to act at all unless it had consultations with the institutions of higher education.</P>

It may therefore be expected to behave reasonably; <i>ergo</i> an amendment which requires it to behave reasonably is supererogatory. The Minister is going round in circles and I do not see why he should not accept the amendment.</P>

I am saying that from any practical person's point of view it would not be possible for An tÚdarás to make a proper assessment or to carry out their functions unless they had consultations with the institutions of higher education.  I do not see any reason why we should insert the amendment.  It would be rather an insult to the intelligence of An tÚdarás to suggest that we would have to tell them in a section of this Bill that they must consult when it would be nonsensical to suggest that they could carry out their functions without this type of consultation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is taking an extreme view of the Bill.  I find the Minister somewhat unconvincing on this point.  If he interprets this as an insult, what about the insults contained in sections 3, 4, 6, 8 and all the other sections in the Bill?  The Bill sets up An tÚdarás and the rest of the Bill deals with how An tÚdarás are to act. Such an insulting Bill would not be damaged by one final insult.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be instances in which relatively small matters are involved and it would not be necessary for them to consult.  If we were to insert a subsection here we could compel them to consult on every occasion and they would be running backwards and forwards all the time. I do not think it is necessary to specify this.  The authority will have requests from the various institutions for finance and will be supplied with statistical information as required under sections 7 and 11 of the Bill, and I cannot see why it should be necessary to insert this amendment.  I want to underline the fact that I cannot imagine this authority operating without consultation. I would say that a basic consideration here in relation to the authority generally is that consultation must take place all the time.  They cannot operate in a vacuum.</P>

      <P>The Minister is entitled to one of two arguments against the amendment but he is not entitled to both.  One is that the amendment is unnecessary because the body concerned must consult, that consultation is inevitable and that there is no point in providing for it in the Bill. The other is that you cannot have the amendment because the amendment would require the authority to consult when consultation is unnecessary.</P>

      <P>I accept the correction. The point I am making is that while other sections of the Bill, section 8 in particular, require the authority to operate by getting requests for finance, it would be possible in the absence of this amendment for the authority, having got such a request, simply to say: &ldquo;We do not recognise this at all.&rdquo;  The submissions made by the authority are not alone based on the requests of the institutions.  This is very important from the point of view that at the moment the universities make direct submissions to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One feature of the present system &mdash;I do not think it is a good system&mdash;is that they can put forward their claim and argue it out and often there is lengthy correspondence between the university concerned and the Department, with a lot of arguing backwards and forwards, all concerned with persuading the Department that the claim is reasonable and with counteracting any counter arguments that may be made.  If you interpolate the authority here, you are cutting out the universities from their sources of money and it is necessary to have some safeguard so that the universities are in a position to argue backwards and forwards with the HEA.  It is with a view to giving the universities the benefit of this buffer without any significant <Col N="631" /> deterioration of the present system that I put down the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <P>Let me point out again that I think anybody looking at this section in a practical way will have to realise that An tÚdarás cannot carry out their functions unless they have consultation and that they could not come to a decision without having consultations with the institutions concerned. On the other hand, An tÚdarás could be tied by an amendment like this by requiring them to have consultations on relatively minor matters which An tÚdarás could deal with quite easily on their own.  Again, I want to underline the fact that in my view it would not be possible for An tÚdarás to carry out their function if they did not have consultations with the institutions of higher education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> On the Order Paper today two questions stood in the names of Deputy Liam Cosgrave and myself in relation to recent damage by fires in the city. Deputy Cosgrave asked the Minister for Justice if, in view of the many serious fires which have occurred recently, he will take immediate steps to increase the Garda force in Dublin city.  I asked the Minister what steps he proposes to take to protect Dublin city stores and other buildings against fires; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  I put down my question today for the following reasons.  First, in the last couple of weeks there have been a series of fires in this city, some of them disastrous in their extent and in the damage caused and others causing less damage simply because the plans did not fully materialise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three fires took place on the same night, one in Clerys, one in Easons and one in Arnotts.  Those fires did not succeed in razing those buildings to the ground but, as I said, that was because the plans did not materialise. There have been other fires since then <Col N="632" /> in this city, all taking place at night and all following the same pattern. Such reports as appeared in the press would appear to present irrefutable evidence that those fires were planned, were malicious and most important of all that there is in our midst a conspiracy to burn down and destroy millions of pounds worth of property in this city.</P>
    <P>The result of this obvious conspiracy is to create a sense of complete insecurity among property owners in the city and to expose the ratepayers of Dublin to a bill for millions of pounds involved in the planned fires. This is at a time when credit is difficult, when the economy is in an unhealthy state and when business in general is finding difficulty.  When I put down my question I hoped to get a statement and an assurance from the Minister that he fully appreciated the gravity and the enormity of the situation and that he would leave no stone unturned to track down the conspirators and to protect the city of Dublin and its citizens from arson and in this way to restore confidence and a sense of security.</P>
    <P>When I put down my question I certainly did not think it would be necessary to bring the Minister in here on the Adjournment to impress on him the necessity for carrying out his duty to property owners to protect their property.  However, the Minister's reply was to my mind so casual and seemed to show that he did not appreciate what is at stake that I had no alternative but to force the issue on the Adjournment.  The Minister said in his reply:</P>
    <P>The nature of the threat in this matter is such that no increase in Garda strength could possibly be contemplated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Read it properly.  I did not say that no increase in Garda strength could be contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I was going to correct it.  I have no intention of trying to mislead the House or of misquoting the Minister.  The Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> The nature of the threat in this matter is such that no increase in Garda strength that could possibly be contemplated could make any significant difference.  The onus of taking precautions must rest on each individual owner and it would be misleading for me to suggest otherwise. Garda activity in this matter must be directed at seeking to apprehend those responsible in cases were fires are malicious rather than by preventive patrols.  Owners have in fact been advised both privately and in public to this effect by the gardaí.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not being unfair to the Minister when I say that I interpreted that reply as meaning that there is very little the gardaí can do about those fires and that the Minister is in effect saying that the onus in protecting their property lies on the property owners.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out the difficulty of the gardaí in preventing this type of crime.  As I see the position, and as I have always understood it, there is an obligation on property owners to protect their property against accidental fires.  I have always regarded it as part of the duty of the Minister for Justice and the Garda force under him to protect such property and property owners against malicious criminal damage to their property.  I say that is particularly so when fires have occurred which show that it is not a case of isolated malice against one property owner, but that on the contrary there is a conspiracy indiscriminately to attack, burn and damage valuable property in the centre of this city.  The Minister said it is difficult to detect this sort of crime.  It is equally difficult for the property owners to prevent. It may, by a system of night watchmen, be possible to prevent Clerys stores from being razed to the ground but it is not possible to prevent the destruction of thousands of pounds worth of property in half an hour or so.  Therefore, I was completely dissatisfied with the Minister's approach to this matter.  I put down the question in a <i>bona fide</i> manner expecting to get a reply from the Minister that would be a comfort to the citizens of Dublin and would restore their confidence. On the contrary, the Minister treated <Col N="634" /> this as another day's work which had to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>It is much more than that; it is a threat to the very foundations of law and order and the security of the city. The Minister can find sufficient numbers of gardaí to station one outside every bank in order to prevent armed robberies.  Indeed, one wonders if it could be said that an unarmed member of the Garda Síochána stationed outside a bank is calculated to prevent an armed robbery or that it is doing anything more than exposing an unarmed garda to attack, sometimes with fatal consequences, as has already happened. I would have been happier if I had heard the Minister saying that while this threat was hanging over us members of the Detective Branch, plain clothes men, would patrol these stores, or stores taken at random, in an effort to apprehend suspicious looking characters and to get to the bottom of this.</P>
    <P>The Garda strength in Dublin city is completely inadequate and I am forced to believe that the Conroy Report, which provided for the payment of overtime for gardaí, is forcing the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, to economise unwisely in the question of the strength of the Garda.  The Minister in reply to a supplementary question stated that there are 242 more gardaí in the Dublin metropolitan area now than there were three years ago.  Look at the situation now compared with three years ago.  We had no bank robberies three years ago.  We had no necessity for patrolling the banks.  I wonder would the Minister tell us how many of these 242 men are absorbed in bank protection duty today.  We had not the same type of crimes of violence involving elderly people and their homes as we have today.  Furthermore, the time of the gardaí is taken up by marshalling parades and keeping an eye on protesters outside Leinster House and elsewhere, a situation which did not exist three years ago. We have, as I say, the fact that gardaí are working on a time regulated basis which was not the case three years ago. It is no answer to say that there are 242 more men in the city.  An analysis of the number of hours worked by <Col N="635" /> gardaí and the additional duties imposed on them, by the things I have mentioned, shows that in effect there are far less garda hours being worked and that the gardaí have less time to devote to what are genuine police duties.  I regard the protection of these stores as every bit a police duty, if not more so, as the protection of banks. I would regard it as more of a police duty than regulating traffic.  If the position continues as it has been in the past week or two the city will become a vast fire risk.  It will be impossible to get insurance companies to undertake risks notwithstanding the Malicious Injuries Act because some of them might not be able to prove their case to the satisfaction of a court.  The position will be that either the companies will refuse point blank to take these risks or they will undertake them at prohibitive premiums.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to regard the position as something requiring exceptional attention and which simply cannot be dealt with as trivial breaches of the law which the gardaí are expected to take in their stride without being augmented.  There is a well planned and well defined conspiracy here and it is the duty of the Minister to take such steps as he can by bringing in further plainclothes men to ensure that this is tracked down and eliminated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick makes the point that he raises this matter because my reply to his question was casual.  He may or may not believe that but in case any member of the public were to believe it I want to say that my reply was in no way casual.  It was drafted very carefully.  I have reconsidered it carefully since and I am perfectly satisfied with every word of it.  I would ask the Deputy to regard every word of it as having been repeated.  What I said today was the only answer that a Minister for Justice can give in these circumstances. In my reply to the question today and in reply to the large number of supplementaries, I pointed out that no matter how many gardaí were put on duty in the city of Dublin during the past two weeks, none of these fires could have been prevented.  I repeat <Col N="636" /> that once again but I do not know how often it is necessary to repeat it in order that Deputy Fitzpatrick will accept that fact.  Regardless of whether he or I may like it, it is something we must accept.</P>
      <P>The type of arson he described and, in particular, the use of small incendiary devices, is one that no police force in the world can prevent.  Since these fires occurred, a considerable proportion of the Detective Branch in the Dublin Metropolitan area have been engaged almost exclusively on endeavouring to apprehend those responsible. I might add that with regard to three of the serious fires which occurred and in which entire premises were destroyed, the Garda have no evidence to show that they were caused maliciously.</P>
      <P>It is unfair to, among others, the ratepayers of Dublin city that Deputy Fitzpatrick should immediately draw the conclusion that the fires were malicious and a result of a criminal conspiracy because there may well be a great cost to ratepayers.  Since most, if not all, of the owners of these premises will be applying for compensation for criminal injury, to some extent these matters are <i>sub judice</i> and the question of malice or otherwise should not be mentioned specifically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point which was not raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick tonight but which was raised earlier today by Deputy O'Donovan when he referred to the fire at the Cavendish premises in Grafton Street.  Deputy O'Donovan made certain allegations, one of which was that there was a fire or a burglar alarm ringing for some time which was heard by a number of people before the fire was dealt with.  The Deputy alleged that there was no member of the Garda Síochána in Grafton Street at the time.  I have had an opportunity of looking into this matter and I am glad to be able to tell the House that the first people to notice this fire were two gardaí in a patrol car in Grafton Street.  These gardaí saw a light or flames in the premises.  This was at 3.40 a.m. and they called the fire brigade.  Apparently nobody had noticed the fire before then and so far as the gardaí are aware there was no <Col N="637" /> bell ringing at any earlier time on that night.</P>
    <P>To go back for a moment to the point raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick's suggestion that there should be sufficient gardaí available in Dublin to prevent fires of this kind, I wish to draw his attention to a comparison that, unfortunately, can be made easily in this country at the present time.  That is to refer him to a city about 100 miles from here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is perfectly serious.  It is a matter almost of great moment in that unfortunate city if a night passes during which there is no fire.  In that city, as we are all aware, there is a large number of troops and a large number of troops attached to the UDR as well as an extremely large number of police.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> So it was right to say that the Minister does not appreciate the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding all the security forces available there, outbreaks of this type, which are recognised by everybody as being impossible to prevent if people are bent on carrying them out, occur, tragically, with regularity.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Fitzpatrick examines the position honestly, he must realise, as I realise, that no number of gardaí can prevent occurrences of this nature. What the gardaí can do and what they have done is to give detailed and continuous advice to property owners as to how they might act in assisting to protect their property.  The crime prevention unit of the Garda Síochána have given special advice to a large number of firms on the precautions they can take in this regard.  This advice is being repeated recently in public and in private and the crime prevention unit have made many special visits to the larger city stores and warehouses and all other likely targets.  Also, the district offices in each district have made a special point of alerting property owners in their district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" /> Deputy Fitzpatrick went on to say that the Minister for Finance and I&mdash; in particular the Minister for Finance &mdash;were being parsimonious in authorising overtime and that, accordingly, there are not sufficent gardaí on duty in Dublin.  After the accounts for the full financial year, ending 31st March, are available, it will be seen that the facts are quite different from what Deputy Fitzpatrick alleges.  The cost of overtime in respect of the gardaí has proved to be astronomical, far beyond what our estimates for it were last year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the number of gardaí in the Dublin Metropolitan area, I would point out to the Deputy, as I have done several times before in this House, that there are now 2,341 gardaí in Dublin and that figure excludes all those who are serving at headquarters and the depot because, strictly speaking, those do not come within the Dublin Metropolitan count but there are quite a number of them.  This figure represents more than one-third of the entire force of the country and if the Commissioner or I were to transfer any more gardaí to Dublin, we would have a situation in other provincial urban centres and in local areas generally, where there would be a lack of gardaí. Our resources are limited.  The Garda force must necessarily be limited.  I am satisfied that the Commissioner has deployed the resources that are available to him in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>All that remains for me to do is to repeat once more that prevention of fire of this kind, which I regret as much as anybody else, is not a matter which primarily falls within the duty of the gardaí because it is simply humanly and physically impossible for them to prevent all these fires; but they can give advice and they can do, as they are doing at present, everything within their power, with specially augmented forces, to find the culprits and I have no doubt, with the successful record of detection our Garda force enjoys, that they will, in fact, be successful in bringing the culprits to justice at a very early date.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 10th March, 1971.</P>

    <P>NOTES:</P>
    <P>(1)  The Scheme came into operation on 27th January, 1967, with the making of regulations entitled &ldquo;Life Annuity (Sale of Land to Land Commission) Regulations, 1967&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(2) In all, some 404 firm applications for participation in the Scheme have been received, and of these, 396 have been investigated.  Some 187 applications had to be eliminated at an early stage&mdash;mainly because the lands offered were not considered suitable or required for Land Commission purposes.  A further 75 were withdrawn&mdash;the owners preferring to offer their lands to the Land Commission in the ordinary way for cash or land bonds.  In all 125 applications developed into potential life annuity cases and advanced to the stage where price negotiations were authorised.  Price agreement has been reached with 37 land-owners and, as shown in the table, life annuities have actually been set up in 31 cases.</P>

The rate of wages and other conditions of service relating to watchmen fall to be dealt with under the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for the Civil Service.  No application for a change in these conditions has been submitted to my Department's Conciliation Council for consideration.</P>

      <P>The watchmen who look after my Department's offices in Dublin at night and during weekends are employed on a shift basis and each watchman works 48¾ hours and 68¼ hours in alternate weeks.  The number of hours per shift varies from 9¼ to 14¾ hours.  The rates of wages, which are related to a 54½ hour week, are £16.45 plus free quarters for a resident post and £18.20 for a non-resident post.  Overtime is paid in respect of hours worked in excess of 109 per fortnight.</P>
      <P>The conditions of service of the watchmen include three weeks annual leave and sick leave privileges.  A proposed pension scheme for non-established State employees will be applicable to the posts.  No other alteration in the conditions of service of watchmen is at present contemplated by my Department.</P>

      <P>The number of hours per week worked by watchmen employed <Col N="496" /> in my Department in Dublin is approximately 1,000.  The majority of the watchmen are conditioned to a 109 hour fortnight and are allowed one night off in each fortnight, or an equivalent break.  Their basic wage is £18.40 (two have £18.10) per week plus service pay, as appropriate.  They are paid for work in excess of 109 hours per fortnight.</P>
      <P>A small number of watchmen are employed casually and are paid on an hourly basis.  The rate of pay varies between £0.209 and £0.267 per hour.</P>
      <P>Watchmen have benefited fully from all the general pay rounds in the Civil Service.  A claim for a reduction in hours of attendance on behalf of a number of full-time watchmen, who come within the scope of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the Civil Service, is currently before the Departmental Council.  Full-time watchmen will benefit under the scheme, recently agreed, which provides pensions for non-established full-time Government employees.</P>
