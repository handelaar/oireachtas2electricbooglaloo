    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan) Sean Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was beginning my reply last night I dealt with the vital question of the right of foreigners to purchase land in this country after our accession to EEC.  I pointed out first that the draft directive seeking to provide such a right has not yet been adopted by the existing members of EEC and also that we have been assured that it will not be adopted for the time being and that, even if it were, suitable amending legislation could be introduced here to protect our interests provided that this legislation was non-discriminatory in nature, that it applied equally to our own citizens as well as to citizens of other member states and finally that this legislation might take the form advocated strongly by certain members of Fine Gael in the course of this debate.</P>
      <P>The fact that we have structural problems different in kind rather than degree from other countries is well recognised in Europe.  In summary, therefore, I can say that our existing controls or similar ones devised to the same end will continue indefinitely.  I could talk for a very long time on this subject having been involved in discussions in regard to the right of establishment that have taken place over the past few months and if any Deputy wishes to know more about the situation I shall be very glad to talk to him at any time.  However, I consider that my purpose at this stage is served by having given the assurances I have given already to the House and to the country.  I agree with those Deputies who said that the question of the right of nationals of other countries to purchase land here on our accession to EEC will be a vital element in the decision of many people as to whether to vote yes or no when the referendum is taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> Before turning to questions of land policy I should like to say something in regard to the recommendation of the Devlin Report that the Departments of Lands and Agriculture should be amalgamated.  This is in reply to Deputy Desmond in particular.  As the House knows I strongly favour this proposal; I accept the logic involved in it.  Indeed, in an earlier debate I suggested my own elimination to bring it about.  What I do not accept is either that the Land Commission staff are working merely at half capacity because this recommendation has not yet been implemented, or that the delay is too great.</P>
    <P>Deputies must know how far-reaching and complex are the recommendations in the Devlin Report.  They must also know that some of these recommendations are fundamental in nature and, put into practice, would alter radically the whole system of communication between State Departments and the public, and would also alter basically the internal structure of the Departments themselves.  Because of their fundamental nature, under any Government it would take many years for these recommendations, if adopted, to be put into operation.  I want to make it clear that this Government have, in fact, acted on some of the more important proposals.  The first and most important of these is the decision to set up the Public Services Department.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that arrangements are in train to try out the aireacht executive recommendation in a number of Departments at least.  I do not think it would be relevant to go into the considerations on both sides as to whether or not this aireacht executive idea is a good one, but obviously it is one that must be tried. In the near future the Minister for Finance will be announcing the Departments in which this system will be tried on an experimental basis.</P>
    <P>The proposals in Devlin in regard to the restructuring of Departments and the creation of new Departments are not as fundamental in their nature as the two that I have already suggested and, for that reason, in the normal course of events would not be implemented <Col N="830" /> for some time yet.  So far as Lands and Agriculture are concerned, there is already very considerable reappraisal and reorganisation going on within the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  So far as I know the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is in agreement in principle with the idea of the amalgamation of his Department with the Department of Lands so far as they control the Land Commission.  Obviously he would wish that the reorganisation within his own Department to which I have referred should be completed first.  It will be many years before the Devlin recommendations, that is those that will be adopted ultimately, will be put into operation.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the major issue of land division.  Deputy L'Estrange, Deputy Tully and Deputy O'Hara asked what had happened with regard to the proposals for part-time farming which I put forward in the House a couple of years ago.  I should make one thing clear.  Like Deputy Nolan I start from the premise that there is not enough land available to solve the economic and social problems of our rural people.  There is not enough land to achieve this aim.  Therefore, let us try to be clear on what is the logic of this simple and yet profound truth.  It follows, first, that not all of our farmers can ever be made the owners of so-called.  economic units and, secondly, that other work must be provided on a full or a part-time basis for those who wish, on the one hand, to get out of farming altogether and go into other work and, on the other hand, to stay in farming but not as a sole means of livelihood.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we must provide that other work, and provide it where it is needed.  We must also decide at what point a man may be deemed to be a full-time farmer.  As regards the provision of industry, much progress has already been made.  In the recent past, certain towns have been selected by the IDA for the establishment of advance factories.  These include areas like Swinford in my own county which are very badly hit by the lack of good land and also by the lack of industrial or other work.  Very soon the IDA will <Col N="831" /> be announcing detailed plans for the development of the remoter rural towns to tie in with the existing plans for the development of regional industry in the larger centres.  I cannot be more specific at this stage.</P>
    <P>I know that the House, and Deputies who have the interests of the real countryman at heart, will be glad of this development.  The real unchanging Irishman of history, the true inheritor and protector of our culture and national values, lives in these hills and valleys and, no matter what economic experts say, his is the greatest value to our land.  It should be added here that one reason for delay was uncertainty in regard to our position in the negotiations with the existing EEC countries for accession to the Community. I think we can be happy with the outcome and in particular with the protocol which will protect the interests of the remoter parts of the country in the years ahead.  This protocol is evidence of the fact that our special problems are well recognised in Europe.</P>
    <P>On the question of acquisition may I say that I have grave misgivings about the fact that the Land Commission are asked to and do acquire tiny bits of land of ten or 15 acres.  I wonder if a system could be devised whereby bidding for such land would be confined to a radius or class.  If this were possible I would operate it with enthusiasm.  It should not have to be the concern of the Land Commission to put the expensive State machinery at their disposal into operation in cases like this.  Instead there should be the semi-free rivalry of interested locals who would contend with each other for the purchase of these small properties. After all, to make three 15-acre farmers into three 19 or 20-acre farmers does not really make them much better off.  Indeed, it is a nonsense, at least in terms of land.  I do appreciate that again I am suggesting some form of restriction on the right to purchase land and that this is indeed a very delicate subject but if you have a severe pocket of congestion and a small piece of land becomes available it seems to me that if competition <Col N="832" /> between the neighbouring or near neighbouring farmers were to result in the sale of the whole of that piece of land to one of them it would be preferable to the expensive and slow system of acquisition by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that this statement of mine involves no adverse criticism of the Land Commission. Various circumstances have forced the commissioners in many instances into going after these pieces of land, sometimes the circumstances being the fact that outsiders with far more money than the locals are in competition in the field and, therefore, without the intervention of the Land Commission the land might go out of the ownership of people in the area.  This, indeed, was the burden of the complaint made here in regard to a case in Roscommon by Deputy Joan Burke yesterday.  She has given me further details of that particular case since then.  I can only say that the decision in regard to all these matters is not made by me but by the Land Commissioners and, therefore, the local people concerned should not attempt to take it out on me personally or on my party because I do not intervene in these matters.  Indeed, is it not time that people throughout the country began to realise what is, in fact, the function of the Minister for Lands and the Land Commissioners?  Is it not time for them to realise that 90 per cent of the representations they make are self-cancelling because one goes to Deputy O'Hara, another one goes to Deputy Finn, another one comes to me and we all make our representations to the Land Commission who eventually prepare a scheme, submit it to the commissioners and they in their wisdom decide who shall get what.</P>
    <P>May I say, as well, that in general the schemes as submitted from the local offices are fairly drawn up and fairly adjudicated on by the commissioners. It is obviously impossible in the situation which I have mentioned earlier of having, on the one hand, too little land and, on the other, too little alternative employment, to satisfy the needs of everybody.  Indeed one of the rules of the Land Commission, which has every logic behind it, has given me a lot of <Col N="833" /> trouble&mdash;the rule which gives preference to a person with a holding, however small that holding, who has it as his sole means of livelihood as against somebody who, while a small farmer, also has some job on the side.  There were instances where it was obvious that the person who had the job on the side had proved his capacity to work and that in the ultimate some of the people who succeeded to the land had not done so and were afterwards to prove their incapacity for real work. However, this is a very difficult problem and one incapable of solution by means of a policy decision.  I am satisfied that in the exercise of their duty both the officials on the ground, the officials at head office and the commissioners exercise their judgement with honesty and fairness.</P>
    <P>In regard to the small farmer about whom I was talking a few minutes ago it is obvious that if this person is to have a fair existence he must have some sideline as well as his few acres. At the other end of the scale the Land Commission also have very great problems.  I shall not repeat what I said here two years ago but simply observe that with EEC approaching the difficulty of providing enough land for those who should be or will remain full-time farmers will be with us for a very long time indeed.  As one Deputy remarked, what was done in honesty 30 years ago has created some of our difficulties today.</P>
    <P>I now come to the vexed question of land bonds and with what I suspect is visible relief I am able to announce the agreement of the Government to the removal of the disabilities under which land bonds have suffered up to now.  I wish to record my thanks to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and all members of the Government for being able to say this.  I am glad, in other words, that I do not have to, because I would not anyway defend the indefensible.  The mechanics of the operation are being studied with the Department of Finance and the outcome will be announced as soon as possible.  It does seem, unfortunately, that it will not be possible to make retrospective change, that only bonds issued in the future will carry the new <Col N="834" /> status.  Of course, the most recent issues are standing high and I can only regret that the owners of other issues of fairly recent vintage cannot, it seems, be compensated now.  In any event, as soon as possible the details of the new land bonds will be announced.</P>
    <P>I turn to one of the most interesting developments in this country in recent years and that is the group farming experiment at Grennanstown, County Meath.  I had the privilege of formally launching the project on the 28th September last.  I agree with Deputy Kavanagh and everyone else who is enthusiastic about the idea of co-operative farming.  Might I tell the House a story?  Just before my visit to Grennanstown I had spent a week in Hungary and had made a brief study of the system of co-operative farming which they use.  The Grennanstown scheme is very similar to the system of co-operative farming operated there.  In Hungary, as in Grennanstown, the farmer is the absolute owner of his dwelling house.  He is also the owner of a few acres of land which, and I think this in interesting, vary in size depending on the number in his family.  I wonder how many countries in the world still provide incentives to parents to have more children?  In any event, the farmer can do what he likes in the way of farming with the acres which he is personally allotted and he can keep the profit for himself.</P>
    <P>The co-operative itself, of a minimum of 600 acres and usually substantially more, is run by a council of the farmers themselves and decisions on production schedules and so forth are taken by a majority vote.  I had long discussions with the Minister for Agriculture in Hungary and also with his two deputies not merely about co-operative farming but about conservation, forestry and other aspects of the development of the country in which I was interested.  Both the Minister and his deputies said that if the farmers of Hungary were now given their choice they would not go back to the system of individual farming which had obtained there up to some years ago.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not telling tales out of school, so to speak, when I say that <Col N="835" /> while I was being shown around Grennanstown estate by one of the four migrants involved, having told him this story, he said: &ldquo;Well, Minister, we would not go back either.&rdquo; Considering that they have been there only since last April it is obvious that the men concerned are more than well satisfied to-date at least with this experiment in group farming.  Another of them said: &ldquo;I hope you will not be calling us communists.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;We will, because that is what you are, but if it is any help you can call yourself Catholic communists.  You certainly are communists because you have now put the bulk of your land together for co-operative development.&rdquo;  Incidentally, a limited company has been formed in Grennanstown and it is operated by the directors.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with those who regard this as a significant breakthrough in land use and land development.  The next co-operative farm will be set up next year.  I have an idea that instead of scattering the houses within a radius of a half a mile or so, as in Grennanstown, the Land Commission might set up a village next time.  I should hope at some stage that this experiment will be tried.  For the purposes of the group farm to be started in the west of Ireland the proposed members of the co-op were not willing to accept this idea and wished instead to live in their individual houses separate from each other as at Grennanstown.</P>
    <P>It may be a pipe dream as far as I am concerned but I remember very early in my political life going through the old Kilvine settlement before the rearrangement scheme was effected and all of the people brought into lovely new houses on compact holdings on the hills surrounding the valley in which the old village lay. There was a marvellous sense of community in that old village and I wonder if I am simply being romantic or perhaps stupid in thinking that this sort of village life is capable of being recreated in the seventies.  Perhaps it is not, but I should like the experiment to be tried.  Of course it can only be tried with the agreement of the people <Col N="836" /> selected to do the farming in co-operation with each other.</P>
    <P>It is true that even without formal pooling of land farmers throughout the country&mdash;certainly in Mayo which is the area I know best&mdash;have begun to realise the futility of their each purchasing their own farm equipment. There has been a significant trend in the pooling of farm machinery in recent years, certainly in my county and I believe elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>In County Sligo as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obviously silly for people with limited resources to purchase machinery which is being used to only 6 or 10 per cent of its capacity.  I understand from Deputy O'Hara that this trend is visible in Sligo as well.  I should hope that through the farming organisations and otherwise this would continue so that farmers will be able&mdash;whatever quantity of land they have&mdash;to make the maximum use of their capital for the optimum development of that land.</P>
      <P>I turn now to certain other specific matters mentioned during the course of the debate by various Deputies.  One is the question of the method of paying income tax which was referred to by Deputy Tully and later by Deputy Kavanagh.  As Deputies know, Land Commission labourers, gangers and forestry workers in the Forestry Division, are at present dealt with under the public Departments system because all public servants are handled under that system.  I understand there is considerable resistance to the idea that these workers should be dealt with under PAYE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say that I see no reason at all why the switch to PAYE should not be made?  I will use my best endeavours, through the Minister for Finance, with the Revenue Commissioners to have these workers put on PAYE instead of being dealt with as of now.  It does not seem to be an insuperable problem and it is clear that some distinction ought to be made between those public servants who are guaranteed permanent work, who have <Col N="837" /> permanent work and those who are on a weekly basis with the Land Commission the Board of Works and the Forestry Division.  It seems unfair that they should have to suffer by reason of the fact that their work is casual in nature.  Therefore, it seems to me that if there is inconvenience that it should be suffered not by these workers, who are not guaranteed continuous work anyway, but by those whose responsibility it is to look after their tax problems.  The simple answer to that is PAYE and I can assure the Deputies who have mentioned this that I will do my best to have the workers concerned accommodated in the way desired by the House and by them in future.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the usefulness of the housing loan.  Deputy Nolan and Deputy Hussey asked that the £500 limit be raised to £2,000.  To tell the truth it is lucky that this particular scheme survived at all.  It was very near the elimination stage when the pursestrings were tight a year or so ago but it just did survive and I must say I agree completely with the statement that nobody is more vulnerable as regards housing than a small farmer in a rural area.  I have seen awful cases and felt so helpless that some immediate way of solving the human problems concerned was not available.  I undertake to have a look at this whole question again and will be in touch with the Deputies concerned and anybody else in the House or elsewhere who has views on it.</P>
    <P>Next there is the question of houses on property owned by the Land Commission. This has been a vexed question for years.  Where these houses are not wanted it has been the practice in recent years, in some counties anyway, for the Land Commission to offer them to the county councils.  If this scheme is not in operation in County Galway then perhaps Deputy Donnellan, who mentioned this problem, will get in touch with the county council with the view to having this scheme put into operation.  It is not right that houses which are surplus to Land Commission requirements should not be taken over by the county councils and used by them to the best advantage.</P>
    <Col N="838" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that there is too much of a delay.  It is in operation to a degree in Galway but there is a delay in allocating the houses in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the houses are surplus to Land Commission requirements there should not be such a delay.  They should instead be taken over immediately because a fairly rapid survey should be able to show whether or not they are needed in the locality.  Indeed, if they are needed I have been trying my best to have the houses allocated to some people because everybody knows houses deteriorate if they are left unoccupied any appreciable time, particularly in winter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Mention was also made about the desirability of repealing section 7 of the Land Act&mdash;Deputy L'Estrange was very strong on this&mdash; and applying the revised annuity to all areas.  Apart from the cost of doing this there are two schools of thought, each holding very strong ideas, as to whether or not it would be desirable not to give preference to people from the west. migrants and smallholders generally, in scheduled congested areas as against those in the eastern and better lands of the country.  The Government fought hard to remain this advantage for the <Col N="839" /> smallholders in these scheduled areas and for migrants.  Obviously if the position were to be restored the western small farmers would be put in a relatively worse-off position than they are now.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, there is the argument in favour of restoring the pre-1965 status, the <i>status quo,</i> that is that all farmers or uneconomic holders would get enlargements, wherever they were situated, and that even the best equipped financially in the eastern areas I have mentioned are no longer able to face up to the prospect of paying an annuity of £20 plus per acre. The cost of an enlargement of say 20 to 25 acres would be almost £500 which is obviously a very heavy overhead for a man starting out to consolidate his position as an economic holder.  These are the two sides of the argument I have been looking after myself.  The cost is a cumulative one of £20,000 a year which would mean £40,000 in two years, £60,000 in three years, and so on. I can only say that a decision as far-reaching as this would not be taken except by the Government but I have an open mind and I will simply present the two sides of the case fairly to the Government and let them decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister bear in mind that after one year the migrant is in the same position as the local man?  They are both living in an area and they should be on an equal footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. Deputy Nolan suggested that the self-migration scheme should be applied to the whole State and this is something which again I will be glad to consider.  Many Deputies referred to section 6, the scheme under which elderly, incapacitated and blind persons are given an annuity in return for their lands being handed over to the Land Commission.  Deputy Hussey described this scheme as a failure. Perhaps the word is a little strong but certainly it has not been by any means the success which we had hoped, although Deputy Nolan put a new slant on this when he said that one side effect of the introduction of section 6 was that a great deal of land owned <Col N="840" /> by elderly incapacitated people had suddenly become the object of interest to relatives and had suddenly become far better managed than before.  This is an interesting thought, something worth examining further.  It is a new challenge as to whether section 6 has been or has not been a success.  I do not think we should close our re-examination of the section until such time as it is clear what will be the EEC benefits to this country after our accession.  I think we should let the situation go on as it is until such time as we are quite clear on what the EEC proposals applicable to us will be.</P>
      <P>I shall for a moment leave the question of land and turn to forestry. Deputies who contributed to the debate agreed that the picture on the forestry side is quite bright.  Might I say before I go on to deal with it further that sometimes when Deputies adversely criticise the Land Commission officials and praise Forestry Division officials, they should bear in mind the great difference in the nature of the work the two groups have to do.  In one case they are doing jobs which are obviously enjoyable and which everybody wants done and in the other they are trying to decide imponderable problems among grasping people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I was one of the people who adversely commented on a Land Commission official I should like to say that I was not referring to a re-allocation situation.  The person was in a similar job to one which he would occupy in the Forestry Division, in establishment.  If he does not enjoy his job he should retire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The picture in the Forestry Division this year is at last a happy one.  Due to financial stringency at the time.  I had with great reluctance to agree to a cut back in the Forestry Vote which involved this year a couple of hundred forestry workers being redundant.  This situation has been changed and, as I announced in my opening statement, 100 forestry workers will be either taken on or kept on as a result of the allocation of additional moneys by the Minister for Finance.  What is perhaps more <Col N="841" /> important, the necessary funds, which will be very much greater for next year, will also be made available so as to keep up both the employment content and the planting target&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy can take any inference he likes from it.  The Minister for Finance made it quite clear in his statement last weeks that he would go for a very careful reflation of the economy after the very stringent period of deflation which was forced on the Government by deteriorating circumstances a year or more ago.  Complaints were made, by Deputy Kavanagh in particular, about the method of declaring forestry workers redundant.  It is true that a number of elderly workers with experience were laid off while younger people, possibly single people, were retained.  I should like to mention that the introduction of the gratuity and pension scheme for forestry workers had a considerable bearing on this.  Workers of more than 60 years of age, as a result of redundancy payments on the one hand and social welfare and gratuity and pension rights under the Forestry Division, were really not suffering any grave hardship by being let off and single men would have sufferred much greater hardship had they been let off instead.  Also taken into consideration were capacity to work and the attitude to work.  The forester is the person who makes recommendations on these to head office and I am satisfied that throughout the country as a whole foresters have been quite fair.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  It is not my practice to interrupt Deputies with statements, relevant or irrelevant, irrespective of what they say, and I expect the same courtesy in return.  The situation in the forestry side is set fair and I join with the House in praising the work of the Division now and in the past.  In recent years forestry work has become multiple instead of singular.  It has been a very exciting period.  There has been the opening up of many forests as public amenity areas, recreation areas, and there has been the opening up of nature trails throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the organisations, commercial and otherwise, which have sponsored competitions and otherwise helped to make the public aware of the recreational and educational uses to which our forests can be put.  I should hope that in the near future we will either ourselves produce or get sponsors to produce an illustrated book with descriptions and photographs of all the indigenous trees of this country.  There is a very good series of books produced by Shell which I recommend.  These books are very beautiful.  I am talking about something simple which would help children at a young age to learn to discern the main species of trees and their different characteristics.  They would find this a very rewarding exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh mentioned the fact that plantations sometimes extend right out to the margin of the public road and thus cause obstruction to pipelines and also to traffic.  Being so close to the open road these plantations <Col N="843" /> are more liable to burning from fires caused by passing traffic.  I understand that the practice of the Forestry Service for the past 15 years has been to keep the lines of planting a minimum distance of 30 feet from a road.  There is no doubt at all that some of the plantations laid down in earlier years come much too close to the road margins. However, where a local authority requires clearance for the purpose of road safety we have been willing to carry out their wishes to the full.</P>
    <P>The problem of parking is obvious, particularly at Bellevue Wood in the Glen o' the Downs.  I should like to say that we hope to have discussions with the Wicklow County Council in an effort to alleviate this problem. There has been phenomenal public interest in the new nature trails and walks in that wood.  A very large number of cars park there every Sunday. This problem must be tackled.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh also mentioned the Kilmacurra Estate and in particular the house on it.  The Deputy suggested certain uses for it in connection with the recreational facilities of the area. No decision has been reached in regard to the house.  I will get in touch with Deputy Kavanagh later when a decision has been made with regard to the house.  I understand as regards the land that in so far as it is agricultural land it will be divided by the Land Commission in the normal way in due course.  The woodland areas are comprised of rather narrow strips and groves and include a high proportion of rare specimens of trees and shrubs which are of great interest to arboriculturists. It is desirable that these woods should receive skilled care.  The first priority of the Forestry Division will be the rehabilitation of this area. The total area of the woodland is 188 acres.</P>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange asked about the progress of forestry in Leitrim where there is tremendous potential.  I am glad to be able to say that we are continuing to take up a very satisfactory acreage of land in that county. Because of the favourable growth rates the price being paid for forest land in Leitrim is greater than elsewhere.  May <Col N="844" /> I again urge the people of that area to co-operate to the fullest with my Department because it is in forestry that the people of that area will form the basis of a better life in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In regard to this acquisition problem generally, as the Members of the House know from my opening statement the picture is now quite satisfactory.  Even so, I have always felt that an even more simplified system with less insistence on the strict requirements of legal title should be operated in regard to forest land.  I put this situation to the legal section of my Department some time ago.  There is general agreement that it should be feasible to bring in such a system in due course.  This would mean something like the following: a forester would negotiate with the occupier of the land considered suitable for forestry purposes.  A price would be agreed upon and the occupier, the apparent owner and the forester would sign and countersign a simple document.  The funds would be lodged by the Forestry Division in some public office against which claims could be made for a period of one or two months, at the end of which time, no claim having been made, the money would be paid over to the person who appeared to be the owner.  This would obviate many of the problems which oblige the legal section under the present system to be just as scrupulous as if they were purchasing 600 acres of rich land in Kildare or Meath.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have oversimplified the system as it will work, but that is the general idea and it would mean that, while we are now getting a very satisfactory acreage of land for afforestation purposes, we would be able to get it with greater facility under a new and more simplified system of acquisition and so ensure not merely that we can maintain a programme of planting over 25,000 acres per year but perhaps in the not too distant future we might be able to raise that national target to a considerable extent.  As yet, with approximately 600,000 acres of land under forestry in the country, we have only 3¾ per cent under trees.  Hungary, which I mentioned earlier, has over 16 per cent of its land under trees.  Our <Col N="845" /> people are still not tree-conscious enough.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hara mentioned commonage. This still remains a serious block to the acquisition of large areas of land, particularly in our own county.  Further legislation should be introduced so as to prevent these large tracts of land. which may have a far greater potential than we realise, put into useful occupation. I am satisfied from what I have seen, for instance, under the new land project in Dingle in County Kerry that much of what was thought to be useless land incapable of production, or incapable, at any rate, of significant production, can be turned into first-class agricultural, beef-producing land in future. I believe that similar vast tracts of land exist in other parts of Ireland including the county of Mayo.</P>
    <P>For that reason, although it is not relevant to my ministry, I think that people in possession of good land should be given loans instead of grants for land reclamation generally and that the grants should instead be channelled into the poorer areas, not by county but by area, because there is poor land in County Dublin just as there is in County Donegal; there is poor land in County Carlow just as there is in County Mayo.  The taxpayers' money should from now on be given by way of grant only for areas such as those I have mentioned and anybody else in better land should have to settle for a loan.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say a few words on the subject of conservation and, in particular, in regard to the proposed legislation on wild life.  I do not agree with Deputy Tully that Conservation Year and after was not a success and I reject the statement that the efforts of Conservation Year were puerile.  I should like to remind him that far more than the Department of Lands and Forestry, far more than the Minister for Lands, who is chairman, far more in the way of people, resources and bodies, <i>et cetera,</i> were involved in the efforts of Conservation Year.  I am absolutely satisfied, far more so now than I was earlier, of its great success; and the extraordinary growth of interest in people of all ages in this whole problem of conservation <Col N="846" /> is evidence that what I am saying is true.</P>
    <P>Three or four years ago if you mentioned conservation very few people would know what you were talking about.  Is there anybody who does not understand now?  Three or four years ago if you mentioned the word &ldquo;pollution&rdquo; how many people would know what you were talking about. How many people are there now who not merely understand but who are greatly concerned about the conservation of the natural amenities, the preservation of the lakes, rivers, seas, the natural beauty of our country, and concerned that the necessary steps should be taken to see that this conservation is achieved?  I think it is simply stating the fact to say that everybody is now concerned here.  I am disappointed that the legislation I have mentioned is not before the House already.  It is ready and it is only a question of getting parliamentary time to dispose of it.  That, as the House knows, will not be very easy with the complex programme involving White Papers on the EEC, the preparation of legislation for the referenda&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, maybe an election coming.  Maybe I will be unlucky again and have reached the Second Stage when an election is declared and we have to go back and start the thing all over again.  In any event, I am disappointed, and I must say so, that no final decision has been made yet in regard to overall responsibility for environmental conservation in Ireland.  At present the Inter-Departmental Committee is sitting and I do not know when it will report.  I can only hope that it reports soon.  I ask it to report soon, because I believe we owe it to our people and to future generations, in particular, that a decision be made on this important matter without appreciable further delay, that the necessary National Council of Conservation be set up as soon as possible and that the administrative machinery necessary for taking care of this major problem <Col N="847" /> be established <i>quam celerrime.</i> I am concerned about this matter, but as I said before, I do not mind, either personally or as Minister for Lands, whether I am given this responsibility or it is given to somebody else, but what I do ask is that the decision be made soon, though I do think that it should in fact rest with the Department for which at the moment I am Minister.</P>
      <P>I wish, in conclusion, to thank again the Deputies who contributed to this debate, not merely what they said but for the tone and spirit of the debate at all times.  It is, I would suggest, a model, and I would hope that in other debates the same spirit of helpfulness as between one side of the House and the other would prevail.  We seem to me to spend far too much time in this House at the other kind of time-wasting exercise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to Deputy Tully.  Perhaps I should make it clear that the fact that I support the Devlin recommendations about the amalgamation in time of the Department of Lands and Agriculture does not mean that the Department of Lands cannot still go to Castlebar.  It is obvious that it can.  Secondly, may I point out that the implementation of the Government's decentralisation programme rests with the Minister for Finance and not with the Minister for Education or the Minister for Lands. These are the two Ministers concerned with regard to the proposal to go to Castlebar, on the one hand, and Athlone on the other.  As I understand <Col N="848" /> the position, the plans for the creation of the necessary buildings to house a Government Department are going ahead.  No change has been made in the basic Government decision that, ultimately, the Department of Lands will be transferred to Castlebar.  However, I wish to make it clear that, following the announcement of the decision, and very properly, the officials of the Department of Lands were asked if they were prepared to go to Castlebar and they were told in effect that they would not be forced to go if they did not so desire.  When Deputy Moran was Minister for Lands he gave that undertaking to most of the staff and I later extended it to virtually all the staff.</P>
      <P>It is obvious from the human point of view that one could not uproot people at certain stages in the development of their families, their children's education and so on and order them to transport themselves from one side of the country to the other.  It is only fair that they should be given the right to stay where they are, should they desire to stay.  In fact, the percentage who volunteered to go was quite small. There is no change in the decision to move to Castlebar but, having regard to the fact (a) that the buildings are not yet available and (b) that a virtually new staff would have to be created to run the Department there, the whole process will obviously take a considerable time.  In spite of the Bishop of Kerry's strictures on the Government, the human problems involved in shifting a major Government Department from one end of the country to the other are more important than any mere statements of policy.  I hope that this decentralisation will take place sooner rather than later, but it can take place only when the problems, mechanical and human, are first solved.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £75,326,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1972, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare for certain services administerd by that Office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, and for sundry grants.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, last year's Estimate for Social Welfare was agreed without discussion and a motion was put on the Order Paper subsequently to enable a debate to take place on the activities of the Department of Social Welfare for that year.  It is proposed to take the motion and the current year's Estimate together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="850" /> The net Estimate for Social Welfare for 1971-72 is £75,326,000.  This represents an increase of more than £11 million over the original Estimate of £64,158,000 for 1970-71.  We had a Supplementary Estimate of £8,730,000 towards the end of March to cover the cost of the 1970 Budget increases and, when this is taken into account, the net increase comes to about £2½ million. We will, of course, require a Supplementary Estimate this year also, because of the increases announced in the Budget, as there is no provision for these increases in the published Estimate. It is, therefore, rather difficult to make valid comparisons between the provision for 1971-72 and that for 1970-71 as set out in the Estimates Volume and I would ask Deputies to bear in mind that most subheads for 1971-72 will be increased by a Supplementary Estimate later in the year.</P>
    <P>The main reason for the increase of £2,438,000 is that the increases in payment rates and other improvements made last year will operate for the full 12 months in the current financial year as compared with eight months for assistance and six months for insurance in 1970-71.  In addition, there is an extra pay day for some services.  These increases are offset by a reduction in the provision for unemployment assistance and in some cases would be greater but for a downward trend in the number of recipients.  This applies particularly to non-contributory widows' pensions.</P>
    <P>The estimated expenditure and income of the Social Insurance Fund are set out in the Appendix to the Estimate.  Total expenditure for the current year shows an increase of approximately £6 million.  Here, again, it is difficult to make valid comparison between certain figures for 1971-72 and 1970-71 for the reason I have already mentioned and, further, because of the introduction last year of new schemes of invalidity and retirement pensions.  For instance the Estimate for disability benefit shows a substantial reduction due to the transfer of many claimants to the new schemes.  Similarly in the case of unemployment benefit there was a transfer to retirement pension with a corresponding <Col N="851" /> reduction in the provision for the current year.  The income of the Social Insurance Fund is expected to increase by about £5 million as a result of the increased contribution rates operative from October 1971. The net result is that the payment from the Exchequer to the fund shows an increase of about £1 million.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading of the Social Welfare Bill, 1971, I gave estimates of the cost of the various proposals contained in the Bill.  On the social assistance side the cost in a full year is estimated at £3,783,000 and on the social insurance side £6,709,000, a total of almost £10½ million.  When this is taken into account, the expenditure on our social welfare services is now running at an annual rate of £128 million.  Administration costs amount to about £5¾ million a year, so that the total yearly bill is roughly £134 million.  This is quite a formidable sum and I would ask Deputies to have regard to it when they criticise as inadequate the rates payable under particular schemes.  In this connection I think it is only fair to say that I feel we are altogether too prone to indulge in general condemnation of our services. Some indulde in this with a very inadequate knowledge of what exactly is available under the different schemes and the great majority without giving credit for the many improvements made down the years.  I am not for a moment suggesting that further improvements are not desirable&mdash;indeed I can assure the House that I will continue to effect improvements within the limits of available resources&mdash;but I strongly deprecate the attitude that our services are something of which we must be ashamed, and that we are lagging far behind other countries in these matters.  In the final analysis the Government can provide only that level of services for which the community, whether as taxpayers, employers or insured contributors, is prepared to pay.  When it becomes evident that the community is prepared to pay substantially more, I, as Minister for Social Welfare, will be only too glad to introduce further improvements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> On this question of improvements, my Department have been working on the preparation of a scheme of pay-related disability and unemployment benefit as promised in the Third Programme of Economic and Social Development.  While a great deal of ground has been covered, a number of difficult technical problems remain to be solved before the necessary legislation can be drafted.  In that programme, mention was made also of detailed examinations of the children's allowances scheme, the scope of social insurance, and the social assistance schemes generally.  As Deputies are aware, the scope of social insurance was extended this year by the raising of the remuneration ceiling for compulsory insurance in the case of nonmanual workers from £1,200 to £1,600 per annum.  An analytical study of the children's allowances scheme is being carried out as part of a programme budgeting exercise in my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department are currently engaged also in a wide-ranging review of our assistance services including home assistance, with a view to framing a new comprehensive code of social assistance which will probably involve a radical restructuring of the various existing schemes, entailing the re-designing of the present scales of payment so as to reflect more accurately the different requirements of various categories of recipients.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve a proper overall development of the State income maintenance services greater integration of the present home assistance scheme with those services would seem to be an essential part of the reform programme. One of the possibilities I have in mind is that the State schemes would be supported by a national reserve scheme of assistance with standardised uniform scales of payment to cater for those cases that do not qualify, for one reason or another, for assistance or benefit under the specific schemes or to supplement the payment under a specific scheme where this would be called for to meet the requirements of a particular case.  Such a reserve scheme would replace the present scheme of home assistance with its widely varying standards of payment. <Col N="853" /> I have under active consideration a number of alternative ways of dealing with the whole problem and in this regard schemes in other countries are being studied.  When this examination has been completed and an overall assessment and evaluation of the position has been made, I will decide the lines which the programme of reform I intend recommending to the Government should follow.</P>
    <P>As part of the general review to which I have referred, my Department have already this year carried out a detailed survey of the home assistance service throughout the country and the material obtained has been discussed with representatives of the superintendent assistance officers and assistance officers who are directly engaged in the administration of that service.</P>
    <P>When moving a Supplementary Estimate for my Department on 30th March last, I gave a review of the operation of the principal new services introduced last year.  It is probably not necessary for me to go over this ground again, but Deputies may be interested to know that the number in receipt of deserted wife's allowance is now 1,500, the number of retirement pensioners is 4,100, and the number receiving invalidity pension is 12,200.  I should also mention that the current provision for social insurance contains for the first time a sum of £205,000 for death grants.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the 1971 Bill, I dealt in some detail with the action being taken to protect employees against loss of benefit arising from failure of employers to stamp insurance cards.  I have no doubt that all Deputies deplore any action by an employer which could jeopardise a worker's right to social insurance benefits.  We should, I feel, equally deplore the action of unscrupulous individuals who make fraudulent claims on our services.  These dishonest claims are made by persons who, while working, declare themselves to be unemployed by signing the live register, or who conceal their full means, or represent themselves to be ill when they are fit for work.  I am sure we all agree that social welfare funds cannot <Col N="854" /> be allowed to become the pool in a game of cheating the Government.  The prevention of abuses in relation to the social welfare services is a problem which is always receiving attention in my Department.  While every effort is made, as it must be if we are to operate the laws passed by the Oireachtas, to carry out a reasonable investigation of claims, it is understandably difficult to eliminate all abuses without delaying unduly the determination of genuine claims and increasing administration costs to an unjustifiable extent.</P>
    <P>From time to time, Deputies and others complain of the complexity of social welfare Acts and regulations.  I admit that complexities exist, but it would be simply impossible to provide social welfare benefits without a very detailed and precise set of conditions governing eligibility for each particular benefit.  I am sure that Deputies would be the first to complain if undue discretion were allowed to me, as Minister for Social Welfare, or to officers of my Department, in determining claims. Thus, when the Oireachtas enacts a provision that, for example, a person must have 156 paid contributions to be eligible for a particular benefit, there is little sense in criticising my Department when a person with less than this number of contributions has his claim disallowed.</P>
    <P>I know the individual citizen often finds difficulty in understanding the various conditions for benefits.  We do our best to provide the required information. We have an Information Section in the headquarters of the Department which handles correspondence of a general nature and deals with a very large volume of telephone inquiries. In Dublin city we have a public office at Beresford Place, and early this year we provided another such office at Phibsboro Tower which is intended to deal with personal callers from that area.  Leaflets giving detailed information on the various services are available at employment exchanges and employment offices throughout the country.  In addition, there is the very useful booklet <i>Summary of Social Insurance and Assistance Services</i> which is revised annually.  This booklet, <Col N="855" /> of which 45,000 copies were ordered on the latest reprint, is distributed free of charge to Deputies, Senators, local authorities, trade unions and others on a mailing list.  It is issued also to any individual inquirer and is available for consultation at employment exchanges, employment offices and post offices.  I know that some Deputies, at least, make good use of this booklet as they have praised it more than once in this House.  Might I suggest that other Deputies should study it and I have no doubt that it will help them in dealing with inquiries from their constituents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>At the outset I might say that the Minister's statement can be described only as a monotonous recital of what he had last year and which we have had on a few occasions since then. Indeed, each year we are promised greater benefits in respect of social welfare.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the statement in so far as it holds out no hope for the less well off sections of our community between now and the next Social Welfare Bill, whoever might introduce that Bill.  As I said during the passage of the Social Welfare Bill in July last, increased benefits granted to social welfare recipients in the Budget have been eroded completely. This has been due to the increased cost of living since then.  It is also true that every miserable increase given in social welfare since 1957 has been swallowed up by rising prices.  In too many cases, and certainly at present, recipients were less well off after the increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right to put on record the experience of a social welfare recipient who visited my office last Saturday. She got about 40p of an increase in the last Budget but she detailed to me how <Col N="856" /> that increase had been already over spent and she was only talking about the necessaries of life, food, drink, clothing and rent.  The Minister must admit that the increases given in the last Budget fall very far short of what is needed in those days of spiralling cost of living.  It is a pity that when the Minister for Finance last week told the House that the economy was now improving to such an extent that he could find £20 million quite easily to give benefits here and there, the Minister for Social Welfare could not tell him, as all rural and city Deputies know, that the less privileged people in our society are far from being reasonably well looked after.  They must still pinch and scrape as they have always been doing, unfortunately, to make ends meet and the increase they got in the Budget is completely eroded leaving them much worse off.  I have already this year asked the Minister to have a careful and comprehensive review made of our social welfare code.  From what he has said just now it appears that little is being done by him or the Government to take serious cognisance of the fact that this is vitally necessary.</P>
    <P>Also lacking from the Minister's statement is any reference to the EEC or his visits to Brussels to look after the social welfare side of government business here.  I think the Minister went to Brussels recently but if I am correct he went as Minister for Labour and not as Minister for Social Welfare. It is unfortunate that our Minister for Social Welfare, in view of the fact that we are an applicant for EEC membership, has not gone to Brussels many times to find out what is being done in regard to social welfare there. One of the fundamental aims of the founders of the EEC was the constant improvement of the living and working conditions of their people and to provide in the social field for all sections of society a fair share in the steadily rising prosperity.  No doubt those are lofty aims but they are aims to which we should all aspire.  Have the Government given any serious consideration to or made any serious examination of how this country will fit in with social welfare conditions in the EEC when we join or whether we should <Col N="857" /> take example from the present EEC countries?  From reading their reports it is clear that social welfare conditions there are vastly improved for those depending on that kind of income.</P>
    <P>The Minister stands condemned because even in the White Paper on the EEC there were only a few pages devoted to social welfare and of those four pages, it is significant that 2½ were devoted to equal pay for men and women.  That is not good enough in those days when the Government are indicating&mdash;and we on this side of the House agree with them to some extent&mdash;that in the European Economic Community social welfare recipients will be, and should be, better off.  We have a duty to those who may lose their jobs when we join the EEC; we must see they are retrained and fitted to get new jobs.  I have heard or read very little of any worthwhile attempt at appraisal of the situation which must now be very nearly upon us. Those are the things about which the Minister should be talking to us and he should give us his views and those of the Government when he makes his annual statement on social welfare here.  His statement was singularly lacking in any reference to those very important matters.</P>
    <P>Later in his statement he mentioned wage-related contributions.  Since I became spokesman for this party on social welfare I have all the time advocated that the Government should take a serious look at the good that might accrue generally if we had wage-related contributions and wage-related benefits. I think we should find that those conditions already exist in the EEC countries to the benefit of all concerned. Employers in the Community contribute a higher proportion to the cost of social security for their employees.  I might say to the Labour Party when we talk of joining or not joining the EEC, that while there may be some disadvantages for the people to whom I now refer it is also evident from reading reports of the European Social Welfare Fund and seeing how it is administered, that there are better opportunities, better living conditions and a much better appreciation of the hardships these people must endure in <Col N="858" /> the EEC countries than here or in Britain.</P>
    <P>Is it not true to say that children's allowances, in which we have been clamouring for increases on this side of the House for years past, are much higher in any of the European countries than in Britain or Ireland?  It is high time serious consideration was given by the Minister and the Government to tackling this problem in a serious way.  Everybody knows the State cannot provide lavishly for everybody when funds are limited but what we expect the Government to do is to redistribute the country's wealth more equitably.  It is no over-statement to say that there are many people in our country in November, 1971 who are living on the breadline and many who are pinching and scraping to make ends meet and, as costs continue to spiral upwards, their problem becomes more difficult and almost impossible of solution. This is a tragedy in this day and age.  That is why I expect the Minister and the Government to give serious consideration to this matter and to stop this business of giving those people an increase of a few shillings in one Budget or another.  Unfortunately we have too much of a stop-go policy being operated by the Government.  They have no real forward-looking policy or aims to be achieved in two or three years time.</P>
    <P>I believe&mdash;and I am sorry the Minister did not refer to this&mdash;that there is a great need for what could be described as professional social workers. As the problems of our times become more complex that need becomes more intense.  People who are doing this work, and they are altogether too few, are giving a very valuable service.  I do not want to denigrate the very valuable contribution made by charitable organisations and religious orders in the field of voluntary social effort.  In fact, I want to put on record my appreciation, and that of my party, of the invaluable work they have been doing and are doing.  As I already said, these problems are so complex that professional, trained social workers are a must.  It is all right to say that doctors and nurses can cure physical and mental illnesses, but we are left with <Col N="859" /> people coming home from hospital who have to face problems relating to housing, company, comfort and things of that nature.  The Government should co-operate with these voluntary bodies who are doing such valuable work.</P>
    <P>I have said more than once in this House that I believe there is a just case for reducing the qualifying age for an old age pension from 70 to 65 years. While civil servants and others in the public sector can retire at the age of 65 years, there are other sections who worked hard and who have to plod along until they are almost incapacitated before the State sees fit to give them a pension.  I say this in all sincerity.  If it is the wish of the people that the Minister should be Minister for Social Welfare when the next Social Welfare Bill is introduced, he should seriously consider reducing the qualifying age for a non-contributory old age pension from 70 to 65 years.  There is no justification for keeping it at 70 years when so many sectors of the community can retire with good and lavish pensions when they reach the age of 65 years. Most Deputies will agree that in many cases when people reach the age of 70 they are incapacitated to such an extent that they can get little enjoyment out of what the State gives them.  For that reason I appeal very sincerely to the Minister to make this change.</P>
    <P>I cannot let this occasion pass without again referring to widows' pensions. During Private Members' Time within the past year we gave three hours for a discussion on what I believe to be a very fair, equitable and common-sense motion.  I thought from the Minister's reply that he was seriously considering the unanswerable case made in this House.  There is nothing in the Minister's statement to cause widows to rejoice.  I said previously and I repeat now that the conscience of this country demands that widows should be treated better by society.  I also said then, and I repeat, that if there was an awakening of the social conscience, and if our people stopped to think about the conditions in which widows have to live, money would be provided to <Col N="860" /> alleviate some of the hardships they suffer.</P>
    <P>Over the past 12 months we have had discussions on the social welfare system.  For that reason, and knowing well that the time of the House is badly needed for a discussion on other Estimates, I am prepared to be very fair and brief on this Estimate.  Surely it is our right as a community to provide adequate care and protection for deprived and underprivileged members of the community.  The Minister said he finds it hard to have patience with those who say nothing has been done for them.  I admit that something small has been done for them, but I assert that we have done nothing like what the vast majority of the people who have something to give would like to do for those people if they were sure that what they were contributing was going towards the alleviation of hardship and distress.</P>
    <P>There is an immediate need to provide a comprehensive social welfare code.  We have been going on for years giving a few shillings to the old age pensioner, the widow, the disabled and the unemployed.  This is not just good enough.  If we believed we were joining the EEC we should have been setting ourselves the task of examining the conditions relating to insurable employment there and insurable benefits and the retraining of workers for jobs. We have heard practically nothing of what may happen in this field if and when we join the EEC.</P>
    <P>I also believe that if this case is put properly to the entire community&mdash;and I think it is not being put properly to the entire community; many people who could be regarded as affluent, because of their own environment, their own living conditions and their own social circles do not really understand the hardships and privations their brethren and their next door neighbours have to endure&mdash;they will think seriously about it and will provide the necessary money to help their brethren.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that not enough is being done with regard to the social welfare system.  Does the Minister and do Deputies in the Finna Fáil Party <Col N="861" /> realise&mdash;and I thought they were near enough to the grassroots to realise this but apparently they do not&mdash;that in this day and age so many people are still suffering so badly?  It is our duty as Opposition Deputies to point out that hardship cases still exist, to point out that the increases that were given on 26th April last are already completely eroded and that, in fact, social welfare recipients are now far less well off than they were 12 months ago.  All those things need to be said.  It does not do any of us any good to say them but we have a duty to do so.  I hope my case for a comprehensive social welfare code will cause the Minister and the Government to think seriously about it.</P>
    <P>The trouble in this country is that the national wealth is still not being justly distributed.  We must try to ensure that if there is an increase in the national wealth it will be distributed equitably and find its way to the weaker sections.  It is unfortunate that for some years the approach of all Ministers for Social Welfare has been &ldquo;How little can we give?&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;How much?&rdquo; We still have the poor law approach to those problems.  Much remains to be done and I suggest that the social conscience of the Minister and of the Government should be stirred up immediately because there is a feeling abroad that, like all the policies of the Government, social welfare is moving from day to day and from month to month and getting graduually worse.  It is a pity this question is not approached in relation to what will be happening in next year's budget. There is a great case to be made for a social welfare policy that will plan and direct its efforts not only for next year but for four or five years hence.</P>
    <P>I am very sorry for the people for whom I have spoken particularly for the widow pensioners in regard to whom I thought there would be something in the Minister's statement but while I am sorry for all those people I appreciate the Minister's position.  The Minister for Finance possibly has more to do with it than he has.  I appeal to the Minister to keep prodding the Minister for Finance.  It is his job to do so.  The people for whom he is legislating <Col N="862" /> are not at all happy with the position. It may well be that the present Minister for Social Welfare will not be there to introduce the next Estimate. It may well be the job of another Minister to do it.  Possibly there will be a change of Government.  If and when there is, and I think there will be shortly, it will be the task of the new Minister for Social Welfare to tackle this whole problem in a comprehensive way, to realise the opportunities that people in the EEC countries have and that we have not got here, to realise even the opportunities that the people in the Six Countries have that we have not got here.  Perhaps having considered all those things, there will be a step towards making a better 32-county Ireland and making us a better member of the EEC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare is also Minister for Labour.  His duties are spread over a vast field.  I consider this wrong.  I would be inclined to think that we should have a Minister for Social Welfare who would also be Minister for Health because health and social welfare are so interlocked.  They cross each other so often that it would be more appropriate for a Minister for Health to take over the duties of the Department of Social Welfare.  In the new government, which is certainly on the way, I think one of the first steps should be to have health and social welfare embodied in one Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are finding that social welfare is not taking the place in our lives that it should be taking.  Social Welfare is a very complex Department.  I will admit that.  However, the service to the people is far from adequate.  This is a criticism of the Department.  We all know how bad this Department is.  It has been highlighted in the national newspapers.  The expert in the <i>Evening Press,</i> Mr. Tony Butler, has done more than anybody, to my way of thinking, to highlight the defects in this Department and to try to rectify them.  He has sent telegrams to the Secretary of the Department.  He has demanded action, action which came finally with his intervention.  This is an interesting point.  People feel that they cannot have their problems solved without <Col N="863" /> going to a person like this.  He has been able to get prompt action because he demands it.  The ordinary person in the street, the person most affected is the person least capable of putting his case, of explaining his problem.  Can anything be more frustrating to a poor person who is on social welfare benefit than not to receive his cheque on Friday morning and to be left without money for the week-end and to go down on Monday and be told: &ldquo;We did not receive the certificate&rdquo;?  In all good faith that person posted the certificate and something went wrong in the Department.</P>
    <P>This should be a dynamic Department geared to meeting people's problems. The people who are meeting the public should be sympathetic and know the problems of the public.  I know that dealing with the public can be a frustrating task but I should like to see trained people in the public office of the Department of Social Welfare who are sympathetic, not people who say: &ldquo;Sorry, we did not get it&rdquo; and chase a person away or: &ldquo;Go over to the employment exchange&rdquo; as they are often told &ldquo;and get your number there&rdquo;.  People have to walk from Store Street across to Werburgh Street when a streamlined method could be evolved within the Department which would make this unnecessary.  It should be orientated towards helping the poor person, not making his life much more difficult.  This is the attitude of this Department.  The Department, despite all the claims, still, to my way of thinking, works at 45 per cent efficiency. That is no exaggeration.  That is the first thing I should like to see.  I would want to see very vast changes in that Department at all levels to ensure that the public are well protected and helped in every way possible.  The people who cannot articulate their problems are the very people who need help.  The whole attitude must be one of sympathy towards these people. Health and social welfare are interlinked so much that they must go together.  The Department of Social Welfare needs to be streamlined in the interests of the public.</P>
    <P>I put down a question yesterday <Col N="864" /> about social services in Northern Ireland which to my way of thinking was a very vital question.  Whether the Government realises it or not re-unification has become an irreversible thing. It will happen in the foreseeable future and we should be thinking about what we can do to put our social services on a par with those which exist in Northern Ireland.  The Department of Social Welfare should be studying the problem to see how we can say to the people in Northern Ireland that our social services are as good as, if not better than, theirs.  We should be spelling out the cost of providing such services. It is no use saying, as the Minister said yesterday: &ldquo;I have a rough estimate&rdquo;.  In the course of his reply the Minister said that if we wanted to know details about specific services in Northern Ireland they could be had by writing for a copy of the publication <i>Everybody's Guide to Social Security in Northern Ireland</i> published by the Six County Ministry of Health and Social Insurance.  It is an insult for a Minister to give a reply like that.  We must know where we fall below the social services given in Northern Ireland.  The Minister says it would cost in the region of £50 million.  We should see how this could be spread out and what extra contributions would be involved.  A section of the Department of Social Welfare should be devoted exclusively to the study of benefits in the North of Ireland and in the EEC.  When refugees came down from the North how active were the Department of Social Welfare in dealing with their problems?  I was dealing with refugees and I know exactly where the Department of Social Welfare fell down on the job.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to come into the House and say that the situation in the EEC countries is different and it is impossible, therefore, to make a comparison.</P>
    <P>The Minister was asked yesterday how our social services compared with the EEC countries and a reply in relation to each and every member country of the EEC should have been given. If there is a disparity it should be spelled out because if we are going into the EEC we have to be geared to the EEC conditions and in this respect <Col N="865" /> there is no more important sphere than social welfare.</P>
    <P>We all know there will be mass emigration and it is important for those workers who will become redundant here and go to the EEC countries to find work to know exactly what benefits they will get.  It would not augur well for this country if our workers went abroad and found social welfare benefits in other countries so high that they would not return.  It is not good enough for the Department to say that statistics are available in books.  The Department should have all the information available.</P>
    <P>I, for one, would like to know exactly what children's allowances are in the EEC, how their system operates, if it is different from ours and if it is working more to the advantage of the individual than our system.  If other countries have a better system, we should follow their example and apply a system which is fairer and more equitable for the individual.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Third Programme for Economic Expansion and everything he said in his speech today was stated in the Third Programme for Economic Expansion, 1969-72.  The Third Programme is due to expire shortly and I presume we shall have a fourth one.  The Third Programme states what it is hoped to achieve within the period 1969-72.  In the field of social welfare it was hoped within that period to have pay related social welfare contributions and a new system of unemployment assistance but nothing has been done in either the sphere of pay related to contributions or social assistance.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>... my Department has been working on the preparation of a scheme of pay-related disability and unemployment benefit as promised in the Third Programme of Economic and Social Development.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what the result of this is and when is it going to be incorporated into legislation.  This is another clear indication that the Department are not doing their job.</P>
    <P>According to my way of thinking he Minister for Social Welfare stands indicted for not doing his job as Minister <Col N="866" /> for Social Welfare.  However, I can understand this because the Minister has not done his job in the Department of Labour either.  We had strike after strike after strike and still he did not intervene so that certainly did not take up his time.  I wonder what did take up his time?  I have great personal regard for the Minister but I must talk in terms of a Minister for Social Welfare who has control over a Department. He should ensure that his Department produces the results outlined and promised in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development.  In February, 1969, a wide-ranging review of our existing services, including home assistance, was mentioned.  That was three years ago but nothing has been done.  What is happening in the Department?  Do we not have the experts?  If not, why not?  It is too important a subject to gloss over by saying that we are studying it.  We are currently engaged in a wide-ranging review but we have not got the personnel.  We must have personnel engaged in vital studies such as these because they concern the welfare of our people.</P>
    <P>Does anybody know the degrading aspect of the means test employed in regard to home assistance, unemployment assistance, non-contributory pensions, whether widows or old age pensions? We had the débâcle of the dole when the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, came across two cases in his constituency of people who were illegally drawing the dole.  He rushed in and wanted the dole removed from all those deserving people in the country who cannot get employment. The Minister for Finance made a scapegoat out of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>In this city we find a man who is out of unemployment benefit who then must go on unemployment assistance and the means test is employed in his case.  He might be a man of 21 or 22 years of age who is living at home because he could live nowhere else except in a dosshouse, the Iveagh Hostel or some other place like that, where you can get bed and breakfast on this £3 a week which is given to those unemployed people.  This man, because he <Col N="867" /> lives at home, finds that the total income of the family is taken into account and that he may get as little as 25p a week unemployment assistance. If he moves out of his home he cannot live because I defy the Minister to tell me where anyone in Dublin could pay for a room and live on £3 a week.  If the Minister can tell me where there is such a place I will publicly stand up and apologise to him. There is no place in Dublin where a person can get a room and two meals a day for £3 a week.  A furnished room alone costs £7 a week.</P>
    <P>The unemployment assistance allowance is so small that this man is forced to live at home and because the means test is employed he only gets as little as 25p a week and is then considered a pauper in his own home. He cannot get a job.  I write as many as 50 letters a day to firms looking for jobs for young men like this man and it is virtually impossible to obtain them.  It is made clear to those young men that they are living on charity in their own homes.</P>
    <P>The wonderful social welfare system we have in this country gives this pittance to unemployed people whose unemployment benefit runs out or to people whose employers refuse to stamp their cards.  The Minister has admitted here on many occasions that this is prevalent.  Those are the people who are being victimised by this means test in regard to unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>You literally are a pauper when you look for home assistance.  You are interviewed by people who are not trained as home assistance officers.  You may get a voucher for food.  You lose all dignity, you are humiliated.  This home assistance, which is not adequate, is also provided while people are awaiting decisions on their pensions, such as widows and old age pensioners.  People who come home from England while they are waiting for their cases to be verified by the British authorities get this paltry home assistance to meet present day spiralling costs.  When they get their benefit they find the home assistance is taken out of the money they receive and is refunded to the <Col N="868" /> home assistance people.  We find that a greater number need home assistance so we should have people specially trained in the field of sociology who will be able to know their problems, who will appreciate the delicacy of this matter, who will appreciate the confidentiality of this matter and who will be sympathetic with those people, see what they can do and not have people going to home assistance officers and in so many cases finding themselves abused.  We are not asking for vast sums of money to be spent.  We are only asking for a proper approach to this problem to see what can be done about those people in receipt of home assistance.</P>
    <P>We ask for flexibility in the deserted wife's allowance scheme.  This was promised by the Minister for Social Welfare a short while ago.  If this scheme is flexible can you imagine the case of a woman who went through a registered marriage with a man, who has three children by that marriage and who finds when she goes to his home in Africa he is already married? This woman is destitute with those three children but she finds that the deserted wife's allowance does not apply to her. She is told that she can be given nothing.  Can you call this scheme flexible? This woman, through no fault of her own, was bigamously married, but is not given the deserted wife's allowance.  We were heartened to hear from the Minister that he would make this scheme flexible.  How can we call it flexible when it treats this woman in this way?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In subsection (6), page 5, lines 18 and 19, to delete all words from &ldquo;in&rdquo; to the end of the subsection and substitute &ldquo;by means of an election employing the single transferable vote&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill as drafted provides in subsections (6) and (7) that the elections by the staff and students will be in such manner as may be approved by the Minister from time to time.  In a Bill of this kind one does not want to tie down the electoral system.  The college should be reasonably free to make up their own minds on that, but I do not think it should be left to the Minister in that form.  There is a problem here, because already within the college there have been informal elections from the student body and the Minister has intervened to object to the particular form of election.  I do not know enough about it to say whether he had reasonable objections to the form of election adopted.  What concerned me was that the form of election which he proposed at that time did not seem particularly democratic.</P>
      <P>It involved equal representation from a number of different groups of students varying very much in numbers. There are schools in the college which have only four students or fewer, while others might have 20 or 30 or 30 to 40.  The Minister proposed at that time equal representation for these different groups.  That is a system which does not commend itself to this House because in elections to this House any system which involves grave departure from one-man-one-vote was found to be unconstitutional in 1961 and I do not think we in this House should envisage a system which might in a similar manner depart from that basic principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure with the best intentions of securing that all interests in the college were represented, the Minister insisted on an election system for students which very much departed from this principle.  He gave to three or four students in one school the same representation as students in the very much larger first and second year schools.  I <Col N="870" /> think we have reason for trying to tie down the system a little more tightly and not to leave it entirely to the discretion of the Minister.</P>
    <P>In thinking out how best it might be done, it seemed to me that a possible solution would be to lay down in the terms of my amendment that an election should employ the single transferable vote.  What is involved here is an election.  As the Bill is drafted, there is reference to student and staff representatives being nominated by the students &ldquo;in such manner as may be approved by the Minister from time to time&rdquo;.  The Bill does not state &ldquo;shall be nominated by an election being carried out as laid down by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As it stands it is open for the Minister to arrange for a number of separate elections for separate groups, whereas the wording I propose is designed to ensure that there will be one election for the whole college operating on the single transferable vote system and that therefore the student council emerging will be representative of the whole student body and proportionally representative of the different interests rather than leaving it to the discretion of the Minister, which might produce the kind of results which would give excessive representation to an individual group.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has an alternative proposal to make I am prepared to listen to it.  I am not tied to this.  In putting down the amendment I am not seeking to make the case for PR in the College of Art.  I am not being dogmatic or ideological about it.  I merely thought that something sufficiently general was required to leave flexibility in regard to details but in particular to prevent the Minister from prescribing a system of election which might involve excessive representation for some groups and inadequate representation for others.  We have some indication that this might be prescribed by the Minister in view of the line he took recently.  As I have said, if the Minister can suggest another way around it, different to what I have proposed, I am prepared to consider any counter proposals he might have.</P>

      <P>While I agree with what the Deputy <Col N="871" /> has said in relation to the teachers and students being free to make up their own minds&mdash;that is the underlying point I have been endeavouring to make&mdash;if I were to accept the amendment it would mean that the teachers and students would not be free to make up their own minds; they would be very definitely tied down to a particular type of election. Perhaps I should mention that in laying down a system that would be approved by the Minister from time to time, what I had in mind was that I would consult with the teachers and ask them which type of election they would prefer and settle for that, and that I would also consult with the students and see which type of election they would prefer.</P>
      <P>As a matter of interest, I am sure the Deputy is aware that on a previous occasion when he suggested the students should adopt the PR system they wrote to me demanding that they should have the straight vote system. I do not know whether their tongues were in their cheeks when they wrote.</P>

      <P>To come back to the subsections, I have explained to the Deputy what I propose to do and that I was simply approving of whatever method they would prefer themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that the students have already expressed a preference for the straight vote.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too happy about that.  I am not too sure whether we should not tie them down a little. I am not arguing about the straight vote in itself.  There is a case for the <Col N="872" /> straight vote in single member constituencies. In another context we have been opposed to that.  A system of the straight vote for two positions would worry me.  If there was the straight &ldquo;X&rdquo; vote in an election for two posts, I am afraid that the block vote of a bare majority or even conceivably of a well organised minority would ensure that a minority vote would succeed. There is no doubt that the &ldquo;X&rdquo; system is workable, though I think it is undesirable for national politics, in single seat constituencies.  It is dangerous in multi-seat constituencies because it leaves itself open to manipulation.</P>
      <P>The Minister's disclosure that that is the system favoured in the instance we are talking about, in the election of 12 students to meet him, suggests the need for us in this House to lay down a system in sufficient detail to prevent manipulation.  I am strengthened in my view now that it is perhaps important to press the amendment in the particular form in which it is.  I am not happy that this should be left to the Minister. He has told us he will take the view of the students.  I am not sure that, if the students did come forward with a proposal along the lines that they put to the Minister in another context, and which is open to manipulation, I would like the Minister necessarily to approve of it.  This is something which may not perhaps be safely left to the students themselves.  I do not think it is something that should be left completely to the Minister because he has shown a disposition for an electoral system which is unrepresentative in terms of giving equal representation to groups of totally disparate size.  The Minister and the students have shown an inclination to look for a system which does not commend itself to me.  This suggests strongly to me that we should lay down a strong line here.  The Minister in what he says persuaded me that my amendment has considerable merit.  I am less open now to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>There is a serious point to be considered.  Would the Minister like to comment further on the possibility of a system, such as the students proposed to him on a former occasion, being proposed by them and whether he would propose to adopt it? A certain amount hangs on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very difficult to follow the trend of the Deputy's remarks, not alone in his statement now but also since the beginning of the discussion on this Bill.  The Deputy has come down strongly on the side of what he would term democracy, that is, giving considerable rights to people, and in this case he would appear to me to be endeavouring to limit those rights.  I do not want to get into any discussion in relation to the merits or demerits of PR or the straight vote.  In general, this is, as it were, a single seat constituency with two seats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The college as a unit is going to vote.  There are only two seats, and according to my knowledge of the PR system it is not regarded as possible to have that type of vote with less than three seats. I am not advocating the straight vote system.  I am saying that I will leave it to the students to decide what type of election they would prefer.  I will let them make a decision and I will approve it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made several statements.  He referred to a concept which, if this debate were broadcast outside Ireland, might be regarded as an Irish concept&mdash;the single-seat constituency with two seats. Perhaps the Minister wants the single constituency with two seats.  His views will not be shared by the Minister for Labour who was elected to this House in just such an election on two occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>We know the exceptional circumstances.  We have by-elections, where we have only one seat. The general feeling in regard to proportional representation is that there must be three seats.  Basically the situation is that, having made the statement here, <Col N="874" /> I would be willing to consult the teachers and students as to the type of election they will have and I will approve of whatever the majority there decide on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems concerned particularly about the teachers and students exercising their democratic rights and that they might recommend to the Minister the block list system.  The Deputy knows that many professional bodies in Ireland operate that system, have been doing so for a considerable time and will continue to do so without in any way diminishing their democratic function. The Deputy is jumping many steps together when he assumes that either the students or the teachers will propose an undemocratic system of election and that the systems he is talking about are undemocratic.  We are all concerned with the exercise of representation. It is very seldom that the Members on this side of the House get an opportunity of noting the presence or absence of some of the people, more or less following the precedent of Deputy Cruise-O'Brien.  It might be no harm to note that the Deputy opposite is the only representative of any Opposition Party in this House at a time when we are discussing democratic procedure.  The spokesman for education in the Labour Party has not attended at all during this debate.  The public would be very concerned to know that one member of the Opposition is now here expressing the views of the total Opposition on the system of election to be operated in the college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That raises an interesting thought, but I think there may be special reasons at this moment for the absence of any member of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>However, my function here is to speak for my own party and that is what I am trying to do.  I am not very happy about some of the ideas the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are putting forward. <Col N="875" /> First of all, the suggestion that democracy entails allowing any group whoever they may be to fix the electoral system for themselves for their own benefit is a claim we utterly reject in regard to Northern Ireland where the system of election devised there by a majority to suit themselves is one to which we are bitterly hostile and universally critical in this House.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting the College of Art is a splinter from some other institution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I am not talking about that.  I was talking yesterday about the problem of the alienation of many students there from authority which is akin to the alienation problem of the minority in Northern Ireland and the split between the two groups and the feeling it arouses is akin to the split between the communities in Northern Ireland. There is an analogy there because some of the psychological attitudes there are akin in the two cases.  I make the reference here merely to point out that the Parliamentary Secretary's suggestion that every majority should have a democratic right to determine their own system of election is something which we do not concede in the case of Northern Ireland and which I do not think we concede in relation to this country itself.  The electoral system here is laid down in general terms in the Constitution and we do not permit the majority party in this country, whoever they may be, to determine the electoral system.  That is a matter to be determined by the people as a whole, not by the majority in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is a danger here&mdash;and I am surprised that the Minister is not more sensitive to it&mdash;that even a minority, or conceivably a bare majority, of the students can so organise things that two student representatives <Col N="876" /> representing their viewpoint only could be elected.  The fact that the students who, if I gather correctly, were in touch with him before and are what might be described broadly as the dissident students did, in fact, propose a block voting system of this kind should alert the Minister&mdash;who is concerned with the interests of other groups of students as well&mdash;to the danger here.  There is a real possibility that, if the Minister simply accepts whatever proposals are put forward, he might get a proposal from what one can describe as the dissident students designed to ensure that they get the two seats, even if half the students or perhaps even more than half the students, less well organised, want a representative of their viewpoint.  I am a little surprised that the Minister is not sensitive to this issue.</P>
    <P>Any electoral system in this instance, when we have a college in which the students and staff are very deeply divided, should be one designed as far as possible to ensure that the different viewpoints are represented and that no one group will dominate the representation and exclude from representation the minority, perhaps even a majority.  I would be rather unhappy if, as would be entirely possible, if the Minister's suggestion is carried through, the staff representatives elected by the system represented the viewpoint of what was the majority of the staff and perhaps the viewpoint of the more conservative members in charge of the staff who, because of what has happened in recent years, are, for reasons which one can understand from their point of view, out of sympathy with the students; and if the student representatives were both representative of the dissident students.  I cannot think that the college would get off to a very good start in that way.</P>
    <P>It is very important, when we are dealing with a body which is so deeply divided, that the electoral system should as far as possible ensure that the two viewpoints that are now to be found among staff and students, who are virtually not on speaking terms with each other, should be represented as far as possible.  We should certainly not adopt a system which would tend <Col N="877" /> to exclude that and tend to intensify a staff-student polarisation which is not, in fact, a full reflection of the situation in the college.  Therefore, quite apart from pressing my amendment, I would press the Minister to give consideration to that.</P>
    <P>It would be unfortunate if we imported into this particular situation an attachment to another electoral situation in another context which we do not employ, which nobody has ever proposed we employ, in a multi-seat constituency and which is known to be dangerous in multi-seat constituencies because it can give one group control of all the representation.  Let us be fair to the Fianna Fáil Party.  They have never proposed such a system for national elections and, in fact, such a system for national elections except in a limited usage in certain boroughs in England, where it has since been abandoned, is not, in fact, employed.  In those boroughs what happened was that in a very large proportion of cases, even when the vote was very evenly divided, one party got no seats.  That system was abandoned because of its undemocratic character.  The Parliamentary Secretary may say professional bodies have used this system here.  I am prepared to believe him.  If so, this may or may not produce bad results.  I have known it to produce very bad results indeed and to be manipulative by very small groups voting consistently in a particular pattern and getting their people in even though they were in a minority. Whether or not the Minister accepts my amendment he should be cautious about accepting any electoral system which is likely to produce the kind of block vote result in which you get two representatives of one viewpoint and the other viewpoint, which may be shared by half the students or half the staff, is not represented.</P>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister even go so far as to indicate whether he is taking my point and that in saying that he would wish to accept the recommendation of staff and students here he is not committing himself necessarily to a system that might produce undesirable results.  I think it is a mistake for us to contemplate that. If the Minister says that is what he <Col N="878" /> intends to do and that if the students recommend it he will accept it, I think it is a strong reason for not giving him the power.  If people feel they have not a fair system, that it has been rigged against them by the Minister, these kind of paranoic delusions will develop, and it would be much better if we did whatever minimum was necessary to ensure that the system would yield representative results.</P>
    <P>I am not wedded to this particular amendment.  Any alternative that would exclude the possibility of a non-representative type of election I would accept, if the Minister can devise one or if I can think of one between now and the Report Stage which would be an improvement on this; but the Minister should think twice about doing what he has indicated he might do.  His own concern to ensure that the different viewpoints in the college are represented, which he has very properly insisted on in this House, should encourage him to think twice about what he has indicated here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am not convinced by anything the Deputy has said.  Perhaps this is one of the problems of the Deputy that he can.  I believe, having listened to him over yesterday and today, argue equally well on one side or the other, and I have not the slightest doubt that if he took the opposite stance he would argue just as strongly as he is arguing in relation to this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not. It is a compliment to the Deputy.  The Deputy referred to the question as to whether or not I was sensitive to the particular situation.  I certainly am, but I have not the slightest doubt that if I showed that sensitivity in one particular direction the Deputy would immediately object to it.  Undoubtedly, there are problems in the college. Quite possibly the attitudes which I was forced to adopt are now leading to a situation where good sense will prevail, and I have no doubt that the very large number of students who failed to make their voices heard until <Col N="879" /> the college was actually closed down will see to it that a proper type of election will take place which will give a fair representation to the various viewpoints.  We are permitting only two students to represent the whole body of students and, no matter what we do, it will be difficult to have every possible viewpoint brought before the board.  Nevertheless, by leaving it to the students and to the teachers, after the difficult period we have had, to make the decision as to the type of election they would like I am showing a trust in them.  Because of that I cannot see any reason why I should change the sections as they are in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear the Minister has not, perhaps, taken my point. Perhaps I should be more explicit. Supposing there are 110 students and 60 take one viewpoint and 50 take another; under the proposed system two candidates will be put up by both groups.  The two candidates put forward by the 60 student group will get 60 Xs and the other 50 will have no representation because they will get only 50Xs.  If the Minister uses the 1, 2, 3, 4 system proposed here each of the 60 will have to choose one or other, giving a 1 to one and 2 to the second and out of that will emerge, as emerges in Donegal/Leitrim in elections, one candidate representing each viewpoint.  One would need an extraordinarily disproportionate strength of the two sides to end up with any other result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to take my point.  It is rather important.  I fear he has not appreciated the significance of the voting system he has indicated, which students have looked for in the past and may look for again, a system which would of its nature exclude representation of the minority.  I do not care whether the minority is the more dissident students.  I am not speaking for one side or the other.  The Minister knows that.  At the moment the minority are the moderate students and what I am proposing would benefit them.  They may in the future become the majority and the others may become the minority.  I am concerned in <Col N="880" /> not adopting an electoral system which will exclude representation of a minority. It could be a very large minority, 49 per cent of the total.  That would be very dangerous in the situation of the college.</P>
    <P>I would impress this on the Minister and I should like from him some indication that he understands the difficulty and will, in fact, ensure this does not happen and, in approving the electoral system, will not be inclined to accept a system which will exclude minority representation.  In the ordinary way this might not matter very much.  If the college was a united body and there were no differences we could take a chance on it.  Many professional bodies act in this way.  In some circumstances it does not matter very much, but it does matter where there is a polarisation of opinion.  The Minister does not seem sensitive to this particular point in view of the dangers.  It may well be that I have not explained clearly enough what the danger is until now, but I think the Minister will see that there is a real danger that, with the kind of division I mention, the 60 students will get both seats.  Surely we should prevent that happening and ensure that student representation does represent student opinion and that no group will be excluded from representation. If the Minister does not see that and does not accept that, then this is an amendment I must press, though it had not been my intention to do so when I started speaking.  I was inclined to be prepared to consider any alternative. I thought the Minister might come forward with some wording which would not tie us to the particular method here.  I cannot think of a better wording.  I am not tied to what I have here, but I cannot think of any other wording which would exclude the danger I mention and, unless the Minister or I can think of another wording to prevent this danger and given the Minister's apparent willingness to let this happen, this is an amendment we will have to press.</P>

      <P>Before subsection (8) to insert the following subsection:-</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" />&ldquo;() One ordinary member of the College Council shall be a member of the Art Teachers' Association and shall be nominated for appointment to An Bord by the members of this Association by means of an election employing the single transferable vote, provided that should this association cease to exist this member shall be elected by the graduates of the National College of Art by means of an election employing the single transferable vote&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This relates to the question of representation of the Art Teachers' Association on the college council, as I have suggested it should be named, or An Bord, as it is named at present.  It seems desirable that the representation on this board or council should be as wide-ranging as possible.  There is by analogy with other third level institutions a case for representation of people who are graduates.  Admittedly, the Art Teachers' Association cannot be equated with graduates of the college who have passed through it and secured diplomas, and if the Minister felt that a wider selection were desirable I should be prepared to agree.  It seems, however, bearing in mind the very special function that the college has in regard to the teaching of art and the existence of this association with a special interest in the subject, that there is a case for having representation for them on the council or board.  This would also have the effect of creating a more even balance between those elected to this body and those nominated by the Minister which would be more in line with the practice in other similar institutions.  It seems to be a suggestion worth making, and I should like to hear from the Minister whether he feels it worthy of consideration or not.</P>

      <P>I do not think I should accept this amendment.  First, I should point out that the board will consist possibly of 11 members and five of these have already been determined in this Bill, the teachers and students and the director.  It would confine me too much to add another <Col N="884" /> to this number.  Also, I can see a situation where the teachers appointed could possibly be members of the Art Teachers' Association and the argument would be put forward then that the Art Teachers' Association was over-represented on the board.  The main consideration is that we have already determined where five of the total representation must come from, and I think I would be confining my choice in regard to the remaining members too much if I were to agree to a provision whereby a member of the Art Teachers' Association would also have a right to be appointed to the board.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that there is a case in a third level educational institution for representation on this governing authority of those who have passed through the institution, that it encourages them to retain interest in the educational body of which they are graduates or diploma holders and that this is a principle we should encourage? I am not pressing the particular form of the amendment, but does the Minister not think it wise to make this provision which exists in the case of the universities at present in one form or another?  It is in a very different form in the case of Dublin University but it does exist in some form in both universities.  Is it not desirable to try to achieve this? If the Minister is concerned that this would not leave enough independent representatives&mdash; I am not convinced of that&mdash;one can vary the total size by adding one to the figure he has mentioned.  It seems a pity not to have some direct link particularly with those who have passed through the college and have continued their interest in art through art teaching which is so much a concern in the country at the moment?</P>

      <P>I am not precluding the appointment of a member of the Art Teachers' Association but I would find it restrictive if I were to decide that what would be tantamount to six of the 11 members should be determined in the Bill itself.  For that reason I think I should have as wide an opportunity as possible to select what I would feel, after proper consultation, <Col N="885" /> would be the best people as members of this board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points on this section that arise out of the discussion. One point relates to the composition of the board and to an amendment which I had down and which was withdrawn for re-drafting. One aspect that was not discussed and which I should like to put now to the Minister is the desirability of ensuring that the membership of this board in the particular circumstances of the college does not include a civil servant. There is no criticism of civil servants in this or any other context; but the college, as the Minister has said, has operated for a long time in conditions which are less than ideal.  The direct running of a college of this kind by a Department of State imposes on such a Department a burden which is so out of line with their ordinary functions that it does not necessarily lead to a successful result.  A clean break should now be made rather than maintaining the link.</P>
      <P>We do not have on the governing bodies of the universities civil servants representing the Minister or appointed by the Minister.  The Minister would want, I would hope, to appoint independent people such as he recommends for appointment to the governing bodies of the universities. This point was included in an amendment which will be coming up again on Report Stage. I should like to press the Minister on this point when we come back to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the membership of the board, as we now have it, it is a board with a membership of between nine and 11.  The Minister said that five of these would be predetermined and I take it he meant those selected by the students and the staff and the director.  In a sense the chairman will also be predetermined.  The question of his manner of choice is a matter to be considered further.  The Minister has agreed to look at it again and to consider <Col N="886" /> a proposal which I put forward as a compromise that he would appoint the chairman on the recommendation of the ordinary members of the board.</P>
    <P>I suppose a board of nine to 11 is a reasonable size for this purpose.  I did consider the question of whether that size might be varied and I decided not to attempt to vary it.  I also considered whether it was desirable to increase the representation of staff and students so that they would be a majority.  Interestingly enough, no pressure came from the staff or students on this point.  I am afraid this may more reflect inexperience on their part of the making of representations about Bills rather than any lack of interest in securing adequate representation for staff and students.</P>
    <P>The students have, in fact, at another time claimed that they should have not only representation but that the college should be run by staff and students jointly.  I understand that this is the way in which a number of colleges are run in other countries.  I read in today's paper&mdash;I do not know how accurate this is&mdash;that in at least one country all the colleges of Art are run on that basis.  I am not happy with the present situation.  In not putting down an amendment to vary staff and student representation on Committee Stage I was, perhaps, over-influenced by the fact that no such request came to me.  It seems to me from subsequent consultations that this reflects a certain confusion on the part of those concerned and a certain inexperience.</P>
    <P>I spoke recently to some members of the teaching staff who are very opposed to the occupation of the college and to the various events which occurred.  I asked them did they consider the Bill and had they made representations and they told me, to my astonishment, that they were waiting to be consulted.  I had to say to them that they were naive if they were waiting to be consulted and that they were unlikely to have an opportunity of pressing their viewpoint.  Owing to the disorganisation in the college, its closure and the difficulties they have had, the staff have not been meeting together to express their views coherently. I would not think that the <Col N="887" /> students have been expressing their views very coherently either.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I was over-influenced in not pressing for increased staff and student representation by the failure of the interests concerned to see this.  This may be due to special circumstances. I am not sure that it would not have been better to have pressed the issue on Committee Stage even though it was not sought by the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not diminish the value of outside independent representation.  I think every educational institution needs this.  Whatever the students may say, a college run only by staff and students could become inward looking and could be insufficiently conscious of legitimate public interest and concern, and insufficiently conscious of their function in society and the role they should be playing.  Some of the students very properly fear that economic pressures in society might, if other voices were involved in their governing authority, pressurise them towards fulfilling an economic role in society as at present constituted.  They feel this would be inhibiting to their true education.</P>
    <P>This is a legitimate fear.  It is a fear felt by students all over the world.  In some countries pressure of business on third level institutions has created very unhappy conditions indeed.  This has not been the case in Ireland.  In fact, far from the problem of business interests pressing assistance of various kinds for research, and so on, on third level institutions and seeking their assistance in solving their problems, they simply have not shown any great interest in higher education.  Our problem is not excessive pressure of business interests but inadequate interest on the part of business interests in higher education.</P>
    <P>In this country, therefore, when students sometimes express fears on this matter they are being a little unrealistic. It is a legitimate concern and there is a danger which is, perhaps, exemplified in the very change in the title of the college, that the college could be orientated very much towards very practical functions and become part of the economic establishment, designed to produce people who would play a role in increasing the productive <Col N="888" /> resources of the country in terms of goods and services saleable on the market.  That is not what a college of art should be for, and any attempt to orientate it excessively in that direction will provoke a very proper resistance by the students and the staff, indeed, in their concern that the college should perform a genuine cultural function and not primarily an economic one.</P>
    <P>Of course, in a small country we cannot have a proliferation of institutions. It may be necessary for this college to fulfil practical functions as well as cultural ones.  I do not want to be too dogmatic about this.  There is a legitimate concern on the part of staff and students on this score and there is a fear that, if the staff and students between them are in a minority they could come under the influence of people appointed by the Minister who, because of their involvement in public affairs generally, might try to orientate the college too much towards an economic function.  I would hope that this will not happen and that the Minister will make enlightened appointments. I am not, of course, excluding the appointment of somebody engaged in business.  In fact, one of the names mentioned as a possible member of the board&mdash;and it has been said to me that he might be acceptable to quite a wide range of staff and students&mdash;is somebody who is engaged in business.  There is not necessarily a dichotomy.  A business man may have a very great contribution to make because of his interest in art.  I do not rule that out.</P>
    <P>It is important that, given the fact that the representation on the board as at present proposed&mdash;and this has not been challenged in any representations made to me&mdash;does involve the staff and students in being in a minority, the other appointments should be demonstrably appointments of people who are primarily concerned with artistic education, and not of people who could be alleged to be concerned primarily with developing the college as an institution to assist in economic growth.  I hope the Minister will have regard to this in making the appointments. I am still somewhat unhappy with the staff and student representation being in a minority but, if the <Col N="889" /> Minister shows sensitivity in the appointments he makes, that may not create problems in this case.</P>
    <P>The Minister has turned down the suggestion that the Art Teachers' Association should be represented directly.  He pointed out that this might involve dual representation if one of the teachers chosen were a member of the Art Teachers' Association.  I suppose that could happen.  In seeking suitable people to appoint, the Minister might have regard to the desirability of appointing at least one person who had passed through the college at some stage, and had direct experience of it with its faults and virtues, and who could, therefore, bring an insight into the discussions of its problems which would be a more detached insight than that of the staff or students directly involved but which, at the same time, would be an insight based on actual experience of the college.  I would not push it beyond that at this stage.  I hope the Minister will have regard to that when he is making these appointments.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the section which have given rise to some concern.  Some of them will come up again on Report Stage so I shall not dwell on them here.  A lot hangs on the Minister's appointments to this body.  We all wish him well in these appointments.  If any of us have constructive suggestions to offer him we should do so privately, and I am sure he will have regard to any constructive suggestions he receives from any source.  I hope he will be successful in the appointments he eventually makes.</P>

      <P>I see.  In the absence of any very strong reason one way or the other that gives you an indication, I suppose, of the kind of period.  I think that is appropriate.  I am unhappy, however, about the provisions which were in the previous section which enable the Minister to terminate the office of members before their term of office is up.  I hope that will not happen, that he will not exercise that power but allow them to carry out their duty for the full period unless they get sent to jail for some ignominious offence or something like that.</P>
      <P>It would be undesirable to have the Minister intervene to terminate the appointment of a member during the three-year period.  He will have regard to the desirability of changing gradually the personnel, not leaving the same people there indefinitely.  There is a tendency when people are appointed by Ministers to State bodies to leave them there for a very long time.  A feeling grows up that if you do not re-appoint somebody this is an insult to him.  It is important when making the appointments to make it clear to the people concerned that there will be a need for change-over and that there will be a tendency not to re-appoint one of them at the end of each term of office and that they need not feel that it is in any way a reflection on them.</P>

      <P>The section is opposed.  I again raise the issue I raised before.  It seems to me undesirable that we should automatically disqualify Members of this House from playing a useful part in bodies of this kind.  The tendency to do so in legislation isolates Members of this House from activities to which they could contribute and from the general life of the community.  However, the Minister has said that that is something that must be considered in a general context.  I accept that but I would like to know when is it going to be considered in a general context. I have been hearing this since I went into the Seanad six years ago.  I have yet to hear of anything practical being done and I would hope that something will be done about it very soon.</P>

      <P>This section covers the case where a member of a board would have an interest in a company or contract and makes very proper provisions to exclude him from decisions in respect of that company or contract.  It does not, however, cover the case of appointments.  In this country where appointments are sometimes made on a basis other than merit it is desirable to safeguard against this and that where people have an interest in an appointment of and close relationship with a candidate they should not take any part in his appointment or his non-appointment, if he is not to be appointed or is to be dismissed in these circumstances.  I think this is quite important.  It needs to be clearly established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a reason for feeling this because several years ago when acting in my capacity as a member of the governing body of UCD an issue arose which affected a close relative of mine and it seemed to me proper to take no part whatever in the discussions relating to that matter and to withdraw from the meeting at which it was discussed. I think this should be a requirement because at the moment one does not know whether a person in that position has acted in this way or not. May I say that on three occasions at least in this House varied imputations have been made against my character by a Deputy opposite which, as I interpret them, from what he has said in the House and has said to me on the corridors of this House, throwing remarks at me as I pass by, suggest that he is unaware of the fact that in that instance I, of course, withdrew from any involvement in the matter and did not seek to influence anybody <Col N="893" /> in the decision taken.  The fact that I am in a position where my character is being impugned in and around this House by that&mdash;I was going to say gentleman but I will say that Deputy in the circumstances&mdash;the fact that that has happened arises from the fact that there is no clear requirement in this matter which would make it clear to everybody that this is the manner in which people should and must act. There is something to be said for including a provision which will not only ensure that people will act in this manner but ensure that they will be known so to have acted and these kind of imputations will not be made against them.  You will appreciate that I have reasons for feeling strongly in this particular matter.  Owing to the veiled way in which these accusations have been made I have had no previous opportunity of clarifying the position.  I think you will see the need for something to be done to deal with this matter.  I wonder if the Minister would be prepared to consider adding to the requirements here that where a person has an interest in the appointment of a close relative that he shall also take no part in the deliberations.  It seems to me important in the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <P>I do not think there is a real need for it in the sense that any person with any wisdom would refrain from taking part in a discussion in a matter of this type.  As I see it, a person could be involved, for example, in a company or concern without the knowledge of the other members of the board but it is most unlikely that if a personal relative of his was going forward for a post that this would not be <Col N="894" /> well known to the members of the board and they would be able to take the type of action that they might not be able to take in relation to these other matters because they would not be aware of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a fairly standard provision in legislation of this sort.  There is a very clear reason for it.  It can mean that a person can be party to both sides of a contract either directly, personally or in some other capacity.  It would effectively nullify or vitiate a contract and this is very undesirable.  For this reason this provision has been included in all legislation of this sort.  I sympathise greatly with the Deputy's suggestion about appointments but human nature being what it is I do not think it would be possible to confine it to relatives.  The Deputy can appreciate that one is sometimes more influenced by associations with friends than by associations with relatives.  In Dublin particularly it is one's friends rather than one's relatives who create the greatest demand. It is one of those occasions on which, unfortunately, people may impute certain things that do not hold water and people have to tolerate this.  It is not feasible to include that type of provision in legislation.  If one says &ldquo;relative&rdquo; how far does one go in specifying the relative?  By including a relative does that mean a close friend?  By the exclusion of one the other may be included. I sympathise with the Deputy, but I think the Deputy is only expressing a concern.  I do not think the Deputy has an amendment down on it.</P>

      <P>Though I recognise there is a real drafting difficulty we have to deal at the same time with a country where the pool of available people is very small and where there is a tradition which stretches back for 100 years&mdash;I am not making a party political remark here&mdash;of jobs for the boys and such is the extent of mistrust in the country that these things are often imputed where they do not happen. It is alleged to occur frequently where it does not, in fact, occur.  In this House we are trying to legislate for a situation where very deep distrust does currently exist.  If relatives are specifically excluded does one give by implication <i>carte blanche</i> to those who are friends and not relatives?  The Parliamentary Secretary knows the law much better than I do but I do not think this, in fact, would be implied.</P>

      <P>There is a difficulty in drafting but there is a real point in what Deputy FitzGerald is saying and although no amendment is down I should like to urge the Minister to see, in consultation with his advisers, whether there is any generalised form of words which could be added to this section.  I recognise that no legislation will be able to prevent the occasional case where the thing is subtly done but I would urge the Minister to consider if it might be possible to get some form of protection in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned last night the depth of the distrust and the depth of the division. I do not say that to increase it but we must recognise that it is there. I do not think we shall have a good art school until that is dispelled and I do not think that will be the work of a moment.  Any provision in this Bill which serves to spell out even more than would be required on other occasions the absolute neutrality, the absolute justice, the absolute equity of all <Col N="896" /> sections would be useful in the present context even simply from the point of view of reassurance.</P>

      <P>The Minister's remark &ldquo;Is he a friend or only a relative&rdquo; reminds me of a story told to me by a very senior officer of the Polish Government who has since died and it is, therefore, possible without risk to him to tell the story&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am just reminded of the story by the Minister's remark. This senior officer told me of a visit by the Poles to Hungary where they made a reference to &ldquo;our Russian friends&rdquo;.  The Hungarians corrected the reference and said: &ldquo;No, you mean our Russian brothers.&rdquo; The Poles were a bit disconcerted and asked &ldquo;What is the difference?&rdquo; The Hungarian reply was: &ldquo;We can choose our friends.&rdquo; We can choose our friends but they are not identifiable in the way in which relatives are.  The Parliamentary Secretary is perfectly right, the kind of amendment I envisage would not rule out the possibility of malpractice and of a person favouring somebody who is a friend of theirs for personal reasons. Nothing can ever exclude that but the evident scandal of a person participating in the appointment of a close relative is something so clearly identifiable that it is worth guarding against even if the more general and probably more widespread evil of people making appointments on the grounds of friendship cannot be dealt with.  It is not impossible to define the degree of kindred; it is done when it comes to marriages and if it is done for marriages it can be done for appointments to the College of Art.  We could have a forbidden degree of kindred clause here too.</P>

It is not the practice in other higher level institutions.  It did not, however, seem an important enough point of autonomy to challenge by way of amendment.

      <P>I should like to endorse that.  In what this section says it is not very important either way.  The number of times there would be any invoking of this power on the Minister would be quite small.  The objection to it is similar to the objection which both Deputy FitzGerald and myself have voiced about other parts of the Bill, that over and over again the Minister is claiming powers which seem to me quite unnecessary.  If we get the sort of people that are essential then they are as devoted to the commonweal as anybody else.  They are as concerned at doing a job as honourably as the Minister or anyone else is.  I certainly do not think this sort of supervision is necessary.  It is a niggling intrusion which adds to the general atmosphere.  There is a remark about motorcars attributed to Henry Ford that one could have any colour one wanted provided it was black.  In this Bill we have the situation where people will be given as much power as they want provided the Minister has the ultimate say about everything. The Minister cannot give it and not give it.  It is niggling and in itself it is trivial.  Let us try to establish the <Col N="898" /> principle of the devolution of power in our legislation and of trusting people who are given that power instead of trying to supervise all the small print.  Vastly more devolution exists in all sorts of areas in other countries.  I consider the best system of agricultural education in the world to be that run by committees of local farmers with different curricula, different standards, different everything and yet they have a very brilliant result.  I suggest they should be left alone and told that no one will breathe down their necks and that we will be amazed if anything improper is done.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 24, after &ldquo;imprisonment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;of more than six months duration&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was raised in the HEA Bill and it is raised again here.  I think it quite wrong that a member of the board should be disqualified because of a relatively minor offence which may have been committed.  There is a girl student in prison for three months for an offence which consisted of having been involved in the spilling of some sheep's blood in the vicinity of a particular institution in the city.  That sentence seems unduly harsh for a student who had no previous record of any misbehaviour.  The fact that that can happen to a student for what most of us consider a prank, but certainly not a crime, suggests that it is extremely undesirable to have a position under which such a student would be automatically disqualified from being on the board.  If a serious offence is committed it would be wrong to have the offender on the board.  Given the <Col N="899" /> way that students and university staff can be involved in demonstrations and the way they can find themselves arraigned if something goes wrong and given a harsh sentence for an offence which most people would regard as not worthy of a prison sentence, suggests the extreme undesirability of having this clause in an unlimited form.  I raised this point on the HEA Bill and I press it here again.  It is possible at some stage that a member of the staff or the students of the College of Art who have been elected to the board might do just the kind of thing that the girl I have mentioned did at the American Embassy.  There should be a provision here to deal with cases of minor offences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to that.  It comes back to the sort of board who are going to be appointed.  It is not any breach of confidence to relate a conversation I had with a Deputy of the Government party who is known for his concern with art and whom I believe to be both enlightened and absolutely genuine in his concern.  We were talking about someone and I said &ldquo;X is crazy&rdquo;.  This man said: &ldquo;That is par for the course.&rdquo;  We are dealing with people who are creative workers. There must be some creative people on that board if they are to be acceptable to the student body.  The actual formulation of this section&mdash;and I do not refer to the bankruptcy bit&mdash;would remove half the great painters that ever were in the College of Art from the possibility of being appointed on a board like that.  Artists do violent and sometimes irrational things with the same motivation which generates the tension inside them to produce valid works of art.  One must accept that that is so.  Are we going to have a board similar to one composed of the trustees of the stock exchange?  If this is done there will be no rapport with the students.  There should be some penalty for major crimes.  Deputy FitzGerald's amendment deals with that. If for the sort of misdemeanour in which either the staff or the students might get involved&mdash;or even independent people if we are to have some really creative people on the board&mdash;<Col N="900" /> and if as a result of pranks or protests they may find themselves in jail for three months, the Minister must remember that this is not a stock exchange or a bank or a factory.  It is a school of art.  The provision is restrictive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  The amendment was suggested in relation to student agitation.  I indicated at that time that I could not accept it.  I could not accept the type of situation which would be created in relation to that Bill.  I would expect that the students elected to the board would be responsible people with the interests of their fellow-students as their prime consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would question a little of what the Deputy has said in relation to that.  If their activities in relation to the college or otherwise involve them in lawbreaking to the extent of being sent to prison, one would be entitled to doubt their sense of responsibility or their suitability to act as members of the board.  Those who would be elected to this particular board should at least have a sense of responsibility.  It should be remembered that their duties as members of the board would be to ensure that the college would be conducted in such a manner as to make certain that the future of the students would be assured.  These duties, coupled with <Col N="901" /> their own studies, in my view should be more than sufficient to fill their time.  If they feel they desire to indulge in illegal activities they should resign from the board and make way for somebody who would be more concerned with the welfare of the students.  Furthermore, in relation to this amendment not only should the law of the land be upheld but it must appear to be upheld.  If certain offences are excused it could be held that this legislation was holding other laws in contempt.  For all these reasons I can see no particular value in the amendment put forward by the Deputy in relation to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of what the Minister has said sounds substantially like the Establishment view. The suggestion that a student should have enough to do with his own studies not to involve himself in public activities is one which can only be described as Victorian and is not realistic.  I do not think the girl whom I mentioned was a student in the college but if, because she was involved in a demonstration and because of the harsh and unjust sentence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was tempted by the Minister's approach to be unparliamentary. The view that a student who engages in a demonstration and is sentenced in a manner which many people feel excessive should not be on the governing board of this particular college is unacceptable.  Of course, if somebody does something which is seriously discreditable and if he is consequently inflicted with a serious prison sentence this would disqualify him.  I am open to suggestion as to how this might be revised.  Do the offences need to be defined?  The fact that a student gets a sentence of three months imprisonment for participating in a demonstration or acts in a manner which, although some people may say students should not behave in that fashion, is not something that most people would regard as a blot on the <Col N="902" /> character of the person concerned.  I think most people here, at any rate, would have sufficient understanding and sympathy, and if a student of the kind we are talking about came forward for employment of some kind we would not rule him out because of a prison sentence.  Most people in those circumstances would have sufficient sympathy and understanding to appreciate that the student was motivated by a genuine, altruistic concern on a political issue with a high emotional content and that what was done was not of such a character as to be equated with somebody pinching the funds of an organisation or hitting his mother-in-law on the head with a hatchet.  It is ridiculous to say we must equate these things.</P>
      <P>There are minor offences which do not carry with them the kind of ignominy which would justify people being precluded from participation in, say, the governing body of the College of Art and it may well be that a student found to be the most valid representative and the one most acceptable to the student body would be the student who demonstrated his genuine concern for and dedication to the interests of his fellowmen; he might be the very kind of student involved in a demonstration on possibly an extraneous issue and could, as a result of that involvement, receive a minor sentence. For us to exclude such a person and to say that students are not entitled to choose such a person is going quite beyond our function in the matter and going quite beyond what is required by any reasonable concern with the responsible government of the college and what we are entitled to do in normal democratic practice.</P>

      <P>All sections of society&mdash;students, farmers, businessmen and others&mdash;are subject to hazards in certain activities which may be peculiar to their particular calling or profession.  Some might suggest that farmers coming home from fairs are more inclined to be in a condition which would, through no particular malice, leave them open to committing a driving offence.  Businessmen might find themselves in the same situation in taking advantage of circumstances <Col N="903" /> not altogether in accordance with the law.  It is accepted that students are inclined to express their views more vocally than the rest of society.  That is not to say that, in doing that, they are doing something unlawful, which is what Deputy FitzGerald would seem to imply.  It does not suggest, as Deputy FitzGerald would seem to imply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy said the sentence was an intolerable one.  I do not know what happened, but it is the function of the court to take all relevant factors into account.  Students are not establishment figures.  They cannot be.  On the other hand, it is not sufficient to exempt them from conditions which apply to the rest of society. As the Minister indicated, the law must be consistent in these things.  One cannot bring in legislation which runs contrary to the general corpus of laws. Participation in demonstrations does not mean that one would be excluded from the board.  There was, I think, a supposition that if so-and-so had been a student she would, first of all, have had to be a student, secondly, a member of the board elected by the students and, thirdly, the facts presented to us would have had to be the facts.  I am not questioning the Deputy's accuracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point.  I have had a little experience in courts and if we specify a period of three months or six months we leave ourselves open automatically to a situation in which lawyers defending people will say that the offence might warrant six months, or three months, or whatever the period is, but &ldquo;My lord, I have to tell you that, in fact, this particular person is a member of An Bord <Col N="904" /> Coláiste Náisiúnta Ealaíne agus Deartha and, if this particular person is sentenced to three months or six months, then he or she will automatically be excluded&rdquo;.  If we specify a period we invite that kind of argument. If the Deputy is concerned about the consistency of the law this is something he might like to consider.  In actual fact no students go to prison for a first offence, or for being found spilling blood, as the Deputy put it, unless there is some element of previous activity.</P>

      <P>I am impressed by the Parliamentary Secretary's argument on the need for consistency and the argument that one cannot differentiate between different degrees of offence. My understanding is that the law of this House was that you were disqualified from being a Member if you <Col N="905" /> committed a felony but not if you committed a misdemeanour.  You are now disqualified if you commit an offence calling for six months imprisonment but not for an offence calling for three months imprisonment.  How is it the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister accept this for Members of this House but not for the College of Art?  She could still be a Member of this House but she is &ldquo;turfed out&rdquo; of the College of Art.  What is good enough for this goose should be good enough for that gander.  Why the inconsistency? We should not legislate other people out of their jobs if they are in jail for less than six months.  If anyone can produce a cogent argument to justify that I should be glad to hear it.</P>

So far as I am concerned, the Minister's answer was a non-event in that it did not answer the points raised, but we have become accustomed to this practice during the course of this debate.</P>
      <P>I said that there would be two other categories as members of the board, those who are currently and euphemistically called the independent members, namely the Minister's nominees, and also the teachers.  I am not claiming any special conditions for students. I take the interesting suggestion that the law must be consistent to mean, as enunciated by the Parliamentary Secretary who is a member of the legal profession, that it is therefore impossible to differentiate between different categories of persons.  In my superficial way, I would have thought that almost the entire body of law so differentiated and that the sort of consistency he is urging is meaningless.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  Then the consistency that is urged here is that, if you have certain rules for national, secondary or university teachers, you must have exactly the same rules for people who are on the governing body of an arts school.  Last night I made a case that, if there is to be a difference in terms of the way the place is run between the arts school and the third level institutions, then the arts school must have more freedom and not less than a third level institution.</P>
      <P>I work in a third level institution and, together with my colleagues, I try to turn out reasonable graduates.  In the faculty with which I am associated, I am not concerned with creativity.  I endeavour to turn out a man who will discharge his professional responsibilities confidently and skilfully.  If one person in a hundred happens to be creative, he can go ahead and do research work and become a creative artist.  That is very good but there is no structuring of the teaching of creativity in the vast majority of university faculties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> The reason that an art school is different is that not only is the aim to get the students to do skilful representations of persons or buildings or to make nice chocolate box lid sort of pictures, but they must be taught the skill of the accumulated know-how of mankind in regard to painting and stone work and so on; but one also wants to teach them to be creative and to use those skills to make significant comments to communicate with and to have emotional impact on other human beings.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald used the word &ldquo;victorian&rdquo; in relation to the Minister's interjection, but I would have used the word &ldquo;square&rdquo; in relation to it.  An art school is really a different institution and the freedom and creativity and the possibility of a certain wildness and woolliness is very important if the students are to be creative. I would hope to see the Minister appointing people who might well be strange people who do odd and erratic things.  By accident of my birth I have known many artists in Ireland during the past 30 or 40 years.  Without mentioning names, I can think of quite a few of those who, in their ordinary behaviour, were strange people who did erratic things that society would probably have disapproved of but who, in my view, would have been valid and useful members of the board of an art school.  I have little hope that what I am saying will get through.  Teachers must be produced who hand down particular skills, and to that extent a school of art could be compared to a place where, for instance, doctors or lawyers are produced; but one must also try to produce an atmosphere in which people can genuinely innovate and be creative and can produce works of art which, by consensus of opinion, are different from works of reproduction or works of skill.  There is another ingredient.  If one does not generate an atmosphere where these things can flourish all one's efforts are vitiated.  The core of my reservations and worry about this Bill is that we are building an institution where, conceivably, skills might be taught but where creativity would be destroyed, and creativity is the one thing for which allowances must be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keating has made a very good case for, if anything, being more lenient in matters of this kind in relation to the College of Art. Given the curious position I mentioned earlier&mdash;that the young lady would be all right as a Member of the Dáil or Seanad or as a member of the governing body of UCD or, I think, on the council of Dublin University&mdash;she is nevertheless to be disqualified from the board of the National College of Art and Design.  Why?  What is it about this institution that it must be protected in this way from the depredations of demonstrators&mdash;people who may offend against the law in some minor respects and find themselves, as this girl is, in prison for three months. Where has this come from?  Who got the idea that, whereas it is all right for members of the governing body of the university to have been to gaol for any length of time, even if it is for as long as 20 years, they can still be members of that governing body but that in this instance the most minor offence must exclude people?  The Minister has given no answer to this.</P>
      <P>What was clear from what he said and from the silence which preceded what he said was that both he and his Parliamentary Secretary were unaware of the fact that Dáil Deputies are in the position whereby they are not disqualified from membership of the House unless sentenced for a period of more than six months.  In view of the fact that the Minister was not so aware and since he had made his case for consistency beforehand, he should, on the grounds of consistency, reconsider the matter between now and Report Stage.  He can give no justification for discrimination against members of the board of this body in a way which is not used in relation to this House or to the Seanad or of the governing body of a third level institution.</P>

      <P>Forty known ground incursions have been made across the border by British troops from August, 1969 to 31st October, 1971.  The dates and locations of these incursions are given in a statement which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I am circulating with the Official Report.  There have been 17 confirmed overflights of the border by British military aircraft in the same period.  Physical damage caused by incursions has not been significant. However, in the case of cross-border bridges blown up the question of the cost of repairing them will arise when routes are reopened to traffic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>The decrease in the number of people at work in the period 1964 to 1970 must be seen in the light of the sectoral employment statistics for that period and of the circumstances which led to a sharp reduction in the numbers at work in the year ended April, 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period 1964 to 1970 there was a substantial increase of 58,000 in the numbers at work in the non-agricultural sectors of the economy.  This increase <Col N="914" /> was, however, more than offset by a decrease of 63,000 in the numbers at work in the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>In the year ended April, 1970, itself the total numbers at work decreased by 7,000 due mainly to a reduction of 5,000 in employment in construction attributable to the indirect effects of the cement dispute in progress at that time &mdash;the balance being attributable to an unexpectedly large fall in the numbers engaged in the agricultural sector and the level of redundancies in the industrial sector.</P>
    <P>It has been emphasised before that the pursuit of increased employment is not solely a matter for the Government; its achievement requires an active commitment from the sections of the community involved in its attainment. The Government, for its part, has in fact intensified the measures which it must contribute through public capital expenditure and other related services and expenditures.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that industry must be regarded as the main source of new job creation in this country.  The Industrial Development Authority have further increased their efforts to assist the expansion and modernisation of native industry and to attract new industry from abroad.  In the year ended 30th September, 1971, 69 grant-assisted projects with an employment potential of 5,500 commenced production. At 30th September, 1971, 31 grant-assisted projects, with an employment potential of 6,700, were under construction.</P>
    <P>It has been emphasised, however, that the maintenance of a high level of employment in keen competitive conditions is not solely a question of Government measures.  The potency of Government action is necessarily affected by the degree of acceptance of an incomes policy consistent with the aim of increased employment.</P>
    <P>In the period 1964 to 1970 industrial unit wage costs in this country rose by about 35 per cent&mdash;a figure much higher than those registered, for example, in West Germany, France and Italy, some of the countries with which we may soon be forming an enlarged European Economic Community. In such a climate of greater <Col N="915" /> competitiveness and opportunity, any further deterioration in our industrial unit wage costs must damage our ability to increase exports and compete against imports, and consequently must damage our prospects of increasing employment.</P>
    <P>The crucial factor in this area will be the future development of incomes, particularly wages and salaries.  To avoid the loss of existing jobs and at the same time provide the opportunity for increased employment we must maintain our position in the domestic market and expand exports.  This can only be achieved if increases in earnings are consistent with the degree of international competitiveness required. It is here&mdash;now that the review of the national wage agreement is approaching&mdash;that management and the trade union movement will have an opportunity to show that their concern, with both the expansion of job opportunities and the sectional interests of those in secure employment, is expressed in this external perspective.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the decline in employment in some of the areas referred to by the Deputy.  That decline has been contributed to mainly by the cessation of jute operations in Clara and the worldwide reduction in employment in textile manufacturing generally.  In some cases where employment has been reduced, steps have already been taken to provide alternative employment.  It will be the intention of the Government, in conjunction with the Industrial Development Authority, to provide alternative employment to the fullest extent possible, and to increase employment where that can be done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions No. 7 and No. 8 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no distinction, as far as eligibility for hospital services is concerned, between medical card holders and persons coming within the scope of <Col N="917" /> the Health (Contributions) Act, 1971. Both groups are entitled to free treatment in a public ward of a health board hospital in the area in which they live.  If the eligible patient is sent with the approval of the health board to a voluntary hospital within the area or outside of it, or to a health board hospital in another area, he is also entitled to free treatment in a public ward in the hospital to which he is sent.  In some health board areas where a substantial part of the service is provided in voluntary hospitals the health board operate a &ldquo;deeming&rdquo; arrangement which dispenses with the need for specific approval to admission in each case.</P>
    <P>Where an eligible patient chooses to enter a public ward of a voluntary hospital, otherwise than under these approved arrangements, he would be liable for a charge of 50p per day by the hospital.</P>
    <P>An eligible patient who chooses to enter a semi-private or private ward of a health board hospital is liable for a charge of 50p or £1 per day respectively. If he is admitted as a private patient of a hospital consultant, he would in addition be liable for the consultant's fee.</P>
    <P>If the eligible patient is admitted to a semi-private or private ward of a voluntary hospital or to a private nursing or maternity home, the health board will make a contribution towards the cost of the patient's maintenance. The amount of the contribution varies between £1.74 and £3.52½ per day according to the type of institution involved.  The patient in such a case is liable for all charges, including doctors' fees, over and above the contribution made by the health board.</P>
    <P>9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurke" hpid="Mrs. Burke Mrs. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will exempt from the payment of £7 per annum self employed persons who are already adequately covered under the VHI scheme or any other such scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be justified in exempting such persons as they would still be legally entitled to the range of health services for which other <Col N="918" /> people with limited eligibility were obliged to pay the contribution.  In particular, they are entitled to maternity services, which are not normally covered by voluntary health insurance. It is important to note, too, that a health board's commitment to the provision of hospital services for an eligible person is not limited in regard to duration of treatment or medical history.  The Voluntary Health Insurance Board's services are of necessity limited in these respects since the board must have regard to actuarial principles.</P>
      <P>As free public ward hospital services are provided by the health boards for persons with limited eligibility, such persons need take out voluntary health insurance only if they do not wish to use these services, preferring instead to make private arrangements.  Where such a person makes such arrangements, his limited eligibility gives him a right to a subvention from the health board towards the cost of his care. This means that he can get full cover by taking out a modified policy with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board which is less expensive than that required by a person with no eligibility under the Health Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I have indicated to the Deputy in my reply that the person concerned can take out a modified policy with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board which is less expensive than that required by a person with no eligibility under the Health Act.  Part of the cost of his hospital treatment is paid for him by the health board because he is a person with limited eligibility who has made a contribution of £7.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that people who are covered by this £7 and who are already paying into the voluntary health insurance scheme are in the middle income group and this group are already hit hard enough without having this extra burden imposed on them?  If they are paying voluntary health insurance could they not be exempted from the contribution of £7?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say, where a number of contributors are already paying into the voluntary health insurance scheme and have, in fact, raised their contributions recently, why they are still being requested to pay £7 even though they are covered by the voluntary health insurance scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Increased contributions to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board were required because of the increasing cost of hospital treatment. I still say that the last paragraph of my reply indicates the position. People who wish to do so can modify their policy with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to allow for the fact that part of their service is paid for by the health board.  The extra money they pay to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board is to ensure them an improvement in the type of accommodation in which they are placed. That has always been the case.  There has been no change.  I do not honestly see any reason why they should not pay the £7 contribution a year since they are, in fact, looking for better accommodation in the ordinary way as limited eligibility patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

Farmers with valuations under £60 who can prove that their income is inadequate can also be medical card holders.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister will agree that the situation in the north of our country is not, thank God, a customary one and that on that account the rules which apply to what is customary should certainly not apply in this instance.  Would the Minister say whether or not he has protested to the British Government that the tragedies, injury and inconvenience caused by the destruction of cross Border routes is too high a price to pay to placate Mr. John Taylor and persuade him to withdraw his resignation from the Stormont Government?  Would the Minister also say whether or not he has drawn the attention of the British Government to the fact that the Border incidents have tended only to camouflage and deliberately tend only to camouflage the fact that the real cause of the Northern Ireland tragedy is inherent in the system itself and has nothing whatever to do with the passing and re-passing of people across the Border?</P>

      <P>Full right of establishment in agricultural land does not operate in the EEC. So far the Community have adopted measures of only limited scope, the effect of which is that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Nationals of one member state now have the right to acquire farms in other member countries which have been left abandoned or left uncultivated for more than two years; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> (2) Nationals of one member country who have worked as paid agricultural workers in another member country for an unbroken period of at least two years have the right to acquire a farm or farms in that country.</P>
    <P>(3) Nationals of a member country established in another member country for more than two years have the right to change farms.</P>
    <P>(4) Nationals of one member state who are established or who are establishing themselves in farming in another member state have the right of accession to the rural lease system in that state.</P>
    <P>Compliance with these limited measures does not create any significant problem for us.</P>
    <P>The Council has had before it since January, 1969, a draft directive which, if adopted, would grant, in effect, full rights to nationals of one country to purchase farms in other member countries. This draft is unlikely to be adopted before our accession.  I dealt with this matter yesterday and this morning and would refer Deputies to what I said.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware the EEC Council of Ministers in March last adopted in principle a series of resolutions on land structural reform in the Community including a pension scheme for farmers who retire from farming and who surrender their lands.  These broad proposals have yet to be converted into specific programmes by the <Col N="936" /> adoption of directives.  Until these directives are adopted it is not possible to say how the life annuity scheme authorised by section 6 Land Act, 1965 will be affected.  Should these directives not be adopted until after Ireland's entry negotiations are completed this country under the settled consultation procedure will be consulted before the draft directives are finalised.</P>
    <P>As regards payment in land bonds this is a matter which will, too, have to be discussed with the EEC in the general context of their land structural reform proposals.</P>

    <P>As previously stated in replies to <Col N="942" /> questions on this matter on 23rd July, 1969, and 11th December, 1969, the goal which has been set is that there should not be more than 35 pupils in any class.  As we now have an average of one teacher for about every 32 pupils it will be seen that if maximum utilisation of the existing teacher force could be secured there would not in fact be any shortage.</P>
    <P>The factual position is that while there has been little change in the number of pupils attending national schools over the past decade the number of teachers serving in these schools has during that period increased by 1,067. The number of students in the teacher training colleges has been increased from 1,099 in 1961-62 to the present number of 1,400.

      <P>&ldquo;( ) On the establishment of An Bord, the Minister shall designate it as an institution of higher education for the purposes of the Higher Education Authority Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the Bill is drafted it appears the intention is that this institution should not be treated as a third level institution coming within the framework of the Higher Education Authority but that grants should be provided for it direct. This seems quite wrong.  Once again, here, it seems there is an inclination to treat this institution as if it did not belong to the third level sector.  I am anxious to get over this difficulty and, consequently, I propose the deletion of subsection (1) and its substitution by a subsection saying:</P>
      <P>On the establishment of An Bord, the Minister shall designate it as an institution of higher education for the purposes of the Higher Education Authority Act.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any reason for not doing this; it seems a reasonable thing to do and I should like the Minister's views on it.</P>

      <P>The College of Art, in fact, is not entirely an institute of higher education.  It caters for second level education in the foundation school.  It also provides courses leading to vocational school examinations.  The Deputy suggests here that the Minister &ldquo;shall designate it as an institution of higher education...&rdquo;.  The Deputy is aware from our long discussion on the Higher Education Authority Bill that I could not designate an institution without prior consultation with An tÚdarás.  For that reason I could not bind myself to do something which An tÚdarás could possibly advise against.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister did not develop that theme a little further to establish the extent to which it does not come under this heading because, of course, third level institutions frequently have courses for non-matriculated students, for example. That does not mean they are not third level institutions.  I am not clear as to the nature of the distinction the Minister is making.  Our universities have traditionally provided such courses for particular purposes.  In fact, one of the categories in the categorisation of students statistically, for example, in the President's report in UCD is &ldquo;non-matriculated students&rdquo;.  It is not clear what the Minister means by saying that it is partly second level.  Does he mean that some or all of the students are non-matriculated?  That in itself does not make it not a third level institution.  I am in a little difficulty to know what the Minister means.</P>
      <P>On the point the Minister made about having to be advised by An tÚdarás&mdash;that seems a fair point which suggests at least the redrafting of the amendment but I should like to hear more about what he means about the college not being fully a third level institution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and he said that this does not mean that it is not a third level institution.  As I said here, this college caters for second level education in the foundation school which is not a minor part of the college.  I do not know if I would call it the least important part of the college but it is certainly not a minor part in numbers. Also, I am informed that students can enter the foundation course from the age of 16 so that, in fact, part of this college will be at second level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The last point about the age of entry has nothing to do with it.  It is, or used be the case that you could enter Trinity at the age of 15 <Col N="948" /> and there is I think at least one very distinguished graduate who did enter Trinity at that age.  The age of entry is irrelevant from that point of view. It does not define second or third level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <P>Under the peculiar regulations the Minister has introduced about not entering second level until the age of 12&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This regulation is upheld by very many countries as well as ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We discussed that and I think I established that as a requirement for entering second level it is not, but as a normal age of entry, it is.  These are two quite different things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the normal age of entry in certain countries but the Minister did not attempt to suggest, and I think had to accept, that it is not a requirement in other countries that you should be aged 12 before entering second level&mdash;far from it.  At present, it is not possible for somebody below the age of 12 in this country to get a grant-aided, post-primary education and to complete education to the leaving certificate standard below the age of 17, perhaps; that is true, but it does not mean that people cannot do it if they are willing to forego the grant.  It is a temporary situation introduced by this Government and will be remedied at the first opportunity.  It does not exist in other countries and the College of Art could take students from other countries, in any case.  Therefore, I think the Minister's interpolation on that point is irrelevant. I do not think the question <Col N="949" /> of age of entry to the college defines it as not being third level.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a second point that the foundation school is second level.  I do not understand that.  I would not deny it without having more information.  How does the Minister define second level?  The normal definition, as I understand it, is that when people complete their education in a post-primary establishment and move on to an establishment which will award them some sort of diploma or degree, the institution to which they move is third level.  Some third level institutions require matriculation; some do not: some have an age of entry of 18, some 17, some 16, perhaps, or lower.  It is the fact that people move to an institution which gives them a diploma or a degree, having had a secondary or post-primary education in a post-primary school, that defines third level as I understand it.  I should like to hear how the Minister defines second level and how he says the foundation year is second level.  What is his definition of second level for this purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In his last contribution the Deputy was concerned with the distinction between second level and third level.  I think the kernel of the matter is that under the HEA Bill which recently went through this House, An tÚdarás, the authority, are vested with the responsibility and the right to recommend to the Minister the designation of an institution as an institution of higher education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see how it could without cutting across the provisions of that legislation.  To that extent, and so soon after that legislation has gone through, surely the appropriate thing would be, apart from the level of courses undertaken there, that this would be a matter to be considered <Col N="950" /> by the Higher Education Authority. Nothing that can be written into this legislation can deal with that.  I have here the definition section of the Higher Education Act, 1970.  It provides that an institution of higher education means (a) a university, (b) a college of a university, or (c) an institution which the Minister, after consultation with An tÚdarás, designates by regulation as an institution of higher education for the purposes of the Act.  You cannot cut across that.  Possibly this matter will be considered by the Higher Education Authority but I do not think it is possible to go further than that in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that as a valid criticism of the amendment.  It could be so expressed as to amend the Higher Education Authority Act to require this body to be accepted.  I would not wish to do that.  I recognise that the amendment, as drafted, would have that effect.  Therefore, I will withdraw the amendment in due course. What we were discussing is what is second level.  I should like to hear from the Minister the grounds on which he defines the foundation school as second level.  It is a concept I have not come across before.  I was unaware that this was the view of the Department.  I should like to hear what is the definition of second level under which they feel the foundation school comes under this heading.  Perhaps the Minister could come back to that in a moment.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister whether it is the intention that, if the Higher Education Authority recommend that this body should be brought within their compass, he will accept this.  Secondly, if it is his intention, is he satisfied that the wording of the section as at present drafted will not stand in the way of the implementation of such a decision?  It seems to me that whereas in section 14 (1) the provisions are optional, because it provides that there may be paid to An Bord out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas a grant or grants&mdash;that seems to leave the matter open&mdash;when we come to the second subsection it provides that An Bord shall submit to the Minister an estimate of their financial requirements for every financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> That suggests that the Minister does not contemplate this body coming within the compass of the HEA because if they did, if I recall correctly, the HEA would be submitting their requirements to the Minister.  I wonder whether the Minister feels that section 14 (1) and more particularly section 14 (2) are in a form that would permit him, without difficulty or embarrassment so far as this Bill is concerned, to accede to a recommendation by the HEA in favour of this college coming within the responsibility of the HEA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of second level, generally speaking second level is regarded as post-primary up to leaving certificate standard.  I agreed in discussions with the students that it would not be possible to make the same academic requirements necessary in their case as in others.  Nevertheless, I would say that those entering the foundation school at 16 years of age would hardly be regarded as being third level students.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of the designation, certainly if the Higher Education Authority advise me that this college should be designated as a third level college I will certainly accept their recommendation.  I do not think that the section as it stands would interfere with this.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section requires the board to <Col N="953" /> make a report to the Minister annually on their proceedings and that this will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is reasonable.  I do not think there is any inconsistency with the HEA Act in this instance.  It seems a reasonable requirement.  I am not so happy about subsection (2) which puts the Minister in a position to require information about how the board are performing at any time.  This seems to me to make some inroads into their economy and leaves it much too open to pressure from the Minister and his Department.  It seems to me that the annual report is sufficient.  I do not think that, in other State bodies, even those in which control is more important, we have provisions quite as tightly drafted as this.  It is certainly not the case that in regard to the universities there is any requirement of this kind, requiring them to provide information as and when the Minister seeks it.  It seems to be inappropriate that this requirement should be put in here when, as far as I am aware, it does not apply in other kindred instances.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will remember that when we were discussing the Higher Education Authority Bill the same thing arose.  I felt that it was essential that we should maintain this because I think the Minister is entitled to get information from a body such as this whenever he feels it is necessary for him to do so.  For example, in connection with teacher training which the board may be requested by the Minister to undertake, it is essential that the Minister should be in a position to obtain information as to the courses, the number of students, and so on.  I think there is nothing at all unreasonable about it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to remove the power of the Minister and the Minister for Finance to intervene in the matter of the terms and conditions including remuneration of the director and registrar of An Bord.  It should be entirely a matter for this body to decide for itself the remuneration of the director and registrar just as the university decides what their president <Col N="955" /> and their registrar are paid.  The idea that the Minister should intervene in a matter of this kind again demonstrates the continuing approach to this body as if it were still under the Department of Education and an unwillingness on the part of those who drafted the legislation, not necessarily on the Minister's part, to recognise that this is to be an autonomous education institution and should be treated in much the same way and with as much freedom as, if not more than, the existing third level institutions.  One cannot justify imposing this condition here when no such condition applies to other third level institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in this case is that the director and registrar will be paid out of public funds.  They will be appointed by the board.  It does not seem to be unreasonable that their terms and conditions then could be determined by the board with the approval of the Minister and with the consent of the Minister for Finance. That does not infringe on the autonomy of the board in discharging its function.  One must have regard to the fact that the Minister is just one agent of what we might call the co-ordination of the level of salaries paid to officials employed by boards.  There must be some level of liaison, some level of co-ordination. I can sympathise with the Deputy's arguments in many ways but one must appreciate that it is not always possible to remove any or all levels of control and that control does not always involve restrictive control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder why the Deputy has put down this amendment relating to the director and registrar and has not put down, as far as I can see, any such amendment to subsection (6) which relates to other officers of the board. That does not appear to have caused him concern nor has he put down any amendments with regard to the superannuation of the officers and servants of the board.  I am not suggesting that he should, but I am merely inquiring whence the particular concern in this area derives and if he has overlooked other areas that are specifically analogous. There must be some level of co-ordination. It is not just a matter of <Col N="956" /> infringing.  If it does apply only to the director and the registrar it will not infringe on the autonomy of the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Parliamentary Secretary's implied criticism of the lack of amendments to other subsections.  I was consciously not putting down an amendment to section 20 on this matter because it seemed not unreasonable that we should try to achieve some kind of standardisation in superannuation schemes; it seemed a very useful long-term objective throughout the whole economy so as to minimise the mobility of labour, so as to make it easier to work towards a single scheme or an interchangeable scheme, so as to ensure that people can move freely.  For this reason and because superannuation is a less sensitive issue and there is a genuine need for standardisation here it did not seem to be desirable to put down amendments. However, the absence of amendments to other subsections of the section we are now discussing was, I think, an oversight.  I am glad to have my attention drawn to it and shall take appropriate action on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming back to the point at issue, I really cannot follow the line of reasoning here.  If the Government feel the need to impose any kind of incomes policy at any level to ensure co-ordination of salaries throughout the whole range of activities, public and private, it is open to them to introduce legislation to that effect and this House will make up its mind on that legislation.  I do not think one should pick out piecemeal particular educational bodies in which to introduce this when it does not operate in other educational bodies.  I do not think the fact that this body is about to be liberated, in inverted commas, from the Department of Education, is a reason for maintaining all kinds of ministerial involvement in it which do not apply in the universities and which the Minister has not suggested should apply in the universities and which I hope he will not propose should <Col N="957" /> apply.  There is an inconsistency of approach here which would suggest a continuing failure to approach this body with an open mind as a third level institution, autonomous, free and standing on an equal footing with the other third level institutions.  I cannot accept that there is a need for ministerial involvement in this matter. The board should determine remuneration here just as the governing boards of the colleges determine the remuneration of their president and registrar.  Unless I hear some good reason for this differentiation I cannot accept that it is desirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>One reason is the factual one that the universities have been established for a considerable number of years and have been exercising their functions under the university system.  This, and the Deputy wants us to forget it, is breaking new ground.  It has been fairly clear in the course of the discussion here that there is not any precedent for this type of legislation in this House.  We had the example yesterday evening of references from this side to the Institute for Advanced Studies which was not meant to be a clear statement that this was an exact precedent.  The Deputy said it would be more appropriate to go back to the beginning of the century, to legislation establishing the universities.  This is a totally new area from that point of view and one must accept that the funds, apart from the fees, are being provided by the State.  It was not so when the universities were being established and it is not entirely so right now either.  Apart from the fees, the bulk of the moneys will be provided by the State.  Until experience proves otherwise this must be so.  The public are entitled to have a reasonable assurance, through the Minister and the Minister for Finance, that the level of remuneration paid here will be on a par with that which operates in other institutions.  I cannot see what the Deputy's concern is.  The terms and conditions will be fixed by the board and they will be referred to the Minister and the Minister for Finance for approval&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or disapproval as the case might be.  That does not necessarily mean to say that their autonomy will be infringed.  All Members of this House like to feel free to express various views.  They like to feel they can launch into a long and learned dissertation on the function of Deputies but they are subject to this very type of control.  I do not think it makes them any less autonomous or independent. I know university autonomy, third level independence and academic freedoms are different but the fact that one's salary and conditions are fixed after approval with the Minister and the Minister for Finance does not mean that one is subject to the direction and control of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>The revelation of the Government's mind in this matter is interesting.  I could translate what the Parliamentary Secretary said in the first <Col N="959" /> few sentences of his remarks as follows: If in 1908 it had been a Fianna Fáil Government rather than a British Liberal Government, the universities would not have got away with being able to determine and run their affairs in the way they do in matters of this kind.  It is maybe a true proposition but it is something of a reflection on self-government that that should be the case.  Are we all to look back with nostalgia to the Liberal period of British rule and regret that self-government has come in?  Is this what the Parliamentary Secretary is suggesting? I cannot accept that this is the standard we should apply.  It is true that the universities were established before the State was founded.  They were established in some respects on Liberal principles of freedom from State interference and those are principles which far from wishing or wanting to devalue we should seek to preserve and extend.  For this Government to say: &ldquo;Oh, if we had been there that would not have happened and now we have a chance to determine our own laws and our own ways we will not allow that kind of thing to happen again.&rdquo; This does not sound well coming from the other side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say quite <Col N="960" /> plainly that the fact that universities have certain provisions which do not involve ministerial control does not mean that now we have the power to run our own affairs we should not, when we are starting off with the second institution of this kind in the line of advanced studies, have a different system and bring the Minister into it.  That is what the Parliamentary Secretary said and meant.  The only case made for the inclusion of this is that it should apply to universities, too, but we have not got at them yet.  I do not think that is a very encouraging note to sound in this particular debate.</P>
      <P>In his first and second contributions the Parliamentary Secretary spoke about the director and registrar being paid from public funds.  What does he mean by being paid from public funds? I am not quite clear about this.  All kinds of people are paid from resources which include contributions from public funds.  It is true in the universities and it is true in many State bodies but that does not mean that the Government should or does in every instance claim the right to intervene and interfere with the autonomy of the board it has appointed and take decisions over the heads of the board. I should like the Minister to tell us in which State bodies outside the educational field does this right exist?  I spent 12 years in Aer Lingus and it is not my recollection that there is anything in the Air Navigation Act, 1936, which provides that the chief executive of Aer Lingus shall have his remuneration approved by the Minister with the approval of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it, in fact, the case that not alone are we to have a less liberal government under self-government than under British rule but that the later Fianna Fáil Governments are becoming less liberal than the earlier ones and in the good old days when Éamon de Valera was Taoiseach the Government did not interfere with these matters but in the latter Lynch days control is going to be tightened up?  Can the Minister tell me in what State bodies these kind of provisions exist because I do not recall them in the legislation on other State bodies although I would not claim familiarity with the 60 or 70 <Col N="961" /> Acts involved.  I think an especially bad precedent is being created here for bodies in the sphere of higher education to which the State makes a contribution. I would ask the Minister to reconsider it in the light of what I have said.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 47:</P>
      <P>To add to subsection (4) the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Without prejudice to the powers contained in the rest of this section, the Director and Registrar shall be appointed initially for a period of four years, but shall be eligible for re-appointment by An Bord&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subsection is designed to ensure that the board will have open to it the possibility of not continuing the appointment of the director or registrar after four years if they decided it was better to make a change.  This is a new body being established in new circumstances and the choice of a director and registrar is going to be a very difficult one.  I do not envy the board having to make this choice and I do not envy the Minister having to appoint the board to make the choice.  It is going to be a very difficult matter.  We hope they will both be good appointments and probably they will but supposing they are not and the director and registrar turn out to be unable to master the numerous problems of this institution and after a number of years <Col N="962" /> it transpires they are not of the calibre, mental disposition or flexibility to cope with these problems.  It would be tragic if we were left in the position where the institution had to drag on with a conflict existing which could prevent it ever from getting off the ground as a successful institution of higher education. We must have regard to that danger and for that reason it is desirable that these two appointments are in the first instance open to review.  The Minister may well reply that it is going to be difficult enough to get somebody without getting them on the basis that their appointment may not be continued after four years.  I admit this provision will increase the difficulty of finding a suitable person to accept the job but it is worth accepting the fact that it is going to make it a little more difficult to get a person if we at least ensure that whoever we get can, if necessary, be replaced.  For that reason, it is valid to suggest that this amendment be added to the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>We know the answer to the amendment.  First of all, the Deputy and other Deputies here said earlier that it would be absolutely essential that we should get the best possible man to take over the job of director.  Surely nobody could imagine a worthwhile individual agreeing to accept an appointment which could be terminated for many reasons after four years.  We know the past history of the college.  We know that there are enormous problems to be dealt with. Unless we are able to get the best possible man from the beginning it is obvious that the man appointed will not be able to deal with the problems. We are aware that some of the difficulties have arisen in the past not necessarily because the director was not a man capable of doing his job, but because particular individuals did not happen to like him.  They put pressure on him.  I have no doubt that <Col N="963" /> the acting directors were glad to get out of the job.  The Deputy can surely appreciate that if we were to agree to permitting such insecurity as would exist if this amendment were accepted we would not get a person who could be capable of overcoming the problems. We would not get a person capable of overcoming the difficulties and we would also be placing very considerable temptation in the way of certain people.  It is quite obvious that it will not be easy to get a person of the calibre we need.  If we impose this type of limitation on the appointment we will not get a director of the calibre we need.</P>

      <P>If there has been any consistent theme through the Deputy's contribution it has been that we should as much as possible in this legislation, with regard to this establishment, follow the pattern of the university.  The Deputy seems to have a facility for arguing a case on whatever basis is given to him.  I mentioned this this morning and the Deputy seemed to think this was a reflection on his integrity.  I meant this as a compliment to his powers of advocacy. Is it the custom in the universities to appoint a president or a registrar for a period of four years and to tell him: &ldquo;We will see how you have done after four years and then we will consider the position again.&rdquo;?  Is this system of dependence not what the Deputy has been asking us to avoid all along? Perhaps the Deputy should withdraw this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's argument is superficially attractive.  In both universities the head is appointed for life, up to a certain age.  The Minister will be aware that the Commission on Higher Education, having considered this matter, decided that this was a bad system. Representations made to the commission were generally of that tenor. There was a widespread view that this type of appointment for life is undesirable. I am not suggesting that the proposal made by the Commission on Higher Education involved a four-year term and I am open to argument on <Col N="964" /> that particular point.  I think a life appointment is wrong.  The practice here and in other countries suggests that the general trend is towards appointment of a somewhat limited duration renewable for another term. Some university bodies suggest that in the university reform legislation which we hope to see in this House some time, there should be provision for seven year appointments renewable for another seven years.  The reason why I took a shorter term in this instance was because I was concerned primarily with the initial appointment and the danger that it might prove unsuccessful and that we would find ourselves back in our current situation of difficulty in the college.</P>
      <P>The Minister could validly argue that I am over-concerned about the immediate situation and that one should not think only of the first years of the institution but should look ahead to the way in which it should be run in the long term.  There is a case for amending the amendment along the lines suggested&mdash;that is, that the director be appointed for seven years and that his appointment would be renewable for another seven years. That would line it up with what is proposed for the universities.  There is general acceptance that the present system in the universities is unsatisfactory. While this would mean a rather long initial period if the director did not prove satisfactory it is probably worth taking that risk in order to avoid building into legislation provisions against the initial situation when the legislation should be geared more to the long-term situation.  Would the Minister be prepared to consider an amendment on Report Stage along the lines of the seven years appointments renewable for another seven years?  This would align this college with what is likely to emerge in the universities.  That may prove wrong, of course, but that is my recollection of the recommendation of the Commission on Higher Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept what the Deputy suggests.  The most important thing here is to ensure that we will get the best possible person. To get that person we must offer the <Col N="965" /> best possible terms and the terms include the length of service.  What the Deputy is worried about is the first appointment, but as I see it this same type of thing could arise on any occasion, whether it is the first, second or third appointment of a director.  We should aim at trying to get the best possible person.  The only way in which we can do that is to ensure that we are in a position to offer the terms which are likely to attract a person of the calibre we are looking for and if we are to confine ourselves to a limited number of years in that sense I believe that we most certainly are most unlikely to get the type of person we would like to get, and that we would be more likely to become involved in the difficulties which the Deputy has underlined.  In other words, if we do not get a person able to cope with a difficult situation and overcome problems we could find ourselves in similar difficulties to those in which we find ourselves at present.  The basic consideration here is to ensure that we get the best possible person and the only way to do that is by offering the most attractive terms.</P>

      <P>The Minister's approach is influenced by Civil Service thinking that you get people if you offer them security of tenure and a good pension.  This is an academic appointment and not a Civil Service appointment.  In academic institutions &mdash;England may be an exception to this&mdash;in places like Scotland and in continental countries, as I recall from the report of the Commission on Higher Education, the practice is to have a rector or the head of the institution appointed for a rather short term of years.  In fact, it can in some instances be as short as a year, in other instances four years.  But, under our tradition here of rather longer appointments, the feeling was that it should be for, perhaps, seven years.  Certainly, I do not think people in academic circles would take very seriously the suggestion that you will not get a man to go as head of an institution unless you appoint him for life.  That is the kind of thinking I can understand from an administrator who is used to thinking in these terms, but it just does not arise in academic circles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="966" /> No doubt everybody wants a bit of security, but the concept of holding a position as head of an institution for a period, and then retiring from it, is one, I think, that is very readily acceptable to most adacemics. I think it was, in fact, the academics themselves in the various institutions here who recommended this in relation to the universities.  That being so, I do not think the Minister should import the thinking of another group of people into an academic institution and that he should be unduly concerned with this question of security for life.  I think that he is right in suggesting I should not be thinking only of an initial term; he is right in saying the difficulties I mention can arise after the appointment of a director, and reappointment for a second term, or something like that.  I see that and I see the need to make some changes in my amendment, but I would press on him that he should not think in terms of security of tenure for life as being necessary to get a man.  In fact, the kind of man who wants security of tenure for life is on the whole rather unlikely to be a successful director of a college of art.  Such a man is a man who will be oriented more towards an administrative career.  The kind of man you want here is a man with flair and imagination, as well as administrative ability, who has enough confidence in himself to take this job on and has in mind doing it for a number of years and then moving on to something else when he finds himself getting tired of the administrative routine and wanting to get back to something which gives a free range to his imagination.</P>
    <P>It is precisely because in academic institutions that kind of person is generally found to be the best administrator, not totally administratively oriented but having still an academic bias, that the idea of the seven year term of office, renewable, is generally accepted in academic circles.  On the whole, academics say they do not want to appoint a man president of the college who wants to be there for life.  They want a man who is an academic, who is interested in academic things, who will take on the burden of this job because he feels he will make a contribution <Col N="967" /> for some years, and who is likely to get restless at being tied down to his desk and want to get back to his academic&mdash;in this case, artistic&mdash; interests after a period.  That is the kind of man we want to run successfully an academic institution in the field of Art.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has not looked at it from this viewpoint.  I think he has been overly influenced by the administrator's viewpoint here and has not thought of it sufficiently in academic terms.  He ought to take account of the recommendations made by academic bodies with regard to the headship of universities.  That is a much surer guide to what is needed in this instance than the practice of the Civil Service of appointment for life.</P>

      <P>What I said was that it would be necessary to offer the most attractive terms.  It could happen that an individual might want to serve for only seven years.  It could happen that he might want to serve for three years. It could happen that he might want to serve for 14 years.  The fact is we will limit the value of the terms we offer if we decide that he can serve for only four years, with a possibility of re-appointment. I do not think one can compare the position of director of a college of this kind with the head of a university because, if the president or rector decides that he does not want to continue as an administrator, he has his position as a professor to fall back on.</P>

      <P>One does not know whether it would be possible for such a director to return to the particular type of employment he had before he was appointed.  Therefore, as I said, this is an added attraction; there will be security in this particular post.  He may not be a person necessarily <Col N="968" /> anxious for security but, if he does happen to be concerned with security and he is also the most capable person we can get, then we should be in a position to appoint him.  I think the Deputy's amendment would prejudice the possibility of our getting the type of person we need.  I am convinced that we must be able to offer the most attractive terms and those include the period of appointment.</P>

It might be better, therefore, to pursue this discussion on Report Stage.  I think the drafting is inadequate and there is something to be said for terminating the discussion at this point and coming back to it on Report Stage when the Minister and I will have had an opportunity of seeing what the Commission on Higher Education said about it; this is higher education and we should look at the arguments for and against and see whether, in the context of this college, they merit consideration.

      <P>I move amendment No. 52:</P>
      <P>In page 8 to add the following to subsection (9):&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;provided that any officer or servant suspended or dismissed shall be entitled <Col N="969" /> to be given reasons for his suspension or dismissal&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a very important amendment and I hope the Minister will look at it with favour.  It is essential that any person suspended or dismissed from a post should be given good reasons for that suspension or dismissal.  I would go so far as to say it is a requirement of natural justice that this should be done. but I cannot produce any legal authority for that.  I have not got any.  The section simply says:</P>
    <P>An Bord may remove or suspend from office or employment any of its officers or servants.</P>
    <P>I do not think any employer, never mind an employer established under an Act of the Oireachtas, should be in a position in which he need not give reasons.  I hope the Minister will accept this as being reasonable.  In the debate on the Higher Education Authority I used a form of words which had apparently a meaning other than that which I intended and the Minister did not accept the particular form of words on that occasion.  Here I am putting it in simple language and I do not think there is any reason for the Minister not accepting the amendment.  There is a very good social reason for accepting it.  I hope he will accept it.</P>

      <P>This is a somewhat similar type of amendment to the amendment put down by the Deputy on the Higher Education Authority Bill and I did not accept it on that occasion.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. If the Deputy looks up the record he will find that they did not.  However, this, in my view, is a provision which <Col N="970" /> is much more proper to the conditions of service than to a statutory enactment. I pointed out on the previous occasion that if I were bound here by this enactment to give this information to the person concerned, I would also be placed in the position in which I would have to answer for this in the Dáil.  The Dáil could ask questions; the Dáil could ask me why a person was suspended and I would have to give a reply publicly to the question.  I think it is accepted that, generally speaking, the vast majority of people concerned in cases such as this who would be justifiably dismissed would certainly not want to have the reasons for the dismissal announced in the Dáil.  Again, I want to point out that I feel that this should be covered in the contracts of service and not in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister has, I think, replied to an amendment which is not down.  The amendment the last time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Those words were interpreted, I thought, indirectly but I may have been wrong, as meaning that they were causes which would have to be stated publicly and which the Minister would have to give in the Dáil if asked.  It is for that very reason that I have changed the wording here.  The wording of the amendment, as the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will see, is &ldquo;provided that any officer or servant suspended or dismissed shall be entitled to be given reasons for his suspension or dismissal&rdquo;.  There is nothing whatever to suggest that anybody else is entitled to have the reasons except the person dismissed, and I cannot conceive, if that amendment were accepted, that any Deputy would have the right to any information about it.  We might argue about that on the amendment to the other Bill but you cannot argue it on the amendment in this form. That argument is, I think, spurious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that this provision is more appropriate to the contracts of service than to this Bill.  That is all <Col N="971" /> very well, but how do we know it is going to be in the conditions of service unless it is stated in the Bill?  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that we should lay down certainly the minimal content of the conditions of service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am writing into the legislation a requirement that the conditions of service of all the officers and servants of the board shall include this provision.  That is entirely proper. That is what legislation is for, to safeguard people's interests against exploitation and it is very necessary that people should have this safeguard.  I have never heard a reason given and I do not think the Minister has attempted to give a reason why people should not know the reason for their suspension or dismissal.  The Minister gave a reason which might have been valid in relation to the wording of the amendment the last time, that he does not think the Dáil should know the reason for dismissal, and that I understand, but he has not given a reason as to why this amendment should not be included.  To say that it is more appropriate to conditions of service is a non-starter and the Minister has not given any reason against the amendment and seems to accept that it is desirable that the conditions of service ought to be along these lines.</P>

      <P>As I said a moment ago, there will be many other things in the conditions of service, and if we were to accept what the Deputy is now asking me to include in the Bill, we would then be placed in the position where it would be necessary to put all the other conditions in as well because the implication would be &ldquo;This is the condition of service&rdquo;, so far as the rest of the conditions are concerned.  We have had this problem previously, and I am convinced, as I said earlier, that it is a matter of &ldquo;conditions of service&rdquo; instead of a matter for the Bill. This would be absolutely wrong, to <Col N="973" /> concern ourselves with one particular condition of service.  I have no hesitation in regard to this amendment, as I had none in the case of the previous amendment, in not accepting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will not accept that this is the most fundamental of all conditions of service.  The most fundamental condition of service arises on the question of being dismissed. Everything else is subordinate to that, and if the Minister accepts that this should be in the conditions of service, it is a right people should have, and he accepts that they will have it&mdash;he hopes they will be in a trade union and hopes that it will ensure this&mdash;what is wrong with having it in the Bill?</P>

      <P>I believe it should be in the conditions of service but I am also convinced that, apart altogether from the fact that I believe the conditions of service is the place to have it, if it were part of the Bill, I could be called on to answer questions in the Dáil and to state publicly the reasons why people were dismissed. This I have refused to do, and I certainly will not agree to insert any subsection in this Bill which would place that type of onus on me because it would be most unfair to the people concerned.  As I say, it is basically a matter for the conditions of service and I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

There is nothing whatever in this requirement to suggest or imply in any way that the Minister would be obliged, or even entitled, to disclose the reasons to the Dáil.  The fact that the board are required to tell a person dismissed or suspended the reasons cannot conceivably be held to give the Minister a duty to disclose it to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I am not sure that an employee or worker would look on it that way, that he would look on it as being a very good condition, but equally there are the questions of terms of pay, superannuation, hours of work, sickness regulations and so on.  He would regard these as being in many ways of much more practical importance than the terms of dismissal and the reality is that if one starts to put this into legislation and leaves out the others, then one assumes a particular significance and the others appear subordinate.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister has clearly indicated, if any assurance is needed, that he believes this should be included in the conditions of service.  If that is not a satisfactory guarantee I do not know what is.  The Deputy is merely suggesting that this matter and others which are important&mdash;nobody suggests they are not&mdash;should all be written into the legislation.

The Deputy as a lawyer will appreciate that apart from the guarantees that are to be written into this Bill, or into the conditions of service, there is one very clear safguard in any event, an action well-known to all lawyers and solicitors, an action for wrongful dismissal. You cannot be turfed out because <Col N="975" /> an employer feels like it.  We must look at the reality of the situation and not assume that the power to &ldquo;turf&rdquo; somebody out resides in employers or boards such as this.

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Saying that nobody would agree to conditions of service which would not include this, that and the other thing, including the right to be given reasons for dismissal is nonsense. A person accepts a job because he needs it; it may be the only job going in this country and he must take it.  Let us be realistic about it.  The idea of people picking and choosing jobs and saying: &ldquo;In this case I shall be given reasons for dismissal; in this case I will not&rdquo; and choosing the job on that basis is utter nonsense. The disparity between the economic strength of an individual seeking a job and that of the institution which may employ him is such that the individual is powerless except to the extent that he may be a member of a union and that union may have considerable bargaining power.  In the light of recent events I do not think anybody will feel that union membership is such a wonderful safeguard. Two people have been dismissed from the College of Art and in fact they have a union who no doubt are taking up the matter but the college is still closed and these two people are still dismissed.  In those circumstances <Col N="976" /> when we know what can happen it is important that we should give the safeguard to which people are entitled as a natural right, the right to know the reasons why they are dismissed.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary for guidance in his legal capacity in relation to an action for wrongful dismissal, what rights there are legally in such an action to be given the reasons?  Is it the case that people who take such an action are entitled to be told the reasons in court or, if they are not so entitled, is it the case that perhaps their non-entitlement puts them in a weaker position in such an action where they have not got as a condition of employment the right to be given reasons than in cases where they do have the right?  I am not familiar with the law in the matter and would be glad of advice on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>For two reasons the Parliamentary Secretary is not in a position to advise nor, if he were, would he do so.  First, I am not at present engaged in practice but, secondly, and most important, one does not advise in a vacuum on a broad basis.  One looks at a particular case and sees what rights are there. One looks at the conditions of employment and conditions of service in each individual case to ascertain whether a dismissal was unlawful.  I am certainly not prepared to make an observation on a broad basis as to whether in an academic sense people would be entitled to certain notices.</P>

I am not altogether convinced by the reply.  Am I not right in suggesting that if I take an action for wrongful dismissal and a reason has been given to me, and I can show that reason is unsound, I am in a much better position to pursue the action than if no reason is given to me and I have to pursue it <i>in vacuo</i> not knowing the charge against me?  Is there a right at law in taking such an action to be given the reason?  If there is such a right as part of the action this would somewhat <Col N="977" /> alleviate the position.  It would not, however, put the person in the same position as the person who is told the reason and has a right to be told it when dismissed.  There is some danger in the case of somebody dismissed without having a right to get that reason at the time and who subsequently takes an action, that the employer would go to some trouble to devise a carefully worded reason which would let him out whereas if he had to give the reason at the time of dismissal the employee might have got a truer reason, one on which he could more effectively sue.  Unless the Parliamentary Secretary tells me that the law is much different from what I think it is, it is necessary for us to ensure that somebody dismissed by the institution would have a right to the reasons so as to put him in a good position to dispute it if the reason is wrong.  Could the Minister now tell me if the two people dismissed in this instance have been given the formal reasons for dismissal?  I think we are entitled to know that when talking about this institution.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister not agree that, particularly in the case of servants, the information which this amendment would require to be given on the reasons for dismissal is vital nowadays as a result of the Redundancy Payments Act which requires that notice be given to employees, as well as the reason for dismissal?  A good deal of money could be involved in the dismissal of somebody and it is becoming much more important that the reasons for dismissal are clear particularly in the case of servants who can claim redundancy.  Therefore, there is a basis for including this amendment in this section.</P>

I shall not place myself in the position where as Minister I might have to state in the Dáil the reasons why a particular individual was dismissed.  I have clearly indicated my point of view in regard to this matter.  While I cannot dictate to the board what they will do <Col N="978" /> in regard to conditions of service I have no doubt they will take cognisance of what I said.

      <P>There is nothing whatever in this that entitles anybody in this House to that information.  The only thing we are entitled to know in this House, on the strength of the wording there, is was the person given a reason or was he not.  Once that question is answered any Deputy who persists in trying to ask what was the reason will be ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle without difficulty. At the moment this institution is part of the Civil Service.  The person involved is a part-time civil servant under the Minister's jurisdiction. I am perfectly entitled to ask the Minister any questions I like.</P>
      <P>This will be an autonomous body. I intend to press the Minister further about what information was given to the people concerned.  I am not talking of an imaginary or hypothetical case. I am talking about a real institution with real people, some of whom may be dismissed.  We cannot just say that it will not happen.  It has happened in the past few days in respect of two people.  We must, therefore, have regard to that reality.  We must be in a position to assure ourselves that all necessary precautions are taken to ensure that the human rights of the people concerned are protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very fact that the Minister keeps stressing that he will not be put in a position of having to tell the House what the reasons are, when it is perfectly evident from the wording of the amendment that no such requirement could exist, and that the Ceann Comhairle would rule out of order such a question under the normal rules about not inquiring into the day-to-day affairs of a public body, seems to me <Col N="979" /> to suggest that he has not got a very strong line of argument to go on.  His other line of argument is that it should be part of the conditions of service and that it is not up to us to put this in, does not hold water.  It is our job to ensure that the essential elements in these conditions of service are applied.</P>
    <P>On the question of trade union membership, the people concerned may or may not become members of a trade union.

      <P>The Minister and his officers have made a number of changes in how the college is run, some of them improvements and some perhaps not.  The whole system of examination has been changed into a system of assessment.  The Minister has made changes in regard to the foundation school course.  The whole running of the college has been changed and modified in many ways as a result of the intervention of the Minister through his civil servants.  For the Minister to say that, while he is making all these changes which have drastically altered the way the college is run, in many ways for the better, and that, at the same time, he was not doing anything about changing a contract which specifically precluded the staff from being given a reason for dismissal, although he himself believes they ought to be given a reason, does not add up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <P>What does add up is that, because of the fact that from the time I became Minister it was obvious to me that, despite the best efforts of my Department, it was not the best type of institution to run a college of art, I decided that I would bring a Bill before the Dáil which would establish an autonomous body to run the college and that, therefore, I would not make any changes in relation to the employment terms of teachers, and so on, until such time as this autonomous body were set up and could deal with that matter.  I said this on many occasions.  I was questioned here on why we had not more permanent teachers and I explained some of the reasons.  Basically the <Col N="982" /> point I made was that I was leaving the situation as it stood until such time as the autonomous body would take over control.</P>

What I was trying to say was that as far as the permanent positions are concerned the Minister has explained to us on a number of occasions why he did not make <Col N="983" /> temporary positions permanent.  The reasons he gave were basically sound reasons because if it is to become an autonomous college I do not think it is wise to burden that college with a whole lot of permanent people who may or may not be entirely suitable. I accept that.  What I do not accept is that having enunciated that principle the Minister should have failed to bring in the Bill for so long.  His statement a few minutes ago that he had other things to do sounds very weak and hollow in that respect.</P>

      <P>I am coming to the Parliamentary Secretary's curious allegation of inconsistency.  I am just trying to answer the point he made that I was suggesting that all the staff should be permanent and that I am now, on this Bill, saying that they should not.  I can understand that there was a desire to set up this college as an autonomous body and not to make temporary staff permanent for the brief period until that would happen but for how long has that gone on?  I have had questions answered in this House which elicited that this has gone on for, I think, seven years.  It was back in 1963 that this process of appointing temporaries to the permanent staff started, if not earlier.  What I have <Col N="984" /> said is that it is absolutely intolerable that matters should be put on the long finger for seven years and that during that time the staff should be run down so that there are only six permanent staff and 30-odd temporary staff.  I can understand any Minister saying at a certain point in time: &ldquo;I am about to bring in a Bill to hand this over to an autonomous body and during the month or two while this is going through I will not make temporary staff permanent&rdquo;, but to do that for seven years was intolerable. During that period successive Ministers should either have brought in a Bill or if they were not competent or willing to apply their minds to bringing in a Bill they should have made the staff permanent at some time during that period.  You cannot let it run for seven years.</P>

He will very shortly, I suppose, be advocating that after the coming into effect of this Bill the whole-time members of the academic staff shall have their positions reviewed after three months.  Maybe the Deputy is capable of doing a few mental convolutions and telling me how that is consistent with his apparent criticism&mdash;I am not quite sure how it is related to what we are doing now <Col N="985" />&mdash;that these people have not been made permanent over a period?  Could we have some level of consistency in this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary would let me finish my answer.  I have been interrupted about three times.  There is no inconsistency. It seems to me that a body of this kind should, in the ordinary way, be staffed mainly by permanent staff.  There may be a need for some temporary part-time element in it because of special skills that may not be readily available in permanent form.  It was quite wrong that for a period of at least seven years the college have been allowed run down so far as staff is concerned and people have been appointed part-time in replacement for full-time staff, not because there were special skills involved but because a Bill was going to be introduced to put this on a right footing.  If, in 1963, it had been known that this would go on until 1970 I do not think the decision would have been taken not to appoint permanent staff. It is simply that this thing has been let run on by a Department and Ministers who have admittedly been preoccupied with other things but who either should have had the time to bring this in or should not have held up the process in the College of Art of appointing permanent staff.  I do not think they can justify such a long period of not appointing permanent staff because they were not able to bring in legislation.</P>
      <P>On the question of my amendments towards the end of the Bill in connection with the way in which existing staff should be treated by the new board it seems of great importance that this board, starting fresh, should be given power to determine which of the existing staff are carried over and if they feel that some staff should not be carried over, then they should be in a position to terminate their appointment. In such circumstances the people concerned should, of course, have reasons given for the termination and I think also, and this is set out in my amendments, that both permanent and temporary staff whose appointments are terminated should be fully compensated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suggest it is adequate.  I suggest that it may be necessary.  The new board may decide, they must be free to decide, that they should make some changes in the staff when they take over because for a period of 44 years now, all but one year of my lifetime, there have been reports on this college which have commented, <i>inter alia,</i> on the staff position and suggested the need for changes in this Act.  It would be quite wrong for this House to allow the personal interest and satisfaction of members of the staff, however important that may be, to stand in the way of launching this new college on the right lines but, of course, if anybody is to have his appointment terminated at that point he must be fully compensated and given the reasons.  There is nothing inconsistent in that whatever. We have to balance, in this situation, the interests of the individual who must be protected against any hardship for reasons that are beyond his control and the interests of the college.  I have tried to do that and the Parliamentary Secretary will accept that putting down those amendments at the end was certainly not erring on the side of political popularity. As the Bill as drafted offers security of tenure to anybody who has more than five years service in the college, he will at least not accuse me of looking for votes by reversing that and suggesting insecurity of tenure but, because of the human importance of it, assuring them of full compensation if their appointments are terminated.  I put down that amendment in what I regard as the public interest.  It is in no way inconsistent <Col N="987" /> with my concern that the staff of the college should be properly treated.</P>

There have been many changes in all aspects of education in that time.  Ministers have been changed from one Department to another and it takes a Minister a while to catch up but he can consult his predecessor and his staff in the Department are permanent.  While it is understandable that the Minister was preoccupied with many things it is not fair to the people whom this Bill is catering for to say, &ldquo;We have only been two years in the Department.&rdquo;  I do not believe references to coalitions and so on are particularly relevant to this amendment.</P>

I am not an authority on the teaching of art but there are people who have flairs and talents which are not common to the ordinary man in the street and if they are dismissed from their office or employment I believe, because of the somewhat unique positions they hold, they should be entitled to ask for and receive reasons for their dismissal.</P>

We are standing the whole thing on its head.  I do not think it is a very important point but it seems odd with this mania for controlling the details of the work of an institution that in an area where it seems entirely proper that the legislature should lay down what should be done the Minister is not disposed to intervene.</P>

I am a bit bothered about the Minister's reaction and determination to retain control over the remuneration of the director and registrar and his reluctance on the other hand to give reasons for dismissal.  This suggests a combination of attitudes which <Col N="990" /> I find difficult to accept.  I hope that despite this the system will work and that the officers and servants of the board will be employed on fair conditions and will be given reasons for their dismissal if they are dismissed.  I hope also that the Minister will accept the view of the board with regard to the remuneration and conditions of service of the director and registrar.</P>

      <P>Something which has been bothering me since last night, and I have gone over the Bill again carefully this morning, is the peculiar ambivalence in this Bill arising out of the use of &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; and &ldquo;the College&rdquo;.  The academic staff of the college are referred to in most of the Bill under the heading of officers and servants of An Bord.  This is implicit in this section where we are told that &ldquo;An Bord may perform any of its functions through or by any of its officers and servants&rdquo;.  According to this section and earlier sections&mdash;this came up several times in the previous section&mdash;these people are defined as officers and servants of the board but later on we find they are defined rather differently.  In section 27 these same people are referred to at several points as &ldquo;permanent, whole-time members of the academic or other staff of the college&rdquo; and in lines 49 and 50 it is stated &ldquo;shall become and be a member of the academic or other staff of the college&rdquo;.  There is an inconsistency here.  I have drafted Report Stage amendments which will take care of it but whether they will take care of it in a manner which the Minister will accept is another thing.  We should be clear whether members of the staff of the college are officers and servants of the board because they can hardly be both.  There is a confusion of function here.  I do not press this point particularly on this section but I do have amendments down for Report Stage <Col N="991" /> which cover this particular section and try to tidy this up.  It seems to me that officers and servants and academic staff are, in fact, officers, servants and academic staff of the college, who are appointed by the board and may be dismissed by the board.  There is a peculiar inconsistency which needs to be tidied up.</P>

Section 17 says an officer shall hold his office and section 19 refers to an officer or servant in the employment of An Bord.  There is an inconsistency here and it seems to me that the simplest way would be to say officers, servants and staff of the college in the employment of An Bord. That formula in section 17 is clear and to the point but there is a conflict in formula as between it and section 19. We should tidy it up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 55:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (1) (c).</P>
      <P>This is the question of somebody who is an officer or servant of the college becoming a Member of either House of the Oireachtas and of his superannuation. I think I made a mistake in not asking for the deletion of the entire section, but I can remedy that on Report Stage.  The question as to whether somebody who is an officer or servant in the employment of the board and who becomes a Member of the Oireachtas should retain all of his functions in the college should be a matter for the board.  It is such a matter in different institutions of higher education.  They have adopted different practices and I may favour one over another, but I do not think this House should lay down that such a person must give up his job in the period in which he is necessarily seconded and lose his superannuation for that period.  The practice adopted latterly by one of our universities is to reduce proportionately the remuneration for that period of the time of their ordinary working day which they, because of their parliamentary duties, are not free to spend in the particular college.  But their superannuation is unaffected.  If this Bill were to apply to universities such people would have to cease being employed by such universities at all. I do not see any reason for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I declare my interest immediately because I have an interest.  It seems to me desirable that people in academic institutions should be encouraged to be Members of the Oireachtas.  To the extent to which they can combine that with their duties in the particular institution they should be allowed to retain that link and be remunerated proportionately.  To say that any such link must be severed is undesirable. It is not our practice.  We have a very <Col N="993" /> long practice here from the foundation of the State under which members of the academic staff of academic institutions at third level can become Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and retain their link with and their teaching functions in the institutions in question.  Latterly there has been much greater sensitivity&mdash;I think rightly&mdash;on the question as to whether, if they become Members of the Oireachtas and that interferes with the carrying out of their duties in their respective institutions, there should be some adjustment in their remuneration. That seems entirely proper.</P>
    <P>We are rightly more sensitive in these matters now than we were in the early days of the State.  We can, I think, leave it to the commonsense of the institution, as we leave it to the commonsense of the universities.  The practice up to now has been that an academic can be a Member of the Seanad without that interfering significantly with his activities in the academic institutions.  If however, he is a Member of the Dáil, with longer hours of attendance and a greater burden of relevant political work, the interference with his function in the academic institution becomes more significant and it is proper, therefore, to adjust remuneration accordingly.  That seems a commonsense approach.</P>
    <P>It would be hard to find an institution situated in closer proximity to the Oireachtas than the one under discussion. There is only a railing between the two.  It is desirable we should retain this tradition.  Academic staff should be encouraged to be Members of the Oireachtas and any problems created thereby should be adjusted by appropriate financial measures.  I do not think the amendment goes far enough.  I suggest the person concerned should not lose his superannuation benefit.  This institution should not be singled out.  Why should it be all right for someone who is teaching veterinary medicine but not all right for someone teaching art?  The logic of that defeats me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 58:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete subsection (3) and to substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  A committee of An Bord shall consist of such number of members appointed by An Bord as it thinks proper and the members shall consist of or include members of An Bord.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If I remember rightly, Deputy FitzGerald made a point in relation to this matter in his speech on Second Reading, and I decided to replace this subsection by an entirely new subsection which allows greater freedom to An Bord in the matter of the persons they would be empowered to appoint as committee members.  I think the original subsection (3) was too restrictive and I changed it so as to broaden the scope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept this as an improvement.  I have another amendment down which would vary this further and which really should be taken in conjunction with my amendment No. 65, and if I may, I would like to refer to amendment No. 65 in the context of this amendment.  The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that in so far as a committee of An Bord are appointed and such committee may carry out functions on behalf of the board as distinct from advising it, there is a natural and proper concern to ensure that such committees, if they do have delegated power, should reflect the balance of representation on the board.  For example, one could have a situation where under the subsection as drafted, and as now being amended by the Minister, the board might by a majority, consisting of members appointed by the Minister, decide to appoint a committee to undertake certain functions which would exclude from membership anybody nominated by staff or students.  In that way the purpose and value of the nomination of staff and students to the board <Col N="996" /> would be vitiated.  This could apply either to staff and students together or to staff and students separately.  The Minister has rightly decided to give representation to staff and students on the board.  Some people may quarrel with the extent of the representation but it is a good principle, and if that principle is to mean anything in practice, it is important that there should be no way of getting around it, under which the other members of the board could band together and decide to appoint committees not including representations of staff and students and delegating power to them to do things on behalf of the board. This is very important.  I am not suggesting that the exact wording of my amendment is perfect and I think that, perhaps, the provision about a majority of members of the committee consisting of members appointed under sections 6, 7 and 8 may, perhaps, be a bit unnecessary but I think some provision is required.</P>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 65 is to allow, however, for the appointment by the board&mdash;the college council as I have denominated it&mdash;of advisory committees which would not be tied in the same way, whose composition would not need to include representatives of the different representative groups on An Bord and which could, indeed, include members from outside, so that what I am proposing is a dual system under which An Bord can appoint committees to which it delegates functions, who can act in their own right but which must reflect to some degree the balance of interest within the board so that they must have representatives of staff, students and ministerial appointees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if it is thought unnecessary to appoint advisory councils which do not have executive functions but which advise the board, there should be no such requirement tying down the representation in this way.  As these bodies have no delegated power and as it may well be desirable to have a membership which might be drawn from outside the board altogether, there should be provision for that.  As it stands at the moment, as the subsection has been redrafted by the Minister, I am afraid there is a possible <Col N="997" /> danger of the whole purpose of staff and student representation being subverted.  I should like the Minister to indicate whether he is in sympathy with the thinking behind my amendment, even if the exact wording may need to be checked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that my amendment is very much less restrictive than that of the Deputy.  I know what the Deputy has in mind, but surely we should leave it to the good sense of the board when appointing a committee of this kind to include the type of individuals necessary to deal with a particular matter.  While I fully understand what the Deputy is getting at, I do feel that, perhaps, on some occasions it might not be necessary to appoint students&mdash;that they would not have any particular thing to contribute, but on the other hand, if the board at any time so wish, they can appoint students; they can appoint students and teachers alone, or with other members of the board and so on, I think we should not be aiming at restricting to the extent the Deputy asks here the type of committee the board should have the right to appoint. I would prefer to leave this to the good sense of the board.  I hope the board will be acting as a unit and that once it is appointed, it will not be regarded as a board made up of students, teachers and other individuals, but will rather be a body whose purpose is to run the college to the best of their ability for the benefit of the students and, therefore, that there would be no question of them ganging up on one another, as would be suggested might possibly happen.  There is that suggestion in the Deputy's amendment and I feel that the amendment is psychologically divisive. I think we should regard the board, once it is appointed, as a responsible body who will be aiming at the interests of the students and will appoint their committees as they think fit in relation to whatever particular aspect they need a committee for and for that reason it is better to allow the broadest possible scope to the board in relation to its appointments.  I think, therefore, that my amendment is better than that of the Deputy.</P>

      <P>That sounds very <Col N="998" /> reasonable but I am not sure that it will work like that.  I accept that in putting down my amendment I am suggesting the possibility of division&mdash; once you try to guard against something, you are suggesting the possibility of it&mdash;but I should like to bring the Minister back to the discussion on the electoral system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I appreciate that, but it was proposed for a certain purpose.  It is a system which lends itself to the domination of representation by one group to the exclusion of another group.  The Minister has said that he will be prepared to accept the recommendations of staff and students in this respect.  Given those considerations, I am afraid that it is likely, unless there is a very radical change in the thinking of all concerned, of which there is no great sign at the moment, that we are going to get a board with two radical student members and probably two conservative staff members because that is how that voting system would work.  That danger is there and nothing the Minister has said suggests that it is not likely to happen.  On the contrary, everything he said suggests that is precisely what is likely to happen.  He has not been prepared to concede the danger and that it needs to be provided against in the electoral system.  I foresee a situation where there will be a board consisting of the Minister's representatives, two of the more conservative staff members and two of the radical, dissident student members.  The way to get over the problem proposed by the presence of students on the board may be to appoint committees to whom functions will be delegated and which will exclude the students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is precisely what the students fear.  Knowing how the minds of conservative academics work, I would myself fear that if the minds of the academic conservative members of the College of Art were in this way like those of university personnel they might well be tempted to adopt this <Col N="999" /> expedient to get around the awkwardness of having to cope with awkward, abrasive students on the board.  That will not work.  It is important to guard against that.  My amendment may be too strong but some provision is needed.  I would not be concerned if we were talking about advisory committees. It is the practice in the NUI colleges for the committees to be purely advisory.  They may not recommend to the governing body.  If that was the case I should not be so sensitive about it.  There might be some difficulty, but An Bord as a whole is there to take the decisions.  When there is power to delegate a danger arises compounded by what looks like the kind of electoral situation we are likely to have in the light of the discussion we had earlier to-day.  In these circumstances it is important to ensure that any committee to whom power is delegated by An Bord should contain representation at least of the students and of the staff. To that extent, this amendment is really desirable and the Minister should be prepared to have another look at it, even if the drafting does not satisfy him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the amendment would psychologically be divisive.  It is all very well to say that there could quite possibly be two militant students appointed.  That may or may not be.  If it were, is it not very obvious that if a board attempted to exclude one of these students from the various committees simply for the purpose of avoiding difficulties that they would, in fact, be piling up difficulties for themselves?  Not only would the students on the board react to this, but probably a very large proportion of the student body would also react.</P>

      <P>I am speaking from experience.  It does not necessarily have to be a large proportion of the students who create a difficult situation.  I should like, difficult as it may be, to try to have a situation in which this board will operate as a unit and in <Col N="1000" /> which there will, quite possibly be argument and discussion&mdash;this is to be expected&mdash;but where it will operate as a unit and where the activities will be geared towards providing the best possible Art education for the students. A board that would act in the manner suggested by the Deputy would be an unwise one.  I doubt very much if this is likely to happen.  I feel that leaving it to the board to decide in any given instance what type of committee would best deal with the particular function or matter in question is the best way to deal with it in this legislation.</P>

      <P>The Minister's suggestion that student agitation will provide an adequate safeguard is a curious one, coming from him.  I should prefer to prevent student agitation and prevent the possible causes of such agitation arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the members of the board will be sensible people and that they will not deliberately provoke a situation.  We are trying to set up a board to look after the students' interests.  The various members appointed to the individual committees will be the people who are best able to serve in that particular capacity on that particular committee. This is the best way to approach it. The Deputy suggested that there should be at least one student on these committees.  I do not know what difference this would make, except that the students might feel they were at least represented.  I do not know how it could prevent certain types of difficulties arising.  It would appear to me that in most matters in relation to the college with which committees would be dealing students would have a part to play and the teachers would also have a part to play.  I am taking it that this board will be a reasonable, sensible type of board and that they will see to it that the proper people are appointed to the various committees.  If it happened that teachers were not appointed on a particular occasion it would be clear to them why they were not appointed to these particular committees.  I could not imagine a situation arising, considering the past history of this college, <Col N="1001" /> where a board would deliberately set out to create a situation which would endanger the proper running of the college.  Therefore, I feel that it is preferable that we should leave it to the board to select the particular individuals who would be most competent to operate on the various committees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Look at the effect of the existing subsection and of the amendment.  Under an existing subsection which the Minister proposes to delete, the committee of the board would consist of members of the board who would either be members of the board or officers of the board, in other words, teachers, thereby excluding students from the board.  The Deputy has put down a provision that only student members of the board would be entitled to represent the student interests under an existing section.  The Deputy has put down an amendment to ensure that at least one member of each sub-committee would be appointed under subsections 6 and 7. That would mean that at least one would be a member of the board selected by the students to serve on the board or selected by the staff.  In fact, the Minister's amendment goes further. It allows that a student who is not a member of the board at all could be nominated to serve on a committee. This goes further than the Deputy's own amendment and further than the original subsection.</P>
      <P>The Deputy was expressing concern about the representation of students and that their voices should be heard. This would appear to me to be a written guarantee almost of the fact that those voices will be heard and not necessarily of the two students who are on the board who will be the only ones who may serve on committees, which, in fact, would be the position under the Deputy's amendment as I read it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow that.  If the Parliamentary Secretary reads my amendment in conjunction with the section it says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A committee of An Bord shall consist of such number of members <Col N="1002" /> as An Bord thinks proper provided that the committee shall consist of at least one member appointed under each of subsections...</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for this is that the authority must take this in conjunction with my amendment No. 65, if the Chairman will permit me to draw his attention to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  What I am concerned about is that any committee which is going to carry out functions delegated to it by An Bord should logically consist of members of the board: any committee which is to advise the board it is logical that it should be open to it to have other members.  It is left rather vague as it stands.  In fact, it is possible under the Minister's amendment for the board to set up a committee, if I read the amendment correctly, which might include people who are not members of An Bord and who carry out executive functions of An Bord.  I think there is something to be said for distinguishing between the two types of committee.  A committee with executive functions delegated to it by An Bord, the members of which should be members of An Bord and an advisory committee, with any membership you like, to advise the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, looking at the Deputy's amendment No. 65, my amendment here could cover not only what the Deputy has in mind in relation to his amendment No. 60 but also his amendment No. 65.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I do not see any need for it apart altogether from the fact that college council is mentioned.  Apart from that, I think it includes the type of committees that I am suggesting and they could be either committees with these functions or with advisory functions.</P>

      <P>Yes, but the Minister appreciates that he is making provision in his amendment for a committee which might not include members of the board and might even have a majority of non-members of the board which would be carrying out on behalf of the board executive functions delegated to it.

      <P>I find the Minister's explanation a little unconvincing.  So far as it is a full and factual statement of what happened it casts a disturbing light on the preparation of legislation. My understanding is that when legislation is being prepared it is a meticulous process in which civil servants concerned go over it very carefully and in which there is close consultation with the Minister.  The suggestion that the Parliamentary draftsman, without the knowledge or understanding of the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary or the civil servants in the Department, put this in and that nobody noticed it is a very odd statement.  It may be true but, if so, I am a little unhappy about how legislation is drafted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 66.</P>
      <P>Before section 27 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Every person who, immediately before the establishment day, was a permanent, whole-time member of the academic or other staff of the College, shall remain such until his or her position is reviewed by the College Council not more than three months after the appointment of the Director.</P>
      <P>(2)  Immediately on completion of this review each such member of the staff shall either: (a)  be confirmed in this appointment, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  if not so confirmed shall be retired on terms that will compensate that person fully for any loss of income incurred as a result of the failure to confirm the appointment, and will ensure full pension rights on completion of the period after <Col N="1006" /> which that person would normally have retired.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We come to a very fundamental issue here, one which I hesitated to raise for reasons already indicated but I decided that in the interests of this institution it was important that the new board should have a certain freedom of action.  I think the Minister in the way he drafted this part of the Bill was showing commendable concern for and loyalty to the staff of the institution who have been through a very difficult time, all of them, whatever views they may have taken of recent events.  The security of tenure given to the bulk of the staff was, I think, a good thought. I was, however, disturbed and bothered by one feature of it to which I want to return in due course and that is that the security of tenure excluded certain people who have not been in the college for five years.  This five year rule seems a bit curious because in third third level academic institutions, so far as I know, the probationary period for staff is normally two or three years.  I hope I am not incorrect but I think it is a fact that one of the staff who was recently dismissed had less than five years experience but more than two or three years.</P>
    <P>One wonders why five years was put in.  Where did the figure come from?  It was not a figure taken from university institutions in Ireland or Britain.  If it did go through in that form it would have had the effect of excluding from security of tenure one member of the staff who had since been dismissed and who was actively involved with and supported some of the agitation by the students for improvements in the conditions in the college.  I think any security of tenure should be given on a more clear-cut basis than that.</P>
    <P>My proposal reverses the whole thing.  In fact, as it stands, it would enable the new board at a certain point in time after the director had been appointed and had been given time to examine the position, on his recommendation, having considered the matter, to decide not to continue some existing staff in office.  I would not dream of prejudging this.  I have no idea what the merits of the staff in the college are.  It is a fact that at various <Col N="1007" /> times independent reports have not been encouraging about the college. In at least one instance, if not more than one instance, specific recommendations were made about members of the staff.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should completely tie the hands of a new body in this matter.  A new body should have the opportunity, when it has had time to consider it, and when the new director has examined the position, and has decided whether the staff are the kind of staff he wants, and that they would run the college successfully, to exercise discretion and to decide that if this college is to operate successfully certain staff should not continue in office.  I have some expectation also that the new board will decide that the existing members of the staff have all got a contribution to make.  One would be disappointed if this were not the case, but one cannot know that.</P>
    <P>The public record of this college and the recommendations made about it by independent review bodies at different periods from 1927 on suggest the desirability of not tying the hands of the board.  If we in this House decide to make it possible for this body not to continue people in office, there is an absolute obligation on us, especially in view of the local service they have given and the difficult conditions they have had to put up with there, whatever position they may have taken up for or against the students on particular issues, to ensure that people whose appointment is terminated, in what the new board on the advice of the director considers to be in the interest of the college, are adequately compensated.</P>
    <P>I gave thought to what compensation would be reasonable and it seems to me that, if the permanent members of the staff are compensated by keeping their salaries for the rest of their active lives, and not having their salaries diminished in any way while being seconded to other service, shall we say, we could not do fairer than that. The cost involved, if it arises at all, will be small.  We are talking, no doubt, about a very small number of staff, if any.  One hopes we are talking of nobody at all.  This provision is <Col N="1008" /> sufficiently generous to take the sting out of it.</P>
    <P>For the other staff who are not permanent at present I tried to think what provision would be reasonable.  They have a reasonable expectation of being kept on.  Admittedly, the terms and conditions at the moment are not very encouraging but anybody who has served there for some time has some expectation of being maintained.  While they are not in the same position as permanent staff and could not be compensated similarly, it seems appropriate to be generous with them too, and to suggest a sum of money in relation to their present salaries which would avoid any possibility of hardship in their case also.</P>
    <P>I hope that, in the suggestions I have made for financing this redundancy, if redundancy it is, my proposals are sufficiently generous to be acceptable to the staff concerned, if that situation arises.  I hope that the staff concerned will accept that, in putting forward this amendment, I am doing so out of a sense of public duty in the matter and recognising that it is neither profitable nor popular for any politician to propose an element of insecurity of tenure when, in fact, other politicians are proposing security of tenure.</P>
    <P>The Minister will at least accept that the amendment is a disinterested one on my part and that, in putting it forward, I have nothing but the interests of the College of Art at heart. Given that this amendment has come from this side of the House, I hope the Minister will be prepared to consider it.  He may have hesitated to propose it himself.  He may even have felt that, if he proposed something of this kind, he might be attacked or criticised from this side of the House. I have taken the sting out of that.  If there is any odium attaching to it, it attaches to me as the proposer of the amendment.  I hope the Minister will take the opportunity afforded by this amendment to adopt some procedure of this kind which would give some flexibility of action to the new board. I should like to hear the Minister on this and to come back on it again, perhaps, having heard what he has to <Col N="1009" /> say.  Deputy Keating may wish to speak first.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Circumstances have changed quite considerably since the time in July when I put down one of these three amendments.  This Bill was circulated at a time when forces that could have been seen to have been at work for a long time were moving towards a confrontation and, indeed, in some ways, this confrontation had already taken place or was beginning to take place.</P>
      <P>Provisions like the whole of section 27 relate to the period when the old College of Art under the Department of Education was going out of business and a new college was to be set up. I want to be careful here because I hope this thing can be resolved reasonably and I do not want to make the situation worse.  On the other hand, I do not want to use this opportunity to say nothing.  Perhaps I will have another bite at the cherry when I hear what the Minister has to say.</P>
      <P>There are two essential provisions. There is the provision in relation to five years previous experience.  I was appointed to something which, without the creative aspect to which I referred earlier, was roughly comparable to the old College of Art.  This was the Veterinary College which was run by the Department of Agriculture. A great deal of my bitterness in relation to third level institutions run by Government Departments stems directly from my experience for five years as a member of the staff of the Veterinary College when it was part of the Department of Agriculture and also my conviction that civil servants are entirely unsuited to the work of administering such organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was confirmed 12 months after my appointment.  That was the normal practice in the Veterinary College.  If you cannot find out whether a person is suitable within 12 months, you cannot find out at all.  This period of five years is much too long.  I do not say that in all institutions it is one year. I do not deny that a probationary period is necessary.  Sometimes the selection mechanism can pick somebody <Col N="1010" /> unsuitable.  It is not a matter of taking even a year to find out.  You should know within the first term. Some institutions have a short period and some have a year or two years, and Deputy FitzGerald says even three years, but five years seems to me to be entirely inappropriate in this context.</P>
    <P>In a separate amendment we dealt with the question of the duration of employment during the week.  Until I hear what the Minister has to say I do not want to discuss the misgivings that caused me to put down amendments to this section.  There is an effort on all sides now to resolve this difficulty and to get the new organisation away to a clean start with goodwill and with a hope of success.  The action of dismissing a number of people, when everybody knew that a final resolution of the problem was pending, and when the Bill had been circulated and given a Second Reading, made the possibility of a smooth start to the new organisation much more unlikely.  This was a bad decision and I hope it will be reversed.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to go more sharply into it now but I hope the Minister will be disposed to take a conciliatory line.  If he so indicates I will be happy to see the difficulties overcome and resolved.  My whole concern with these amendments was that I feared these rules would be designed not in a general way to see that the college was properly protected against unsuitable appointments but that they would be specifically drawn by people to exclude not the general category of the unsuitable but a certain specific number of people, certain individuals. I think that is an improper intention for legislation.  The period of 18 hours a week is unduly long.  I hope the Minister will share the view that every effort should be made to launch the new organisation with the best possible hope of success and, therefore, I would be disposed at this moment not to pursue the matter.  I think the Minister is well aware of what I am talking about and he is well aware that a great deal more <Col N="1011" /> could be said about it but I should like to hear what he has to say about it.</P>

      <P>In relation to the board and the appointment of teachers, the question arose as to whether it should be left entirely to the board to appoint whatever teachers they should desire or that they should feel were the most suitable teachers to teach in the College of Art.  I felt that this would be unfair to those who had considerable service in the college and particularly to those who had been appointed on a permanent basis.  I felt, and this refers to the five years period, that those who had five year's service and had been teaching for what could be termed the whole-time equivalent number of hours per week had an expectation which should be met.  This was not a probationary period.  It is simply that I felt that in these particular circumstances teachers who had this service were entitled to have particular consideration given to them.  To carry this further would, in my view, tie the hands of An Bord too much in relation to the teachers they might wish to employ.  I wanted to give as wide a scope as possible to the board but I felt that I had certain responsibilities and these responsibilities referred to the teachers who had a particular length of service in the college.  This was not intended to be a probationary period as has been mentioned by Deputy Keating.</P>
      <P>Knowing the background to the problems in the college, I could not accept these amendments.  The first amendment here by Deputy FitzGerald states that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every person who, immediately before the establishment day, was a permanent, whole-time member of <Col N="1012" /> the academic or other staff of the College, shall remain such until his or her position is reviewed by the College Council not more than three months after the appointment of the Director.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious to me that this amendment was put down at a time when, quite possibly, the Deputy had only been discussing this matter with one particular group.  Deputy Keating has almost gone to the extent of accusing me of bringing in this section of this Bill to exclude particular teachers, which is untrue, but this particular type of amendment could very easily react in a different way.  Knowing the background of the problem in the college and the position that a number of permanent whole-time teachers have found themselves in, in relation to a certain militant group in the college over the past two or three years, I can very easily see what could happen if we were to have a situation where the appointment would be made for only three months after the appointment of the director. We could have a reversion to the situation where the lives of certain individual teachers in that college were made almost unbearable.  Pressure could be put on them.  On the one hand, their lives could be made such a hell that they would leave; on the other hand, the pill would be coated by offering them compensation.  Mind you, the amount of compensation here is not to be sneezed at either because the compensation, as far as we can estimate, would work out at about £160,000 in immediate cash payment, apart from the payment of pensions afterwards.</P>

      <P>The giving of monetary compensation in lieu of retention would, on the one hand, entail expenditure that would be prohibitive and would, on the other hand, cast a slur on teachers involved for which no money would compensate them.  These are teachers who have done a very worthwhile job despite criticism which has been levelled at them from many sources and despite the type of attack that has been made on them in recent <Col N="1013" /> times.  I am convinced that arising from this particular amendment this is exactly what would happen.  I must say it never was my intention to exclude anybody.  The board will be an autonomous board.  They will have the absolute right to appoint whomsoever they wish.  Apart from the number whose interest I felt duty bound to protect the board will be fully entitled, as an autonomous body, to appoint whomsoever they wish.  When I looked at this particular amendment it was very clear to me that this was the type of thinking that was behind the militancy which had been going on in the college for some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>What I mean very simply is that some of the teachers whom I am protecting here were persecuted in that college by a small group over a period and I could see that if I were to agree to this type of amendment I would not alone be letting down people who have done a worthwhile job in the college but I would almost be placing them in a position where they could be forced out of their employment. I certainly and assuredly am not going to do that.  I also pointed out that monetary compensation in this type of situation would not compensate these people if they had to give up their employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said at the beginning that when I began to think over this matter first my problem was whether or not the board should be entitled to appoint all of the teachers.  I felt I would be unfair to those teachers who were permanent whole-time members and I felt a responsibility to those who have given the type of service I have mentioned in relation to the five years.  I felt I might be restricting to far too great an extent the right of the board to appoint teachers if I went any <Col N="1014" /> further.  These were my reasons for putting in the sections and I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>A probationary period in an academic institution means a period during which one's employment does not carry with it any obligation to permanent employment. Normally in academic institutions in this country and in Britain the probationary period is two or three years and at the end of that period one can be dismissed without any compensation and without questions of any kind, but after that period a person does acquire rights&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Brief contributions have been made while the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary were sitting down and I did not think I was that much out of order.  I was hoping to get a quick answer from the Minister. This is the normal probationary period in these institutions.  The onus is on the Minister to explain why he departed from the norm here and produced the five year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of it was, as he must have realised, knowing as he does the situation in the college, to immediately arouse suspicion.  It was thought that the purpose of making it five rather than two or three years was to make <Col N="1015" /> it possible to discontinue not only one of two teachers but both of them. When I was puzzling over the five years the point was made to me that the reason for adopting this peculiar period for which there is no precedent that I know of&mdash;the Minister may have one but we have not heard about it yet&mdash;might have been to make it possible to dispose of not only one but two of these teachers.  In fact, both of the teachers in question have since been disposed of, which does not reduce the suspicion attaching to the action.  The Minister has told us this is not his intention and if the Minister says that I know the Minister well enough to know that I must accept his word, but who drafted the amendment? Did the Minister suggest five years or did that figure come from the Department?  I am not as convinced that his Department are innocent of having thought out this peculiar period in relation to the existing teaching staff as I am satisfied that it was not the Minister's intention.  We are in a very unusual position because months ago it was suggested that the purpose of this was to enable two teachers to be dismissed and the two teachers who were named in that context have since been dismissed.  This does not reduce suspicions and it makes one concerned about this particular matter.  The Minister has an obligation to tell us where the five years came from and before we discuss the matter more generally I shall give him the opportunity of answering that.</P>

The Deputy wants to know where the five year period came from.  I want to state again that the <Col N="1016" /> five year period was not a probationary period.  In relation to this Bill we have been arguing about the period for which the director and the registrar should be appointed.  The Deputy had an amendment down and argued that the director and registrar should be appointed by the board for a probationary period of four years.  I do not see the difference in my taking five years and his taking four years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very obvious. I was not accusing the Minister of responsibility for events which occurred as long ago as that.  The Minister desires to break the line of thought for the sake of interjecting but he ought be a little more relevant.  The Minister was perfectly well aware I was not making that assertion.</P>
      <P>The figures for the number of permanent and temporary people indicate a policy which has existed in the College of Art, and unfortunately in some other third level academic institutions, of running the place on a very small number of permanent people and a very large number of temporary people.  My father spent from 1911 to the early sixties, one way or another, either as a scholarship student or a teacher working in a school of art.</P>
      <P>For a considerable period of that time he was professor of painting and not alone a member, but President of the Royal Hibernian Academy, but he was never permanent.  The Department of Education, over which the Minister now presides, have been pursuing a policy of running the place on temporary people up to the very highest level and up to the most senior appointments.  In any sort of equity the responsibility is taken on to a person if he is considered good enough to be appointed and if he is considered good enough to be confirmed after a probationary period.  The matter of probation does come into it, though the Minister may deny it.  Then the responsibility is taken on towards them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that he is not concerned about suspicions provided he is satisfied he has done the right <Col N="1018" /> thing.  The reason I put down these three amendments was that, when the Bill was circulated, people came to me and said: &ldquo;This is designed for the purpose of screwing Messrs.  A, B and C.  That is the reason these provisions are thrown up in this way&rdquo;. This was as plain as a pikestaff at the end of June or early July.  Two of these three people have now been dismissed close to the moment of reorganisation and, in my view, and we will discuss this more fully at a later stage, dismissed in a vindictive way and in a way guaranteed to give a difficult start to a new organisation.</P>
    <P>It may, of course, be coincidence. That is possible.  But either at the end of June or early in July I was told these were the objectives of this formulation. Then it was actually done.  I know these people.  I know their creative work to be of high quality.  I know their crime has been too much commitment to their students and to their efforts to have a real school of art.  I am not in the least concerned with the Minister's good faith.  Perhaps his faith is impeccable. I do not know.  I have no way of telling.  I do not suppose he himself drew up these regulations anyway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is drawn into the position of having to stand over something.  Though I have no way of being certain that it was vindictiveness and for the purpose of execution, that was the purpose told to me three months ago and that has been validated by the events which have occurred since.  If this is an effort at making a comparison with the North, last night, without being able to define which side was which&mdash;there is a proven separation between two groups of people; it was admitted there were two sides&mdash;I said the same events were seen by people as if they were different events and there were actually two complicated situations. Just as I declined to make a judgement that all the right is on one side and all the wrong on the other, it seems to me the Minister makes the opposite judgement: all the right is on the part of those persons he describes as being victimised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1019" />
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  On many occasions I have pointed out here that I recognise the problem is a two-sided problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is then the thing is to conciliate.  One can make judgments until one is black in the face. They do not help.  The great thing is to get a viable, happy and creative organisation off the ground.  If I was told what I have put on record at the end of June or the beginning of July, and if we have these two dismissals since then, which validate the suspicions expressed to me, it does not seem to me to matter whether or not the Minister feels his hands are clean; all that matters is that suspicions were expressed and that events since appear to validate them.  The sense of alienation is, therefore, deeper.  The sense of betrayal is deeper.  The sense of using the apparatus of the State to pursue vendettas against people is deeper.  The Minister ought, therefore, agree.</P>
      <P>The Minister says he is not in the least concerned with what suspicions there may be, but he ought to be concerned regardless of the propriety or otherwise of his own actions because, if he does not concern himself with allaying these suspicions, he does not have any serious chance of launching the school we want.  The suspicions are real and divisive.  Regardless of the rights and wrongs of the suspicions, if they are there and deeply held, then the Minister, if he is seriously trying to discharge his duty, ought to be concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to stress that point too.  We are all naturally concerned that we do the right thing, as we see it, but I do not think any of us can be happy if he just satisfies his own conscience that he is acting properly and that that is sufficient.  We are politicians and, in the best sense of that word, acting politically, in a politic manner.  It is right that we should have regard to the effect of our actions on people.  I do not think we can simply say we have done what we think is for the best and, if people do not like it, they can lump it; that may be grand for other people, but it is not grand for politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> Our job is to conciliate, bring people together and make the system work.  If we are simply satisfied within ourselves that we have done what is right and are not concerned for the effects of our actions, then we are not doing our job; we are not being effective politicians. I think the Minister in what he said on two occasions there was not giving full thought to the effects of what he was saying and, perhaps, to the effects of what he was doing.  We are in a desperately difficult situation in relation to the college.  We have tried in this debate to avoid anything which would make the situation worse.  We have tried consciously to do anything we could to make it better.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get involved in the controversy.  I agree with what Deputy Keating has said and the Minister agrees there are two sides to this.  There are profoundly two sides.  I have known about both sides for a long time.  I have seen both sides.  I have known about the need to bring them together. From what we know of this college and the report we have had on it since 1927, together with the intimate involvement some of us, unfortunately, have had in its affairs in the last year or two, I do not think any of us can say that this problem is largely one-sided and that we can go ahead and simply commit the new board to all the existing staff and all will be well. I do not want to say all will not be well if the existing staff are appointed. I do not know that, but there are <i>prima facie</i> grounds for concern which make it necessary for us, regardless of whether or not it is politically popular, to create the conditions in this Bill which will enable the new board, if it decides it is the right thing to do, to relinquish the services of some of the staff and compensate them.</P>
    <P>I was not impressed by the Minister's attempt to tell us the cost of this.  First of all, he would not tell us the number of years.  Some of the staff are quite young; some are in their twenties, I would say.  Some of that compensation would be paid some time in the next century, 2015.  Producing figures spread over 40 years can be very misleading. Certainly there is no ground for the assumption that the new board will <Col N="1021" /> sack the entire staff.  I do not think anyone suggested such drastic action could or would be necessary.  But, if all the staff were sacked and what that would cost, has no relevance to this debate and its introduction was an act of partiality; the Minister was endeavouring to bias the discussion in a particular way.  I do not think it really added anything to the discussion.  It was the kind of figure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was asking for details of the figure and he is now apparently implying that they are not forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It was given without any details, without indication of the years it was over and to give the figure in that form is so completely misleading that it is better not to give it at all or give the full details, but to give it without giving the number of years is very misleading.  To anybody who is not familiar with it is could well appear that this was going to be the annual cost and I do not think that is the right way to handle a serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister ought to accept that in putting in these amendments I have been trying to help the situation.  I would like to ask him a couple of questions which may help to clarify my mind.  Is it his position, although unstated so far, that when the new board takes over, by the action taken in his wording here, they will have to take over certain staff but that they will have power to dismiss this staff just as they have power to do other things in the college?  Is this what is implicit in what he said?  Is he trying, on the one hand, to give the staff a feeling of security of tenure, while knowing that it is not security of tenure, that the new board can get rid of them.  Is that what he is thinking? If that is so, we should say so plainly rather than mislead people.  If that is the case what kind of compensation would the staff be entitled to if they are dismissed by the new board under the terms of the Bill as drafted?  Could I have an answer to these two questions? Will it be within the power of the board to dismiss any member of <Col N="1022" /> the staff, who is in a permanent or temporary position?  Will they be able to do that and what compensation will they be entitled to under the Bill as drafted?  I do not think we can discuss this constructively any further until we have the answers to those two questions. When we know precisely what the powers of the board are as regards dismissal and the compensation given under the Minister's scheme, we can make a comparison validly with the scheme I have proposed.  It may be that there is not that much difference between us but the Minister is not disclosing fully his intent in the matter and I should like to bring this whole matter out into the open.</P>

      <P>We have to look at incidentals to assure each other of our <i>bona fides.</i> The fact that a teacher is not covered by section 27 does not mean that he is automatically excluded, which seems to be the impression that is being conveyed.  It is open to the board&mdash;these 18 or 19 who are not included in that special provision because of length of service&mdash;to employ them.  Note that it is so open subject to the condition that they may continue in the employment of the board:</P>
      <P>on such terms and conditions as An Bord may from time to time determine, being terms and conditions that, in the opinion of the Minister, are not less favourable to the person than those....</P>
      <P>So that to suggest that the Minister or the Department or some person had notions of acting vindictively does not hold water, having regard to what I previously said on the section.</P>

He said that he was more or less in the interests of good relations and harmony in the college prepared to accept the odium that would attach to his amendment.  There is not much odium attached to amendments which provide, in the first instance, for full compensation for the rest of one's working life at the rate which one would have got had one continued to work and, secondly, pension rates on the basis that one had continued to work when one, in fact, did not.  If the Deputy thinks that kind of proposal is going to attract odium&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy was apparently sacrificing himself on the altar of public interest.  If we are going to start with the idea that everything that emanates from the Minister is put forward for vindictive or selfish reasons and everything from the other side is put forward for reasons of public service despite one's own comfort, the debate would get very unbalanced. For this reason, I want to reassure not only Deputies but all concerned that it was not directed at any particular individual, and I suggest to Deputy FitzGerald, as well, that while he has been the very person who suggested that it is important for university or third level staffs to have security, he wants to have their positions confirmed after three months.  That does not seem to me to give them a guarantee of security that seems to be consistent with third level institutions or universities as argued by the Deputy over a considerable period on the Bill.  I feel that the Deputy is being totally inconsistent in putting down this amendment.  He is arguing against <Col N="1025" /> his own case but nonetheless, suffice it to say that though he would be effective in arguing a hypothetical case, in the practical case he would fall down.</P>
      <P>The Deputy then suggested that the figures are not relevant but maybe by the time we get to Report Stage we can give the Deputy the figures for each individual should he choose to operate it.  Suffice it at the moment to say that the amount of money involved on a global basis&mdash;and I admit that the likelihood of its happening for all together is most remote, but for the number of teachers who would be concerned&mdash;something over 39&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not a reflection on the staff but simply a matter of responsibility that if you write in conditions into legislation you must be prepared to honour those conditions when they arise.  Who can say what the board, if and when the situation arises, will do and who can tie their hands in coming to any determination? It is possible that a global figure of that sort or a significant proportion of it will be decided on.  That is something that the Minister for Education must consider before accepting amendments of this sort.  I would hope by reference to the fact that there are no individuals involved in this that the board would be entitled to continue them on terms not less favourable. There is no question of their service being automatically terminated.  It has been suggested to us that it is meant to be a coincidence that two people who apparently would not have been covered have now been dismissed. Deputy Keating sees a coincidence in this or a confirmation of suspicions some people had.  It is quite the other way around.  The fact that people have been dismissed indicated that nobody was sheltering behind any authority that would reside in any board under this Act.  There was never any possibility that this Act would be introduced before the beginning of this academic year.</P>

      <P>The prospects of the Act coming into operation with the amount of legislation and the <Col N="1027" /> manner in which it was going through the House, were remote.  It was expected that these part-time teachers would have been in employment in the current academic year and then it would have been a matter for the board.  That illustrates that it is the board who exercise responsibility and in the exercise of that responsibility they are not exercising it for the purpose of restricting or removing rights, but, if anything, to ensure that people will be continued in employment on conditions no less favourable than those under which they were employed previously.</P>
      <P>We have all endeavoured to establish the necessity for an autonomous qualified board.  This board will have students, teachers and a director as members.  I know a little of students while not having the same constant association with them as Deputy FitzGerald or Deputy Keating.  I know that if they thought that student representatives on the board were going to be intimidated by a board of which they were members they would create a row about it.  The students themselves will be involved in the decisions which will be undertaken or effected by section 27.  The staff selected by the staff association would also be responsible for the decisions.  Is that not some safeguard?</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says that there are 18 people here and that that proves that the two dismissals were not envisaged.  We find that one of the persons dismissed has four to five years service.  The only way he can be got into a different category is to raise the limit to five years.  In so doing other people are brought in&mdash;16 or 17 of them&mdash;but this is the only way one can get those two people into that position.  The Parliamentary Secretary's argument that there are 18 or 19 people is not a conclusive argument or even indicative that the purpose of having 5 years here was not to exclude these people.  I have accepted the Minister's statement that this was not his intention.  I do not necessarily accept that the choice of this particular figure, so at variance with the normal figure for academic posts, in the draft submitted to the Minister did not have regard to the fact that one of the two people involved who has since been dismissed had a period of service of more than two or three years.  The Parliamentary Secretary's argument is inconclusive. If we pass this legislation without amendment, will the new board be in a position to dismiss members of the staff and what compensation will they get under the Bill as drafted?  We need to have answers to these questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <P>It has been pointed out already by the Parliamentary Secretary that there are certain members of the staff, whom I believed I had a responsibility towards because they were permanent whole-time members, who would be employed by the board on such terms and conditions as the board might from time to time determine but on terms and conditions which in the opinion of the Minister are not less favourable than those applying in relation to their previous employment.  If these teachers are employed by the board then they will have to get conditions similar to those to which they have already been entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get behind this dialogue and get down to the facts of the matter.  What the Minister is suggesting now is that under his scheme the staff will be transferred to a body which will be able to dismiss them without any compensation whatever. Under my scheme they would be entitled to compensation.  I think my scheme is better and fairer.  The Minister is adding as a justification for his method of doing it that if it is done his way there will be no pressure of any kind and that the staff will be quite safe while if it is done in my way pressures will arise and the staff will be liable to lose their jobs.  I should like to know what kind of a board does he contemplate will be appointed by him&mdash;because it is he who will appoint them&mdash;which when it comes to review the position of these people three months after the director is appointed will be liable to dismiss them.  The only difference between his scheme and mine is that the position has to be reviewed, whereas if there was a specific review point set there would be no question of the board doing anything.  What kind of pressures are we talking about?  What kind of board are we talking about that would act in such an irresponsible way?  I think the Minister has been, shall we say, betrayed into exaggeration on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic situation now is that the Minister is proposing to hand over these people to a board which would have the power of dismissing them without any compensation while I am proposing that they be handed over, that the position be reviewed and if they have to be dismissed they should <Col N="1032" /> have compensation.  Can anybody doubt which of the two is the fairer and more equitable?  The Minister's protestations of loyalty to the staff of this college and his accusations that on our side of the House we are in some way motivated by some animus sound very hollow when it transpires that he wants them to be in a position where they cannot be compensated and we are proposing they can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The teachers are very well aware of this but the fact of the matter is that the Deputy consulted only for a very considerable period with one particular group and only in very recent times was the case of the others put to him.  I now say that he should consult with the teachers and ask them whether they think the terms offered by me or the proposals put forward by him are more acceptable to them.  I have no doubt as to what the answer would be.</P>

It may well be that some people came to me sooner than others and that reflects on the situation in the college somewhat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not want to suggest that the Deputy was deliberately consulting one side but what I am saying is that all of the information which was being relayed to him for a very considerable time was coming from one side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall certainly admit&mdash;&ldquo;admit&rdquo; is hardly the word&mdash;<Col N="1033" /> I shall state clearly that I received representations from anybody who came to see me.  For a certain period the people who came to see me were of one viewpoint.  That put me in a position to make inquiries and my procedure in making those inquiries has been as far as possible to establish, by asking the Minister privately or publicly for his views on the information put to me, the truth of the matter.  In that process I have established to my own satisfaction that a number of the points made to me are entirely valid. On others the position is less clearcut. In some I think the case made was exaggerated, as I would expect to find in an <i>ex parte</i> statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that goes far enough.  The Deputy said some of the points were valid and that others were less valid.  Were they invalid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary would listen to what I said, I said some were unclear and some were certainly exaggerated.  I do not recall anything which was flatly untrue or that was shown to be untrue but certainly some things were shown to be significantly exaggerated, exactly what one would expect in getting an <i>ex parte</i> statement.  I think the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary know me well enough not to assume that I would accept the <i>ex parte</i> statements of any group as necessarily true.  When put to one they provide a case for inquiry and I have inquired diligently in private and in public to establish the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been approached by and have had consultations with members of the staff with the two opposite viewpoints. I have pointed out to them the provisions in my amendment.  I do not want to put words into anybody's mouth but I did not meet with any dissent on the proposals.  Some of the people concerned welcomed them and thought they were good and generous proposals.  Others said they understood there were good reasons for giving the board a free hand even though they themselves could be affected.  I found throughout that the people concerned, whatever their viewpoint, had an open <Col N="1034" /> and public-spirited approach and were not motivated by narrow considerations of personal advantage.  That is as true of one group as of another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did any of those with whom the Deputy consulted or who consulted him direct any odium at him as a result of these proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I must say they did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I wonder what was the basis for the statement the Deputy made in the House today that he was leaving himself open to odium with the teachers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say the teachers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Who else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I said nothing of the kind.  I said that any politician putting down a proposal which, on the face of it, involved the possibility of dismissal for people was hardly doing it for political advantage.  I was trying to establish with the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary that, in putting down this amendment, I had only the good of the college at heart, and that I was not motivated by any other consideration.  I think it was legitimate for me to point that out.</P>
      <P>So far as the staff are concerned, the ones I have met have shown an understanding of the reasons for these amendments.  They were not aware, and naturally I was not aware, that my proposal was one which would be greatly to their advantage because I did not detect on the part of any of them an awareness that even the permanent staff could be dismissed without compensation, and that the Minister's proposal would hand them over to a board and leave them in that position.  Since neither they nor I were aware of this I do not think they appreciated the significance of my amendments and their possible value from that point of view.  However, that is really neither here nor there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should now try to come to some conclusion on this.  We are faced with two choices.  One is the Minister's proposal which has the merit, from his <Col N="1035" /> point of view, of appearing to offer security of tenure to this loyal staff he wants to support for their great work in the college, but which leaves them exposed to dismissal without compensation. The other is from somebody he seems to feel has an animus against him and is one which will, in fact, ensure that, while on the one hand the new board will have an opportunity and will be required to review the position, and to ensure that the staffing arrangements of the new college are in the interests of the college, will also ensure that the staff to whose loyalty and hard work the Minister has paid tribute can and will be compensated adequately if the new board decides to dispense with their services.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the argument to date and what has emerged from this discussion, and what has been disclosed in response to my questions, I have no doubt that my amendment is better from the point of view of the college and from the point of view of the people concerned.  It may be less good from the point of view of the Exchequer but that is the least of my concerns at this moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, let me say that if it is a fact that the teachers concerned did not know before now what was involved in my proposals and what was involved in the Deputy's proposals, I assume that they will know now after this debate.  I would ask the Deputy again to see them and to find out from them whether they think my proposals or his proposals are more satisfactory.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is making a charge against me which he knows is not true.  The fact of the matter <Col N="1037" /> is that the teachers who are in permanent employment in the college at present are in a somewhat similar situation in relation to dismissal as civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I told the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to say that whatever the Minister's intention was&mdash;and I think he was inadequately informed because he was getting advice at that point&mdash;he did, in fact, in actual terms, mislead the House because the Parliamentary Secretary has now said that the two terms are not synonymous.  He is not claiming they are synonymous.  In fact, they are not synonymous.  In one case it is possible to dismiss people because they are not able to carry out their duties adequately and in the other case it is not.  By giving to the House a form of words which suggested the inclusion of the possibility of dismissal for lack of competence when, in fact, that is not possible the Minister misled the House.  I am sure he did not intend to do so.  I am sure he was inadequately informed but he has wasted half an hour of the debate as a result.  He ought to have been better informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I most certainly have not wasted the time of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>He has not got the Deputy's capacity for using time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the teachers concerned know well that they cannot be dismissed by the board unless they are guilty of gross negligence or criminal acts.  Surely they are good and sufficient reasons.  Let us look at it from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us restart the debate now that we have got the factual information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will not restart the debate.  I have made my position clear on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is becoming clear but it is a tough job pulling it out of the Minister.  The position now is, <Col N="1038" /> therefore, that under the Minister's proposals these teachers will be taken over by the board but, if the board takes the view that some of them are not in a position to carry out their duties effectively, with whatever diligence they attempt to do so, and that it would be better if they did not continue, the board will not be able to replace them.  That is now the position that emerges from the Minister's statement. It seems to me that, if the Minister has the interests of the college at heart, he should make it possible for the new board, if it finds in any instances that one of the teachers is not in a position to carry out his duties adequately and competently, to be free to take steps to replace that teacher and to compensate him adequately.</P>
      <P>The case for my amendment is even stronger.  It emerges at this stage that my amendment creates a slightly greater element of insecurity for the staff.  I accept that.  When I talked about odium, since the Parliamentary Secretary is so sensitive about this word, it was because I felt at the time &mdash; although I had been misled for half an hour and led up a blind alley&mdash;that my proposal did increase the insecurity of the staff.  I felt that would not be very popular.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people will be inclined to be against any proposal which reduces the security of tenure of anybody through sympathy for people in that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>His was very much to the point.  I do not understand that reference.  Let us not waste time on that.  The issue is becoming more clear-cut now.  The new board must be in a position to review the position of teachers and, even if a teacher is not a criminal and does not commit gross negligence, if the board feels that it would be better to replace him with somebody else it must be free to do so and this college must have a fresh start.  I hope that will not happen and I am not saying it will happen.  If it does happen the teacher concerned must be adequately compensated.  That is the purpose of my amendment.  The case for that amendment has now been made by the information we have dragged out of the Minister.  I do not think anything more needs to be said.</P>

He now comes up with the piece of information that the conditions of service they now enjoy are that they can be fired on a week's notice without any reason given.

      <P>It has generally been the case, in fact, in this debate because I found the arguments terrifyingly feeble.  We now get the matter of five years being validated for a teacher by comparison with a chairman of a board.  I should like to hear the Minister validate his demand for five years by comparison with any teaching institution, for teachers, if such is possible. It is indeed possible that he can dig up something in the obscure regulations of some group of teachers.  I do not want him to bring in some other <Col N="1042" /> sort of people.  We are talking about teachers.</P>
      <P>I should like him to consider the point that if someone is thought good enough to get by an appointment board, in the first place, and then is good enough to be confirmed after a probationary period, that by these two steps a responsibility towards him is taken on in regard to his future employment.  I have never heard of a case where the confirmatory step, after the probationary period was over, was as late as five years.  The Minister may argue that one year is too short, though I would like to hear why, but it is interesting that somebody should have been considered fit to work for three or four years and is not thereby considered to have established any right to be continued in employment if the particular institution is dissolved and another one set up.  There is a real point at issue here and I would like to hear it argued in regard to teachers. The Minister must have reasons.  I should like to hear what they are.</P>

      <P>I said previously that five was not a magic figure.  The Deputy suggested that teachers who passed a board should be satisfactory after a year or two years.  So far as I am aware, this was not the method of appointment of teachers in the College of Art.  The teachers who are appointed on a permanent basis were appointed by the Civil Service Commission and this was one of our problems because on one occasion when a number of teachers went before the commission, the commission only agreed to sanction half of them.  The other teachers in the College of Art were appointed by the director.  I do not know whether or not these teachers would have been appointed if they had had to go through the procedure of going through the Civil Service Commission.  Therefore, I felt that I should not be too restrictive in relation to the situation in which the board would find themselves.  I believe we have a responsibility towards those who were appointed full-time by the Civil Service Commission, that we have a certain responsibility also to those who had given a considerable length of service to the college but I feel it <Col N="1043" /> should be left to the board to decide, in relation to the remainder of the teachers, whether or not they should continue their appointments.  This, as I said a moment ago, had no bearing at all on a probationary period.  It is very much in line, although I know the Deputy wants to get me off it, with the four year probationary period which Deputy FitzGerald proposed in relation to the director and registrar. That is not any more magical than the five years.</P>

      <P>These teachers have to be compared with other sorts of teachers.  Would the Minister not agree that whether a person is appointed by the Civil Service Commission or a director&mdash;a director is someone whom one must have some trust in and although his judgment may not be invariably correct by and large he would not be there if he did not have some talents for making judgments like that&mdash;that once selected the person is seen in action for a period of time.  By the time people have been seen in action for, let us say, two years, is it not incumbent then either to give them some security and some responsibility with regard to their future employment or else to dismiss them?  Is it not a scandalous thing to say, &ldquo;O.K.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are separate only for purposes of drafting and are part of the same thought.  I am concerned with persons who are not permanent staff.  The objective of subsection 2 (b) is to define the period of time and the amount of service.  We have already discussed the matter of the five years in the last line of the subsection and we found the Minister, in my view, unwilling either to concede any amount of time or to advance any argument in favour of the five year period.  However, that is water under the bridge.</P>
      <P>I want to turn now to the amount of time.  In most third level institutions there have evolved rule of thumb conditions about the length of time for which one was expected to teach.  I think that pretty well any university teacher who thought he would have to teach for 18 hours a week would consider himself grossly overworked, because there is the matter of preparation. The amount of time actually spent with the student is only a small part of what has to be done.  I recognise that the teaching art is not entirely comparable with certain academic disciplines, but it does appear to me that on the basis of a five day week, this is rather a lot of teaching time for people employed on a part-time basis.  I would be very interested to hear the Minister telling us what the average teaching time of a part-time teacher is, what the largest amount of teaching time of a part-time teacher is and what the smallest amount of time is; in other words, what is the scatter of teaching hours of the 29 or 30 people currently on the staff of the college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said earlier that I put down these amendments in the circumstances of three months ago in an effort to protect the jobs of certain people.  It is water under the bridge in regard to two of them now because two of them have, <Col N="1048" /> in fact, been dismissed and I will have the occasion to express my thoughts on that, not speaking to any amendment but to another section.  I must say that I have held back in the hope of a more conciliatory attitude than the Minister has shown and I am a little disappointed that he has not been more considerate on this.  I can think of a particular instance where someone is teaching 17 hours a week and has the qualification under the number of years.  That person misses out on the number of hours by one hour and the number of hours chosen is rather large. I suggest that if people teach for a period much shorter than five years, and, indeed, for a period much less than 18 hours a week, provided, firstly, that they are appointed in good faith, and then adjudged to be satisfactory, so that they are retained, without questioning their appointment, for a reasonable period, such as one or two years, by the fact that they are continued in their employment&mdash;it is possible to terminate these part-time jobs, as the Minister said, at a week's notice&mdash;by the fact of their being continued after one year or at most two years, I believe that any public institution, whether in the Civil Service or under a separate board, takes on a responsibility towards these people.  If one draws analogy with other sorts of work, there is a responsibility which in many instances is covered by redundancy legislation that once the work is adequate and the job is there&mdash;provided the job is not abolished&mdash;if a person has been adjudged to be satisfactory enough to be re-employed even for a second year, then a responsibility towards him is taken on.  This is built into the social legislation of very many countries in regard to very many jobs.</P>
    <P>I have already argued that I think the period of five years is much too long and the purpose of these two amendments, which are really a drafting mechanism to add on another sentence, is to indicate that the period of 18 hours is much too much.  There is a further objection to this rather long period of 18 hours that it does not say in the original draft in the Bill that people must have been working for 18 hours for a previous number of years; it does not say that they must <Col N="1049" /> have put up an average number of so many hours a week&mdash;X hours a week for a certain number of years.  What it says is that they are required to work not less than 18 hours per week.  This I take to mean at the time the decision is being taken that they might have been working only for 18 hours for the previous fortnight and other people who had been putting up 18 hours and more&mdash;25 and 30 hours&mdash;in previous years could be precipitately dropped for the purpose of exclusion from this net to 17 or 16 hours or some number less than that barrier.</P>
    <P>I know a particular case where I believe this has been done, or at least &mdash; let me put it at this moment more charitably&mdash;where there is a suspicion that it has been done, where there is a presumption that it may have been done.  I think that not alone is the five years too much but the 18 hours is too much.  It is too much in relation to the experience of third-level academic institutions I have got and in the sense that it can provide a mechanism whereby the authorities could say to Mr. So-and-So: &ldquo;Your work is, indeed, satisfactory; we have no quarrel with it, and we are not going to dismiss you, but simply because we do not have the need for your services and we are going to drop your number of hours of work below the threshold level,&rdquo; which would be the mechanism of denying the right of employment. The Minister may say that the board will be autonomous and may re-employ such a person if they so wish.  The question of whom the board employs is a question for the board themselves.  The board will decide in their own time and, I hope, objectively and without influence from any outside source.  At the same time people have a right to protection.  It is not their fault that the employment to which they had given a number of years of their lives&mdash;though in some instances less than five years&mdash;is being abolished by the institution in its present form.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider this question.  Perhaps some of his advisers can tell him the average hours worked by part-time teachers and what are the maximum hours and the <Col N="1050" /> minimum hours worked.  The Minister might be able to give us an estimate of the hours worked by the 29 or 30 people in this category.  The Minister might tell us how many of them are working more or less than 18 hours.  I recognise that it may not be possible to produce that information quickly. but this information would help us in trying to assess the wisdom or otherwise of the situation.  I am suggesting that the period of 18 hours is too long. I suggested a period of eight hours per week in my amendment.  Part-time teachers are often people who want to do creative work on their own but find it impossible to make a living while doing so.  They opt to teach a few days a week in order to live and they use the money so earned to subsidise themselves to practise their own creative work.  They would be people who would be extremely valuable members of the staff of the college.  A person carrying on his own creative work would be more valuable than somebody who opts to work the maximum hours and does not do creative work at all.  Some of the people opting to work the shortest number of hours might be the most valuable people and might have established the best right to be employed by the new institution.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister did not see fit to alter the period of five years. My suggestion of one year was perhaps too small but it is possible for people, if they wish to meet each other, to compromise.  The Minister may have cogent arguments for suggesting more than the eight hours I have recommended.  Perhaps eight hours is too short, but it is my conviction that 18 hours is too much.  The object of my amendment is to reduce that amount.</P>

      <P>I do not see much difference in the arguments which I can put forward in relation to this and the ones which I put forward in regard to Deputy FitzGerald's previous amendments. <Col N="1051" /> As I said, I felt that I had an obligation towards a certain number of people but this board who are now being appointed are an autonomous board.  I wanted to restrict their scope of action as little as possible as I felt that the number of teachers I took in under the sections of the Bill was the limit to which I ought to go and that I should leave it to the discretion of the board to appoint the remaining teachers.  It will be a matter for this board which has already been mentioned as consisting of two students and two teachers as well as other independent members, to decide on the teachers they will appoint apart from those that I have already determined should remain in the college.  As I said, I have the same argument in regard to this amendment as I had in regard to the other one, that I feel I should not be too restrictive and that I should leave it to the board to make the appointments of the teachers apart from those to whom I felt I had a particular obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said rather the same thing that he said earlier but which he did not say very much earlier.  Essentially, he said he has responsibility towards some of these people but he does not want to restrict the board too much.  This section is concerned with people who are not permanent.  The position of the permanent staff is simpler.  If one has ever been a permanent civil servant one enjoys some certain well understood rights, some legally established, some not.  This is a case of, I think, five or six people.  The second sector of people whose jobs will be abolished when the College of Art goes out of existence are the part-time teachers who are more numerous, five or six times as many.  There are two extreme positions and I do not think any of us would take up either position.  I am not suggesting that all of them have the right &mdash;those taken on a few months ago, for instance, if there were any&mdash;to be taken in automatically: I do not think the Minister suggests that none of them has the right.  I mentioned what I consider is a very bad principle but one which many institutions have operated. I do not know the current situation in <Col N="1052" /> UCD but I remember a time when UCD was grossly lobsided in the direction of college lecturers and the whole place was being run on college lecturers rather than by people who had a real stake in the place.  I think that was very bad.  The running of the College of Art with a very small number of permanent people and a large number of temporary or part-time people is also a bad principle.  I gave one particular instance to indicate that although they may, in law and in their formal relationship with the college, be part-time people they are, nonetheless, people first of considerable excellence and, secondly, people who have been doing the job in a distinguished way for a long time.</P>
      <P>We are really concerned with saying: &ldquo;Not everybody has the right to the job and not everybody should be excluded.&rdquo; Where do you draw the line leaving some people with the right to go on and leaving some people outside? The Minister has chosen to draw it at five years and 18 hours.  I suggest both are too much.  I have not heard any arguments from him as to why the period should be so long.  Both in years and in hours the figures seem too high.  Look at it this way: the pool of possible art teachers in Ireland is quite small and it is obviously necessary that the various trends and attitudes in the art world should be represented on the staff.  I do not want to discuss these attitudes or trends now and I do not know that I would be competent to do so; it is a very rapidly shifting scene. But I think it would be impossible to have a balanced school without having people representative of all trends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the long run one wishes it well. It may be that the appointments after it has been established will cover this aspect but will the Minister see his way to reduce the qualifications?  He simply set a couple of limits, one in years, the other in hours.  A case can be made that both are rather high.  He has proved utterly immovable in regard to the number of years.  I do not mean this abusively but I cannot see, without any arguments, if you take on responsibility to somebody over a period of five years that you do not take on a comparable sort of responsibility over three years.  Either the person is (a) <Col N="1053" /> good enough to appoint and (b) good enough to confirm and you then have a responsibility to him, or else he should be thrown out quickly and not left in agony.  Once you retain people long enough to indicate confidence in them you have a responsibility to them and that is a much shorter time.  I should be interested to know if the Minister is disposed to &ldquo;give&rdquo; at all in this matter on either point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will probably appreciate that by accepting his amendment we would again extend the scope of those who would be guaranteed further employment by the board, though not very significantly. The question could then be asked: why should one stop at that particular figure for those particular teachers? You would still be excluding a significant number of part-time teachers. You are then in a situation that no matter what proposal you introduce you will exclude a certain number unless you go the whole way and say that all of them, whatever the periods, should be employed.</P>

I do not suggest the Deputy was arguing either extreme position but the further it is extended the more you confirm the fact or demonstrate that there are others who are excluded from the extension.  One must therefore reach what would appear to be reasonable figures in regard to working hours in a week and reasonable length of service during which those working hours operated. It is only on that basis that the 18 hours per week would appear to be reasonable.  It may not be the norm but on a broad basis it appears to be reasonable.  The five years figure was selected also as being reasonable.  Those who have served five years would be guaranteed employment but others <Col N="1054" /> would in fact be eligible for re-employment. These are not the only hours that could have been fixed, nor is five the only period of years that might be determined, but had the hours been 15 and the years four we would be open to the suggestion that it should be 12 hours for three years.  It seems reasonable in the interests of the staff who have been there to introduce this proposal to guarantee them employment and to give the reasonable assurance that the board will be satisfied&mdash;one cannot anticipate that&mdash;to re-employ the others, if necessary, on a permanent basis.  I suppose one can never give a conclusive answer such as the Deputy requires but those are some of the reasons.</P>

      <P>I shall try one further argument, or at least reiterate one that I have not heard answered.  There is the point of view that &ldquo;those who can, do and those who cannot, teach&rdquo;. If you turn that around the other way I should say that in an art school the people you want as teachers are those that you know are good at doing.  They are good creative workers who are evolving and devoting a fair amount of their time to their own creative work and are much better than those who have given up and who have said: &ldquo;I have had a bash at it; it is not in me.  I shall settle down and teach.&rdquo;  The first type of people are much more useful if you want creativity.  If that is so, the more desirable person is the person you want to conciliate and you should do everything possible to get him into the college. This is the person who devotes a very significant part of the time to his own work but is prepared, either, for economic reasons or love of teaching, to teach.  There are people who have the gift themselves and have a great desire to pass it on to those coming after them and to whom they can give their skill.  If you make the qualification of 18 hours a week, that seems a bit high for them and in that way you would tend to get those who just want to be teachers.  The people you really want will say: &ldquo;Perhaps eight or ten hours a week but 18 is too much.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I was discussing the question of flexibility in the deserted wives allowance scheme. When the Bill was introduced we were assured that there would be flexibility and that the scheme would not be operated rigidly.  We were assured that <Col N="1057" /> every case would be considered sympathetically and that regard would be had to the circumstances of each case.  We were told that the Minister realised that many of these cases were of a delicate nature.</P>
      <P>Recently a woman came to me and told me she had gone through a marriage ceremony in a registry office. She had three children.  When she followed her husband to Africa she found that he had already been married so she returned home.  I thought she should qualify for a deserted wives allowance but she was told she did not qualify because, in the view of the Department, she is not married even though she went through a form of marriage.  Such cases do not occur every day of the week.  The Department will not be inundated with women who were married bigamously and who are deserted.  They will not be an excessive charge on the Exchequer.  Cases like this are really deserving of help.  She should be regarded by the Department as a deserted wife and she should be granted an allowance for herself and her three children.  It was enough of a shock for her to find herself in that predicament.  We should be a little more humane and sympathetic towards a person in that situation.  The Department should have said they knew this case did not come within the framework of their scheme.  I appeal to the Minister again to give sympathetic consideration to this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the question of insured employees&mdash;and this is happening especially nowadays with redundancies and with small firms closing down&mdash;who find that their insurance cards are not stamped.  In many cases they find that their employers have not stamped their cards for years.  This is deplorable.  The system in the Department is wrong.  It is not working properly if an employer can escape the notice of the Department and not stamp cards for two or three years.  It should be very simple for the Department to ascertain if an employer is obeying the rules and stamping cards. An employee takes an employer on trust and in good faith and pays his share of the contribution and it should be possible for the Department to <Col N="1058" /> guarantee to the employee that the employer will pay his contribution.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Department to say to an employee: &ldquo;That is your tough luck.  You had better sue your employer.  If it goes on for a few years and you are not successful, we will then consider sueing him on your behalf&rdquo;.  That is the system which prevails at present.  It is most unjust.  There is laxity in the Department.  I often find that the inspectors investigating these cases are inclined to be a little lax too.  I find that when employees go to the Department, the Department are not very sympathetic and not very helpful in cases like that.  The Minister says he will be bringing in legislation but we have been asking him about this legislation for a long time.  It is now overdue.  During this session the Minister should bring in legislation as quickly as possible to protect the worker.  It is not good enough for a man to find that when he is unemployed he has to depend on unemployment assistance or home assistance.</P>

      <P>I should also like to bring to the attention of the Minister and his Department the long delays in the case of returned emigrants who must sign on at the employment exchange while they are waiting to get employment They have to wait for weeks and weeks while the Department check with their opposite number in England to verify their insurance number. This is time-consuming.  In the meantime a man and his family must live on home assistance.  The Department say that he signs on for 12 days, but in practice this does not happen. I phoned the Department about this and I was told that he signs on for 12 days and then he will be paid.  I know a man who has been home since 6th September.  This is now the 3rd November and he has not been paid yet.  Some forms get lost or something happens and one section say it is the <Col N="1059" /> fault of another.  The system is wrong which allows delays like this in checking these facts.  It should be possible for the Department to send the printed form to Britain and there should be no need for this excessive delay in the payment of unemployment benefit which a man has earned and paid for in Britain.  The reciprocal arrangement should operate much more quickly and satisfactorily in the case of workers who return from Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, we are always hearing about the delays in Britain but I find when I write to the Department over there that I get a prompt reply.  It is easy to say that the delay is in Britain.  I find that they are very prompt.  I had a case last week and I was surprised to get a reply back in two days.  They had investigated the lot for me.  We are not able to do it here as efficiently and they have a lot more to deal with.</P>
      <P>These are people who are in need. They are the people who are least capable of articulating their grievances and explaining their cases and this is where we should have a really efficient Department geared to helping them and ensuring that they get their assistance promptly.  These are people who do not have savings.  They cannot call on reserves in the bank to tide them over days or weeks while they are waiting on replies from the Department. These are people who are on the poverty line.  It would be all right if we were dealing with people who had bonds or shares and who were not in urgent need of money.  It is very hard to see a family hungry at the week-end because a cheque does not arrive.  You ring up the Department at ten to five on Friday and get an engaged tone.  It is very hard to tell a fellow: &ldquo;They are off until Monday and we will have to wait until Monday to investigate your case&rdquo;.  Cheques should be sent out in ample time especially when people are waiting on the money for the weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1060" /> I brought up the question of pension books at a health board meeting. I wonder have the Department looked into this question.  A person's pension book is his property.  I wonder why the Department have not taken action in cases where the local authority or the local health board demand the pension books in respect of people who are receiving medical or surgical treatment in some of our local authority hospitals.  I am speaking of people in receipt of old age pensions who are holders of medical cards.  They are admitted to a local authority hospital for treatment.  The ruling is that after four weeks the hospital demands the pension book despite the fact that the medical card provides for medical and surgical treatment and maintenance while they are in hospital.  I do not think a local authority hospital has the right to demand the pension book. This has been happening too often. Could a local authority have the right to take a person's pension book?  This is illegal.  I wonder why the Department have not taken action in all these years on this matter.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would look into it.  I have been successful in the Eastern Health Board in having a resolution passed saying that this must not be done.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary does not need individual names and addresses.  If I were to start going through my files I would provide him with too many.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is where the illegal act comes in.  It will not happen in the Eastern Health Board any more but I should like to see that extended to the whole country and ensure that pension books are not taken from these poor people.  It is discrimination against these people.  If you are 64 you do not have to bother, you can have your social welfare benefit because your medical card provides the treatment but if you are 65 your pension book is taken.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will look into this immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I brought a particular case to the <Col N="1062" /> attention of the Minister for Social Welfare not so long ago.  It is the case of a person in receipt of an income of £2.6 a week from investments left by her husband.  As a result she cannot have a non-contributory widow's pension because by virtue of some Act of 1908, I understand Lloyd George was associated with it, she is considered to be in receipt of 10 per cent interest when, in fact, she is only in receipt of 5 per cent interest on the stocks.  This is an anomalous situation.  The only answer which the appeals board of the Department of Social Welfare had was that she get the stock out, reduce her income and then they would give her a pension.  She got her room decorated and as a result she got 25p a week pension.  This is an unjust law.  I should like to see an amendment to this Act passed rapidly in order to help people such as this.  The head of the old age and widows pensions section in Mountjoy Square will explain to the Parliamentary Secretary the anomalous situation which exists.</P>
    <P>Widows in receipt of pensions to which their husbands contributed through social welfare contributions before their death find if they go out to work that they have to pay full stamps but when they are ill they only collect half the social welfare benefit.  For the past six years I have asked successive Ministers for Social Welfare to bring in amending legislation to stop this discrimination against widows by the Social Welfare Act, 1932.  I do not think it would take up much of the House's time to bring in such amending legislation because I doubt if anyone would criticise the Minister for bringing it in.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of medical certificates and national health certificates which pose a big problem for every doctor.  If we were to have a fresh look at the problem of certificates we might well save the country thousands of pounds every year.  Employers insist on a medical certificate which is followed by a national health certificate.  It would be a good idea if the Department of Social Welfare, Department of Health and the medical profession were to study the problem of medical certificates and national <Col N="1063" /> health certificates because as well as saving a great deal of money we might reduce absenteeism.</P>
    <P>I want to mention another case of social injustice.  I come up against such cases every day of the week.  There are some people in institutions in this country who are destitute and depend for bare essentials on the charity of neighbours and friends.  One case of which I am aware is a woman in a Cheshire Home who is completely disabled; she is a deserted wife and gets nothing because she is so disabled that she cannot have even one child with her.  She does not have a penny in this world and there is not one scheme which will give her even one penny per week.  She does not get the deserted wives allowance because she has no children under her care; she cannot get home assistance because she is being maintained in the Cheshire Home and she cannot get a disabled benefit because no one can trace her husband's insurance.  This woman of 32 is dependent on the charity of people in the hospital for a bottle of lemonade.</P>
    <P>It galls me to hear the Minister talk about people obtaining money by fraud.  The Minister says that we have to make sure people do not obtain money by fraud.  What is wrong with the Department of Social Welfare is that there are too many people employed checking up on people and not enough people looking after the genuine cases.  The Government are penny pinching.  Too many people are engaged in checking to see if anyone is drawing a penny to which he is not entitled.  The Department of Social Welfare are negative in their thinking. They are not thinking how they can help people.  They are thinking how they can deprive people of their small benefit or allowance.  I want to see a change in government so that the Department of Social Welfare can have a new Minister and can become a dynamic Department with a breath of fresh air running through it.  We want a humane approach towards people.  I do not think it is a matter for the Parliamentary Secretary to smile about.  It is a bad state of affairs when <Col N="1064" /> a young crippled girl cannot get one penny.  The social welfare code should have provisions to help people like her.</P>

      <P>Every time there is an increase in social welfare benefits the burden of that increase falls on the insured workers.  I should like to know what percentage is obtained by way of increases in social welfare contributions. The one group which pays all the time are the insured workers. Perhaps the Minister might be able to give us an indication of the percentage provided by them by way of increased contribution.</P>
      <P>The ceiling at the moment is £1,600. We should have a comprehensive social welfare scheme to which everybody would contribute.  That would be the ideal solution.  If certain people did not want to avail of the services provided that would be their look-out. They should be at liberty to reject the services, but they should be compelled to pay for them.  In that way we could get the revenue necessary to put our social services on a par with those in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Has any study been carried out into this?  It is possible that we will have a situation in which we will have to provide for our people in the North and I should like to see one section of the Department of Social Welfare geared to working out a scheme embracing both North and South and finding out what the cost would be.  We do not want a wild guess by the Minister like the one he made yesterday.  Deputy FitzGerald very rightly told the Minister he had not got a clue.  The Department of Social Welfare should be examining this so that those in the North will be able to tell themselves they will not lose out if they unite with the people in the South.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been reading the Minister's introductory speech and thinking over social welfare for the past number of years.  Despite what Deputy O'Connell says, the Estimate for this year is £11 million over and above what <Col N="1066" /> it was last year.  The total Estimate is £75½ million as compared with £64 million-odd last year.  One can very easily, in the light of those figures, contradict those who argue that we are not dispensing a reasonable share of the national cake to the social welfare classes.  I have heard similar statements made here.  If we look at the Minister's brief, we shall see that not merely has spending increased under the heading of social welfare but that a number of new schemes have been implemented in extension of the social welfare range of payments.  Together with that, we have a number of extended services and we hope that a number of those services will tie up with voluntary arrangements later on.</P>
      <P>As I said, it is very easy to come into this House and talk big.  I have listened to a range of what I might call big talk.  When one has not to levy the taxation, when one has not to increase the contributions payable by those who pay insurance, it is easy to talk and to say that we should have more.  I am not satisfied with our range of social welfare services, far from it.  I should like to see much more accomplished, but we will not be able to accomplish a better social welfare system by condemning the system we have.  I have time and again in this House heard speakers indulging in what one would call over-kill in the sense of the services not merely, in relation to the Department of Social Welfare but also in relation to the Department of Health.  I have heard cases quoted here now and again and, strangely enough, on a number of occasions on which one asked for the facts in support of those cases, one found it hard enough to discover the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say at the outset that Deputy O'Connell may be interested in social welfare and so am I, not merely as a Deputy for my constituency but outside it.  I happen to know something about the system because I have been working and living with it for quite a while.  We all object to means tests because a means test is a barrier on the road towards social welfare, but, unfortunately, we have not been able to increase the size of our national cake <Col N="1067" /> to such an extent, for example, that we would be able to wipe out the means test, especially in relation to non-contributory schemes.  Every year here for at least the past ten years in every Budget we have devoted a share of the Budget to the recipients of social welfare, and especially recipients in the non-contributory branch of the scheme. I think that it is a bit too thick to say at this stage that we have not the compassion or humanity to care about the sick, the old and the widow and orphan.</P>
    <P>I want to refute straight away the suggestions of Deputy O'Connell that there is gross neglect in regard to this matter in our Department of Social Welfare.  I am not going to sing the praises of the Department.  I have my differences with the Department, but I have never found yet in any section of it a reluctance, a harshness or a refusal to recognise the basic facts of life here, and this applies more particularly in the case of non-contributory benefits.  I could go further and say in relation to the non-contributory old age pensioners that if the means test were rigidly enforced there, we could pay a much higher pension.</P>
    <P>When on this point, I should like also to make the point that a few years ago&mdash;I have not got the date by me, as I have not had too much time to look up the Book of Estimates, or the book for the year before, but I recall that we implemented a supplementary old age pension scheme for non-contributory pensioners living alone, and if I remember aright, we named in the scheme seven people as being eligible to participate in the scheme as representing caring for the pensioner. The point I am trying to come at is that we must take this in the context of care of the aged, and care of the aged happens to be at the present time, and I think will continue to be and should continue to be, more a local matter than a matter for the administration at the top, although I quite recognise that the administration at the top have a lively interest in this subject.  If this scheme of the care of the aged is to be carried out as it should be and if we are to take an interest <Col N="1068" /> in the aged, we must not merely have more money but we must have voluntary help as well because I do not know of any system which will work as well as where a community is willing to give a little help in a voluntary way to this group.  We have many people today marching in protest; we have placard bearers at every corner.  I would say to these placard bearers to go back to their respective areas, to look around them and to join up with their neighbours in trying to do something, if nothing else, under the scheme of the care of the aged.  If they devoted as much time to giving a little voluntary help to this scheme, we would not hear as much criticism of the men who are trying to promote it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I did not refer to them but I was coming to the point by degrees.  I quite agree with Deputy Barry that in a number of areas the scheme has worked well, and, as Deputy Barry reminded me, we should extend our gratitude from this House when speaking on this Estimate to the people who have sacrificed time and money and who have given freely of their time to help promote this worthy scheme.  There are many other matters connected with social welfare which I would like to mention.  A few years ago I helped to initiate a resolution at a political convention advocating that deserted wives should be included under some scheme.  This was fully discussed at the time.  The arguments about this were well put by people of considerable experience. Subsequently the Minister accepted the idea and later extended the allowance to deserted wives.  We feel grateful to the Minister for this attitude.  This is a sad subject to speak of but there are women who have been deserted and we should all feel obliged to do what we can to relieve their suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> There are a number among us who would like to see the supplementary pension scheme extended to cover those who are being cared for by families. There will be another occasion to discuss this subject.  In dealing with the non-contributory schemes such as social assistance, as apart from social insurance, I must say that this Vote has increased in amount considerably. The Minister mentioned that a survey is being carried out into the payment of home assistance to try to evolve a better system for its administration and to ensure that home assistance may not be rigidly tied to the local authority. We are all aware that the administration of home assistance is a difficult task.  I have always admired the men working in this field.  They have sometimes to inquire into delicate matters and those of them whom I know have succeeded in administering the scheme in a very humane way.  When assistance is applied for it is a time of emergency in a family and the result may depend on the outcome of some other claim. When a person or a family has to resort to a home assistance claim then those administering the scheme must know the person, the area and the background and also the social conditions of the family as well.  I invariably find that the men working in the administration of home assistance provide an excellent service.</P>
    <P>I, for one, would be grateful if the Minister would make available to the House some idea of what he proposes to do in changing this scheme.  I said at the outset that the cost had risen and that the amount of the Vote had risen for both social assistance and social insurance.  According to the Minister expenditure last year was £128 million.  This year it is £134 million.  That may not be enough.  I do not believe it is enough but I am not able to point to any area where we could get more money either by taxation or the levelling of increased contributions.  The figure of £134 million is a large slice of our budget. We hope that our budget will grow and that that figure will increase also. In the meantime the means test must remain in non-contributory schemes and in schemes of national assistance. <Col N="1070" /> This is one of the aspects of the whole scheme which gives us considerable trouble.  Some time last spring a parliamentary question was asked about the cost of administering the means test.  My recollection is that the figure was £175,000 but that figure may not be accurate. The cost of abolishing the means test for non-contributory old age pensioners, and the cost of payment in full to everybody applying for a pension at the age of 70 was given and I think it worked out at something like £22 million or £23 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of correction: the Deputy is estimating and I am also estimating but my figure is much less for the cost of administration and giving this money, abolishing the means test for the old age pension. Would the Parliamentary Secretary have that figure?  In my opinion it is less than half what Deputy Carter said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am sorry about that.  That referred to the non-contributory means test old age pensions.  I was referring to the marginal aids provided for pensioners such as a percentage for light, radio and TV licences and free travel.  All this ties in with the general aim of making the lot of the upper age group a little better and even the smallest step in this direction is welcomed by the whole community but the community is not always aware <Col N="1071" /> that if old age pensions were increased by only 50p a week, which is not very much nowadays, the cost would be enormous in the Vote.  The final figures always impress me when I realise that this money must be provided by taxation and other means.</P>
      <P>I would regret that anybody should be destitute, poor or sick and not helped.  I think there is no Deputy who would not go a long way&mdash;and I know most of them&mdash;to help anybody in such circumstances.  Sometimes Deputies indulge in dramatics in this regard.  Here and there, there are difficult cases and one must have considerable experience and knowledge to even attempt to work out a solution.  We have certain do-it-yourself merchants, some attached to newspapers, concerning themselves with social welfare&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>They are bad enough but the do-it-yourself man is worse because he helps to sell his paper by publicising the results of his efforts which results he sometimes inflates enormously.  One finds it hard to swallow the arguments advanced.  The TDs work quietly and do not publicise their efforts to help those in the social welfare class.</P>
      <P>The level of income for participation in the contributory scheme was raised from £1.200 to £1,600 and it has been suggested that the limit should be put higher.  This limit applies also in regard to health and local government services. People are apt to forget that the limit does not merely relate to social welfare but relates to other Departments also.  It might be thought that raising the qualification limit would not cost very much but the cost is greatly increased when the limit is applied over the range of other Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another very desirable trend in social schemes in the past year or so is the move to pay retirement pensions. I know that a number of those receiving contributory pensions welcomed this move and especially in the country they welcomed it from many points of view. They welcomed it in the first instance because they have not <Col N="1072" /> got to report and to sign documents as they had to do when they were drawing benefit.  To this extent the pension in lieu of the social benefit is a much better proposition.  There are some qualifications but I have not come across any reluctance on the part of anyone in the section to trace and locate any case and to give it the full benefit of the doubt.  The death scheme is also an excellent scheme and one to which we should all subscribe.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to the question of cheating.  It has been said that under some of our schemes some claimants are inclined to cheat.  Unfortunately, this occurs in our range of schemes.  Advantage is taken of the various sections of the various Acts to cover up this cheating.  While the administration are aware of this and do everything possible to provide against it, it still happens.  Those who are cheating have no regard for the fact that they may be depriving some genuine claimants of social assistance, or national assistance, or insurance. They cannot very well deprive them of insurance but they can rob the insurance fund.  It would be a pity if the idea went abroad that the insurance fund could be raided with impunity. We would all like to see a good national assistance scheme and a good social insurance scheme, but this cannot be achieved without the co-operation of those people who are deemed to be claimants under such schemes.  Making appeals to them will not deter people who misrepresent the position and who attempt to draw money to which they are not entitled.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to monopolise the debate.  I hope that the various schemes will continue to be supplemented from the Exchequer.  I also hope that we will be in a position to increase the allocations under those schemes and that a good system of voluntary health will be available to back them up and that we will make the lot of the sick and the old as comfortable as each one of us would like to be at the end of our lives.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Brennan, has a very poor record so far as social <Col N="1073" /> welfare benefits are concerned.  In my constituency of East Mayo, and in all the congested areas in the western region, there is very little confidence in him.  I am not surprised at that because of the action he took last April in taking the dole from rural dwellers. It was not a very generous benefit at any time, but it was a benefit that should have been paid to those people. It should have been more generous. When the Government found themselves in difficulty for money the Minister was told, no doubt, by the Minister for Finance, that there was to be a credit squeeze, that money was tight, and that things were not going too well and the first people he attacked were the people who were in receipt of unemployment assistance, people who went over to England down through the years to try to supplement their meagre incomes with their earnings in the hayfields in England, perhaps, or in the potato fields in Scotland which we have heard so much about in recent times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>That was scandalous when we think of the hardship and the difficulties under which these people laboured in the past, not just the present generation but generations in the past.  It was the fate of the males of the families, the breadwinners, to have to leave their homes and their families and go across the water for seasonal work.  Some of them went permanently. The Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Geoghegan, and I come from congested areas.  We have lived among our people all our lives. We have seen their hardship and difficulties. We have witnessed the weeping and the mourning of the breadwinner who had to take the train, bus or taxi to Dublin and cross to England on the boat.  On many of these occasions the cost had to be borrowed.  The little bit of dole was a great help in keeping them on their little holdings.  The dole scheme had the blessing of their lordships, the bishops&mdash;Catholic, Protestant and Methodist&mdash;particularly, I think, the blessing and approval of the Catholic bishops.  Of that I am sure because they made it known at meetings <Col N="1074" /> in my home town of Foxford, at meetings of the &ldquo;Defence of the West&rdquo; group at Charlestown and other centres, that those benefits should be continued in the hope that it would be possible for those families to eke out an existence from their smallholdings on the mountainside.  It certainly came as a shock to me that the gentleman responsible for moving along those lines in a Fianna Fáil Government was a man who himself came from a congested area, as did his Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>However, due to the action of the Fine Gael Party at the time, supported strongly by the Labour Party, and the publicity given to it and the criticism of such a dishonest and mean action on the part of the Minister and his Government, the Fianna Fáil Party had second thoughts.  They continued payment of the benefit to the urban dwellers but excluded the rural dwellers with smallholdings.</P>
      <P>We in this House are very fond of paying lip service to the people in these regions who have held on to the Gaelic tongue and to their culture, who have been in the front line of trenches in every good fight.  It was from these regions that the real Irish came.  That fact is well known to city dwellers and country dwellers alike.  It should also be borne in mind that millions of pounds of the earnings of these people who emigrated came across from England, from America, from Australia.  As one who engaged in business with these people and who dealt with them in many lines, I am well aware of the amount of money that came in to supplement the meagre incomes from smallholdings.  Millions of pounds have come into this country from them.  Nobody knows the exact figure.  They sent money home to help to build schools, churches, roads and many other things.  If we travel on the roads of Ireland today, we see the fruits of their labours.  Let nobody tell me that it was an Irish Government that achieved these wonderful things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The census of population figures were released some time ago and the figures in relation to the West of Ireland and to Mayo in particular proved the point that due to economic <Col N="1075" /> stress and the hardships with which these people were confronted the population decline has gone on.  It is certainly no credit to an Irish Minister for Social Welfare, his Parliamentary Secretary or anybody connected with him that these people should be the first to have their meagre allowances taken away.  It was disgraceful.  This Government will never be forgiven for it.  I know well that in my constituency and in the province of Connacht and in all the congested areas they will forever hold it against the Minister and Government who struck that hard and deadly blow.</P>
    <P>However, on second thoughts they gave way a little and continued payment to certain classes of people in urban areas.  They fail to realise that they have driven many more families out of this country by stopping the benefits.  They created a panic situation. The people became worried and despondent and the rumour went out that all these benefits would be stopped. Many people have gone to England to try to get employment and we know that the employment position there at present is far from healthy.  There are already roughly one million people unemployed in England and it has been the tradition of our people to go there and for many of them to take jobs as labourers.  These people were insured in England and paid their contributions to the social welfare department in England.  Some of them have broken down in health and understandably so because they went to England to work all the hours that God sent.  Many of them engaged in piecework on the potato fields, the hay and harvest fields, at beet and other work.  They were not 40-hour a week people.  The people of this city should take an occasional look at the boat train that goes out to Dún Laoghaire or the one that goes down to the North Wall for Liverpool. Hundreds of thousands of people leave this country every year.  They pay their insurance contributions and they contribute to other schemes while working in England and when they come home they think they will be able to live on the social welfare benefits payable to them from the British Government through a reciprocal arrangement <Col N="1076" /> entered into between the two countries some years ago.  I do not want to exaggerate the situation but many people who return from England after 10, 15 or 20 years over there find they can get benefits of only, 10 or 12 shillings a week despite the fact that they have paid hundreds of pounds by way of contributions in the belief that they will get benefits when the time comes.</P>
    <P>Members of the medical profession have contacted me in connection with people's claims for social welfare benefits.  I have taken these cases up with the Department only to get the usual stereotype letter that the matter is receiving attention.  Most of these people sent home money when they were in England which means that they return with very little money and within a short time they are penniless. I cannot understand why the Minister for Social Welfare does not insist on these payments being made to genuine applicants because they have made contributions and these payments are their right.  What would we have done if neither England nor America were there to absorb our labour forces?  It is up to the Department of Social Welfare to insist that the benefits due to these people are paid forthwith and if necessary a Minister should go to England to sort out the technicalities. I know of at least half a dozen cases in the area where I live which fall into the category to which I have been referring during the past few minutes. The money which these people sent home paid the rents, rates and taxes and kept the family in comfort.  It is scandalous the way these people are treated once they retire to their homeland. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to convey to his Minister strong criticism for the scandalous way he has treated these people.</P>

It is hard for the Parliamentary Secretary to take it when I charge his Minister with trying to deprive these people of their few shillings dole.  He knows very well that it was the lot of most of those people to have to go across to England to get employment and even so they stood by their language, traditions and music.  The Parliamentary Secretary's neighbours are well aware of the way this Government have treated them. One of the reasons why they were and are now afraid to face the people is that they have driven the country into such a mess that they are not able to pay social welfare benefits.  They have made it impossible for these people to live here.  They have had to shut up their homes and are now tramping the streets of London, Birmingham, Manchester and other cities in Britain.</P>
