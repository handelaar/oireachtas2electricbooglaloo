    <P>Rising costs and twelfth round salary increases are in the main responsible for the additional requirements of the training colleges.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the twelfth round salary award, the increase of £60 in the maxima of the common scales and the long service increment of £75 are the principal reasons for the increased provision required for teachers' salaries.</P>
    <P>The increased provision for the special educational project is due mainly to the clearing off of payments for building work which had not been completed in the previous year as originally planned.  There are also additional costs related to salary increases, <Col N="1701" /> heating and cleaning and pupil assessment.</P>
    <P>The effect on pensions and gratuities of the increases in salaries which I have already referred to is, in the main, responsible for the increased provision for superannuation.  As well as this the average percentage increase on which the estimated cost of the general pensions increase from 1st August, 1970 was based was too low.  In addition the number of <i>ex-gratia</i> or non-contributory widows is very much higher than was visualised at the time the original Estimate was framed.</P>
    <P>The deficit in Appropriations-in-Aid is due to the fact that the contributions to the teachers', widows' and children's pensions scheme is less than expected.</P>
    <P>Under Vote 29 there are two items requiring additional expenditure: teachers' salaries, £650,000; examinations, £35,000.  The implementation of the twelfth round salary award and the increase of £60 in the maxima of the common scales are the main reasons for the increased provision required for teachers' salaries.  The additional requirement for examinations is due to an increase in the rates of remuneration for superintendents and examiners.</P>
    <P>The total of £685,000 is offset to the extent of £275,000 by savings on other subheads leaving a net additional sum of £410,000 now required.</P>
    <P>As regards Vote 30 the Supplementary Estimate is required to provide funds for vocational education committees to enable them to meet the cost of the twelfth round to vocational teachers and other officers of the committees and also to pay for the increase of £60 in the maxima of the common basic scales.</P>
    <P>In the case of Vote 32 a net additional amount of £677,500 is being provided for the universities and colleges. These additional grants are in respect of both current and capital expenditure. The additional amount for current expenditure is £707,500.  In the case of capital expenditure an additional amount of £190,000 on subheads C. 2 (University College, Cork) and G. 3 (National College of Physical Education) is more than offset by a saving of <Col N="1702" /> £220,000 on subhead D. 2 (University College, Galway).</P>
    <P>The additional current grants are being provided in the main to enable University College, Dublin, University College, Cork, University College, Galway, and Trinity College, Dublin, to meet the cost of twelfth round salary increases awarded to the staffs of the colleges with effect as from 1st April, 1970 and 1st January, 1971, and also to compensate the colleges for the cost of the limitation to £10 in certain faculties of the general increase of 25 per cent in university fees introduced with effect as from the beginning of the academic year 1970-71.  Provision is also included in respect of the cost of twelfth round salary increases for the staff of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies and the Dublin Dental Hospital.</P>
    <P>An additional capital grant of £100,000 is being provided for University College, Cork, to meet expenditure over and above the original provision of £400,000 arising in connection with the erection of the new science building.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be in a position to inform the Dáil that a site has been acquired for the new National College of Physical Education proposed to be established in Limerick.  The site consists of 51 acres and is adjacent to the Plassy site recently purchased for the Limerick Institute for Higher Education, so that in all some 124 acres will be available for the development of the institute and of the National College of Physical Education.  The site is located about 2½ miles to the east of the centre of Limerick City and lies approximately 400 yards off the main Dublin/Limerick Road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Among the features of the Supplementary Estimate which we all welcome is a new provision in respect of the College of Physical Education. The fact that we are being asked to provide money for this college is the first concrete sign of activity here.  We are delighted to see this development getting under way.  The Minister will recall I had occasion to raise in the House some time ago the problems that will arise in the interim <Col N="1703" /> period.  The Minister, very properly seeking to make provision for the training of males in physical education, has made financial provisions to enable them to be trained in Britain, but this has produced a situation where the girls are in fact at a disadvantage because they are not getting the same assistance.</P>
      <P>It does seem a pity to leapfrog in this way and while it was clearly necessary to make special provision for the men, made generously it must be said, pending the establishment of the college, it should be matched by an equal provision in the case of girls who should not be at a financial disadvantage during the interim period.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at this, because the costs involved would be short term and that kind of discrimination is adding fuel to certain flames which are already burning in various areas and it seems to me to be undesirable to add to them in this way.</P>
      <P>In regard to university grants I am not clear from what the Minister has said how much is in fact being provided to meet the cost of the twelfth round salary increases and how much is being provided to compensate for part of the cost of increased fees.  When the Minister is replying perhaps he will tell us the relative proportion involved in these two headings which appear to account for the great bulk of additional expenditure in respect of general grants for universities.</P>
      <P>I notice in the main Estimate for this year, and no doubt Deputy Thornley will raise the matter, that Trinity College got a very small increase in its general grant but it now gets a disproportionately large increase in this Supplementary Estimate.  The net effect of the two is to give Trinity College increases broadly in line with those of the other universities but I wonder what the reason was for not giving them their due in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are at a disadvantage in that the Supplementary Estimate contains all kinds of apparent anomalies which are always easily explained, but we do not get an explanation and a fuller presentation might be helpful.  Other Ministers have adopted the procedure of <Col N="1704" /> circulating fairly full statements accompanying their speeches rather than integrated into them.  We have it in Transport and Power and Agriculture and Fisheries and this enables the Minister to explain much detail which would be out of place in his speech but which the Dáil is entitled to have information about.  On previous occasions I have pressed the Minister to produce a White Paper on education generally which is long overdue and as another part of the process of information perhaps he would consider, when he comes to his main Estimate speech, preparing a full statement on the expenditure for the year ahead giving us the kind of details which I think we are entitled to but with which he would not want to clutter up his main speech.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, although I think I know the answer, what the position will be in the Book of Estimates as regards the universities. Am I right in taking it, as we have not yet established the Higher Education Authority, although we hope to do so in the very near future, that the presentation for the grants for universities this year will be in the traditional form and in the following year we will get the new presentation for the grant to the HEA?  As the legislation is not through yet it is inevitable it should take the old shape this year but we look forward to seeing the new presentation in the following Estimates showing us that the HEA is in full swing and doing its job.</P>
    <P>The big item in all these Estimates is teachers' salaries and none of us will begrudge these increases.  The Minister has had a difficult year trying to sort out the problem.  We are all glad it has proved possible to get to the stage we have got to, of at least avoiding a strike, but the Minister knows the problem is not totally solved.  It has been resolved for the time being but there remain difficulties to be ironed out and as we see from recent developments in the ASTI there remains a lingering sense of frustration which could be a source of danger to the settlement reached.  It is important that the procedures the Minister has been able to establish should get <Col N="1705" /> working and that channels for dealing with these frustrations should be created, channels which have become clogged up because of the dispute which has arisen and because of the circumstances giving rise to the dispute. The sooner channels of conciliation and arbitration acceptable to the different teaching bodies are being used, the sooner we shall reach the stage where we can breathe freely again without having another strike descending upon us from one or other of these three Olympian heights.</P>
    <P>The big problem here is the promotional problem.  I must say I am not clear as to where we have got to.  The last we heard from the Minister on this was the partially satisfactory statement that progress has been made with many of the religious orders in this matter but in certain sectors, some of the teaching brothers I think it was, agreement had not been reached with regard to the provision of adequate promotional outlets.  Can the Minister tell us if progress has since been made in this respect?  Clearly the lack of adequate promotional outlets in our educational system, particularly in the secondary sector, is one of the main problems and we are, indeed, now paying a rather high price for this because the frustration that has built up has given rise to disputes which have had to be settled fairly expensively, and which could have been settled more peacefully and, in some respects, less expensively if we had not had this problem and if normal promotional outlets had existed.  It is clear we have these difficulties which have to be resolved.</P>
    <P>This is a country in which religious orders have played an enormous role in education.  They will continue to do so in the years ahead.  Most people, certainly at this stage, want their children in secondary schools to be educated in the traditional way in schools which are run mainly by religious orders and the work of these orders will continue.  But its smooth continuance and the smooth relationship between Church and State, which we would all like to see, depends on a settlement being reached which will assure teachers of promotional outlets <Col N="1706" /> to which they are entitled.  I think there has been a great change in thinking on the part of the religious orders. There was a time when too many of them took the view that the schools were their schools; they should manage and control them, hold the principalships and vice-principalships, and the lay teachers were simply there to serve. That attitude has diminished and there has been a growing recognition on the part of the religious orders that this is unwise and undesirable in the main and liable to lead to a very unsatisfactory situation.  The Minister has the job of ensuring that this recognition becomes widespread and I should like to hear from him what progress there has been and, in precise terms, what has been agreed.  We are, I think, entitled to more than vague assurances that goodwill has been shown.  What agreement has been reached and with whom?  With whom has it not been reached?  Is there still some area where there is an obstacle and where the possibility of teachers getting promotion to the highest level is not open to them?  What does the Minister think can be done to ensure that the goodwill being shown by so many of the religious orders in this respect will be shown by all of them?  We are, I think, entitled to hear about this because this is a matter which is liable to give rise to difficulties in the period ahead if it is not adequately settled.</P>
    <P>I want now to come to subhead A. 1 relating to training colleges.  In September, 1970, the Higher Education Authority produced its report on teacher education.  This report is unsatisfactory. I am sorry to say this because I had hoped the authority would make a breakthrough in this area.  What I find unsatisfactory is not only that I disagree with the conclusion which is a familiar position in which I find myself in regard to many reports, but the conclusion is at variance with the premises.  In section 2 of the report there is an extensive quotation from the findings of a group of educationalists in various countries, a group set up by a committee of the Council of Europe for higher education and research; the findings of this group are quoted in a footnote, as if they were accepted and formed the basis of the Higher Education <Col N="1707" /> Authority's recommendations, but their recommendations actually fly in the face of the views of the Council of Europe in this respect.  The very last clause in these findings, clause (d), is as follows:</P>
    <P>Whereas some universities may be organised with a special accent on teacher training and educational research, isolated educational universities are not recommended because they would run the risk of becoming cut off from developments in other fields of scholarship, research and professional training.</P>
    <P>These are wise words and we should heed them.  The Higher Education Authority, having recorded these words, did not heed them and has in fact proposed to cut off the training college in a separate sector, producing teachers who would have a special degree, BEDSc, Bachelor of Educational Science, on a three-year course, which would include practical training in teaching.</P>
    <P>This proposal has a number of disadvantages. The first is pointed out by the Council: such bodies would be cut off from developments in other fields of scholarship, research and professional training.  This is not giving to teachers a university education.  It is elevating somewhat the existing training colleges and extending the length of the course.  The students will still be cut off in separate institutions, segregated from secondary teachers and the great body of vocational teachers doing university studies with a view to acquiring a Higher Diploma in Education for the purpose of teaching in these areas. The report talks about this as bringing the aim of a unified teaching profession a step nearer.  Here, we are at a stage at which the Minister has been for two years battling to secure a unified teaching profession, has met with great difficulties in this, has overcome them for the time being, at least, and all the Higher Education Authority can offer is something that will bring us a step nearer something we had thought the Minister was in process of procuring.  If you continue to hive off primary teachers and keep them in separate institutions, segregating them <Col N="1708" /> there and giving them a three-year course, with practical training, whereas secondary teachers will have three years at university, followed by a year of practice, to talk about a unified profession is just nonsense.  It will not be unified and you cannot expect vocational and secondary teachers to accept that it is a unified profession.  We have been fighting to get that.  Why undermine the whole situation now by making a change so inadequate as to highlight the continued divergence between their system of training and education and that of other teachers?</P>
    <P>This proposal is quite inadequate.  It is, I understand, unacceptable to some at least, if not all, of the teacher training colleges.  In at least one case it greatly underestimates the potential of that college&mdash;the case of St. Patrick's Training College, where you already have a research activity being carried on of a university character, an activity indeed with which any university would be proud to be associated.  You have there a college which over a relatively short period of years could become a university college, accepted as such with its degrees accepted by universities generally here and elsewhere. It seems to me that the Minister, if he accepts this proposal, and I hope he will not, will be doing damage in a number of different ways.  He will be preventing primary teachers from securing the same kind of training and education at the same level as secondary and vocational teachers and he will be seen to be doing so.  As well as that, these teachers will be seen as not having a similar educational qualification. He will be placing an obstacle in the way of a unified teaching profession and underestimating the potential of some of these institutions.</P>
    <P>In the Fine Gael policy of five years ago we put forward quite clearly our views on this subject.  We have not changed them.  They were put forward in some degree tentatively, because it was the first time this question had been tackled and we did not feel we should be unduly dogmatic about particular solutions.  But the solution we put forward was one under which primary teachers, like other teachers, would get a university degree in a <Col N="1709" /> university institution not confined to teachers, and would proceed thereafter to a further year, which would be equivalent to the Higher Diploma in Education, in which they would complete their training in the theory and practice of education.  We suggested it would be desirable that people intending to become teachers would, during the period of their university course, undertake some additional course in the theory and practice of education.</P>
    <P>Indeed, what we had in mind was that on the practical side it would be possible for them to get some experience during the holiday periods instead of going to a pea-canning factory in Britain.  We suggested, however, that if they were undertaking an honours degree in those circumstances this extra load, concurrent with their ordinary university course, should not be imposed on them because this would create difficulties in the completion of their honours degree.  You would have two streams of primary teachers coming forward, both of whom would continue on them to the additional year, one of whom would have had some training in the theory and practice of education during their university general degree course, the other of whom would not have had but would have specialised in particular subjects and reached a very high level and would compensate in their subject orientation for what they might lack in their pupil orientation.  In the final year, because of their calibre as honours students, they would more readily catch up on any backlog on their part in the theory and practice of education.</P>
    <P>There are different ways one can work this.  We are not being dogmatic about the particular solution but what is evident is that we simply cannot accept at this stage, and we will not accept may I say to the Minister, on this side of the House that teacher training should continue to be segregated and any attempt to whitewash it and make it look as if it is for primary teachers the same as for secondary and vocational teachers is not acceptable. At this stage we want a unified teaching profession.  We have supported the Minister in this.</P>
    <P>We have, as the Minister knows, at <Col N="1710" /> no stage made any party capital out of the difficulties the Minister has faced.  We have worked quietly behind the scenes to try to get this dispute settled but having done that loyally and tried to help in this situation at every stage, we think we are entitled to say that what has been achieved to date in preserving the principle of a unified teaching profession as the objective to aim at should not be prejudiced by any step which would be such a half step as to undermine the possibility of having a unified teaching profession.</P>
    <P>Our position, therefore, is clear on this.  We are not prepared to accept proposals along the lines of the Higher Education Authority report.  I believe this is true of some at least of the teacher training colleges.  They are not prepared to accept them either and the Minister should beware therefore of accepting a recommendation which does not have the necessary support. As far as we are concerned when we get the opportunity to deal with this problem we intend to deal with it along the lines that I have suggested and it would be a mistake for the Minister at this stage to proceed to any interim arrangement which would have to be adjusted when this party get the opportunity of making that adjustment.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, therefore, to think very seriously about this report from the HEA and to take very seriously the view of the teacher training colleges themselves on this matter. I see difficulties, as I have said before, in overnight turning all those teacher training colleges into university colleges. This may not be the answer.  The answer may lie in the different kind of structure in which some of them become full university colleges with a range of subjects.  They may not have the same range initially as existing universities but they could have a range of relevant subjects taught to university level and with a body of research being carried on in them equivalent to what is carried on in the university. Others of the colleges might in fact be used to fulfil the role of the training college, providing the additional year at the end of the university course.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> There is no reason why all of those colleges should have to fulfil the same role.</P>
    <P>The proposal put forward is one which in fact would make them into a kind of half university colleges, which underestimates the potential of some and which does not provide a satisfactory solution.  I would urge the Minister, therefore, not to accept the dangerously simplified solution put forward here and instead to consider seriously the kind of proposals outlined in our policy, to which a lot of thought was given and which I think has stood the test of time.  In the past five years the evolution of thinking in the teacher-training colleges themselves has been in the direction of our proposal.  I think our proposal was ahead of its time.  It did not secure at that time the support of the teacher-training colleges.  Some at least accepted it as a possible solution but they did not I think feel it was necessarily the best solution.  I think opinion has come around towards our view since then.  I think, and hope, that we have played some part in that and that we have helped constructively to lead opinion towards the kind of solution which would be in advance of other countries, because I recognise that in other countries still teacher training is segregated off in training colleges separate from universities.  We are in the happy position that for most of our teachers already this is not the case.  For two groups of teachers this is not the case already and for the primary teachers it would not require an enormously expensive adjustment to bridge the gap between the present system and the university system.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out before that the cost of a university general degree in particular in this country is relatively low.  In fact it is quite extraordinarily low, partly because of the inadequate teacher/student ratio it must be said and, on the other hand, the cost of the training colleges has been relatively high because of their residential character. In those circumstances for us to move from a segregated residential training college system to one in which <Col N="1712" /> the primary teachers would get a university education followed by a year's specialised teacher training would not necessarily increase costs. We are in the happy position that we are able at this point to make the transition to a much more advanced system than other countries have at very limited cost.  We should not fail to grasp this opportunity.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a couple of words on the subject of school attendance arising out of Subhead C. 8 in the Primary Education Vote&mdash;Special Educational Project.  All of us will watch with interest this project and what results come from it.  It is, of course, frustratingly long-term in character.  Quite rightly, because of its very nature, it is spread over a period of years.  Its results could only be of value if they were secured in this way but it is frustrating that we have to wait to see the results of this experiment.  I do not think we need to wait for the results of this experiment to introduce many changes, reforms and improvements in our educational system especially in areas like the City of Dublin, especially in the great suburban sprawls and in the centre city areas.</P>
    <P>We have very severe problems here which I do not think have ever had adequately the attention of the Department or of the Minister for Education. In this country the strongest political pressures come from rural Ireland. There are very good reasons why this is the case and why this should be the case.  Indeed many social problems are greater in rural Ireland.  Certainly the problems of employment are greater there.  I speak for the moment as a Dublin TD in this respect.  All of us in Dublin accept that there must be a bias towards rural Ireland in much of our legislation but there are two areas where the bias should be the other way because there are social problems so acute in the city and less acute in rural Ireland that they require special attention.  Those are housing and education, and in particular primary and vocational education.  I do not think the secondary education situation creates special problems in the cities. On the contrary density of population <Col N="1713" /> there provides greater variety of choice and in fact secondary education probably is in a better position than in rural Ireland but there are problems of vocational and primary education in the city that have never adequately been tackled.</P>
    <P>It is most disturbing to hear from the Minister, as we have heard recently in reply to a question, the figures for the size of classes in Dublin primary schools.  Those figures, as far as I can judge, show a deterioration not an improvement.  After years of the process of closing down small schools which was designed in the Investment in Education policy, among other things, to release hundreds of teachers for urban areas with a view to bringing down the pupil/teacher ratio, we have made no apparent progress.  I do not understand why this should be so.  The Minister ought to give us full data on this.  We need some kind of flow diagram which would show us as between say 1965 and 1970 what has happened, what have been the changes in the number of pupils in the major urban and rural areas.  What have been the changes in the number of pupils in the major and rural areas?  What have been the changes in the number of teachers?  How have these changes in the numbers of teachers come about? Have teachers been transferred from rural to urban areas?  Has there been a non-replacement of teachers in rural areas?  To what extent have newly-trained teachers been diverted?  What has been the flow of teachers and what has been the result?  How is it that after some years of a policy allegedly directed towards improving the appalling teacher/pupil ratio in the schools in the cities, especially in Dublin, we seem to be no better off and possibly are worse off in this respect?  The size of classes at this stage is an absolute scandal and an intolerable scandal because it is something which it must be in our power to remedy.  We simply cannot accept that a situation in which the teacher/pupil ratios are totally different in different parts of the country must continue.</P>
    <P>One sees that changes must be made gradually.  One accepts it takes some years to reorientate our teaching force <Col N="1714" /> to where it is most needed.  However, we have had some years and we have not had results.  The Minister ought to tell us why this is and I would ask him again to be much freer here in the provision of information.  His development branch, as originally envisaged, was one which was to produce a flow of information available to everybody, to teachers, school managers, to the Opposition, to everybody who wanted the information, instead of which it seems to be working away behind closed doors.  No access to it is available to any of the people I have mentioned.  It is under tight administrative control.  It is not the professional unit it was meant to be and in the meantime we are deprived of adequate information on the educational system. We are simply not getting the flow of statistics.</P>
    <P>In <i>Investment in Education</i> we got a glimpse, a snapshot of a moment in time, of our educational system and when we saw what the flaws and problems were and what needed to be done to resolve them the book was hastily shut and we have not seen it opened since.  All we can do occasionally by the frustrating process of Parliamentary Question is to get the odd page reprinted and updated, but we do not have a picture of where we stand in our educational system at the moment.  We need that picture and in particular we need to know why we are not making progress in the cities and especially in Dublin.  The problems here are immense and I would commend to the Minister a very important paper read last night in the city at a symposium on school attendance organised by Dublin Corporation in a very valuable and imaginative gesture. It was a meeting which was extremely well attended and at which the contributions were at a very high level.  Because of my commitments in the House I was not able to get there until towards the end of the meeting.  I did not hear the paper read but I did get a copy of it and have been reading it. I commend it to the Minister because there are facts put forward in this paper as a result of research carried out in this sphere by Dr. McQuaid, a psychiatrist, which are profoundly disturbing <Col N="1715" /> and which ought to influence very seriously the Department's policy and attitude.  I wish to mention a few of the points that emerge from this paper:</P>
    <P>A particular problem in recent years has been the association between school non-attendance and residence of the family in the high rise apartments in Ballymun.</P>
    <P>I just mention that because I am extremely disturbed at the attitude of officials on this whole question of Ballymun.  Ballymun was an error in social planning.  We all make mistakes and we know errors can be made in social planning, but the attitude of this Government and indeed of the Public Service of never admitting a mistake is most dangerous.  I had the experience recently of discussing this with very senior officials of Dublin Corporation and their attitude was that Ballymun was a howling success, that it was an absolute lie to say it was not a success.  Every public representative in this city knows that people will not go to Ballymun, that the people who are there want to get out of it, that it was designed according to middle-class prejudices and is totally unsuited to the people for whom it was provided. It has been a serious social blunder.</P>
    <P>Let us accept it was a mistake made in good faith by a Government anxious to get something done about housing but let us face the mistake, and here is a concrete fact, the emergence among many other social evils that Bullymun has created of a school attendance problem because of the psychiatric and social problems created by putting people into conditions which are totally unsuited to them, when they were used to a different environment altogether, a gregarious environment, and locking them away in these little boxes 17 storeys up and in many cases literally driving them mad as a result.</P>
    <P>There are other points that emerge from this research.  There are such things as the stratification of education in certain areas of the city, the preselection from the convent school before allocation of places, which would appear to indicate that the better boys <Col N="1716" /> are selected from the convent school for one type of school and the remainder go to a school run by a different religious order.  This has very great significance in terms of expectations and built-in predictions for the children by the responsible school authorities.</P>
    <P>Another point that emerges is that of a small number of children, approximately 25, fully assessed and placed in a special school, 15 cases eventually had to be discharged from the special school because they were unacceptable by virtue of abnormal behaviour.  These children eventually returned to the school from which they had originally come and for which they had originally been found totally unacceptable. If we create a system to cope with children who, because of their environment, do not fit into a normal school, there is something very wrong if we provide a special school for them and the special school then rejects them as being abnormal and sends them back to the school they came from.  Clearly the system is breaking down when that kind of situation arises.  There is then a sentence which sums up the Dublin situation in terms which certainly strike home to me:</P>
    <P>It can hardly be denied that to come from an understimulating, underprivileged and deprived home where there are perhaps large numbers of children competing for limited emotional and material fulfilment, that to go to a situation where there is little of attraction, an expectation to remain still and listen to an individual from an alien social class with alien cultural ideals and expectations of children, often coupled with a lack of individual contact, an attempt to realistically assist the child in developing some competence in educational tasks is asking too much of the child in question.</P>
    <P>There is a problem which the Minister needs to consider.  Owing to the way in which our primary teachers have been drawn in the past, as to 85 per cent from seven counties in the West of Ireland and owing to the imposition on children in Dublin of the whole system of Irish language teaching which to them means nothing, which to them <Col N="1717" /> is an alien cultural system altogether, the combination of having teachers from a different cultural environment who clearly in many cases have difficulty in understanding the children of the area and the Irish language problem is simply to recreate a colonial-type situation.  I do commend to the Minister that remarkable paper on social mobility in Dublin, which made it clear that there is no social mobility in Dublin for children of manual-working parents.  There has been no social mobility because they are in fact colonised and re-colonised in each generation, taught by people from an alien cultural environment and taught a culture which to them is alien, which means nothing, and as a result of which when they leave school they are in a very high proportion of cases not literate, incapable of coping and simply exported as fodder to the British labour market.  This is the type of situation which if it existed in a colony would be regarded as totally unacceptable and the United Nations would do something about it, but because it happens in Ireland, in our own country, and because we do not recognise these subcultures as existing and take the over-simplified view that we are all of the same culture in this country we are doing nothing about it.  There is a very real problem here.  There is an oppressed subculture in Dublin whose only outlet is to emigrate without any qualifications, without any adequate education or training.</P>
    <P>This is now changing.  Great work is being done.  In many of our schools now, and particularly in many of the vocational schools, great work is being done in trying to achieve a breakthrough. There are vocational schools in particular that are managing to get children from very underprivileged homes right through into Kevin Street and Bolton Street and into the university. A real breakthrough is being made for the first time, but we have for half a century allowed this colonial-type of situation to exist and have done nothing about it.  It is only in recent years that the problem has been tackled.  There is an immense educational problem in Dublin, a problem of impossibly large classes in the primary schools, a problem of inadequate <Col N="1718" /> places in the vocational schools.  I was in a vocational school this morning where the principal told me he has to turn away two to three times as many pupils as he can take.  This is a school which is doing remarkable work and yet pupils have to be turned away because there is no accommodation for them there.  We need to reconsider our whole attitude on this subject.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about community schools and I want to conclude fairly soon to leave time for another speaker.  The Department's document on community schools has come in for a great deal of publicity.  It is most unfortunate that its provenance was never explained until the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  Very belatedly the Minister did concur with my account of its origins.  There is far too much controversy and heat in this country at present but much of the heat would have been avoided if it had been made known at the beginning that this document was produced as a guide to thinking in a particular instance when a particular bishop wanted to know in respect of a particular problem in a particular town what was the Department's thinking.  If secondary schools in particular had been told that that was the origin of the document, a lot of the suspicions that arose as to what the Department were up to in sending documents to the hierarchy and not to them, would not have been aroused.  I am glad that I am able to contribute now to the clarification of this document.</P>
    <P>The document itself is interesting and is worthy of serious consideration. The Minister knows I have not accepted the view put forward by some people that this is an attempt to destroy our religious system of education.  I have not rallied to the flag of revolt that has been raised by some people because we gain nothing by discussing these problems in emotional terms. This proposal in relation to community schools deserves mature and responsible consideration but what bothers me about it is the inadequacy of the statement put forward.  I am not saying that I am opposed to community schools but I will say that there are difficulties in relation to the creation of the kind of community schools envisaged <Col N="1719" /> here&mdash;difficulties that are better faced up to than swept under the carpet. No service is done to education by producing a document which, after reading it, one would think there was no such thing in Ireland as religious education.  There is religious education and there is a problem between two co-existing systems of education one of which is&mdash;I shall not say secular&mdash; non-sectarian, the vocational system. This system is run by the State.  We have had it now for 40 years and it has worked well.  I have not heard many complaints in relation to the religious faith of either the majority or the minority being adversely affected by these schools.  We also have the secondary stream which is predominantly religious.</P>
    <P>Parents who send their children to these schools do so, among other reasons, because they are concerned that their children should have the same kind of religious background as they themselves have.  This is a deep-rooted instinct among Irish people.  It is true that, owing to the way the two systems have originated, there is considerable class division between them and we have the rather curious position where, by and large, a middle class who, themselves, were educated in religious schools, send their children to religious schools, whereas the children of manual workers have found, until recently, that their opportunity for education lay in a different system &mdash;in a system that was non-sectarian. This tended to differentiate our two cultures even further.  I have never understood why there should be so much heat about this just as I have never understood why it should be all right for the children of manual workers to attend non-sectarian schools while there were grave moral dangers attaching to children from middle-class homes in attending these schools and so they were sent to religious schools. I could not follow why a child coming from a better off home should be more prone to religious deviation and why it is that the Church felt that the children coming from workingclass homes did not matter so much.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, the document produced by the Minister's Department <Col N="1720" /> does not face the problem.  There is a problem and it is not going to be resolved easily.  Clearly it is desirable for practical reasons, in a number of towns in this country, that we should have some merger of schools at the post-primary level.  I do not concur with the figures in the Minister's document. In a country of low density of population, I am sceptical of setting targets of 800 pupils with a minimum of 400.  Quite apart from the problems associated with achieving this in most parts of the country, I would accept that there are counter arguments here. The Minister knows that I supported the Government in the small schools controversy.  I accepted that one- and two-teacher schools, whatever advantages they might have from a social point of view, were clearly a mistake from an educational point of view. However, at the secondary level I am not convinced that this argument applies with the same force in a secondary school up to 150 pupils. There is a lot to be said for having, as well as large schools, single stream schools of about 250 pupils and about 10 classes including the primary stage running all the way up with one single class at each level.</P>
    <P>Of course one accepts that this limits the choice of subjects in that school but we can go overboard in trying, within every school, to give every choice of all possible subjects. In the first place, children are flexible to some extent.  As between a number of different languages, for instance, their ability to learn one cannot be very much different from their ability to learn another.  Secondly, parents are capable of selecting a school on the basis of the range of subjects available within that school.  A solution based on two schools each having up to 250 pupils and each having a different range of subjects would be quite acceptable.  I do not see why it should be necessary to put the two together so that there is a wider range of subjects in one school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are voting <Col N="1721" /> money here for a variety of purposes, for all forms of education, vocational and secondary and while I must admit that community schools do not fall under either heading, they do fall under both.  Are we then in the position of a three-card trick?  Presumably we are voting money here for comprehensive schools although we do not have a separate heading for such schools.  It seems to me that I am entitled to speak briefly on the subject of community schools.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to give us more fully his views on this question of community schools.  I should like him to say that he stands over this document.  Is it his thinking that schools must be of the order of 400 to 800?  Does he not accept that what we want in education is variety and not uniformity and that his Department are trying to impose a rigid uniformity everywhere and that this is totally alien to what we want?  I would much prefer to see an open view, looking for large schools in some areas and small ones in others, experimenting between the two and learning the advantages and disadvantages in each case rather than to go overboard for a particular educational solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main issue on which the Minister should give us some indication of his thinking is the religious issue which looms large in Irish education.  It is a matter which must be considered seriously.  If we are to merge vocational and secondary schools we will create a situation in which either the secondary religious school as it would normally be would have to become non-sectarian like the vocational school.  In some cases this would be acceptable while in others it would not. Alternatively, a vocational school would have to become a religious school but this would be unacceptable because it would exclude the Protestant community effectively from attending these schools and would set up a system of community schools which excludes one part of the community. We have not had any indication of the Minister's thinking on this subject.  We must face the fact that in moving towards community schools, and this is in accordance with the 1966 policy of <Col N="1722" /> Fine Gael, the type of education to be provided by secondary and vocational schools should be geared to the needs of each neighbourhood and should not be inhibited by traditional distinctions between secondary and vocational schools which are the result of historical factors that have no validity today.</P>
    <P>We anticipated the Minister and his Department by five years in putting forward that enlightened view.  I am not, therefore, attacking the principle of the community schools.  I am simply saying that to produce a document that pretends there is not a religious issue is to make no real contribution to the discussion at all.  What we have to do is to discuss the religious issue and see how it can best be resolved. No progress will be made until that is done.  It is time the Minister adverted to this instead of sweeping it under the carpet.  There are problems in this area which will have to be resolved if we are to make progress.  They will be resolved with goodwill and trust between the Minister, the schools and the Hierarchy.  There are more than two parties to this.</P>
    <P>It was most unfortunate, as I said at the outset, that the Minister should have given the impression to the secondary schools that he was doing a deal with the Hierarchy on the subject when, in fact, it is the secondary schools that are concerned.  We need open and free and frank discussion on the subject and I would hope that the Minister would break out of the mould in which he and his Department have been stuck for so long and be prepared to take an unusual step like calling together for week-end seminars the representatives of all the different interests concerned to talk frankly and freely and in privacy about these problems and see if solutions cannot be found.  At the moment, fears and tensions are being created and vested interests are taking up positions. The Minister is likely to find himself in an embattled position when he ought to be discussing in free and frank and friendly terms how best to resolve these problems in the interests of the community as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to start by agreeing with Deputy FitzGerald <Col N="1723" /> about the actual information given here which I must say I find excessively terse.  There are points which are rather difficult to understand.  This may be a function of my limited intelligence.  I do not know; it is quite possible.  There are certain areas which are just impenetrable to me, particularly the supplementary grants for universities and colleges.  I will refer to that later.</P>
      <P>To begin at the beginning, since this covers all areas of education I should like, first of all, to follow Deputy FitzGerald in deprecating the continued lack of success which we seem to be having in reducing the size of classes in primary schools.  The Minister consistently says&mdash;and he may be correct&mdash; that he can only give us average figures. Even these averages are revealing. The average number of pupils per class in Dublin city is 42.3.  In Dublin county it is 40.3.  In the remainder of the country it is 31.1.  The optimum of the Department is, of course, 35.</P>
      <P>If the average size of classes in Dublin city is 42.3, it stands to reason that there must be some classes which are substantially larger than that.  I think the Minister will agree that there are classes with 50 or more pupils in them. Surely this is educationally most undesirable. I know it is a problem of money to a great extent and recruitment but surely you cannot really feel that a child is getting a fair crack of the whip in educational terms in a class of 50 by comparison with a child in a class of 20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be interested if some time the Minister would really lay out before us his intentions with respect to the smaller schools.  There has been a tremendous pattern of school closing over the past five years; 419 one-teacher schools and 850 two-teacher schools have been closed in that period. This represents a massive social revolution and it is something about which we should have a clear-cut and unmistakable policy.  I know it is the policy of the Department to continue, where possible, abolishing the one-and two-teacher schools.  Some people feel that the three-teacher schools are coming increasingly into a dangerous position. I do not know if that is true, and I should like to be told.  I am not saying <Col N="1724" /> that I disagree with it.  I do not. Like Deputy FitzGerald I think these things should be set out as part of a major policy and not done piecemeal and, in a sense, by stealth.</P>
    <P>I want to raise a few small points about the secondary school level for which we are also voting money here. When we consider issues like community schools we should recognise the growing amount of money which the State is investing in the actual building of schools, nearly £8 million between 1967 and 1970.  Any discussion about the place of the religious in the schools should be held against the background of the fact that the burden of building in the secondary area is increasingly falling on the State.  In this context we should bear in mind that there is a change of attitudes.  I agree with Deputy FitzGerald that there are still people who have thin skins on the subject of State intervention.  You find them in the oddest places where you would not expect to find them.  You find them in the ASTI, for example, which always seems to me rather anomalous.</P>
    <P>In that context, a change of thinking is exemplified by the recent speeches by that most admirable man, the Most Reverend Dr. Good and, if more clerics took that line of thought, there would be less of this sort of conflict.</P>

      <P>One has to say something quickly about the strike since so much of this money is being voted for the new method of salary payment.  I do not want to go deeply into this subject&mdash;that would be futile&mdash;but I must say I do not think the Minister handled this as well as he might have done, and certainly his predecessor did not do so.  I think the 1969 agreement was deplorable.  It represented a going back on the principle of the Ryan Report. Personally, I remain obdurately in favour of the principle of the Ryan Report and I agree with the Minister and his Department here.  I am in favour of the principle but not of the actual figures and sums and pounds, shillings and pence set out in that report.  In fact, I think there has been a retreat from some of the better elements of that report in a simple across <Col N="1725" /> the board payment of £60, or whatever it is, to people who do not receive posts of responsibility.</P>
      <P>In fact, I think that to some extent the teachers are to blame.  The teachers co-operated with the Minister in producing a system of salary payments by which reward is commensurate not with skill but with seniority.  I think this is regrettable.  I am not very good at actuarial calculations but it would have been better if something like the same amount of money, or even a little more, could have been spent on maintaining the general principle of the Ryan scheme, improving the points system in such a way as to make posts of responsibility more available, and increasing the rewards for higher qualifications.</P>
      <P>I do not see how any other branch of the teaching profession could object to this principle.  It seems to be a perfectly equitable one and quite consistent with the principle of a common basic salary scale.  If that principle had been more closely adhered to I think we would have had a situation in which the teachers would have been more directly involved in the running of the schools.  I am quoting from memory but I think in Mr. O'Connell's article in <i>Studies</i> some time ago he spoke of the teacher being like the hired help whose function ends when he reaches the door. There is a lot of truth in that.  The Ryan scheme properly developed could have done much to break that down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister the other day had he any intention of altering the method by which the teachers are paid from two different sources.  He said he had no plan to do so and that both the managerial and the teacher organisations had requested that the system should continue.  Far be it from me to wish on the Minister even greater problems with the teaching profession than he already has, but it seems to me that, irrespective of the wishes of the managerial and teacher organisations, the present system by which the State pays some money to the teacher and some money to the school, which then pays it back to the teacher preserving the illusion that it is employing <Col N="1726" /> the teacher, is a singularly silly one and should be got rid of.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look kindly again on the possibility of increasing the amount of grant in respect of those schools which opted into the so-called free education system.  So far as I know, that figure has been frozen since the scheme was started.  It is an open secret that many schools have very, very great difficulty in sustaining their function in any effective way with the present level of grant.  As a result they are driven into all sorts of concealed subsidisation through so-called voluntary schemes which very often are not voluntary.  This is bad. It is a breach of the scheme.  At the same time, we cannot really blame the schools because they have no other way of raising the money.  The Minister should look again at this.</P>
    <P>I agree completely with Deputy FitzGerald about the HEA report on teacher training which seems to produce a sort of compromise which is neither one thing nor the other. The teacher is not genuinely in the university nor is he genuinely out of it.  As Deputy FitzGerald said, all the institutions are treated as being comparatively equipped to provide something commensurate to a university degree which in some cases they can, like St. Patrick's for example, and in some cases I would say they cannot. It would be invidious to name which is which, but I certainly think that report is an unfortunate one and I hope the Minister will not be guided totally by it.  This is one of the rare instances where I am in the position of urging the Minister to disagree with the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>Turning quickly to the level of vocational or technical schools, this is not something on which I am as expert as I should be.  It seems to me to be an open secret in many areas that there is not the degree of co-operation between secondary and vocational schools which should exist.  The Minister said that he is aware that in a number of centres more could be done and the implementation of proposals based on a working paper for schools would cater for the situation in a large number of these cases.  Yesterday the Minister <Col N="1727" /> said to me that he is not prepared, at this stage, to make any further statement in the matter of the progress of the discussions on community schools.  Here, again, I agree with Deputy FitzGerald in this area of policy, as in many other areas.  If the Minister's Department took people more into their confidence than they do at the moment, I do not think they would find that the battalions of conservatives are quite as strong in their entrenched patterns as they used to be, and as many fear they are.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the universities, I will do my best to resist the temptation to speak as a don.  I do not understand the supplementary grants in respect of education.  I do not know where Deputy FitzGerald worked out that Trinity College is getting more than the other colleges.</P>

      <P>We should realise that we cannot continue to have university education on the cheap.  It is no good saying that the doors of universities are open to greater numbers of students without being prepared to pay for the additional staff and facilities which they will require.  A breaking point is reached at a certain stage in the size of a university.  I am not one of those who think that a university must be a selective, enclosed place. When one is lecturing to 250 students <Col N="1728" /> one considers the question of whether the students are getting a university education at all.  I asked for information on the staff/student ratio of the different colleges.  I was told that it is 1-17 to 1-19, and the Higher Education Authority expressed the desire that by 1975 the ratio should be 1-12.  This would need 155 additional staff at Trinity College.  I am sure the position is as acute in the other universities.  To accuse the universities of selectivity is a bit unfair in the context of the resources.  There is a widespread illusion about Trinity College which I cannot resist any opportunity to dispel, and that is that Trinity has vast resources of its own.  In fact, in the academic year 1969-70 its income from dividends, rents <i>et cetera</i> was £73,000 of a total running figure of £2,000,000. The college is almost invariably &ldquo;in the red&rdquo;.  If the universities are to expand, grants must rise very steeply. It is estimated that to keep going as it is Trinity College would need a further £500,000 in the year 1971-72.  I wonder will it get it.</P>
      <P>To come now to the question of night classes&mdash;quite correctly in this House UCD has been criticised for abandoning a small scale of night classes and Trinity College has been criticised for having abandoned them altogether some years ago.  That criticism is bad.  It is a question of money.  The colleges want to maintain the quality of the education given. Trinity College have initial proposals for a limited form of night teaching which would cost £30,000.  There is no point in criticising universities in this House unless we give them the money to do what we want them to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister recently if he had any plans for increasing the size of grants to students who qualify for such grants in the university.  The Minister replied that he had not, and that special financial provision was made to enable the university fees to be kept this year at the level obtaining in 1969-70.  I ask the Minister to think about this matter and to adopt a more generous attitude to the provision of grants, particularly for people who have to travel large distances.  The grants are inadequate.  They go some <Col N="1729" /> way towards meeting the costs.  I spoke to the Minister's predecessor on &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; when he introduced this scheme.  I asked him was it adequate, and the then Minister said it was only a beginning.  I asked him when phase two was to happen.  I would ask the Minister to be more generous to the universities in future. The content of the universities is increasing. I am glad to see this happening. The students are increasingly representative of what might be called the broad spectrum of Irish society. We will have further problems, which are already evident, when the students referred to as &ldquo;Donogh O'Malley's battalions&rdquo; begin to hammer on the doors of the universities.  If we are serious about the quality of our education, we will have to provide the universities with sufficient funds to enable them to take these people in. The universities are no longer the privileged bastions of the rich.  They are still somewhat so, but not so much as they were in the past.  They are increasingly becoming community institutions. We should not look on them as enclosures which are of no great interest to the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to speak to his colleagues, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice, on the issue of the Kennedy Report on Industrial Schools.  This is a facet of education which does not correctly come under the Minister's care.  Everyone knows how unsatisfactory the situation is in these schools.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a little about the overall policy in the Department. It seems to me from Parliamentary questions that the closure of small schools, the possible imminence of the community school process and the development of vocational and comprehensive teaching follow a clear-cut pattern of regionalisation and in teaching in larger blocks at all levels.  This is in keeping with the general tendency towards the kind of thing mentioned in the Buchanan Report.  I have no particular objection to this.  I tend to be sympathetic towards departmental policy over the last five years.  I wish that this was not always done by stealth.  I agree with Deputy FitzGerald <Col N="1730" /> that a White Paper on the policy of education should be published. We are bringing a vast, new educational pattern into existence in a piecemeal fashion.  It is only when one looks around ten years later that one realises what has happened.  The reasoning behind it would seem to be that if it were not done by stealth it might not be done at all.  The character of thinking on education has changed sufficiently for a broad and daring policy to be publicly communicated to the people.  This should explain exactly what the Department is getting at.  I thought that Mr. O'Connell's articles were a first tenta-tive &ldquo;dry run&rdquo; for such an event.  I would like to think that this would be followed up by an overall regional policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might just say, first of all, in relation to the general matter of policy, that the one thing that can be seen running through all my policy, and the policy of the Department, is the fact that the emphasis is on the pupil and the student, that the pupils and the students come first.  It is in line with this that various aspects of our policy are being operated, for example, the amalgamation of the smaller schools and the development of the community school idea.  It is obvious from these Supplementary Estimates that the bulk of the money required relates to salary increases under the twelfth round.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald referred to the problems we had last year in regard to teachers' salaries.  I do not intend to say very much in relation to this except to refer to a remark he made that some people did not appear to be completely satisfied.  Of course, it is obvious that in such a very difficult and complex situation as we found ourselves in, and in relation to the fact also that we were dealing with three different groups of teachers, it would be expecting too much that everybody would be completely satisfied.  However, I hope it will be recognised that we did make the best possible effort to achieve agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to conciliation and arbitration.  I too should <Col N="1731" /> like to see a common conciliation and arbitration scheme set up.  So far as I am aware this is a matter that will be discussed by the ASTI at their annual congress this year, with, I hope, a successful conclusion.  It has already been accepted by the other two groups of teachers, not necessarily in its present form, but I have no doubt that it will be possible for all three groups to come to an agreement in relation to an acceptable form of conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald also mentioned the promotion prospects of teachers. At the moment the ASTI are dealing directly with the various managerial bodies in relation to this matter.  We already have the information that, in so far as the convent schools are concerned, all posts of responsibility, including principalships, are open to both lay and religious.  The same applies to diocesan colleges and in fact a lay principal has been appointed in one diocesan college relatively recently. In regard to the Brothers' schools the position is that they are willing that all posts except that of principal be open to lay teachers.  They regard the headmastership and the superior of the school as being more or less synonymous and involving one and the same person.</P>
    <P>Speaking of the financial position in relation to education generally it will be recognised in view of the fact that the total amount of money available for education this year is approximately £76.5 million, as compared with £15 million 12 or 13 years ago, that whatever may be said in regard to the detail there can be no doubt about the Government's concern to ensure that all our young people would have their abilities and aptitudes developed to the greatest extent possible.  I have some interesting figures here in relation to a question which Deputy Thornley has put down for today in which he asks how many sat for the intermediate certificate examination in 1968.  The number was 23,313 and the number who passed was 20,290.  He then asked how many sat for the leaving certificate in 1970 and the answer is 18,975, which is exceptionally good.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1732" /> It shows that the vast majority of those who passed the intermediate certificate examination in 1968 continued on to the leaving certificate stage.  I think this is exceptional and, in fact, it tallies with the findings of an American research professor.  He found, in relation to the 16 to 18 age group, that we have the highest participation rate in Western Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any figures for the GCE, because some of the difference between those two figures is accounted for by a very large number of pupils, in Dublin, for example, going for vocational schools and doing the GCE?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have not got those at the moment.  The question of teacher training was also raised.  I am in consultation with all those concerned in this matter.  I have asked for their views on the report which was referred to by both Deputies in the course of this debate.  When I have had the opportunity of having a full examination of the views expressed by the various groups concerned I will make my decision.  I would like to add that I am sure Deputies will recognise that nobody could be more interested in or concerned with the training of primary teachers than I myself am.  It is also true to say that nobody, perhaps, recognises the limitations of the present system as I do.  A thought which struck me when Deputy FitzGerald was speaking&mdash;and Deputy Thornley very safely qualified what he said&mdash; is that I can remember that one or other of these Deputies, or perhaps both of them, criticised me for not having accepted all of the proposals and suggestions put forward in the first report of the Higher Education Authority.  I pointed out at that time that I felt that the authority as an independent, autonomous body were entitled to their say and that I was also entitled to my say in relation to their recommendations.  Now I begin to see that the Deputies opposite are more or less agreeing with me on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on whether or not we agree with the recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1733" />
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, and a similar situation arises in relation to my own view on them.  References were made to the various training colleges and I doubt if it was proper to speak about any particular college because it tends to give the impression that Deputies are downgrading the other training colleges.  The fact that one college might possibly happen to have a better PRO system than others should not be allowed to cloud the issue.  In my view all of the colleges are doing a very good job in the circumstances in which they find themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made was in relation to research activities at St. Patrick's which puts it into a kind of category close to a university. If you go to the university you must have research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This may be so to a certain extent but I have seen the work of all the colleges.  They differ in their approach, I recognise that, and sometimes I have difficulty in deciding which is the better approach, but all of them do a very good job in the circumstances in which they find themselves. I have not made up my mind yet in relation to the new system of teacher training but I hope that in the not too distant future I will make a final decision.</P>
      <P>One of the things that would worry me in relation to Deputy FitzGerald's attitude is in regard to what he said about the type of degree which might be made available by the Council of National Awards.  There might be a danger that the interpretation put on his words would be that he regarded a degree awarded by the National Council as being lower than a university degree.  This could have a very serious influence on the status of degrees from the Council in relation to other spheres. In so far as the CNA is concerned it will be necessary to ensure that whatever degrees are awarded by it will be on a par with university degrees.  Otherwise, the CNA will be of little value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mention the CNA.  I was talking about a B.Ed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but in the general context of what is in the report I think this should be said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have that clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference was also made to the size of classes.  It must be pretty obvious that where the national average is one teacher for every 34 pupils a re-deployment of teachers is one of the best ways of ensuring that we will be able to reduce the size of larger classes.  Over the past four years we have amalgamated over 800 small schools.  This will ultimately have the effect of making more teachers available. At the outset it makes a number of teachers available but very often when schools are amalgamated, for various reasons connected with the smooth operation of the whole business, it is necessary to allow all teachers to continue in the amalgamated school so that it does not release as many teachers as we would like at the beginning.  Deputy FitzGerald will also admit that while it is not true of himself there was considerable opposition by his own Party and by very many other people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to the amalgamation. The opposition was voiced by the Fine Gael Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I never found any particular opposition to the principle of amalgamation in this party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice, not the principle, poses the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>However, it was opposed by many people.  I think that it is quite obvious now that such opposition is largely a thing of the past particularly when we see the small number of cases in which difficulties now arise in relation to the amalgamation of small schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason the implementation <Col N="1735" /> of the policy was slower than was desired.  Still we have amalgamated over 800 to date and within a reasonable time we hope that this will have a very considerable impact on the larger city schools.</P>
    <P>Also we have been turning out additional teachers, hundreds of them, in the past few years.  These are being concentrated on the larger city classes. In the past ten years the total number of qualified teachers has been increased by over 1,200.  This was done by increasing the number of places in the training colleges, removing the ban on the permanent employment of married women teachers in 1958, abolishing the untrained qualification of junior assistant mistresses, recognising Froebel teachers' qualifications and providing summer courses for inservice training for junior assistant mistresses.  In 1969 we accorded recognition to teachers trained in Britain and Northern Ireland and since then some 160 teachers so trained have entered our primary teaching force. Also, in 1969, we introduced extern students into the training colleges.  In this way, by June, 1971, the output of newly trained teachers will be 720 as opposed to the former output of 590 to 600.  With the addition of the Froebel and English-trained teachers the total addition to the teaching force this year will be about 780.  This is a very substantial effort in regard to providing more teachers and thereby improving the pupil/teacher ratio.</P>
    <P>We are principally concerned at the moment with classes of over 50 which since February, 1968, have been reduced. In February, 1968, there were 1,286 of these classes; in February, 1970, 1,000.  I admit the problem is still very acute although we have made considerable progress, as I have already outlined, in regard to the steps we have taken to deal with it.  Proper re-deployment of the teaching force would go a long way towards solving the problem of the large classes. Amalgamation of smaller schools will, over a period, redress the imbalance but it will be some time before this becomes apparent.  Large classes predominate in the junior sections of the <Col N="1736" /> larger schools but I do not give this as any excuse.  I recognise that it is a serious problem but we have made considerable progress towards overcoming it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not explained why the number of classes over 40 does not seem to be going down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>We have mainly concerned ourselves with the reduction of the number of classes over 50.  This is the obvious way to tackle the problem.  We have reduced the number there by 268.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>And you have increased the number with over 40?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Very little.  As regards community schools I have already pointed out my reason for putting forward these proposals.  I was particularly anxious to get co-operation in the smaller towns where this was possible.  In some instances we have already succeeded but in some cases we came up against a situation where there were financial as well as educational problems and we therefore had to approach this difficult matter in another way.  The Deputy is being rather simple in suggesting that if I had stated originally that this document referred to one bishop and one small town I should have avoided controversy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is pretty well known that while one town was the immediate problem we were concerned with similar situations in many other areas.  The Deputy says that I did not in the document recognise that there were two different types of schools.  Of course I recognise this; in fact this is why I am having discussions with all the groups concerned.  I have had meetings with the Catholic Hierarchy, with the IVEA, with some of the heads of religious teaching bodies and I propose to continue these meetings until such time as I can evolve a system that will be as satisfactory as possible and with as much agreement as is possible in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>There was no such intention on my part.  My only concern is to ensure that the young people of this country get an opportunity to develop their talents and abilities to the greatest possible extent and in whatever way I can contribute to this I will do so.</P>
      <P>In relation to the saving of £275,000 in Vote 29 this was mainly due to the fact that there was an over-estimation of the number of pupils who would elect to enter secondary schools.  On the other hand I am glad to be able to say that the number entering the vocational schools increased very considerably.  This is a very desirable trend and is something I have been advocating since I became Minister for Education.  As I said on many previous occasions, for historical reasons, far more of our children have entered secondary schools than vocational schools and this resulted in an imbalance.  For that reason we are turning out more students on the academic side than on the technical side, when our need is for more technicians at all levels.  With the introduction of free post-primary education the vast majority of the young people entering the post-primary sphere tended to follow the original pattern and for that reason there was a danger, I felt, that this imbalance would be perpetuated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons for this was that at the particular time when free education was first introduced a student could only do the group certificate in the vocational school, that is, he could only do a two-year course.  This situation has dramatically changed and in recent years the intermediate certificate was introduced to the vocational schools and this year the leaving certificate will be done for the first time in vocational schools.  Of course, graduates of the vocational schools and many graduates of the secondary schools also will be able to continue into third level education in our regional technical colleges and technological colleges.  I hope this educational <Col N="1740" /> trend will continue in post-primary schools generally.</P>
    <P>Some reference was made here to what we are doing for slow learners. I do not know whether it is necessary for me to deal with the Rutland Street project in detail here.  The £6,350 in Vote 28 is for this special educational project.  This project is a pre-school effort to help underprivileged children, and in the course of it ascertaining the effect on the children's education of their being underprivileged.  We would hope to apply our findings in relation to the work being done in this school in the years to come for the benefit of all our children.  As Deputy FitzGerald mentioned it is a very worthwhile project but it is necessarily a slow process and we cannot expect to have the results immediately.</P>
    <P>In this school we have a project leader who is an inspector of my Department. We have a specially favourable pupil/teacher ratio.  We have employed there, also, doctors, nurses, social workers and we have made available special teaching aids.  The children are given a hot meal daily. One very important aspect of this work is the involvement of the parents.  They take part in the education of the children in the school in so far as this is possible.  They help out in every way they can.  I would like to express my own appreciation and the appreciation of my Department for the exceptional help they are giving us in relation to the development of the project.  I also want to point out that we have established in the city a large number of classes for slow learners where the pupil/teacher ratio is much lower than the norm.  It is approximately one teacher to every 20 pupils.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer, again, to our Development Section in the Department which has been the subject of some criticism here today.  I do not know of any country where there has been the same amount of consultation at local level as there has been here. Officers of the Development Branch have attended local meetings all over the country.  While it is essential to have a general policy in relation to such things as school size there could be no question of rigidity in relation <Col N="1741" /> to it.  The purpose of local meetings is to ascertain what the local factors are so that these can be taken into consideration when educational provision is being made for the particular area.  One thing we must take into consideration is that whenever consultations take place we are always confronted with the individual whose advice was not accepted, and who then tells all and sundry that no consultation took place at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very inadequate statement of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. While obviously we are not going to reach the minimum of 400, which I have mentioned here, in many areas, this figure is accepted by international educational opinion as the minimum in which we can provide a sufficiently broad curriculum to cater for the interests and ability of all types of pupils. As I say it will not be possible in many instances to reach this target but our efforts must be directed towards ensuring that the facilities available in any area must be as adequate as it is possible to make them because not only must we provide free education but we must also provide equality of educational opportunity.</P>
      <P>When I was presenting a medal to a student recently who had done particularly well at languages it struck me that had it not been for the fact that languages were available at the particular school she attended she could never have developed to the extent she did and to which she was entitled.  We must try so far as it is possible to make the opportunities available to our young people to develop whatever ability they may have.</P>
      <P>The question of grants for girls attending the physical education colleges has been raised and on a previous occasion I said that this is bound up with the grant scheme.  The position is that these colleges are very much in the same position as training colleges generally.  When a link with higher education institutions has been established in the case of these colleges we shall reconsider the whole position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the allocation to <Col N="1742" /> Trinity College, the requirements of Trinity College were greater than originally estimated and this is the reason why we have had to make more money available now.  We shall not be making&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a short and interesting debate on this Supplementary Estimate last night.  Deputy Donegan spoke on behalf of the Fine Gael Party and referred to the question of galloping inflation.  Deputy O'Donovan said that the Department itself was creating inflation and he went on to compare the amounts of the Estimates of the Department for the last few years.</P>
      <P>In the course of his speech Deputy Donegan stressed that as the Department of Industry and Commerce is the creator of employment it is the most important Department of State.  It is wrong to criticise the increased expenditure of the Department because it is all the time trying to create new employment and maintain and expand existing employment.  Deputy Donegan said that the Department is passing through a difficult time from this point of view.  I was rather surprised to hear Deputy Donegan criticising the amount of money being spent for the various purposes I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Donegan, who is the Opposition spokesman for Industry and Commerce, has any complimentary thing to say about either the Minister or the Government he traditionally compliments us from the point of view of making a success of a scheme which had either been introduced or mentioned first by him.  I was interested to hear him suggesting something which was started by my predecessor, Deputy Colley, and is being further developed by me, that is, an investigation into the various regions of the country to <Col N="1745" /> see how best those regions can be developed industrially.  The IDA are at present implementing plans for the erection of factories in these regions.</P>
    <P>I was amused last night at Deputy Donegan's statement that Fine Gael had a revised policy.  I had seen something to that effect in the papers recently.  Deputy Donegan claimed that the most progressive element in this revised policy from the point of view of industrial development in the west was the decision to subsidise&mdash; that was the term he used&mdash;transport costs in relation to industries located in that area.  Deputy Donegan and his party must be aware that my predecessor set up an interdepartmental committee to examine this and he must also be aware that I and my colleagues have publicly stated that this particular recommendation is at the moment the subject of governmental investigation.  It is possible that Deputy Donegan wants to put himself in the position of being able to say, when I come to make an announcement in regard to this, that once again we swiped one of his ideas.  I do not mind&mdash;I have said this before&mdash;where I get ideas if they are good ideas.  If they are good ideas I will do my best to implement them for the benefit of industrial development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Donegan was careful last night to say how far these transport subsidies would go.  He qualified the assurance that they would be fully paid.  This was wise of him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We extracted something from CIE anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in no position to comment on anything that was extracted from CIE.  That would be a <Col N="1746" /> matter for the Minister for Transport and Power and it would not be proper for me to discuss CIE on this Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan also criticised the necessity of having to provide an additional £10,000 for the National Development Association to further the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  As I said last night, it was hoped that industry would contribute a bigger share to this &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign and it was because that hope did not materialise that this extra £10,000 had to be provided.  I have spoken on this subject on a few occasions and I am pleased to notice that some trade union leaders have taken up the theme.  It is appropriate that it should be taken up by the trade unions.  Possibly Ministers for Industry and Commerce have on occasion resorted to an indiscriminate demand that people should buy Irish.  I have been careful not to exhort people to buy Irish unless what they are buying is quality Irish.  I am satisfied that practically everything we manufacture here is as good as, sometimes better than, the imported article.  However, for some reason or other, there are people who still believe that, in order to be &ldquo;with&rdquo; it, they must buy the imported article. I hope to get an early opportunity of addressing myself to trade unionists in the distributive trade.  I hope to ask them to keep their fellow trade unionists in the manufacturing industry in employment to the extent certainly of not hiding the Irish article in the back of the store or under the counter while presenting the imported article as attractively as possible.  I have had experience of this.  What the motive is I do not know, but it is disheartening to find the imported article displayed while the Irish article has to be asked for.  I welcome the manner in which trade unionists have taken up this rallying cry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find myself answering questions here about the boot and shoe industry. It is a fact that we are still exporting twice as many shoes as we import.  This shows that our manufacturers are able to produce an article acceptable in the United Kingdom, in the USA and elsewhere. For some reason some Irish consumers prefer imported footwear.  I <Col N="1747" /> have a responsibility&mdash;I am conscious of it&mdash;to protect people against themselves and, under free trade conditions, it will be very necessary for people to show a little practical patriotism when buying articles over the counter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan said that the reason why Irish industry would not support the campaign was that the Minister for Finance had lost their goodwill. I know that any increase in taxation is unpopular but I do not accept the Deputy's contention that this was the reason why money was not forthcoming for the National Development Association.  I propose to take this up with that organisation with a view to seeing if the manufacturer here can contribute a little bit more because it is obviously in his interest.  There is no reason why all the money being channelled into the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign should be from Government sources.  The people who are hoping to glean the immediate benefit from this should be expected to contribute. Over 20 firms did contribute to this scheme in 1970 and I hope more firms will contribute and that they will contribute more generously.  To contribute to any extent at all must be of tremendous benefit to them in view of the increased awareness by the man in the street of the necessity, in the national interest, to buying Irish manufactured articles.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan criticised the annual report of the IDA for making specific reference to the progress that had been made between 1952 and 1970. I have not had the opportunity of going into this with the board of the IDA but it was a progress report.</P>

Consultancy fees are quite high.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This helps to push up the expenditure.  The processing of capital intensive projects, of which the IDA have little experience, gave rise to consultancy expenditure which was not anticipated.  It would be very wrong for me as Minister to be critical of them for spending of this nature in relation to trying to attract large-scale industry.  I have heard much criticism here before I became Minister&mdash;in fact when I was in the back benches&mdash;in connection with Potez, for instance, and Deputies will appreciate that care must be taken.  The record of successes of the IDA is quite good.  It is much better to have something not getting off the ground as a result of <Col N="1750" /> an exhaustive inquiry that shows that it would not survive than to set it up and then have the embarrassment of answering a whole lot of intelligent questions as to why it had to close down.</P>
      <P>There was a little bit of crossfire last night in relation to surveying and the question of the checks made by the geological survey on the drillings from boreholes.  The people who are prospecting, because their licence is a renewable kind of licence, must establish that they have made use of their prospecting licence and have worked in the fields for which they got the licence.  Therefore, going along with the prospecting licence is an obligation on the mining company to keep the geological survey fully informed of the results of their explorations, drillings, <i>et cetera.</i>  Apart altogether from being kept informed and receiving samples, the survey themselves visit the site and make various checks.  There is a dual operation and this is the manner in which it is done.  I am at a loss. I am a bit vague on the question that Deputy Dr. O'Donovan asked me some time ago.  If that was specifically the question I cannot understand why I did not spell that out as being the answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I keep worrying about everyone's questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1751" /> Deputy O'Donovan also raised the question of royalties in relation to mining.  Mining royalties are paid as a percentage on profits as calculated for corporation profits tax.  They are not calculated on tonnage.  However, there are three ways in which royalties can be calculated but this is a system that we have been operating up to now.  Therefore, a check on tonnages from the point of view of exporting does not arise.  In relation to mineral production there is provision to ensure that there are no false returns in the prices at which ores are sold.  It is a function of the Central Statistics Office to check on the export value.</P>
    <P>I think that I have covered, in general, the questions raised last night. I was pleased that Deputy Donegan went out of his way to say that he believed that what I appeared to be trying to do in relation to the licensing of mining is correct.  His contribution was helpful.  The Deputy had something to say, too, about prices.  However, the only difficulty is that Deputy Donegan is endeavouring to have it both ways.  In the first place, he criticises the Prices Section of my Department. In doing that, he criticises me as Minister for Industry and Commerce because I must clear any price increases that are conceded.  The Deputy criticised us in that we are too slow in conceding increases to the manufacturers. He alleged that some increases are inadequate but, on the other hand, he criticised the Prices Section for keeping no control on prices.  He is over-simplifying the situation.  In today's newspapers we read that the Dublin Gas Company have increased their prices but that at their annual meeting yesterday they talked about the slowness of the Department in conceding much-needed increases and said they had difficulty in continuing production.  On the other hand, housewives will naturally protest and say that the Department of Industry and Commerce have no control over price increases.  There are complaints by the producers, on the one hand, in relation to the Prices Section of the Department in that they are too efficient and so are too unreasonable while, on the <Col N="1752" /> other hand, there is the consumer who, the moment a price increase in announced, criticises the section and says that the increase is not justified.</P>
    <P>The Prices Section of my Department consider exhaustively all applications for price increases.  I do not think anybody should get away with saying, on the one hand, that price increases are not conceded quickly enough and, on the other hand, that we allow too many increases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that where an increase was justified, it should be given promptly and efficiently and that if it is not so justified, it should not be given at all?  Surely that is a fair proposition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Some do not take two years.  Under the terms of the regulations, there is a specific period of three months.  Very often there seems to be a delay but the reason usually is that the manufacturers may not regard an increase as being satisfactory and so the matter remains with the Department. When it is determined eventually, it is claimed that the increase was not granted quickly enough.</P>

      <P>It is easy to say that a well-established firm is a well-off firm but, as I see it, anything that improves efficiency and which helps firms, particularly those involved in the export trade, is worthwhile.  If they need to readapt to make themselves more efficient, to remain more competitive, to hold the export market, I and the IDA have a responsibility to help them to do that.  It is very easy to pick out a name like Guinness.  The Deputy picked out Guinness last night.</P>

      <P>We have at present a factory at Shannon Airport which has been in operation for two years and, within that period, the machinery has <Col N="1755" /> become antiquated.  It is not sufficiently up to date to turn out yarn that measures up to the standards required, at an economic level.  As far as the rural areas are concerned, one of the claims made against the Department and the IDA is that if you are an American, or a German, or a foreigner, you have no trouble getting a grant, but if you are an Irishman you have not a hope.  Here is a case where we gave an adaptation grant to Irishmen and we find ourselves criticised.  It is impossible to do the right thing.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £636,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1971, for the salaries and expenses <Col N="1756" /> of the Office of Public Works; for expenditure in respect of public buildings; for the maintenance of certain parks and public works; for the execution and maintenance of drainage and other engineering works; and for payment of certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is for increased expenditure on some of the services rendered by the Office of Public Works and to cover an under-realisation in Appropriations-in-Aid of the Vote.</P>
      <P>The excess on subhead A is due to salary increases authorised since the original estimate was prepared.  Part of the cost of these increases is being met by savings on the subhead.</P>
      <P>The excess on subhead B is caused principally by increased rates for travelling which have been authorised and by the cost of incidental expenses being higher than expected.</P>
      <P>The excess on subhead D is due in the main to the purchase of the lessors' interest in Nos. 11/13 Upper O'Connell Street known as Hammam Buildings which house certain staff of the Revenue Commissioners and a telephone exchange.  A lease of the offices held by the Commissioners of Public Works expired in June, 1970, and the commissioners were faced with a renewal of the lease at a substantially increased rent or alternatively the purchase of the lessors' interest.  The State already owns the properties on each side of Nos. 11/13, namely, Nos. 9 and 10 and Nos. 14/15 Upper O'Connell Street also occupied by Revenue staff and inter-connected with Nos. 11/13.  In all the circumstances it was decided that purchase of the lessors' interest in Nos. 11/13 would be preferable to a renewal of the lease. Following protracted negotiations purchase terms were agreed early this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The excess on subheads F.1 and F.2 is in the main due to wage increases granted since the original Estimate was prepared.  The excess on subhead F.4 arises principally from increased costs of fuel, electricity, <i>et cetera.</i>  The excess on subhead G.1 and G.2 is due to wage increases and to the commencement of <Col N="1757" /> the Groody catchment drainage scheme in County Limerick.  The excess on subhead H arises from the purchase of plant which had not been provided for but which during the year was found to be necessary.  The excess on subhead K.1 arises from requirements being higher than expected and to wage increases authorised since the Estimate was prepared.</P>
    <P>A new subhead K.3 is being opened to meet the cost of conservation and restoration of Hollycross Abbey, County Tipperary.  The conservation costs will be the State's liability, but the expenditure primarily incurred by the State on work classified as restoration will be recovered from the promoters of the scheme and brought to credit as an Appropriation-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The principal short-fall in receipts, subhead M, is under item 6 which reflects the volume of work carried out by the commissioners for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and under item 2 which was adversely affected by the disruption of traffic at Dún Laoghaire caused by the fire at Menai Bridge in Wales.  Under-realisation in certain items of the subhead was partly offset by increased receipts on others, principally item 3, sales of property.</P>
    <P>The gross total of the excesses amounts to £897,000 but, allowing for savings on a number of other subheads, that figure is reduced to a net £636,000.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to draw the attention of Deputies to the fact that while subhead E overall is showing a saving, expenditure on the erection and improvement of national schools will be of the order of £3,300,000 by the end of the year against the sum of £3,000,000 originally provided.</P>

      <P>Any Estimate or Supplementary Estimate must be examined carefully because the people who give the money for those Estimates should get a clear and lucid explanation of what the money is required for and how it will be spent. This is not a concession to the public. It is their lawful right because they <Col N="1758" /> provide the money, or at least it is extracted from them by the necessary taxation.  I want to say here and now that we have the unenviable reputation of heading the league again with the highest cost of living in Europe.</P>
      <P>When we examine this Supplementary Estimate it can readily be understood that where wages and costs are involved there is a ready explanation for the increased expenditure and the revised Estimate.  Under subheads A, B, F.1, F.4, G.1, and G.2 we have wages, salaries, incidental expenses and travelling expenses.  This can be readily understood by the people because over the past year there was another rise in wages, consequent on the higher cost of living, which may be the fault of the Government.  When a Government are in charge of a country they are supposed to manage that country thriftily and not allow the cost of living to go so high that they must increase wages to offset it.  I do not intend to speak about anything except the subheads here, as arranged.  In the case of subhead D, the explanation given by the Parliamentary Secretary in his memorandum is absolutely clear.  The majority of the Deputies agreed, when speaking on the Estimate some time ago, that they were in favour of buying out office accommodation instead of leasing it.  I wish to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on buying out Hammam Buildings in O'Connell Street.  The cost may be excessive but property values are not going down.  I know that this policy meets the wishes of the Deputies and of the people.</P>
      <P>Subhead F.2 relates to furniture, fittings and utensils.  There is an explanation there that an additional sum is required to meet increases in wages and increased requirements.  Unless the employees of the Office of Public Works make furniture, fittings and utensils, how can wages be involved in this subhead?  It struck me as strange that this should be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming now to subhead E, this subhead is mentioned on page 8 where there are Appropriations-in-Aid, and the words &ldquo;Less a saving on subhead E&rdquo; appear.  Subhead E involves new works, alterations and additions.  There is £171,000 less expenditure.  Had this <Col N="1759" /> anything to do with decentralisation of the Departments of Lands and Education to Castlebar and Athlone?  If the £171,000 was spent it would pay a large amount of the cost of erecting offices in Castlebar, where they are long awaited.  Decentralisation was emphasised a month ago by the former Minister for Justice at a Fianna Fáil function in Castlebar.  Does the non-expenditure of this £171,000 mean that the money should have been sent down to Castlebar to establish these offices but that has not happened?  I would like to know why the buildings were not built even though there was an allocation of £171,000 for the year for them?</P>
    <P>Subhead G.2 refers to arterial drainage. This is important to the rural community.  The Moy arterial drainage scheme is almost finished.  The maintenance staff have taken over.  There are regular complaints in connection with employment.  There is a drop in the numbers employed on maintenance. There seems to be a similar drop in employment in the Black River-Corrib Scheme where no single man has been employed since Christmas. Married men with families should be employed, but there seems to be a drop in the employment of single men. The only work available to such men in County Mayo is that provided by the county council and the arterial drainage scheme.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to endeavour to have these young people employed, because the only alternative open to them is emigration.</P>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary was introducing the Estimate some time ago there was an allocation of £30,000 for the Corrib-Mask scheme.  This money has not been spent.  There is no indication as to when the work will start.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to give us an approximate date for the commencement of this work.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints of compensation withheld through mere technicalities. This compensation is in respect of deposits on the shores of rivers.  It is well known in Mayo that the most fertile land lies along the <Col N="1760" /> river banks.  Compensation should be paid to applicants within a month.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has given us information about the grants for national schools.  I am glad that the grant for the national schools has been increased by £300,000.  Managers and the parents and teachers of the children will welcome this scheme under which the managers of the schools can, on their own initiative, install flush toilets and other amenities. I hope that the managers will avail of the grants and that the Parliamentary Secretary and his efficient staff will deal with the applications in an expeditious manner.</P>
    <P>Has the Parliamentary Secretary any information regarding a central national school in Newport, County Mayo?  I hope that within a year at least the school, which is badly needed, will be built.</P>
    <P>Subhead M shows a shortfall of £154,000.  That could be due to miscalculation, but it is a very large sum. The explanation given here which relates to the destruction of the Menai Bridge possibly clarifies the position. This deficiency means that the Office of Public Works have over-estimated what they should have got from the various services.  There are receipts amounting to £108,000.  This leaves £46,000 to be added.  In the case of these receipts, I would like an explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary of the procedure adopted for the sale of property and produce in the stores under the Board of Works.  Is it by auction, by tender, or by contract, or how do they get rid of such things? There must be a tremendous amount of surplus stores in the storehouses and yards of the board and it would be very interesting to know how they get rid of this material.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the more important items and there are various minor matters with which we can deal on the main Estimate, because we want to get through the remaining Estimates fairly quickly as this is the last day of the financial year and if we do not, most of the people concerned may not be able to get their salaries or get various jobs under way.  From my own experience, and from information I <Col N="1761" /> have received from other Deputies, I can say that we have received the utmost co-operation from the officials of the Office of Public Works and especially from the Parliamentary Secretary. I trust that this co-operation will continue because if there is no co-operation in a Department there is no efficiency.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Kenny for his constructive remarks. The first thing to which I should refer is the property at 11 and 13 Upper O'Connell Street.  The purchase price for this property was £270,000 and the premises contain about 70,000 square feet, that is, between the office and the telephone exchange.  The purchase is a particularly good one because it puts the State in the position in which they are the owners of practically the whole block between Cathedral Street and the Savoy Cinema.  In the circumstances, in spite of policies followed in the past, on the recommenadtiton of the Commissioners of Public Works, the Minister agreed that this was a property the State should buy and I am very glad that they have done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kenny raised the question of savings under subhead E and I should like to say that in a way I am sorry we have had these savings which are principally due to difficulties arising over the acquisition of land at major fishing harbours at Killybegs and Castletownbere.  The Deputy will remember that on the main Estimate we proposed further extensions at these harbours but we ran into some difficulty acquiring land.  Subsequently the Minister for Lands, under rather recent legislation, appointed the commissioners as his agents for the purpose of implementing a compulsory purchase order in respect of these properties. Steps are now being taken to implement these compulsory powers; the matter is with our legal people at the moment and I hope that in 1971-72 we will be able to proceed with the very important work of major harbour development. Deputies in general will agree with me that any investment we can make in relation to our fisheries is a very worthwhile one because it is quite clear, under the present terms of the Common Market, that this industry <Col N="1762" /> will be in some difficulty.  Naturally, if we are hoping for a period in which to help our fishermen adapt to Common Market conditions, then to do this the most important thing is to give them proper landing facilities, proper harbours, into which they can bring bigger boats which apparently will be necessary over the years, as we have to adapt to Common Market conditions. While these savings at Killybegs and Castletownbere may help out in the overall budgetary position in Vote No. 8, they are not savings which I was very happy to make.  As the Deputy is probably aware, a survey is being carried out of all landing places on the western seaboard and we hope we may be able to proceed with some work on these very soon.  However, it is only fair to say that it is quite clear that next year the amount of money to be provided under nearly every head is going to be pared to the absolute minimum and there may be things which we would like to do which we will not be able to do in the coming year.  However, I sincerely hope that we will be able to proceed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the Minister for Finance is quite anxious to limit any increase in national expenditure in the forthcoming financial year.  As I say, as a result of this there may be things which I personally would like <Col N="1763" /> to have done which we may not be able to do, but we are proceeding on the basis that we will be able to carry on our programme as we have been doing in the past.  That is the only way in which we can do it.  As I say, the compulsory proceedings in relation to the harbours are under way and we expect to be able to proceed with them before very long.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny also referred to subhead F.2 and he wanted to know how wages were involved under this head.  The Deputy is probably aware that we operate a central furniture store in Rathmines in which we have roughly 30 employees including upholsterers, storemen and all the other people you would expect in a general furniture store.  It is quite an extensive store.  As Deputies are aware, we are proceeding with the decoration of some of the rooms in this House and we were able to find additional furniture there without having to get furniture specially made.  In this connection, too, although it is only indirectly related, we have in Inchicore a furniture workshop where they design prototypes of various furniture that will be suitable for Government Departments.  When they design these prototypes the various private manufacturers are asked to submit tenders for the supply of this furniture. The Deputy is also aware that the greater the quantity you buy of any one design in furniture, or for that matter, textiles, or plastic bottles, the better the price deal you can make.</P>
      <P>When placing orders we must always bear in mind new offices coming into Government possession.  We shall have an enormous building in Kildare Place, probably the largest single Government office in the country.  It will house the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and other offices.  I think Deputy Ryan asked about the delay in the provision of a police station in Ballyfermot.  The interior decoration there is almost completed but, strangely, we are waiting for furniture despite the furniture store position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Rathmines is not far from Ballyfermot.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows we both have the privilege of representing the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In four or five weeks we shall have the gardaí in the station in Ballyfermot.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, we are now making decent progress with the Rathmines station also.  It was a bit slow for a while but it is moving satisfactorily now.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny was mainly concerned about how wages were involved and that is how they are involved: we have these storemen and upholsterers and so on in connection with the Rathmines furniture factory.  The people there are doing some great work.  They can produce tables and items that I never knew existed at the drop of a hat when they are required for a special committee meeting, or something like that.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also raised the question of the proposed Newport central school.  The difficulty here has also arisen in other places.  Preliminary sketch plans were prepared some time ago for this school on the basis of five classrooms and a general purposes room.  Our information now from the Department of Education is that the requirements are changing and until requirements are finalised the Office of Public Works cannot make any progress. This difficulty arises from time to time because we work as agents for various Ministers.  We understood this school was to proceed but on examining the whole question of the area the Department concluded the requirements might differ from what was originally envisaged so that therefore we are not in a position at present to proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically all of this relates to the produce from the farms at the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park, Killarney, where we have an experimental farm producing milk and cattle.

      <P>Yes, Garnish Island is State property.  The principal produce is that coming from the experimental farm in the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny also inquired about sales of surplus stores.  This relates to worn out plant and equipment from the Central Engineering Workshops, mostly scrap.  We also have old furniture which is surplus to State requirements.  I understand we shall be selling some soon following stocktaking at Rathmines. We usually appoint a furniture auctioneer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they can price things much more quickly than anybody in the Office of Public Works. In general, since I became responsible for the Office of Public Works, sales of property are by public auction. Previously, I think the practice was to sell by public advertisement.  We now sell by public auction as far as possible and I try to ensure that a local auctioneer is appointed.  In one case where I appointed a Dublin auctioneer there was some objection and so I try to avoid that situation arising again.</P>

A scheme for Dunkellin has been surveyed and it is now being designed in consultation with the Department of Lands on account of the existence of the Rahassane-Turlough wildlife region.  It is not expected this will hold up the scheme.  This is a matter that would be investigated with any drainage scheme.  The scheme is not being unduly help up.  It will be dealt with when the design is completed with due regard to the money available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £64,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1971, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for External Affairs, and of certain services administered by that Office, including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of the Supplementary Estimate have been circulated to Deputies. It provides mainly for an additional sum of £58,000 under subhead A to meet the cost of Civil Service pay awards granted during the year.  It has also been found necessary to make an increased provision of £5,000 under subhead C&mdash;Post Office Services&mdash;in view of increased demands on these services.  Demands on subhead D&mdash; Repatriation and Maintenance of Destitute Irish Persons Abroad&mdash;have also been greater than anticipated due to the increase in the numbers of people travelling abroad and in the requests to our missions for assistance.  This increase <Col N="1769" /> is also reflected in the additional sum of £2,000 expected under subhead G&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;to provide for extra receipts in repatriation cases in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>It is also necessary to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for £10,500 for the Vote for International Co-operation to enable an emergency contribution of $25,000 to UNICEF for the relief and rehabilitation of women and children affected by the tidal disaster in East Pakistan in November last.  As Deputies will recall, that disaster was on an almost unprecedented scale.  The heavy death toll and the privations suffered by the survivors evoked worldwide sympathy.  The Governments of member States of the United Nations received a joint appeal from the President of the General Assembly and the Secretary-General for emergency contributions to UNICEF for the relief and rehabilitation works for women and children which that organisation was to undertake in the disaster-affected areas.  It was decided to pledge, subject to Dáil approval, an emergency contribution of $25,000 on Ireland's behalf.  I am sure that Deputies will agree that it was appropriate to give this practical indication of the sympathy which the people of this country felt for the victims of the disaster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We appreciate that later this year we will have an opportunity of discussing foreign affairs in greater detail.  There are many matters on which we would wish to address the House but we will leave more detailed discussion until then.  I am surprised, however, that we find ourselves debating Foreign Affairs under the External Affairs umbrella.  I thought this change had already taken place and that it would have found its imprint on the Order Paper of the Dáil because the order changing the title of the Department has already been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say, incidentally, in relation to the change of title of the Department that I am very disappointed that once again we appear to be imitating in a servile manner decisions taken abroad instead of looking at the situation anew and making our own decisions.  The word &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; is not, in fact, the happiest word to <Col N="1770" /> attach to the activities of a Department which is concerned not with relationships between States in the manner of the 19th century and earlier periods but more concerned with international co-operation.  Any dictionary will define &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; as something belonging to another nation or country, something alien to or remote from or not connected with a country. There would be no purpose in having a separate department to deal with the relations between this and other countries if they were entirely remote and unconnected, if they were alien. We should have taken the progressive step of christening the Department the Department of International Affairs because that, in fact, is what it is. This is the way in which we should be encouraging ourselves to think and the world to act in a spirit of international co-operation.</P>
    <P>There is an interaction between the activities of this Department and other countries but not in the sense of being alien, remote and hostile.  On this first occasion that we discuss matters of an international nature I should like to express disappointment that we did not call this Department the Department of International Affairs. As interdependence grows between nations, as trade replaces war, as the means of communication and international relationships increase, it is of paramount importance that we abandon the old approach of the rest of the world being against us and that nations would cease considering all other nations as being hostile to them.  The pursuit of national selfinterest is a legitimate priority of any nation just as the pursuit of one's own self-interest is a perfectly appropriate activity for human beings subject of course to behaving in an orderly and just manner towards other nations and other individuals.</P>
    <P>It is important when we engage in relations with other States for us to maintain the greatest possible degree of political independence.  The degree of political independence which a State endeavours to maintain must out of self-interest be compatible with economic, social and political forces.  We have a clear obligation as a sovereign <Col N="1771" /> State to make our contribution towards the preservation of world peace.  We have a moral obligation to all mankind but it is also promoted by selfinterest. We should very clearly state that Ireland has a commitment to be neutral militarily.  There has been an unfortunate development in our international standing over the last decade which to some extent has been promoted by the <i>ex-gratia</i> declarations of our preparedness to abandon our neutral position.  Such statements have been made by the present Minister and by the present and the previous Taoiseach. As we are very properly concerned with Ireland's possible membership of the EEC it is very important that we should recognise the motivation for the EEC.  It was not a motivation out of desire for material welfare but it was an anxiety not to permit Europe, which had caused two world wars within itself this century, to become yet again the trigger factor in a terrible international war.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, and I have no wish to develop this matter to any great length but the Vote does, of course, cover all the activities of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I believe that this particular aspect of our relations with foreign States is so critical that it would be unwise to allow this, the first opportunity we have had for a year to discuss our international affairs, to pass without at least a passing reference to it.</P>
      <P>One of the most critical areas of the Minister's activity both in the past year and in the immediate future is our relations with Britain.  What I have to say does not arise out of any Anglophobia, a feeling which I trust I do not share and certainly would not wish to influence my thinking on the matter, but within the last four months we have seen five instances in which our nearest neighbour has trespassed on the sovereignty and integrity of this State.</P>

      <P>We shall have another opportunity, but I am entitled to say that last November we on this side of the House were asked to speak moderately about the outrageous behaviour of British vessels because the Government were making representation to the British authorities.  We were led to believe <Col N="1773" /> that these representations might in some way become less effective if loud protest were to be made in this House.  I will leave the matter by saying it now appears that the representations to which the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred on 17th November last have proved to be ineffective and if diplomatic manoeuvres are not going to make the British behave in a civilised manner towards us then we shall have to take defensive measures to protect Irish vessels from the intervention of which we complain.</P>
      <P>Some of this additional Estimate has been necessitated by the very welcome switch of emphasis from United Nations activities to European affairs in the last year.  To say this is a welcome change is not in any way to diminish the importance of Ireland's contribution to the United Nations or to make a plea for a narrowing of our outlook; it is to say that we had got ourselves into a position of disinterest as far as European economic and social affairs were concerned.  Any money which the Government require to increase the staffing of our embassies and other offices in Europe will be given as far as the Fine Gael Party is concerned in the realisation that money so invested will be likely to produce for us considerable benefit in the years immediately ahead.</P>
      <P>It is now 14 years since the Treaty of Rome was signed and 14 months since the end of the transition period.  Judging by the many erroneous statements made by people in relation to Ireland's application to join the EEC there is a terrible degree of ignorance in our community.  I must charge the Department of Foreign Affairs with appalling neglect in the discharge of a function which it clearly had but did not carry out.  It had the function not only of explaining Ireland to other countries but also of explaining to Ireland what other countries were doing, what they were endeavouring to achieve, how our relationships with them could be improved and how in particular we could match our economic independence to our political independence by spreading our economic and commercial interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now two years since my predecessor <Col N="1774" /> as Fine Gael spokesman on foreign affairs complained about the fact that the only means of information in relation to the EEC to Members of this House was the picking up of bits of information from papers here and there and through leaks from meetings and organisations abroad.  Last November we were informed there was a unit established in the Department to distribute information and to keep people informed on the meaning of the EEC and of the negotiations for Irish membership.  To date we have heard nothing except a dramatic silence, if one can hear a silence, from that particular quarter.  As I pointed out recently, when voluntary agencies are able to distribute regularly bulletins and papers of an informative kind, it is deplorable that a Government Department, with all its staff, influences, opportunities and means for acquiring knowledge has not yet furnished our people with the information they must have if they are to make, as they will some day be called on to make, a mature decision as to whether or not Ireland should join the EEC.</P>
    <P>Once again we are asked to vote additional money for the repatriation of our citizens who find themselves in distress while travelling abroad.  We can understand that the need for this is likely to increase as more and more of our people travel abroad.  I should, however, like to hear from the Minister &mdash;I trust he will be able to give the figure or, if not, arrange to have the information supplied&mdash;the number of Irish citizens who annually have found themselves in distress abroad and what arrangements are made to recover the expenditure on these for the benefit of the Exchequer.  It should not be necessary to vote considerably increased amounts under this heading if the Department recovers a worthwhile proportion of the expenses incurred. I do not for one moment suggest that there should not be a generous attitude on the part of our various missions in rendering assistance to citizens who find themselves in distress abroad; it would be entirely undesirable that we should abandon them to serious difficulty in foreign <Col N="1775" /> countries.  Immediate assistance should, of course, be rendered so that their immediate distress is relieved.  The distress will be all the greater because they are in an alien atmosphere.  I have reason to doubt that the Department pursues as efficiently as it should the question of a refund of the expenditure when these people return home.</P>
    <P>This is United Nations Year to combat racism.  The amount of money we contribute in this particular field is, I am sorry to say, extremely small and I wish this Supplementary Estimate contained a far higher contribution from Ireland towards combating racism.  We are a country keenly conscious of the injustices which can be done to minorities by majorities which have no concern with the giving of human rights to certain sections.  Appalling as that situation is, and unjustifiable as it is, is it not a great deal less appalling than the situation which exists in some countries where minorities deny fundamental human rights and opportunities to the vast majority of the citizens?  This is a generation which is supposed to respect human rights and which has subscribed to declarations of human rights across the world and this is, therefore, a situation that should not be allowed to continue. We, as a country which has suffered so much deprivation in the past because of the non-recognition of our fundamental human rights, should be more generous in the contribution we make towards the removal of apartheid in South Africa and all forms of racism.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that Ireland should be one of the European countries which have not yet subscribed to the Council of Europe Convention condemning racism and discrimination. I understand the official attitude was, until recent times, that it would be inappropriate for us to pass legislation condemning discrimination because it might be said that we were putting ourselves into a position of being holier than our fellowmen in Northern Ireland and it would be diplomatically unwise for us to take a particular <Col N="1776" /> stand.  The sorry events of the last 18 months have removed the need for exercising that particular form of ineffective discretion and I would urge that there be no further delay in giving the appropriate signatures and ratifications to the European Convention.</P>
    <P>I find myself restrained by the limitations of the debate and I shall say no more other than that we believe the increases sought are entirely justified. For a long, long time in this House it was the practice to be niggardly when treating with the Department of Foreign Affairs and to query in a very petulant way the expenditure of money on embassies and staff.  We are now in a position in which at last people are prepared to accept the importance of having a strong Department of Foreign Affairs, properly staffed with skilled diplomats.  We are extremely lucky in the high quality of our diplomats and experts in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  With the increased duties which proposed integration with Europe has imposed upon them they are now, we believe, unable to give of their best and there is need to expand the staff in our European embassies.</P>

      <P>We are voting extra money for the civil servants in the Minister's Department and I am justifying the expenditure of that additional money by saying that, far from it being too much, it possibly errs on the side of being too little having regard to the tremendous commitments immediately ahead of us, one of which is the need to open an embassy in Norway.  Last year we remedied the situation in relation to Denmark.  We should certainly have an embassy in each of the member nations or applicant nations of the EEC because we certainly need not only a listening post but also a mouthpiece in the capitals of all western European countries so that our voice will be adequately heard.  We should also be considering diplomatic relations with other European countries.  This is a subject to which we will be able to address ourselves when the more substantial <Col N="1777" /> Estimate comes before the House.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party will not oppose these Supplementary Estimates.  The conventions under which we necessarily have to work here in discussing Supplementary Estimates of this kind necessarily make our discussion a little bit artificial in the sense that, if we attempt to widen the scope of the debate, we will be pulled up, as the previous speaker was, by the Chair.  On the other hand, if we concentrate strictly on the matters before us we are really not sufficiently well informed about the matters behind these subheads to know whether or not the increase is justified.  There is an increase of £5,000 for telegrams.  We do not know whether or not that increase is justified.  It all depends on what was in the telegrams.  We do not see the telegrams. The artificiality of the proceedings here is somewhat heightened by the fact that the responsible Minister is not able to be here.  Furthermore, the Minister for Finance, who is acting for him and who necessarily is not familiar with the details behind these Supplementary Estimates, is not accompanied by any official of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  There is no official of the Department of Foreign Affairs here.  Perhaps it is rather a pity.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has increased considerably in importance and significance in relation to the nation's life by reason of the Government's application to join the EEC.  It has a bearing on every aspect of our national life, and the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is responsible for the EEC negotiations makes any discussion of the Vote for Foreign Affairs a matter of considerable moment, whatever about the question of the supplementaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say a word about the change of name.  &ldquo;External Affairs&rdquo; still figures on the papers before us but the name has subsequently been changed to &ldquo;Foreign Affairs&rdquo;.  Personally I rather deprecate this change.  We are disposed in this country to confuse frequent changes in nomenclature with progress.  The change does not imply any substantial change.  Nothing of substance has happened, nothing that <Col N="1778" /> would justify even the extra expenditure on official stationery which presumably is the main change required.  At this stage of our national existence we ought to deprecate changes in name that do not involve changes in substance.</P>
    <P>In general, I think the Minister for Foreign Affairs enjoys a rather wide measure of sympathy and support in this House.  I think it is realised that he has been an active Minister, that he has sent a current of energy through his important Department and that he has, on many occasions, represented this country effectively.  I am sorry to have to add to that a significant criticism. In the conduct of the Department of Foreign Affairs during the past year or so there have been two forms of activity which I think we will hope will cease. One was, of course, the spate of antiPartition activity in various parts of the world at one time.  That has faded away but I hope it will not be resuscitated as a result of any future pressure.</P>
    <P>The other form of activity is of more significance.  The first might be ascribed to Government policy generally, but the second is an action of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I believe a mistake, that was, when he indicated that we would be willing to enter military commitments as part of our EEC policy.  That was an unnecessary commitment and I think a mistake by the Minister himself, and I hope he will take the opportunity to withdraw from that position.</P>
    <P>I will press on from that as I realise we may not discuss wide issues in any great detail here.  I would, however, like to refer to two matters as we are asked to contribute here more money in connection with the United Nations.  I would like to differ, in an amicable way, in emphasis from what my friend, Deputy Richie Ryan, said when he spoke of a shifting away from the United Nations and towards Europe. I do not think there should be any conflict here and perhaps Deputy Ryan did not intend to suggest that there should be.  Our commitment to the United Nations and the contribution we make to it remain of importance. However, I would think our presence in the United Nations would be more <Col N="1779" /> justifiable and therefore the financial commitment we make would be more justifiable if our position in that Assembly became more distinct.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been preoccupied with other matters, with Europe, but I have not been able to see that our representation at the United Nations has any very distinct position.  There is a tendency for the smaller countries in the United Nations who are situated geographically as we are to be carried in the wake of a major power, particularly the United States.  That has been so for some years in the past and it is still so.  This is unfortunate at a time when the United States has been engaged on a course which seems to many people in this country and to a great many growing numbers of people in the United States disastrous.  Ireland has had little or nothing to say or nothing of any clarity to say for example on the widening war in Indo-China which a growing proportion of the American electorate regard as a disastrous course. If we have nothing to say on a matter like that, then to that extent our involvement in the United Nations itself becomes questionable.  If all we are doing is to acquiesce in the policies of a major power, what does our activity signify?  Again I am aware I may not develop this line of talk but I hope to do so on the main Estimate when the opportunity arises.</P>
    <P>Part of the Supplementary Estimate which is before us concerns aid to the people of East Pakistan in respect of a natural disaster.  We welcome the support that Ireland was able to give there, but since that time a manmade disaster has befallen the same population and it has befallen for essentially the same reasons as brought about widespread sympathy in this country for the people of Biafra, as it then was, when they attempted to assert a right of self-determination.  It does appear that the people of East Bengal, East Pakistan, are united or almost united on this issue, and there are 75 millions of them.  They are now about to be suppressed by armed force.  This is part of a general human tendency, to crush people over whom you have a military advantage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1780" /> The action being taken by West Pakistan against East Pakistan is an example of an imperialist, suppressive war.  I would hope that in the case of East Pakistan, we will not be as mealy-mounthed as we were in the early days of the Nigeria-Biafra conflict.  In the case of people who were affected by a natural disaster, we were willing to contribute to helping them and now that the people of the same area are struck by a manmade disaster, are we prepared to do anything to help them? This question relates also to matters nearer home&mdash;matters that affect us in our own island, essentially the claim of one group to impose their will on others.  I do not care whether that is a claim by northern Protestants to order about northern Catholics and deprive them of rights and so on or whether it is a question of a claim made by some people that the majority of the inhabitants of this island have the right to lay down the law for a minority who are Protestants.  It is the same arrogant and woolly state of mind.  We ought to resist it.  It belongs to the kind of principles that it is important for us to assert and without which our membership of the United Nations is a vague and empty thing. We shall support these Supplementary Estimates.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan and Deputy Cruise-O'Brien referred to the change of name of the Department.  To the best of my knowledge, nobody has ever suggested that inherent in the change of name would be any momentous changes of any kind.  It was a relatively small matter and the main reason for the change was that there was some connotation by the use of the title &ldquo;External Affairs&rdquo; of membership of the British Commonwealth but it was not and was never suggested to be a matter of any major importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Ceann Comhairle has indicated to Deputy Ryan who was making some comment on the question of neutrality that this question is outside the scope of this debate. Therefore, I shall not pursue that matter except to say, as a matter of interest, that some years ago there was carried out and published a study <Col N="1781" /> by the Council of Europe in regard to neutrality.  Personally, I consider that study to have been revealing in regard to very many different kinds of neutrality that operate in the world today.  However, the comments made on this matter would be far more informed if the speakers concerned had familiarised themselves with the contents of that report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not read it but I am sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs has read it.  Deputy Ryan complained that information relating to the EEC was not being provided by the Department.  I am surprised to hear this complaint because it seems to me that information is being furnished at a fast rate.  Unfortunately, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs has had to say here on one or two occasions, it would appear that some people who complain loudly that they are not getting information do not take the trouble to acquaint themselves with the information that is being furnished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only information we get are copies of the Minister's speeches after we have already read the Minister's speeches from supplied scripts which go to the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not true and the Deputy knows that even within recent times a document has been issued in relation to the progress of the negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been others also.  It is not true for the Deputy to say that they merely receive copies of the Minister's speeches.  Furthermore, some of the speeches made by the Minister in this regard have been designed precisely to convey information of the kind suggested by the Deputy. <Col N="1782" /> Therefore, the making available of copies of these speeches is part of the whole process of giving information in regard to developments in the EEC.</P>
      <P>In regard to another point raised by Deputy Ryan.  I shall convey his suggestion to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he would consider furnishing the Deputy with details of the number of citizens claiming assistance from our embassies abroad and the steps being taken to recover the money. I have not that information available offhand but I would hazard a guess that it is likely that the recovery of money expended in this way in a particular year would spill over into the next financial year.  Therefore, if there should be an increase, say, in the current financial year, it would have to be provided for in this way and a lot of it might not be recovered until the following financial year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien made a passing comment on what he called &ldquo;anti-Partition activity&rdquo;.  In that regard I would point out, firstly, that what I think he was referring to was not carried out by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>Finally, in regard to the question of East Pakistan, as was pointed out by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien there is provision here for assistance in dealing with the natural disaster which occurred there.  With regard to the recent developments there, perhaps I should tell the House that arrangements have been made to evacuate Irish citizens from East Pakistan.  In regard to the political situation there, it is clear, I think, that at present the position is quite fluid.  Indeed, the reports available are inadequate to enable us at this stage to make any statement of policy on that matter.  I, therefore, do not propose to attempt to do so.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1971, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Transport and Power, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary to meet excess expenditure on certain subheads of the Vote which could not be foreseen when the original Estimate was prepared.  The sum of £324,000 provided under subhead A is required to meet the 12th round pay increases and other increases arising from the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Rates of overtime in certain departmental grades were altered with effect from the 1st October, 1967, and additional pay for Sunday duty and public holidays was provided for.  There is an excess of £137,000 on subhead B.1&mdash;Travelling and Incidental Expenses. There is a token sum of £10 in respect of subhead F.1 which is to enable the transfer to administration and general expenses of Bord Fáilte of the sum of £200,000 from the provision of £600,000 for interest grants. There is an excess of £27,000 on subhead L which deals with international organisations.  An additional £53,000 is necessary for subhead P to meet the cost of special inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been necessary to take into account also a deficiency in Appropriations-in-Aid of £315,000.  The deficit shortfall in the surplus on Shannon and Cork Airports account is now estimated at £425,000 due to reductions in the number of flights passing through Shannon Airport.  The decline is largely <Col N="1787" /> due to rigid enforcement by the US authorities and IATA of the regulations on charters and to a drop in the number of US military flights.  There is a surplus of £110,000 on the operating account for the year ended 31st March, 1970, at Dublin Airport bringing the net deficit down to £315,000. An adjustment of £250,000 as between passenger service charges&mdash;U.3&mdash;and Dublin Airport operating account for the year ending 31st March, 1971&mdash; U.7&mdash;is necessary to rectify a printing error.</P>
    <P>The total excess expenditure of £856,010 has been met from savings on other subheads so that the net sum required is £10.  The bulk of the additional £137,000 required for the travelling and incidentals subhead is attributable to payments made to the British authorities in respect of the search carried out by their vessels and personnel for the wreckage of the Aer Lingus Viscount aircraft, which crashed into the sea off Tuskar Rock in March, 1968.</P>
    <P>The additional £27,000 under subhead L arises in connection with Ireland's membership of the Convention relating to Co-operation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol).  This convention which came into operation in 1963, provides for a unified air traffic control system over western Europe at heights above 20,000 feet.  In accordance with the convention member States are required to contribute to the costs of operation of the organisation. The levels of contributions are fixed jointly by member States and this year our contribution involved an increase of £27,000 on the original Estimate. It is necessary to provide for this to meet our commitments.</P>
    <P>Consultants were engaged to examine the position regarding cross-Channel freight shipping.  The background to this inquiry was a planned large-scale investment and development by the B &amp; I Company and by British Rail which could have resulted in over-capacity in the cross-Channel shipping trade and an element of incompatibility in the policies followed by CIE and B &amp; I in this area.  A major review of the policies of State companies engaged <Col N="1788" /> in the trade was made and I availed of this opportunity to invite the consultant's views on the capital structure of the B &amp; I Company.  The House will be in a position to discuss the affairs of this company in detail during the debate on the British and Irish Steam Packet Company Limited (Acquisition) (Amendment) Bill, 1970.</P>
    <P>Consultants were also engaged to assist a joint committee, comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Finance and CIE, which was set up following a serious increase in CIE's losses to investigate the financial position of CIE and to identify possible corrective measures.  The committee has not yet completed its assignment.  I do not propose to go into the affairs of CIE in this speech as the activities of the board were discussed in detail in the House in December last during the debate on the Transport Bill, 1970.</P>
    <P>Next I come to the provision in relation to tourism.  As Deputies are aware, 1969 and 1970 were difficult years for the tourist industry.  Tourist receipts in 1970 are provisionally estimated at £101.2 million as compared with £97.8 million in 1969 and £93 million in 1968.  These figures indicate modest increases in very difficult circumstances but the increases have not been sufficient to offset changes in money values. In terms of constant money values, therefore, our tourist income has shown a decline of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent in each of the last two years.</P>
    <P>The main reasons for the fall-off in growth were the Northern Ireland disturbances and the world-wide publicity given to them, and rising prices. Revenue from British and Northern Ireland visitors fell short of target in 1970 while income from the North American, Continental and other markets was either on or above target.</P>
    <P>The problems affecting the tourist industry have had my close and constant attention during the past year.  I have had discussions with Bord Fáilte about the measures to be adopted to deal with these problems and I have appointed two additional members to the board to enlarge the expertise and experience at that level.  The board <Col N="1789" /> itself has carried out a review of its operations and has effected changes designed to strengthen its activities and to ensure the most effective operation.</P>
    <P>I have also had consultations with all sectors of the tourist industry, both State-sponsored bodies and the private sector.  I have found a keen awareness of the importance of tourism in the economy and of the challenges facing the industry at the present time.  The positive response of the industry is illustrated by the formation during the year of the National Tourism Council, which is representative of all sectors and which will serve to improve the machinery for communication and consultation within the industry.  This was a worthwhile and welcome innovation which will strengthen the tourist industry and facilitate an integrated approach to the task of expanding tourism revenue.</P>
    <P>I believe that the main need at present is for intensification of our marketing effort.  In accordance with this, I arranged for Bord Fáilte to undertake a special promotional campaign in our main markets over the past few months.  The purpose of this campaign is to win back lost traffic and to develop further tourist growth over the next two to three years.  The cost of the campaign will be £395,000.</P>
    <P>Half of this is being provided by this Supplementary Estimate.  An amount of £200,000 out of the £600,000 provided for interest grants in the current year was not called on because of problems arising from the banks strike. I am accordingly proposing to transfer these unused interest grant moneys to Bord Fáilte's general grant-in-aid for administration, operational and general expenses towards financing the special promotional campaign.  The balance of the cost of the campaign, i.e. £195,000, will be met out of the board's grant-in-aid allocation for 1971-72.  The campaign has included increased consumer advertising backed up by public relations and sales activity with appropriate supporting print and distribution.</P>
    <P>In view of the amount of speculation about the tourist industry, I am sure Deputies would wish to have a firm <Col N="1790" /> indication of the general tourism prospects for 1971.  In a normal year this would be difficult enough at this stage but the current exceptional situation renders it completely impossible to give any firm estimate of tourism income for the coming season.  Bord Fáilte have, however, told me that they are generally satisfied with the progress of the special campaign in North America and Europe and that present indications from these markets are reasonably good.  In Britain, inquiries to Bord Fáilte offices were running at a particularly high rate before the commencement of the British postal strike.  The board undertook for the duration of the strike special measures, in conjunction with the trade, to offset the worst effects of the strike.  Since the resumption of normal postal facilities in Britain earlier this month, postal inquiries to Bord Fáilte are at about the same level as last year.</P>
    <P>I have impressed on Bord Fáilte and on all tourism interests the need for the most vigorous marketing effort in the coming year.  Many of the difficulties which prevailed in 1969 and 1970 are still with us and it is essential that all sectors of the industry should be indefatigable in their efforts to maintain and expand the tourist trade which has played and will continue to play an important part in our national economic growth.</P>
    <P>I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather peculiar, if not significant, that the last occasion on which we had a debate on Transport and Power was on the day prior to the adjournment of the Dáil for the summer recess last July which meant that we had a number of Estimates fitted in and rushed through without proper debate, as has happened today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing of significance in the Minister's speech.  I can understand the point he has made in relation to the fact that an investigation was being carried out into the affairs of CIE and pending the outcome of the investigation it would not be easy to have a constructive debate on the affairs of the company.  The Minister <Col N="1791" /> says that consultants have been engaged to examine the position in regard to cross-Channel traffic.  A Bill in relation to the B and I company has been circulated and will be debated in the House some time in the future.  I am amazed that the Minister did not avail of the opportunity presented by this Supplementary Estimate, limited though it is, to give us details regarding the tourist industry.  The Minister has made general statements here which are totally divorced from the harsh realities of the situation in the industry. The Minister made a statement here on 23rd July, 1970, in which he said:</P>
    <P>One must, at the same time, while facing up to the problems and seeking to achieve a solution of them, refrain from any panic stations, any immediate rushing into short-term apparently remedial measures that might be of no particular value.  For this reason I asked Bord Fáilte and the deputation from the Irish Hotels Federation, after very long discussions I had with each body, to prepare for me complete appraisal in depth of where they see the future of the tourist industry for next year.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>I want immediate action on this front because, if there is a problem, now is the time to diagnose it, assess it, and provide for the necessary finance and the necessary action to deal with it.</P>
    <P>In spite of what the Minister says and the fact that he had meetings with Bord Fáilte, we are now at the beginning of the 1971 season and the problems which were there last year are still with us.  The situation, if anything, is worse now than it was last year particularly in relation to the British market.  What practical steps have been taken since 23rd July, 1970?  The Minister has met the board of Bord Fáilte and has had consultations with various people.  What practical steps have been taken?  An additional subvention of £395,000 has been made available to Bord Fáilte.  It has been made available in a very circuitous manner. It is a transfer of £200,000 from the <Col N="1792" /> loans fund and the balance is to come from next year's Estimate.  Did the Minister have a meeting last September with Bord Fáilte, the hotels and other interests?  What assessment was made of the difficulties encountered last year?  Apart from the additional subvention what steps were taken to tackle the problems which were encountered last year?  All the evidence indicates that, in fact, little or no progress was made.  The situation has definitely worsened.  I do not regard the postal strike in Britain as being an adequate explanation of the problems in our tourist trade.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte is a State body charged with responsibility for the Irish tourist industry.  The situation in that body has deteriorated.  A marketing manager has resigned.  A number of key posts have remained unfilled over the past months.  There has been no manager in the Glasgow office for some time.  Various people have been sent there and taken out again.  There are three key appointments in other parts of Britain which have not been filled. An important post in London has not been filled.  One of the staff of Bord Fáilte in Birmingham has gone to the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, leaving his post unfilled.  The morale within Bord Fáilte among the staff is deplorably low.  Staff relations are very bad. When the Estimate comes before the House I will explain what is happening. Last July the Minister told us that restructuring of the board would take place as soon as he had a chance to introduce the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>What restructuring has taken place? Why was it that particularly in relation to marketing to which the Minister refers the marketing manager who had an outstanding record prior to his entry to Bord Fáilte was compelled to go out in the middle of the peak promotional period?  These are matters which indicate that a very serious situation exists in the State body charged with responsibility for the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>In relation to this extra subvention I asked the Minister, when the Dáil resumed after the summer recess last year, whether £395,000 would be adequate and I said that I believed this <Col N="1793" /> money could be spent in Britain alone. The Minister's reply was: &ldquo;I am looking into this.&rdquo;  The time has come to face facts and there is no use trying to hide from the situation which exists. I want to look at the situation realistically and I want to put on record the facts as I have found them particularly in relation to the three main markets, Britain, North America and Europe.  I cannot speak with practical experience of North America, or of the European market, but I have had considerable practical experience in Great Britain. The situation in regard to the British market has been deteriorating for quite a long time.  Admittedly, the situation was aggravated by the unfortunate troubles in the north and the political situation here last May also affected our tourist market in Britain.  Admittedly also, the postal strike came at a very unfortunate time, just at the peak booking period and when our advertising promotional campaign was at its peak.  However, over and above these factors there are much more serious and much more fundamental factors having a very adverse effect on our tourism potential in Britain.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago I pointed out at Question Time that for a long number of years it has been the policy of Bord Fáilte to bring travel agents over here on familiarisation tours.  Year after year numerous travel agents have been brought here&mdash;I am speaking now in relation to the British market&mdash;on familiarisation tours.  In fact, practically every travel agent there has been brought over here at the expense of Bord Fáilte, or his expenses have been contributed to by way of free transport by the B and I or Aer Lingus. Receptions have been held in Britain and everything that could be done has been done to ensure that the British travel agents were completely familiar with the potential of Ireland.  What do we find?  We find that over the past three years British travel agents have been losing interest in Ireland.  The situation has now been reached in which we are contemplating the establishment of a national tourist agency or the purchase of an interest in Cooks Travel.  This is because the British travel agents have written Ireland off.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1794" /> There are a few with whom I am familiar who still display a reasonable interest in Ireland and I refer particularly to Frames, and to Olley Travel of London, Camkin Travel of Warwickshire and particularly to Emerald Isle Holiday Tours of Manchester who specialise in Irish holidays, but, by and large, the overall situation there is that agents have only been looking at Ireland with a secondary interest.</P>
    <P>There are reasons for this, reasons which Bord Fáilte should have been aware of and which they should have brought to the notice of the Minister to enable the necessary action to be taken.  It is madness that at the start of the tourist season in 1971, at the end of a promotion period and so forth, we are now talking about setting up a national travel agency and buying an interest in Cooks.  That should have been done last September or October. That was the time to start.  I understand from replies here that an examination of the sales structure and marketing set-up of Bord Fáilte is being undertaken.  Why was this not done in September or even in October?  Certainly it should have been done before Christmas.  There was adequate time from July to Christmas to set up whatever new machinery was necessary.  If the Minister looks up my speech in July last he will see that I am now making the same speech because we knew as much last July as we do now. I do not know what has gone wrong. The situation is serious and it is giving rise to grave concern.  Drastic action will have to be taken if we are to recover our foothold on the British market and generate additional traffic from the British market.</P>
    <P>I have already said that the money being voted here could be profitably spent in Britain alone but instead it has been allocated between the three main markets I have mentioned.  The amount provided for the British market is totally inadequate and results show that expenditure on promotion in Britain over the last four or five months has been totally inadequate and unrealistic.  The Minister stated that bookings from Britain at the moment are running at the same level as last year.  I wish to contradict him <Col N="1795" /> on that.  The present bookings from Britain are not at the same level as they were last year and unless the Minister can produce definite evidence I will not accept what he says.  I have been reliably informed that B &amp; I bookings show a reduction of 15 per cent and that British Rail Bookings show a reduction of about 18 per cent. I have not got figures for the national airlines but from what I can gather the position there will be the same.  I think it is reasonable at this stage to predict that there will be a reduction of at least 20 per cent in traffic from Britain this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the fact that advertisements have been issued for the post of temporary medical officer at Shinrone, County Offaly; that a long term temporary officer has held this appointment since 1964; that no indication has been given to her that her appointment is being terminated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the matter to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The termination of a temporary appointment of this nature is entirely a matter for the health authority and I have no authority to issue a direction in regard to the decision taken.  I understand, however, that the term of office of the doctor concerned does not end until 4th April and that it will, therefore, be a matter for the new Midland Health Board to appoint a person to fill the vacancy.  Before doing so the chief executive officer will consider the application for reappointment <Col N="1802" /> which has been made by the present holder of the post.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that no official intimation was given to the medical officer concerned that her appointment was being terminated?  Would he not agree that in ordinary courtesy and in order to conform with the official&mdash;shall we say &mdash;connection between the county manager and the medical officer concerned he should have intimated in writing to the medical officer that her appointment was being terminated?  In view of the fact that he has failed to do so, would the Minister not intervene and see that the matter is regularised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall refer the Deputy's observation on this matter to the county manager whose jurisdiction in relation to this appointment ceases on April 1st.  I shall also refer it to the chief executive officer who will be responsible for making the decision after 1st April.  If there is an irregularity in regard to this matter I shall see that it is attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry.  I should say that the term of office of the person concerned does not end until 4th April so there is still time to put right anything that is wrong in the administrative sense or in relation to any communication that should have been made to this person.  I still have time until 4th April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Deputy alleges, I suggest there is some reflection on the existing holder of the office.  If they advertise for another temporary person, there is a suggestion that the present holder is incompetent. It casts a reflection on this person and I suggest the Minister make an immediate inquiry to the county manager so that the matter can be resolved very quickly.  It would be a different situation if they were appointing a permanent officer but to appoint another temporary person to replace the present one suggests that the present one is not satisfactory and has not been told about it and it is a very serious matter.</P>

So far the board have spent £50,000 on craft and shore facilities and marine works in Athlone and Lough Ree and this does not take account of the scheme for a new jetty in Athlone, which Bord Fáilte are undertaking jointly with Athlone Urban District Council.

The workshops were aimed at getting business for 1972 but the Irish participants also availed of the opportunity to secure tourist business for the current year.  While it is too early to make a firm estimate of tourist traffic from North America in 1971 the indications are that business from that market will be better than in 1970.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of a <Col N="1810" /> survey on 3rd July, 1970, as to the stamping of insurance cards of the workers of the employer concerned, it was found that insurance contributions were due in respect of the insured person referred to for the period 16th June, 1969, to 8th May, 1970.  On 17th July, 1970 his 1969 insurance card with only two contributions was lodged with the Department.  Action taken by my Department for payment of all the contributions due in respect of the insured person concerned and others employed by the same employer met with no success and it was subsequently discovered that the employer had left the area.  His present whereabouts are not known.</P>
      <P>The claim to unemployment benefit by the insured person made on 18th May, 1970, was disallowed because less than 26 employment contributions has been paid or credited in the relevant governing contribution year 1968. On the commencement of the new benefit year on 1st June, 1970, the claim was reviewed in the light of the 1969 contribution record but could not be allowed because of the employer's failure to pay all the insurance contributions due in respect of that year. The claim will now be reconsidered under the amending regulations which were made on the 8th instant to see whether the claimant can be made eligible for unemployment benefit from that date through the grant of credits in respect of weeks for which contributions are outstanding.  The insured person is statutorily entitled to recover the benefit lost up to that date from the employer but the prospects of doing so or of recovering the arrears of contributions are not encouraging.</P>
      <P>I should add that following on the disallowance of his claim to unemployment benefit, the person in question applied for and was granted unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>It was publicly announced shortly after the development scheme at Dunmore East harbour had started that it was intended, ultimately, to charge a mooring fee for small craft using the harbour. The question of the lay-out of the moorings is at present being considered in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries after which a decision will be taken as to the amount of the fee and the date from which it will operate.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was not here in 1963 when the then Parliamentary Secretary, the late Mr. Donogh O'Malley, announced the decision to carry out this development.  The Deputy must not even be familiar with the development because there are some facilities there, very good facilities; I have seen them.  The decision in 1963 was announced in a press release, which I will make available to the Deputy if he wishes, by the Office of Public Works to the effect that charges would not be made for moorings until the improvement scheme was well advanced.  The lay-out has to be done in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Office of Public Works and local yachting interests.  The limits of the harbour area will be defined by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and charges will apply only to moorings within that area.</P>

It was only after the most careful appraisal that decisions were taken in relation to lay-offs in particular areas.  The comparative position in relation to work availability as between different areas has to be the prime determining factor but I can assure the Deputy that the Department is particularly reluctant to lay off men in remote areas of low employment; apart from social considerations lay-offs <Col N="1818" /> in such areas can create difficulties for the Department itself in the event of later work expansion.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen the statement referred to. I am not aware that, following the increase in the commercial cost of fuel oil, the glasshouse industry would find it practicable to switch to gas heating in the absence of supplies here of relatively cheap natural gas.</P>
      <P>As against the extra cost of fuel oil to the horticultural industry, I would point out that in the case of the home market measures of protection from imports apply in the case of tomatoes and other glasshouse crops.  Our exports of these are primarily to the United Kingdom where restrictions also apply to imports from countries other than Ireland.  It was recently announced by the British authorities that special aid to offset the increased fuel cost would not be granted to UK producers.</P>

      <P>This gives a total increase of 4.7d (1.96p) per gallon.  The main reasons for these increases were increases in the world prices for crude oil and increased international freight rates.  A subsidiary reason was increased internal costs of Irish oil companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this startling increase is a direct result of the repressive measures being applied by the banks following their closure and the lack of facilities for the best part of the last year, and would the Minister indicate if he can do anything to ensure that the banks, from this point forward, will not continue to apply these harsh restrictions on their customers and cause further liquidations?

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with that.  As the Deputy knows, a number of liquidations take place which have nothing to do with insolvency or even trading difficulties and they are included in the figures which I have given.  In respect of the first period for which I gave figures the percentage of liquidations in relation to the number of companies on the register was 0.14 per cent.  In respect of the second period, it was 0.25 per cent.  That means that during the bank closure a number of liquidations which would have taken place in the ordinary course of events&mdash;and bankruptcies also&mdash; were deferred because of the bank closure.  What would have taken place during that period has all come together.</P>

      <P>Despite the sorry trend of events, does the Minister not agree that there are further closures of shoe factories likely unless drastic action is taken now?  Does the Minister not have information available on his file to this effect?</P>

      <P>I am quoting figures <Col N="1830" /> back to 1965 and they show the closures which took place in each year at a time when we had a quota which was rigid and which allowed something like 5 per cent or less of the total number of shoes used in the country to be imported.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the amount of footwear imported under duty-free licences, indicating the type of footwear, the country of origin and the average cost per pair in each of the years 1960 to 1969 inclusive and in each month in 1970 and 1971 to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No import duty was payable on leather or textile footwear before 1st July, 1970, but quota restrictions operated.  Accordingly, no duty free licences for leather footwear were issued before that date.  A statement of the quantities and types of footwear to which this former quota applied and which have been licensed for duty-free importation since the removal of the quota on the 1st July, 1970, and up to 28th February, 1971, will, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, be circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>A separate statement showing quantities and types of rubber and plastic footwear for which duty-free licences have been issued in 1968, 1969 and the half-year ended 30th June, 1970, will also be circulated with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle. These latter types have not been subject to quota restrictions since 1st January, 1965.  Figures for the years 1960 to 1967 are not available.  The corresponding figures for the second half of 1970 and 1971 to date are available but could not be compiled immediately in suitable form.  If the Deputy puts down a question I can, however, make the figures available to him in the near future.  I have no knowledge of the value or origin of footwear imported under duty-free licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is probably aware that licences for quantities outside the appointed quota were issued up to the 30th June, 1970, for special types of leather and textile footwear.  In accordance with statutory requirements statements <Col N="1831" /> were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas showing the names of recipients, the number of licences and the quantities licensed in each of the six-month periods covered by each of the quota period orders.</P>
    <P>Duty free licences are issued only for types of footwear for which it is considered suitable substitutes are not available from the Irish footwear <Col N="1832" /> manufacturers.  The total quantities for which duty-free licences were issued do not necessarily equal the total quantities imported under licence in the corresponding periods since licences may not always be fully utilised.  Information as to the actual quantities imported under licence is not, therefore, available.</P>
    <P>Following are the two statements for circulation:</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1833" />
      <Col N="1834" /> Quantities and Types of leather and canvas footwear licensed during the period July, 1970 to February, 1971.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Cunningham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that no urgent water supply or sewerage scheme is at present being held up through lack of finance.  There must, of course, necessarily be a limit on the amount of capital that can be made available for the financing of the local authorities' sanitary service programme in any year having regard to the needs of other essential services such as housing.  A sum of over £4.8 million was, however, spent on these services in the current financial year.  This is a record figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will agree that all water schemes and all sewerage schemes that come for sanction are urgent and will he also agree that all local authorities, including the Cork County Council, have been very annoyed with his Department over the slow sanction or <Col N="1838" /> the refusal of sanction in many cases of schemes which have been on their books for a considerable time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that all water and sewerage schemes are urgent but there is the question of relativity and within the framework of the amount of capital available we are taking the most urgent of the sanitary service schemes and again in their wider context of housing and other activities we must use priorities when there is not an unlimited supply of money available.</P>

      <P>I assume the question refers to the local improvements scheme.

      <P>Yes, it is a very popular scheme and in each county we have a very heavy demand for schemes of this kind.  Again, it is a question of not having enough money to do all the schemes in one year.  These schemes will be done over a number of years. This is the logical way to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reported progress I had been referring to the situation that now exists eight or nine months after the Minister had come into this House last July and given an undertaking that the necessary action would be taken to overcome the difficulties which had then appeared in the tourist industry.  It is an appalling situation and a completely indefensible one as far as the Minister is concerned. We find that instead of the improvement in Bord Fáilte, particularly in the marketing section, which the Minister had undertaken would be brought about, the situation, as we enter a new tourist season so far as Bord Fáilte is concerned, has deteriorated considerably. Without going into detail which would take a couple of hours, the sitution now is that instead of facing the problems which were there last summer and which should have been tackled in the early autumn in time to launch a realistic dynamic promotion and marketing campaign over the winter months we find that the marketing manager has resigned, several key marketing posts in the company have been left unfilled, staff morale is at its lowest and the industrial market research company which examined the internal set-up of Bord Fáilte have made some very drastic recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find there are fewer British travel agents pushing Irish Ireland than ever before.  The Hotel and Accommodation Directory for this year, the most important piece of promotion literature which should have been in the hands of travel agents last November or October, was not circulated until February.  We also find the current issue of that directory has undergone drastic change and has been considerably reduced in size.  I should like the Minister to explain why there was such delay in circulating the directory to travel agents.  How does the Tourist Board expect travel agents to sell holidays in Ireland when they did not have the official accommodation directory available to them?  What do these travel agents and tour operators abroad think of Ireland when they see this cheap, shoddy little book which we issued this year and which lacks the most basic information?  It is not even <Col N="1844" /> related to the previous directory.  How can tour operators and travel agents sell Ireland without this information? When they got the book it lacked most of the vital information.  Despite the fact that the Minister wrote to me himself&mdash;I appreciate that he did so when I raised the matter at Question Time&mdash;and said there was no undue delay, I have a copy of a letter sent by Bord Fáilte to travel agents at the end of January apologising for the delay in circulating the hotel guide because of production difficulties.  This is a very serious matter.  We are only codding ourselves if we think we can sell Ireland abroad if our Tourist Board stoop to these slipshod, inefficient methods.</P>
    <P>In addition, we find, particularly in Britain, that in the tourist markets abroad the State bodies other than Bord Fáilte which are engaged in tourism such as Aer Lingus, CIE, Shannon Free Airport Development Company and the B and I Line are in open, cut-throat competition with one another.  There is intense rivalry and petty jealousy that should not exist.  I am not making this allegation lightly. I had occasion to go to Britain at the end of January to investigate air services between Britain and France and particularly the decision to terminate the direct Manchester-Shannon Air Service.  I spent six days investigating it.  I have written a report of which I shall give a copy to the Minister later; I have already given it to some State bodies directly concerned.  I want to quote one significant paragraph from it which says:</P>
    <P>The picture that emerges from my investigations in Britain is one of where five State bodies using taxpayers' money and all having spent some money in making the Manchester-Shannon service viable, were unable to generate enough business to fill three aircraft per week.  For me the worst aspect of this whole exercise&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is my investigation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>was the way in which it revealed a total lack of co-operation between the five State bodies mentioned.  I have been appalled at the way in <Col N="1845" /> which one tries to blame the other and at the rivalry and petty jealousy that exist.  Indeed, the most difficult part of my entire investigation was to try to sift through the maze of contradictory statements and view-points from representatives of the different State bodies.</P>
    <P>This is an appalling situation.  In my opinion, the greatest problem for the Minister in regard to the tourist industry is to tackle this situation of the relationship between the various State bodies.  The Minister's job would be very simple in regard to the tourist industry if he were dealing only with Bord Fáilte but in recent years other semi-State bodies have entered into the tourist business.  Somebody will have to decide what the specific function of each of these bodies is to be.  The situation in relation to Britain is disastrous.  In reply to my question about the recent operation of tourist workshops in North America the Minister said that the result was satisfactory.  I have met people who were there and I am pleased to acknowledge that that is so, but one comment I heard was that there is considerable duplication and lack of co-ordination between the efforts of semi-State bodies in North America as well.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is not servicing the British tourist market.  The policy of Aer Lingus so far as Britain and the Continent are concerned is that its services are geared to feeding the trans-Atlantic route.  Because of modern technological developments and bigger and higher powered aircraft the long haul service is the one that pays; the short haul services are different propositions. No steps have been taken by the Minister to introduce realistic cross-Channel fares and no effort has been made by either Bord Fáilte or the six semi-State bodies operating in Britain to cater for the huge ethnic market there.  There are an estimated four million people of Irish parentage in Great Britain and this vast market has been taken for granted by us down through the years.  These unfortunate people are being fleeced by the shipping companies and the airlines.  A constituent of mine returning to Limerick has to pay £31 10s to fly from London to Shannon.  It must not <Col N="1846" /> be taken for granted that second and third generation Irish will spend their holidays at home.  A scheme should be devised, and I see no reason why it could not be devised, to enable special travel concessions to be given to people returning home to stay with friends and relatives who do not need hotel accommodation.  I have suggested this time and time again but fares continue to increase.</P>
    <P>Two trainee nurses who are neighbours of mine returned home for three days at Christmas to visit their mother who had fallen ill.  It cost them each £31 10s return air fare from London to Shannon and they also had their fare from the hospital to the airport and from Shannon Airport to the particular part of Limerick they were going to.  Without fear of contradiction I can say that it cost those two girls £70 in travelling expenses alone. They could go to Spain for a fortnight all-in for the same price.  These are hard facts and we have got to face up to them.  There is no point in blaming the postal strike and the political situation in Northern Ireland.  Neither the Tourist Board nor the semi-State bodies are doing their job in the British market.  I am very enthusiastic about the future potential of the Irish tourist industry but I have a sence of frustration about what has been going on. The Minister will have to devise some system to ensure that the semi-State bodies will co-operate with the private interests engaged in the business in the British market.</P>
    <P>I make no apologies for referring to the ethnic market in Britain.  We should be ashamed of the way we have neglected our own kith and kin in Britain.  The Most Reverend Dr. Harty, Bishop of Killaloe, pointed out some months ago that we are not pleading for any charity for these Irish people; it is very good business in the material sense to try to encourage as many Irish people to come home as possible.  In most cases they are coming into villages and hamlets which would not normally see tourists and their money is as good as any other tourists' money.</P>
    <P>Extra money has been voted for the advertising campaign which has <Col N="1847" /> recently been carried out.  I have a breakdown of the advertising expenditure on the British market this year.  I have the official advertising schedule from Bord Fáilte, but I will not say how or from whom I got it.  In my opinion Bord Fáilte's advertising policy in Britain has been wrongly orientated. They have advertised in the <i>Sunday Times</i> colour supplement, the <i>Observer</i> colour supplement, the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, the <i>Guardian</i> and the <i>Radio Times.</i>  All this advertising has been concentrated on the upper market.</P>
    <P>I have been to Britain on numerous occasions and I have engaged in the hard physical exercise of persuading tourists to come here for their holidays. I have arranged for them to come here and I have looked after them when they arrived.  I believe Bord Fáilte's advertising policy is totally wrong. The theory behind advertising in such papers as the <i>Sunday Times</i> is that wealthy people read them and if they come here they will spend more money, but what we seem to forget is that with the abolition of the £50 travel allowance this type of tourist can go to any part of the world for his holiday.  I am not advocating that the schedule should be changed completely and that no advertising should be done in this type of news media.  I must say the colour advertising in the <i>Sunday Times</i> was beautiful and has been highly commented on, but the stark fact is that it is not achieving the results is should achieve.</P>
    <P>A much higher proportion of our advertising in Britain should be directed to the mass circulation newspapers and to advertising on radio and television.  To prove I am not talking through my hat in this I can show that this could be most effective.  A very good friend of mine, a leading travel agent in Manchester, who brings on average 15,000 to 20,000 people into this country every year, took a full page in <i>The Guardian</i> and three half-minute slots on television this year by way of experiment.  The television advertising cost £695.  <i>The Guardian</i> advertisement cost £700.  The expenditure was almost identical.  What were the <Col N="1848" /> results?  From <i>The Guardian</i> advertisetisement he got approximately 600 replies; for roughly the same expenditure on television he got 6,438 replies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The conversion ratio, the acid test, is 25 per cent as against 55 per cent.  Far too much emphasis is placed on the high-class market.  Out of our total advertising budget a relatively small fraction has been directed towards the 4,000,000 Irish living in Britain.  A few paltry advertisements in the <i>Sunday Post</i> is the sum total of it.  That is disgraceful. The result is British travel agents, with the exception of a few, are not interested in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The work shop operation in North America was very successful and what the Minister told us today bears out the information I had.  The prospects are good and I trust that market will go some way this year towards counteracting the fall in the British market.</P>
      <P>Europe is a neglected market as far as we are concerned.  The Continent offers us, after Britain, the best potential for tourism.  Since the initiation of our application and negotiations for entry to the Common Market Ireland has become better known on the Continent.  All the market surveys indicate that there is a tremendous potential market on the Continent for Irish tourism.  What do we find?</P>
      <P>In the light of the troubles we had to contend with in Britain and America last year one would have expected there would have been a special, intensive operation directed at the Continent of Europe.  What do we find?  We find the expenditure on marketing and promotion in Europe for 1970-71 is the same as it was for 1969-70.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will have to be a complete rethinking of the whole future of Irish tourism and I sincerely hope that on the next occasion the Minister comes in here he will have something practical to tell us and that he will be able to report to the House that definite concrete steps have been taken, and <Col N="1849" /> drastic action, where necessary, with a complete reorganisation and restructuring of Bord Fáilte to ensure that a proper relationship will be arrived at between Bord Fáilte and other State bodies interested in tourism.</P>
    <P>I have questioned the Minister recently about the problem in the British market and whether or not special steps should be taken.  The Minister said today that other forms of publicity and promotional work in Britain will be carried on in the months ahead.  Last week Mr. Boyd from Britain and Mr. Evans, a director of Bord Fáilte, spelled out publicly in the national press the difficult problem in the British tourist market.  Both were of the opinion that this would be a difficult year; there would be a decline in traffic from Britain and some special effort would be needed.</P>
    <P>At Question Time today I suggested to the Minister it might be a good idea to have an operation carried out in Britain similar to the operation in North America.  Despite the lateness of the season, both promotionwise and publicitywise, I am convinced that a special drive in Britain just now would yield good results.  I believe that Bord Fáilte, the other State bodies and even the Minister have fallen down very badly in that no special steps were taken to counteract the difficulties of the British postal strike.  It should have been &ldquo;action stations&rdquo; and, when the strike was over, a special plan should have gone into operation and a special advertising and publicity campaign should have been mounted and all the available manpower from Bord Fáilte and elsewhere should have been sent into Britain to do a follow-up on the advertising.  It would not have been difficult for the regional boards to organise groups of hoteliers and travel agents to go into Britain.</P>
    <P>At this late stage a crash programme on the British market would pay dividends and I would be grateful if the Minister would give us some indication when he comes to reply of what he means by other forms of publicity and promotional work in the British market in the months ahead.  It is not months ahead.  It is tomorrow and next week. Months ahead will be too late for the <Col N="1850" /> 1971 season.  I understand Bord Fáilte have recommended this special type of publicity campaing in Britain.  They estimate it would cost £14,000 and they have not been able to get this £14,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of what the director of Bord Fáilte said last week it is obvious that something must be done immediately.  The proximity of Britain means it would not be difficult to organise a special drive in Britain.  Unless this is done now we will have disappointing results in 1971 where the British market is concerned. The Minister has announced that the question of a national travel agency being set up is under consideration and even the possibility of purchasing an interest in Thomas Cook &amp; Co., is being considered.  I can see merit in the idea of having a national travel agency. My opinion is that, unless drastic and much more fundamental changes are made in Government policy in relation to the tourist industry, and in relation to Bord Fáilte and the other semi-State companies already in the business, a national travel agency, or the purchase of Cooks, will not produce a magic formula that will solve all our problems overnight.  I hope that the report of whatever consultants have been engaged to examine the marketing of Irish tourism will be made public and that we will have an opportunity in the House of debating in depth the whole future of this most important national industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to follow Deputy O'Donnell's promotional effort on behalf of tourism.  I will confine my remarks to the Supplementary Estimate itself but I want to ask the Minister a few questions, some of which he may feel bear only slightly on the Estimate.  This is the first opportunity I have had to complain about the inclusion in the Transport Bill at present before the Seanad of the section regarding the examination of engine drivers.  I want to complain about the trouble it has created for me. I understand that the Minister is reconsidering <Col N="1851" /> it and I am glad to hear that.  It may have been purely accidental, but I do not mind admitting that I did not see the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. The Minister mentioned two cases of the employment of consultants in relation to transport.  I am sufficiently old-fashioned not to believe in consultants at all, or almost at all.  If you are lucky and if you get a break, you will get something from them.  Various occupations used to be regarded as a bit <i>outré</i> at one time.  The advertising industry was regarded as being not quite a respectable profession at one time.  It is quite certain that the greatest crowd of charlatans ever to come together has been accumulated in the consultancy business.  The Minister will say that he always gets the best.  I take it that care is taken in the selection of consultants, but they cost a lot of money.  I was told by one industrialist, a very shrewd man, indeed, that his costs were cut by 30 per cent after he employed a firm of consultants.  He is a bacon curer.  To have a proper consultancy set-up you must get together a most involved group of people.  You want a full team of men who work well together.  You want good cost accountants, a good work study man, a good mechanical engineer, and a whole list of people. This costs a very large amount of money indeed.  I am not aware of any consultancy firm that has any such group of people permanently employed as a team on its own staff in this country.  Obviously you want different types of consultants for different jobs. This is why we so often get them from across the Atlantic despite the enormous figure of £1,000 a week per man. That was the figure the last time I inquired and I suppose it is £1,500 per week per man now.  They would want to be very good to justify that kind of expenditure.  However, we will have an opportunity of talking about the B &amp; I on another occasion so I will leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister two fairly <Col N="1852" /> straight questions about the shortfall of £425,000 in Cork and Limerick.  The figure in the Estimate is £1.466 million. That does not refer to Dublin.  Therefore the shortfall is £425,000 out of £1½ million.  Is it a shortfall of almost one-third.  I want to ask the Minister a more important question.  Year after year we have colossal expenditure on airports.  We have infinitely more expenditure on them than we have on anything else except roads, and the expenditure on roads is paid for by the people who use them.  Here we have £5 million estimated for construction work at airports including furniture and buildings.  What rents does the State get from the air companies for what I call the &ldquo;cosmopolis&rdquo; out at Collinstown as it used to be called?</P>

      <P>I will look it up myself.  I want to say a few words about tourism.  Deputy O'Donnell made a very good point and I agree with him when he said that the hotel booklet list was not readily available last year.  Of course it is cheap.  This is an important item for residents of this country.  I take it that hundreds of thousands of copies must be produced. Why not produce one printed on expensive paper and sell it at a slightly <Col N="1853" /> higher price?  I think you would get people to take it.  As Deputy O'Donnell said, there was a fairly long period last year when you could not get a copy of it in most parts of the country. This affects tourist revenue inside the country.  It was easier to buy a copy in a remote country town than in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has set up the National Tourism Council and I hope it will achieve something.  The Minister went on to talk about the current exceptional situation.  This situation is only exceptional compared with two or three years ago.  The fact is that it is a situation which we will have with us for a long time.  I do not have to explain the various aspects of this. The Minister knows what I am speaking about.  We were all aware of the efforts made by Bord Fáilte and they deserve credit.  They made an effort to get over the effects of the postal strike in Britain.  I am inclined to be critical of some of their operations so it is only fair to say that.  The Minister mentioned the national economic growth. It might have been as well for him to have omitted reference to it.  It is a myth at the moment.  The only reason why there has not been a savage fall in the GNP during the past 12 months has been the increase of £100 million in the Government current expenditure and the increase of £50 million in Government capital expenditure.  This must be paid for in future.  Part of the current expenditure will have to be paid for in the future.  This increase of £150 million between current and capital expenditure is over 10 per cent of the GNP.  At the end of this suitably deflated calculation, by an inadequate index, we get a growth rate of 2 per cent.  This is a joke.  There has been no growth rate whatever in this country over the past 12 months.  I suspect that the Minister knows that as well as I do.  I do not blame the Minister for giving figures prepared by the Central Statistics Office, his own Department and the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say one critical thing about Bord Fáilte.  I believe that Bord Fáilte were altogether too liberal in their approach to hotel grants in the west. I said this last year.  Work was <Col N="1854" /> estimated at one price and carried out much more cheaply.  I suspect that the people in Bord Fáilte believed that the Department of Finance was like an elderly wolfhound with no teeth whatever and that all they had to do was say &ldquo;We want the money&rdquo; and the Department of Finance would give it to them.  It did not work out like that, not because the elderly wolfhound got its teeth back, but because the Government found they could not meet it.  I know of one place where a man must be in serious difficulties.  He was quite well off but his grant did not come to hand for a long period.  I do not know whether he has got it yet or not.  The assumption inherent in a great deal of official thinking was that there would never be a time like the 1950s again.  I might end by saying that perhaps we will be very lucky if times are not worse than the 1950s.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Dr. O'Donovan for their constructive contributions.  I could make a very wide-ranging reply on this aspect because of the many activities involved, but the nature of the debate has been, of necessity, truncated. I would like to deal with the tourist aspect, and point out the practical steps which we have taken to deal with what is a difficult situation, and one not of our making.  I cannot emphasise enough the fact that it has been very difficult for the various agencies concerned in the tourist business&mdash;and they all have a part to play under the Bord Fáilte umbrella.  It has been very difficult to push peaceful Ireland to people in Britain, Europe and North America in face of the publicity given to the unfortunate activities in the north-eastern part of Ireland. This is a basic fact of life.  This is why Bord Fáilte have undertaken this special campaign which I inaugurated in conjunction with them over the winter and spring months to spend £400,000 on an intensified promotional campaign in Britain, Europe and North America to offset the ill-effects of this publicity.  The Irish airlines have spent £4 million on worldwide publicity particularly in North America, Britain and Europe in order to ensure that their planes are as full <Col N="1855" /> as possible and that their targets are achieved in regard to the considerable growth expansion envisaged by them in passenger travel this year on the North Atlantic routes.  CIE, through their carrier operation in connection with their tours and hotels, have done an intensified marketing drive in North America, Europe and Britain, as have SFADCO.</P>
      <P>I should like to make the point that I have had numerous consultations with the various State bodies concerned with the tourist business and Bord Fáilte.  I am concerned that there should not be overlapping of their activities on external markets.  We have got together on this aspect and we are having consultation as to how best all these activities in the carrier and tourist business can be rationalised.  There is a danger in going too far.  I believe that a certain degree of competition is good because it keeps the executives and staffs on their toes and maintains drives and momentum in the organisations. If they were amalgamated into one organisation they might go &ldquo;soft&rdquo;, in the business or selling sense.  I would aim at a degree of competition between them but at the same time a rationalisation of their activities.  This is what we are seeking to achieve and this is what consultants are at present examining, how best to ensure that there is an avoidance of undue overlapping, an avoidance of duplication, and at the same time to maintain the competitive edge on the part of their various executives who are fighting hard for visitors from markets abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with State companies being in competition with one another and with private enterprise for the same business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what we are seeking to rationalise.  Indeed, apart from the State bodies, I have also had consultations with the private interests, both here and abroad, who are concerned with bringing people to Ireland and I hope to have further discussions with the Irish travel trade here and further discussions with the travel trade in Britain, America and <Col N="1856" /> Europe, in regard to how best to have a degree of competition between all concerned, but certainly not overlapping, not duplicating and not, as Deputy O'Donnell says, looking for the same customer.  This is what we must achieve and what I think will be achieved.  As I said, I have had a number of discussions with both private and semi-State interests on this aspect.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte are the overall umbrella providing the general promotional and advertising aspects and I should like to emphasise that we have given them this extra money to embark on this campaign this year; we have strengthened the board of Bord Fáilte by adding two people to it who have been successful in the tourist industry and we have set up a national tourist council representative of the various carriers, hotel and travel trade interests in order to ensure communication with Bord Fáilte.  In addition, there has been a complete reorganisation of the management structure of the board and at the moment there is a review being carried out of their marketing activities. In general the board are concerned very much at present as to their future structure and role in the Irish tourist industry.  Consultations are taking place at the moment with the other State-sponsored bodies as to how best to get down to positive product selling, whether a national travel agency is desirable or not, in what way the private industry might be brought in on such a development.  These are all matters which are being considered at present.  There may be need for a change in the role of Bord Fáilte.  As I said, heretofore, they have been the umbrella organisation and there may be a need for more hardselling, person to person selling, of holidays here to travel agents, wholesalers, handlers and carriers, at the grass roots level, as it were, than the present Bord Fáilte promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is room for the two and that both go hand in hand.  As I see the future, Bord Fáilte will provide the umbrella with the overall advertising and promotion and within that umbrella there would be various agencies, State and private, engaged in <Col N="1857" /> the hardselling.  This to a degree is already done by Aer Lingus, by CIE through their tours organisations, by SFADCO and by private interests as well.  I should like to see an intensification of that activity and how best to harmonise the overall global promotion work of Bord Fáilte with the person to person hardselling of the various organisations working within this umbrella.</P>
    <P>There should be greater harmonisation of these activities and a greater unity of purpose between the organisations concerned, both public and private.  Deputy O'Donnell referred to the fact that reports from the North American market are encouraging.  This is true and all the reports we have from our airlines, from CIE, SFADCO and Bord Fáilte are encouraging.  The British market is a problem.  It has been tackled by Bord Fáilte in the past few months but there was an unfortunate synchronisation of the peak of their advertising and the mail strike.  They took various steps to get out of that situation and I want to pay them a tribute for this.  I think Deputy O'Donovan referred, inter alia, to it.  It was just coming to the peak of the special advertising campaign and the British organisation of Bord Fáilte adjusted straight away to a telephone promotional campaign.  They made special efforts via the telephone by communicating the telephone numbers of various Bord Fáilte offices to the trade generally in Britain, by advertising their telephone numbers and by making personal calls to various people in the tourist industry generally and to various Irish associations.  An intensive telephone campaign was carried on when the strike broke and it held the situation which otherwise could have been very serious.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have discussed this matter with them and they do not think that anything further needs to be done in this direction.  Generally as far as bringing people here is concerned it is to the non-ethnic market that we need to pay particular attention because as time goes on and as we have less emigration and fewer Irish people abroad, which is the pattern now developing&mdash;the airlines are very conscious of this, particularly on the North America market&mdash;it will be all important to reach out beyond the traditional Irish ethnic markets that heretofore have been very important, and will continue to be important. However, that slice of the tourist cake is not expanding as emigration decreases and the expanding slice is the non-ethnic market.  Both the airlines and Bord Fáilte are very conscious of this and are seeking to reach outside the traditional Irish market and to attract people to come here who otherwise would not know anything about Ireland, who would have no connection with Ireland and who would have no reason for coming here.  It is in that direction that real progress needs to be made in tourism.  While I am not taking away from the traditional ethnic market, which will always continue to be important, taking the long-term view the real impact has to be made outside the ethnic market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that second or third generation Irish people offer as good a potential market, that they are the most easily attracted section of the entire British market and their money is as good as that of the others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not being neglected.  I want to emphasise that that aspect of promotion is not being neglected but is being developed.  But I am saying that in apportioning money for promotion one must bear in mind that to a growing extent in the years ahead there will be a need to encourage a higher proportion of people from outside the traditional Irish ethnic sources of supply.  It would be a very grave mistake to pin the whole future of Irish tourism on the Irish ethnic market alone and the other aspect is the all-important, stable, long, <Col N="1859" /> term investment which will be the growing one in the future.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donovan had some remarks to make about consultants and I agree with him to this extent, that consultants are necessary but one must know what one wants and where one is going when one hires consultants. Taking on consultants on the blind, as it were, is a mistake.  Otherwise, you really do not make progress with them. But if one has an idea of how one is doing and knows what needs to be rectified and puts that to them and gives them a specific job to do, their second opinion can be of tremendous help, but only in that context.  So long as they are pinned down to a specific job and asked, as it were, to offer a second opinion to bear out or not bear out what you think is the solution to the problem and to point out specific options in regard to specific problems, consultants can in that way be of help.  We have had very practical success with them in the past 18 months.  I have been very keen on introducing them to examine the operations of all State companies.  We had them in the ESB and a very excellent reorganisation of the whole management structure of the ESB has taken place as a result of their recommendations. The reorganisation suggested by them could very easily have been suggested by me or my officials.  The proposals were rather obvious in many ways in bringing a business-like management structure to the top of the ESB with proper delegation of responsibilities, but it was important to have an outside organisation to give a second opinion.  This opinion accorded with our own views and the reorganised management structure has worked very well in the ESB and has helped enormously to reduce the tension that existed in the industrial relations side of that organisation.</P>
      <P>Similarly we had consultants in the transportation field to rationalise the activities of B &amp; I, British Railways and CIE with a view to sharing terminals and ships and operations across the Irish sea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, we had a pretty good idea of what was needed. We knew it was futile to embark on a capital expansion programme where B &amp; I could start building terminals side by side with British Railways and with CIE also coming in on the situation. We put this to the consultants who have now come up with recommendations bearing out our views and we are seeking to implement their recommendations with the co-operation of the three organisations I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Similarly we are doing this type of exercise at present in regard to tourist travel arrangements and the various State companies and private interests involved.  Another investigation of this kind is currently taking place in regard to CIE's internal transport situation.  Again, we know the answers there to some extent but it is no harm to have them pointed out and have the options put before us. That report will also be available in regard to CIE.  There are two stages and we hope to have one report very shortly and another within three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to any of these consultants we set very stringent date lines for production of reports and recommendations. It is very important that we should always be alert to the performance of all our State companies. They are doing an excellent job but I see no point in Parliament being complacent about it.  It is important that we should always act as a watchdog <Col N="1861" /> on behalf of the people we represent. Whoever is Minister for Transport and Power and charged with responsibility for these organisations which are concerned with very heavy capital expenditure, must be enternally vigilant.  My main concern in having consultants in the past 18 months to look into the various organisations is to ensure that the organisations be kept on their toes and be able to see themselves with the help of these consultants and make an assessment of their present and future operations.  In that way we can watch their performance.  No matter what one thinks about consultants I think it makes good sense to keep State-sponsored organisations continually under this kind of review to ensure that what is done on our behalf by them is done with the greatest efficiency and with proper planning ahead so that the community gets the best value.</P>
    <P>We shall have occasion in the coming months to debate much of this field on various measures of legislation.  We shall have the Nuclear Energy Bill which has been passed by the Seanad and will come before the Dáil.  On that measure we shall have full opportunity to discuss the whole future of power development in Ireland and development of resources for power generation. We shall have the Road Transport Bill which is now practically through the Seanad and which will give an opportunity for a comprehensive review of road transportation.  Very shortly we shall have the B &amp; I Bill.  The First Stage has been moved and the Second Stage will be taken very shortly, and we can then discuss our whole sea transportation policy.</P>
    <P>We shall also have an ESB Bill dealing with the whole future of rural electrification and plans to ensure proper financing of the ESB in this regard so that the whole rural electrification programme can be completed within the next five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will this be a special Bill apart from the Nuclear Energy Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy O'Donovan referred to our airports. The idea here is to separate the operation of our airports entirely from the airlines.  This is already being done in <Col N="1862" /> Shannon, Cork and Dublin.  We propose to introduce very shortly a National Airports Authority Bill putting all State airports under a single authority that will be charged to operate in a commercial manner independently of our airlines.  It will deal with our own national airlines or any others on a purely commercial basis.  I want to emphasise that it is important that this should be so because in the world of the future it may be necessary to have many airlines coming to many parts of Ireland.  It is important as far as the State is concerned that the airports, with their facilities and amenities, should be under State control and separate management and have the responsibility of operating for our benefit while they have the benefit of the whole community and should be able to make their own commercial decisions as to what they should charge airlines, how to handle customers, provide the necessary amenities required in modern airports and also provide necessary revenue.  The capital cost that Deputy O'Donovan referred to in regard to airport construction and renovation in the current year is quite acceptable.  It is designed to provide the very facilities needed to cater for the sort of aircraft now coming in through our national airline and other airlines.</P>
      <P>The new 747 has placed a tremendous strain on airport managements and airport personnel.  This new runway development and passenger development has been necessitated by the dramatic transformation of aircraft technology which has led to the development of the Jumbo Jet.  It is imperative to have a rapid through-put of passengers in order to ensure the maintenance of the business.  This has led to exceptional capital development at our airports in the current year which we hope we will not need to repeat in the immediate years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £2,550,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1971, for the salaries and expenses of the Garda Síochána, including pensions, etc.; for payments of compensation and other expenses arising out of service in the Local Security Force; for the payment of certain witnesses' expenses; and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The additional sum is required to meet extra expenditure arising on the Garda Síochána Vote in the year ending on 31st March, 1971, which was not foreseen when the original Estimates were being prepared.  Of the total extra sum required, over £800,000 is needed to meet the cost of applying to the Garda Síochána the increases in pay which were granted under the twelfth round pay agreement.  A further £1,220,000 is required for the payment of overtime, night-duty and rent allowances which are now being paid to members of the force, following the recommendations of the Conroy Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies may be aware, two new widows' and children's pensions schemes are being introduced for members of the force.  A contributory scheme, similar to that in operation in the Civil Service, will apply to members serving on or after 23rd July, 1968, i.e. the date of commencement of the Civil Service scheme.  Under the second scheme, <i>ex-gratia</i> pensions&mdash;equal in most cases to half the benefits under the contributory scheme&mdash;will be payable to the widows and children of members of the force who died or retired on pension before 23rd July, <Col N="1864" /> 1968.  These <i>ex-gratia</i> pensions will be paid with effect from 1st October, 1969, or the date of commencement of the widow's existing pension, whichever is the later.  To cover the payment as soon as possible of the arrears of these pensions up to 31st March, 1971, it will be necessary to make a sum of £400,000 available; this sum is provided for in this Supplementary Estimate by way of a grant-in-aid and it will enable the payments to be made in anticipation of the necessary amending pensions order.  The calculation of the pensions is well under way and payment of the arrears will be made as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the concern expressed in recent times by Deputies and other responsible citizens about the increased incidence of vandalism and the like.  Since becoming Minister for Justice, I have been doing all that I can to improve the efficiency of the force.  I have mentioned in the House and elsewhere some of the measures which have been and are being taken, such as the provision of modern equipment and the reassignment of men to urban centres where the problem is greatest.  These measures in themselves are not enough and I have sought and obtained the approval of the Government for an increase of 400 in the present strength, of whom 200 will be recruited in the coming financial year and 200 in the following year.  This 400 is, of course, additional to the 200 normally recruited every year to replace wastage.  This is a substantial increase and the maximum that can be provided having regard to the other calls on our resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I welcome this Supplementary Estimate in so far as it provides money to bring the salaries of gardaí up to a reasonable level and provide them with long-overdue payments for overtime. Every time one gets an opportunity one should put on the record of this House the appreciation of the service given to this country and its citizens by the Garda Síochána over the last 50 years. I do not think I could put that on record more effectively than by quoting paragraph 1269 of the Conroy Report. That report was presented to the Government <Col N="1865" /> by a distinguished commission set up by the Government and the Minister for Justice to examine and report and make recommendations to the Minister on the remuneration and conditions of service of the Garda Síochána.  Paragraph 1269 states:</P>
      <P>However, despite organisational shortcomings, we were left with the abiding impression of the Garda Síochána as a force whose members were men and women of integrity, dedicated to a job of increasing difficulty and complexity, a job that is frequently thankless.  Since its foundation as an unarmed force in 1922, the Garda Síochána has served the country well.  We believe that if our recommendations are implemented and if the matters to which we have drawn attention are put right, it can serve the country better.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I do not think I could record my appreciation in better terms or more adequately than the Conroy Commission did in that paragraph.  I wish on behalf of myself and my party to endorse every word of that paragraph.</P>
      <P>It will be remembered that the Conroy Commission was set up to report and make recommendations to the Minister on the remuneration and conditions of service and the general terms of reference were confined accordingly. In a paragraph headed &ldquo;Concluding Comment&rdquo; on page 214 of the report the commission stated:</P>
      <P>At the outset of this report we said we were satisfied that there is serious and long-standing discontent in the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>We have dealt with the principal matters raised by, or on behalf of, the members of the force and which were suggested by them to be the root causes of the discontent.  We believe that the recommendations we have made will, if accepted, go a long way towards removing the causes of the discontent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Government have accepted the Conroy Commission Report in principle.  It has been intimated that is is proposed to implement it.  The commission went on to say that pay and conditions were only part of the <Col N="1866" /> problem and only part of the cause of discontent.</P>
    <P>It is also stated at paragraph 1265 that they were satisfied from the evidence that pay and conditions were only part of the problem.</P>
    <P>The objective is an effective police force with high morale, fully accepted by and integrated with the community it serves.  This objective will certainly not be fully attained merely by paying the force fairly and by looking after their physical conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>At paragraph 1266 they say:</P>
    <P>We would be failing in our duty to the Minister if we did not strongly urge that an examination be carried out by appropriately qualified people into the role, organisation and personnel policy of the force and, in particular, its relationship with the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>In the concluding paragraph on that page it would appear that the commission are satisfied that there is some sort of unhappy relationship between the Garda Síochána and the Minister's Department and that this relationship has existed for some years.  If this is well founded it is rather disturbing.  I am satisfied the Conroy Commission would not have gone outside their terms of reference, as they did in fact do, to draw the attention of the Minister to this if it were not well founded.  I gather from what the report says that the relationship was unhappy and there was an unclear definition of role as between the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána.  There was a vagueness causing uncertainty and ineffectiveness about the relationship between the Department and the Commissioner, according to the report.  The report alleges a lack of delegation from the Department to the force and this lack permeated the force, particularly in relation to financial resources.  It goes on to suggest that there was no comprehensive planning based on research, that there was no personnel policy and the commission found it particularly disturbing that in a force the size of the Garda Síochána there was no one with specific responsibility for developing an on-going personnel policy, including training and retraining. <Col N="1867" /> The net result of all that has been to develop between the Department and the Garda Síochána a &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; atmosphere.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Judge Conroy and the other learned members of the commission did not say that lightly or without evidence.  The Garda Síochána should have a certain amount of independence. There should be a well-defined policy and, as long as the force is carrying out its duties, there should be no interference from the Department of Justice; there should certainly be no day-to-day interference in the functions of the force.  The Commissioner is invariably a man of long standing, a man who has come to the top because of the way in which he discharged his duties, because of his integrity, his discipline and his knowledge of men and people.  There should be a considerable amount of delegation from the Department to the Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána are sometimes frustrated a great deal by not knowing what Government policy is in certain fields.  For example, last year we had a very undesirable development within the Government and that occurred, in my opinion, because certain Ministers did not know what the Taoiseach's policy was or what the Government's policy was.  The Minister raises his eyes.  I shall relate this to the position that I think could develop in the Garda Síochána if the members of that force do not know from day to day what Government policy is in certain matters.</P>
    <P>A couple of years ago outside Leinster House people were arrested and taken away in Black Marias because they were picketing and protesting outside Leinster House.  Recently we have had demonstrations and protests which appeared to be perfectly legal.  I suppose all the Garda Síochána can do is mark time; they do not know whether they are to permit these demonstrations and protests, give them their blessing, stand idly by, or arrest the protesters and take them away.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in the sphere of illegal organisations, it is only fair to the organisations as well as to the country that they should know exactly where <Col N="1868" /> they stand with the Government and where the Government stand with them.  I do not believe the Garda Síochána know where their duty lies in relation to illegal organisations.  If they are aware of illegal activities all they do is report to headquarters and await instructions.  This sort of thing leads to a wedge being driven between the Department and the force.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to read carefully again and again the concluding comment on page 214 of the Conroy Report and to see to it that the relationship between the Department and the force is improved and that the Department and the force know exactly where they stand with each other.  There should be delegation from the Department to the Commissioner and the Commissioner should be encouraged to delegate to his officers.  In that way we will have a more efficient force and better relations all round.</P>
    <P>A matter which has come up here time and time again&mdash;the Minister referred to it in his opening speech&mdash;is the strength of the force.  The question is whether the Garda Síochána is up to strength at the moment, whether it is adequate.  This problem can be approached from two angles.  It can be approached on the long term basis or on the present requirements of the force.  I regret to have to say that, looked at on a long term basis, it is difficult to say what the required strength of the Garda will be in ten or 20 years time, although that is something we should know now, because when members are recruited the likelihood is that they will remain with the force for 30 years.</P>
    <P>We might ask ourselves what sort of a police force do we expect to have in ten or 20 years time.  Will it be responsible for traffic control, for traffic regulation and for the enforcement of the Road Traffic Acts as it is at present? Will it be responsible for such things as taking a census, enforcing the regulations under the licensing of dogs Acts and rendering many other services to the various Departments of State or will it be strictly a police force?  It would appear from remarks made by the Minister for Local Government over the past few weeks that he has some idea of establishing a <Col N="1869" /> muinicipal police force which apparently would take over from the Garda the control of traffic and the enforcement of the Road Traffic Act regulations and that sort of thing.  Is there any co-operation or liaison between the Department of Local Government and the Department of Justice about this? This might very well affect the requirements of the Garda in years to come.</P>
    <P>There should be a planning section within the Garda which would devote its time to assessing the personnel requirements of the Garda not now but in five, ten, 15 or 20 years time in the changing conditions of our society. I recommend to the Minister that he should devote some thought to setting up such a planning and research unit within his Department which, as well as planning for modern methods of crime detection and prevention, would also plan for the future of the force. There is one thing about which there is no doubt and that is that at present the force is grossly understaffed and the public at large are getting a bad and inadequate service because and only because the force is understaffed.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons why the force is understaffed.  The Conroy Commission introduced the 42-hour week and provided for overtime for the Garda both of which provisions were long overdue.  That, of course, reduced the number of police hours available. There is no doubt that crime of one sort or another has increased very considerably in recent years.  I am told, for example, that 999 calls have increased fivefold within the past ten years.  Each one of those calls makes a demand on the time of the Garda.  None of those calls can be written off.  Some of them may be only inquiries but they all have to be followed up.  In this age we are living in, especially in the urban areas and particularly in the cities, there are marches and protests and demonstrations of one sort or another.  They are all time-consuming and they take up a considerable amount of time of the Garda.</P>
    <P>I was amazed today when I considered the amount of time of the Garda which is taken up in relation to motor vehicles.  I did some research and I found that in 1950 there were 138,134 motor vehicles registered in <Col N="1870" /> this State.  On 30th September, 1970, 20 years later, the figure of registered motor vehicles of one sort or another in the State had jumped to 558,403, an enormous jump.  I then referred to some valuable information given in the Conroy Report and I found that in 1948 the Garda force consisted of 7,370 all ranks; in 1952 the figure was 6,785, and in 1968, which was the last year for which I could get the figure, it had dropped, instead of having increased, to 6,530.  Therefore, in the past 20 years the motor population of this State jumped from over 100,000 to nearly 600,000 and in the same period the figure for the Garda force decreased although the amount of work imposed on the Garda in relation to motor vehicles must be enormous.</P>
    <P>Bear in mind that not only is the time of the Garda taken up by road traffic offences, as indeed a lot of it is, but the activities of criminals have become more complex in this mechanical age.  Motor vehicles are now used as getaway vehicles.  A vehicle is stolen, a robbery takes place, the stolen vehicle is abandoned, another vehicle is stolen; and so on.  That adds enormously to the complexity of criminal activities and to the difficulties in detecting crime and in arresting criminals. Furthermore we now have a state of affairs where motor vehicles are being stolen by the score in this city and elsewhere.  It is not safe to leave cars parked for any length of time. As a result of the Garda being understaffed and below strength and not able to deal with this kind of thing effectively, we have reached the stage where one of the national newspapers, the <i>Irish Independent</i>, has had to provide a service for recovering motor vehicles.  The system is that the person who loses the vehicle communicates with the <i>Irish Independent.</i> They publish the numbers and in that way a great number of cars are recovered. That is something that the newspaper concerned is to be complimented on, but it does emphasise the necessity for a strengthening of the Garda Síochána.  I said that the force is grossly under strength.  The figures I have given prove that conclusively.  As spokesman on Justice, I have got letters from citizens of this city complaining <Col N="1871" /> that elderly people are in terror of being assaulted and having their handbags snatched from them and their houses broken into because of a lack of patrols.  The system at the moment is that there are three eight-hour patrols in Dublin.  There are vast areas like Ballyfermot&mdash;and I am not picking out Ballyfermot for any reason other than it is a huge built-up area with a large population of young people&mdash; where because of the lack of men there are times when during a particular eight-hour period, no members of the force are on patrol.  There is no better way of preventing crime, whether serious or trivial, than having a garda on beat on foot.  We all have experience of driving cars and seeing the Garda uniform.  This makes one alert. One starts thinking of the road traffic regulations and of observing them.  One could drive through town after town without seeing a member of the Garda Síochána at present, because they are under strength.  The Minister should prevail on the Government to increase the strength of the force.  He has told us that the numbers are to be increased by 400 men over the next two years. The Minister must know that that number is not sufficient.  I do not blame the Minister personally for this.  I am sure that the Minister applied for a much bigger increase in the numbers. The 400 men who are being provided probably represent all that the Department of Finance would permit as an increase rather than the minimum necessary to do the job.  That view should not continue to exist.  Even with the closing down of Garda stations throughout the country it is impossible to make the case that we are able to do with a smaller force now than we had 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the closing down of the Garda stations.  I will not make the case that every isolated Garda station in the country should be kept open, or where there is a large town with a substantial station that a Garda barracks four or five miles away should be retained.  It would be unrealistic to do so provided there are sufficient patrol cars and motor-cycle patrols. Some barracks which have been allowed to remain open are closed most <Col N="1872" /> of the day and one finds a notice on the door indicating that the sergeant is somewhere else.  A stranger coming into the town and seeing that notice may find that he is directed to a street he never heard of.  This is due to the fact that the force is under strength. Reasonable facilities should be provided for the public by a continuous Garda service.  It should be possible for a person in search of a garda to go to the post office where someone would be able to put him into telephonic communication with the garda's house after the station is closed.</P>
    <P>Money is provided for post office services.  It would be a good thing if the telephone numbers of the Garda stations were uniform throughout the country.  In most cases the ESB in country towns have had the telephone number 500.  I know that the ESB phone number was 500 in my own town when there were only 100 telephones there altogether.  It would be a good thing if one could lift a telephone in any town and dial a known number which was general to Garda stations and be connected with the local Garda station.  Everyone knows that the number 999 should be dialled in an emergency.</P>
    <P>I would like to see something being done about recruitment.  I stand over every word of the concluding paragraph of the Conroy Report which states that the Garda force are a fine body of men and have great integrity. As years go on and as the task of the Garda becomes more difficult, more attention will have to be paid to them on recruitment.  The duties of the Garda are among the most difficult that could be imagined.  A garda's life requires something in the nature of a vocation. A garda meets people at their worst. He meets them when they are breaking the law.  He meets the criminal type, the person with mental illness and the drunken type.  He meets the excited type of person and the angry person and he also has to deal with people who are suffering under great stress for one reason or another.  He needs to be a man of great character and a person temperamentally suited to deal with the different types of people and the many situations which will envelop <Col N="1873" /> him.  There are women in the force and they also must be temperamentally suited to the job.  It must be in that situation a source of amazement to discover that there is no aptitude test for recruits for the force.  The person who wants to become a member of the Garda Síochána must satisfy the Civil Service Commission and the Garda authorities that he is a person of integrity, that he satisfies certain standards in regard to physique and that he has certain educational standards; he must also pass a medical examination, but there is no aptitude test to ascertain if he is temperamentally or otherwise suited for the job.  I may be told that he is interviewed by the sergeant and by the superintendent and eventually by the commissioner, but that is not the sort of test we should have.  Paragraph 687 of the Conroy Report recommends that each candidate who qualifies in the written examination should, before acceptance, undergo an aptitude test administered by a qualified psychologist at an early stage in the recruitment procedure.  That is not an extravagant requirement.  One trained psychologist would be sufficient to deal with that requirement and it would prevent the occasional square peg from finding its way into the round hole.</P>
    <P>Even one member who is temperamentally unsuited can make things difficult not alone for his colleagues in the force but for the general public and, therefore, I hope that the Minister has considered this recommendation. Indeed, we are living in the days of career guidance and we have trained people to give guidance on careers and this test is not unique because in the religious orders, for example, before students are taken in they have to undergo tests.  It is an excellent idea and I strongly recommend it to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Technically speaking the force is badly equipped and badly trained.  We should have this research and planning unit, about which I have been speaking, and which we have not got.  Compared with cities on the Continent and throughout the world we are very far behind in this regard.  I am told that in London or in Glasgow they can say how long it would take a policeman to <Col N="1874" /> go, either on foot or in a motor vehicle, from one point to another at any time of the day or night.  They have researched all this type of thing which is very badly needed here.  We are providing money for the post office services and that reminds me that the central radio equipment and the central telephone equipment which the Garda Síochána use is very much out of date. I am told that the ESB have a much more up-to-date and more effective radio and telephone system than the Garda Síochána have.  That should not be.  I am also told that certain parts of the country are blacked out as far as the headquarters central radio and telephone system is concerned.  Indeed, some vehicles used in illegal activities, robberies and raids, have been found abandoned in these &ldquo;black&rdquo; patches and whether that was merely accidental or whether it was planned by the criminals in the knowledge that they had a better chance of getting away in these areas than in others I do not know.</P>
    <P>In regard to buildings, I had occasion some time ago to go into the Castle and I found that the conditions under which certain sections of the force, notably the fraud section, are operating are an absolute disgrace.  I have referred already to the lack of understanding between the Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice.  We find that the Garda Síochána are housed in buildings in Dublin Castle which were abandoned by the Civil Service and which are a public disgrace.  The Civil Service were moved out because the buildings were not fit for them and the gardaí have been moved in.  Pre-fabs are now being built and I suppose they will be an improvement but it is not good enough that gardaí should be operating under those conditions.</P>
    <P>Another point which I should like to mention is in regard to the number of man-hours taken up by protecting banks all over the country.  It may be that this protection is necessary but it is not good enough that it should be given to the banks at the expense of citizens in the community or to their detriment.  Because of the lack of manpower resulting from this bank protection it is not now possible to establish proper road blocks where a car, <Col N="1875" /> for instance, has been stolen in Limerick, presumably for illegal activities. Formerly they used establish road checks as far away as Cork or on the Dublin side to try to locate such a car but that is not done now because it is not possible as the personnel are not there to do it.  I do not know how this problem of bank protection can be dealt with. I do not know if it would be possible to station a few members of the Army in each of the larger towns and let them do bank protection work but it is something which the Minister should tackle and he should let us know his proposals in this regard, because it is a matter on which a lot of time has been wasted.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Social Welfare Services for Widows and Orphans: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, being conscious of the grave hardships being suffered by widows because of the quite inadequate social welfare services available to them and their orphan children, calls on the Government to take immediate steps to provide a comprehensive social welfare code for widows and their families so that their standard of living will not be lowered by the deaths of family breadwinners.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy R. Barry).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>While a number of widows have pensions because their husbands were insured it is rather extraordinary that, as far as I know, a number of insurance companies have no widows' pensions for employees with the result that widows of some rather senior executives in these companies find themselves depending on the tender mercies of the State.  This is something that should be taken up with the companies concerned.  These rather rich companies&mdash;I am not confining this entirely to insurance companies&mdash;could do much more for widows of their employees by having <Col N="1876" /> them insured so that in the event of the employee dying the widow would not be dependent on a non-contributory widow's pension in many cases. In many cases these people would be over the limit of insurability under the State and would not qualify for the normal widow's pension.</P>
      <P>It is hard to know which type of widow is worse off.  The widow whose husband was insured, whether she has a small family or no family, if she qualifies for a contributory pension, at least has some income&mdash;I consider that it is far too small.  If the husband was not insured&mdash;he was running a small business and being self-employed was not insurable&mdash;the widow must depend on a non-contributory widow's pension which is a smaller amount and harder to manage with.  Even when we come to widows of those who have relatively decent incomes the first thing the widow finds if there is no income is that she must make up her mind whether to apply to the State for a non-contributory pension.  Frequently, when the investigation is carried out she is found to be in possession of a motor car which she considered essential before her husband died.  It is probably suggested that she should dispose of it. She then finds her house is mortgaged and she must find money somewhere to pay this off.  It is extraordinary how badly off widows of people considered relatively wealthy can find themselves. I do not know what the State can do at this stage, but whether the widows are in the lower, the middle or even the higher income groups in some cases, they seem to be caught in every way.  I have come across cases recently where widows with a house and very little else, perhaps a car that is relatively new, and because of the high value put on the house which might have been purchased at a relatively small figure a few years earlier, they are billed for death duties.  The owner may have to sell the house in order to pay the State.  Instead of the State helping her, she is expected to contribute a portion of the little she has to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not blaming the Minister for Social Welfare for all these ills but I am bringing them to his notice because the only way anything can be done to improve the position is to have these <Col N="1877" /> matters raised again and again.  It has been said that any group of people can make the case that they are not getting a fair share of what is going but I think the widows can truthfully say that they have been shabbily treated.  In the Supplementary Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Justice I see a reference to the question of two new widows' and children's pensions schemes being introduced for members of the Force, a contributory scheme and a non-contributory scheme or <i>ex-gratia</i> pension.  If these people are drawing widows' pensions, as soon as they get anything under one heading it is immediately taken into account and they lose it under another heading. The extraordinary case has been brought to the notice of various Ministers over the years of the Garda widows who are the first to be caught out with social welfare increases.  As soon as there is an increase in the widow's pension from the Garda, the State takes account of this and reduces the amount.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat that I think it is terribly unfair that the widow who has to go to work must pay the same amount for her stamp as her single colleague but if she becomes ill or unemployed she gets only half the amount of benefit.  In this case the Minister is having it both ways.</P>
    <P>In dealing with widows' pensions can the State not make some effort to do so more expeditiously?  A woman whose husband is dead since 4th February came to me two nights ago. She had submitted all the necessary application forms and certificates.  She has seven children, the eldest approaching 14.  Although she did everything required she had not got her pension. As soon as the matter was brought to the notice of the Department of Social Welfare they immediately agreed she was entitled to the pension.  She had not got it, they said, because something had happened and they had not got a record of the 1970 card.  I believe this matter could have been cleared up without the intervention of an outsider. She had to come to me and say she was not able to live on the wind and therefore she wanted something done. The Department of Social Welfare have <Col N="1878" /> been very helpful with every case I have taken to them but I should not have to go to them.  These people are entitled by right to what they get and they should get it without having to bring the matter to the notice of a third party.  For that reason I feel the Minister should make an extra effort to see to it that widows, faced with the traumatic experience of losing a husband, should not have to suffer the degradation of living on an income of nil while deciding how they are going to live.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurke" hpid="Mrs. Burke Mrs. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said on this motion but surely it is a reflection on this House and this State that the plight of widows needs to be discussed?  Perhaps one of the reasons for this is that this House has been dominated by men, who could not possibly understand or be expected to understand the financial problems which face many widows today.  Added to the financial problems are the problems of loneliness and the change in social standing once the husband dies. When one realises that 75 per cent of our married women become widows one realises the size of the problem and the necessity for the Government and Members of this House to relieve the urgent and pressing financial difficulties that beset many of them.</P>
      <P>We cannot lessen their grief but we can certainly help by easing the burden of worry and want.  How could anyone exist on £4 10s a week plus 18s for the first two children and 13s for the third?  Indeed the non-contributory pension is much worse, it is only £4 5s plus 15s for the first two children. With the ever-increasing cost of the essentials of life they could not possibly be expected to live on a miserable pension such as this.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully referred to the long delay in processing claims.  A great deal of time is wasted from the time the application is made for a widow's pension until the final decision is made. It can very often take several months. These decisions could be expedited if the matter could be finalised at local level as a result of discussions with the local pension officers and the local social welfare officers and a provisional payment could be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1879" /> Another problem which, thank goodness, does not happen very often is the case where a husband is killed and the authorities decide an inquest is necessary.  It is very often nine or 12 months before the inquest is held and a death certificate cannot be issued until the inquest is over.  Widow's pension cannot be paid until the death certificate has been issued.</P>
    <P>The present widows' pensions are a false economy.  Illness springs from undernourishment and mental anguish which are a direct result of the miserable allowances being paid to widows. I recently heard of a widow who had to abandon her children because she just could not cope any longer.  No woman gives up her children easily and it must have taken something for this woman to give up her children and send them to an orphanage.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to ask the Minister to consider the position of widowers in poor circumstances because they too have to rear large families in some cases on their own.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion relates to a limited aspect of social welfare but I think it important to make a contribution towards it.  We realise the Government's difficulties generally in raising money to do all the things that the various motions put before the House ask them to do.  I should like to repeat something I said last night on the Supplementary Estimate and that was the proposal to the effect that, pending a new social welfare code, specific taxation be devoted to those dependent on social welfare.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the future of social welfare in this country is going to be because we are not yet fully conversant with the social welfare code to which this country subscribed when it signed a convention passed by the Council of Europe.  Neither are we in a position to know how widows, sick, old and unemployed people will be treated if Ireland becomes a member of the EEC but even if the social welfare code within the EEC were to be very much improved it would take some time to have it fully implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1880" /> There is a special case to be made for those who are the subject of this motion tonight, namely, widows.  We should all take note of the contribution made by Deputy Mrs. Burke.  I do not think any man could truly appreciate, although Deputies can more than other people, the problems of widows and their orphans when they lose their breadwinner.  When this happens everybody is full of sympathy for the widow and her family, people send letters and telegrams and neighbours call round and try to be as helpful and as charitable as they can&mdash;and they are very helpful and charitable in this country when such an occasion arises&mdash;but the day after the funeral these women need not only sympathy, they need the wherewithal to provide for their children.  If they happen to be notables in a particular district or if the husband died in tragic circumstances there is in many cases a generous response by people in an effort to provide for the widow and her orphans.  Would that that type of consideration and charity were embodied in some part of our social welfare code.  It is not that we would not like other social welfare recipients to have their allowances increased as well, but widows are in a somewhat different category.  The widow with four or five young children finds it difficult, if not impossible, to integrate into some other section of the family, be it with in-laws, her own mother, or some other relation. Old age pensioners are in many cases looked after by their children.  Recipients of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and sickness benefit are in many cases members of families which have some source of income.</P>
    <P>The means test operates more harshly against the widow with the non-contributory pension than it does against any other section.  For every 10s per week that a widow earns by way of wages her pension is reduced by practically the same amount.  It is most distressing for widows in receipt of non-contributory pensions that they cannot earn a little more than the meagre pension they get under the existing code.  The number of non-contributory widows' pensions must be declining all the time.  The number of old IRA are also declining and <Col N="1881" /> that has been used as an argument for giving them special consideration. Surely the same argument is equally applicable in the case of widows drawing non-contributory pensions?</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Burke referred to the frustration of the widow who has to wait three or four months before she gets her pension.  In the meantime she receives a few pounds per week from the home assistance officer.  There was a time when such money did not have to be refunded to the local authority. That has been changed and, as soon as the arrears of pension are made good, the unfortunate widow has to refund to the local authority the few pounds per week that she was given by the local authority while waiting for her pension. Perhaps the Minister might be able to do something to ensure that not all the moneys paid by way of home assistance would be deducted from accumulated arrears of pension.  As Deputy Mrs. Burke said, the widow feels alone and neglected.  She has to readjust to living. She has to readjust her standard of living.  She feels she is being cheated when what she got by way of home assistance is deducted from her pension arrears.</P>
    <P>Now that the Budget is to be introduced on 28th April this is an opportune moment for the Minister to approach his colleague&mdash;I know how difficult it is to get money from Ministers for Finance&mdash;to see if anything can be done on the lines suggested in the motion.  If there were a motion in the Budget for a capital gains tax in some form or another and the Minister for Finance came in here with a proposal that this tax on wealth would be devoted to certain classes of social welfare recipients, not alone would he get the support of the House but he would be acclaimed by the nation for taking from the rich in order to give to the poor.</P>
    <P>I know that deep consideration has to be given to various proposals that emanate from this House, but something on the lines of the tax I suggest should be introduced, not alone in respect of widows and orphans but also in respect of other people who are dependent on social welfare and particularly <Col N="1882" /> those who are dependent on social assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be remiss of me to let this opportunity pass without contributing to the debate.  All of us are agreed that the plight of the widow should be improved.  There are many widows in difficult circumstances mainly because their late husbands did not take out life insurance.  Thank God, there are many dutiful husbands who look after this aspect in the running of their lives.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in distributing the money available to him.  He has to run his Department.  There are approximately 136,000 widows and to give each an increase of 10s per week would run into something in the region of £3,276,000 at a rough calculation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will deal with that.  It is obvious that the amount of money available to widows is not enough.  The Minister has said so himself. He would like to give far more. There are things that could be done. There could be an extension of the free travel and free electricity schemes. Widows whose children are not school-going and who cannot go out to work because of that should get special consideration. I hope that in the Budget the Minister will distribute more money to this particular class of citizens.  There is, too, the widow who cannot obtain work because of her years.  As one speaker said last night, there is a reluctance on the part of many employers to employ widows.  They tend to want to employ much younger persons although there are many widows who were quite capable secretaries before they got married and are still capable of doing a very good job of work. There are also the widows who could go back to the jobs they held formerly.</P>
      <P>I would not waffle any further on this matter.  I do not doubt for one moment the sincerity of the speakers here in their desire to get a better deal for widows.</P>

      <P>Our Constitution re-echoes the conviction of the majority <Col N="1883" /> of our people that the family is the fundamental unit of our society and, as such, is deserving of all protection the State can give.  The reality of Irish society is that, on the death of the husband, the widow and her family are crushed by a multitude of economic and social pressures to the point at which family life becomes a nonentity, something which does not exist or, if it exists, operates under pressures which deprive the children and, indeed, the mother of the emotional bonds and the sense of security which should be theirs.</P>
      <P>We in Fine Gael accept the desire of all Members of this House to improve the lot of widows.  We would hope that the Minister and the Government will not express any resentment of our motion or the tabling of the motion.  I understand, indeed, that they intend to accept it.  That is the right attitude and I certainly hope that will be the Minister's declaration.  We are all politicians and by nature we are responsive to public demands.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Fine Gael motion proposed by Deputy Barry, seconded by Deputy O'Donnell, and supported by other speakers, including Deputy Joan Burke, herself a widow, is to bring pressure to bear on the Minister for Social Welfare so that, at this critical time of the year, he can go to his colleague, the Minister for Finance, and say: &ldquo;Look, we are on the spot.  We have had this motion passed unanimously in Dáil Éireann. This pressure is building up.  The widows of Ireland are no longer prepared to accept the position of fourth, fifth or tenth class citizens.  They ask that Irish society should now honour in the spirit as well as in the letter the declaration of our Constitution that family life must be respected and that they should get from Irish society the financial and other supports necessary to put them, deprived of the breadwinner, in as good a position as it is possible for Irish society to support.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that the allowances which are now paid to young mothers who have families to rear are appalling. Because of the Fine Gael conviction that widows are grossly unprovided for, when we published our detailed statement on social welfare policy as <Col N="1884" /> far back as January, 1969, we proposed a minimum pension of £5 a week for widows, not that we regarded that then as being the optimum, but because we regarded it as being a goal which could be achieved in the short run.  We regarded it as the bare minimum for a widow with, of course, equivalent benefits for children.  It was also with the same limitations in mind but, at the same time, compelled by the necessities of the situation, that last December the Fine Gael Party resolved that the widows' contributory pension should be increased immediately from a minimum of £4 10s a week to £6 a week, with payments for all dependent children increased from 18s to £1 10s weekly.  In respect of non-contributory pensions, Fine Gael maintain that the minimum pension should be increased from £4 5s to £5 10s a week and that the support for children should be increased from 15s to £1 5s a week.</P>
    <P>We appreciate that this will cost a great deal more money but we say that, if we are to have any respect for our society, we cannot ask our society to pay anything less to the widows and orphans in our midst.  One of the least excusable scandals in our society is the provision in our law which drastically cuts or abolishes the non-contributory widow's pension if the widow earns more than £4 a week.  That figure has been in application, if my recollection is correct, for a decade or more.  When £4 a week represents less than two days pay that is a terribly mean means test to apply to widows.  It surprises me, indeed, that the Department even bother to keep to such a paltry figure because it is so small as to discourage widows from taking even part-time employment to supplement what the State accepts as being an inadequate level of support for widows.</P>
    <P>The Deputy from North County Dublin, Deputy P.J. Burke, took great delight in the humanitarian approach of the Dublin Health Authority which supplements inadequate State pensions for widows with payments from home assistance.  I think he should feel a sense of shame that the Dublin Health Authority and other health authorities find it necessary to supplement State social welfare payments with home assistance. <Col N="1885" /> What is the definition of home assistance?  It is a payment which is made by law to people who are unable by their own industry or other lawful means to pay for the necessities of life, food, clothing and shelter.  The lawful means available to widows who are not working are their pensions.  Here we have a situation in which local authorities find as a matter of law and fact that widows dependent on State pensions are unable by their own industry or other lawful means to provide for the necessities of life.  Our society can do a great deal better than that and must live up to its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>We appreciate all the disadvantages of throwing social welfare supports into the general pool of taxation.  As long as necessary support for widows and other necessitous people in our midst is in competition for funds with everything from the revival of Irish to the Institute for Advanced Studies, the widows will come last in the queue. That is the reality not only in our society but in all other societies in which social welfare is thrown in as something which does not take priority over everything else.  That is why we in Fine Gael have argued and will continue to argue for the establishment of a family fund financed out of identifiable insurance contributions and out of identifiable taxation so that it could not be touched no matter what other demands might be made by the many other activities which are proper to the State.  The only way in which we will ever have adequate social welfare provision is by setting aside identifiable funds which are financed in an identifiable way.</P>
    <P>One of the drawbacks of our whole social welfare code is, of course, that we limit the number of people who are compulsorily insured.  This is no longer justifiable.  Everybody who has an income in Ireland should be contributing towards the social insurance fund.  We are sick and tired of listening to all the differences that are supposed to exist between Ireland and the rest of the world.  We are supposed to have more farmers, more independent employed people, more self-employed people; we are supposed to be so utterly different from the rest of mankind that we cannot bring in <Col N="1886" /> a scheme of universal insurance.  We do not accept that, and it is because we do not accept it that we have been pressing for a properly financed welfare fund and if this came into existence, then we believe that adequate provision would be made for widows.</P>
    <P>We know for a fact that the inevitable experience of Irish society is that out of every five women who marry, four will be widows and of the women who will be married, 45 per cent of those widows will have very young children to rear, from the age of seven years or under, at the time their husbands die.  These are things which have been established by the statistics available to us and there is a clear obligation on our society so to arrange its affairs that we provide the necessary financial security for such people.  It is no answer to say that we are free to arrange our individual insurances to provide against widowhood and for orphans.  We are, and so are we free to provide for our health expenses and so we are free to provide against the many other unavoidable consequences of the sins of Adam and Eve, but human nature being what it is and human experience teaching us certain lessons, we know that the majority of people will not make provision for these things.  Indeed, the people who need most of all to have provision made for these inevitable hardships of life are often times not in a position to pay for them themselves and so the money must be collected from those who are in a position to pay, and here the State has a clear obligation which our State has not as yet fulfilled.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that our present Minister is a kindly man and wishes to do more.  I anticipate that that will be the tenor of his remarks.  He can be assured as far as Fine Gael are concerned that we will not in any way withhold support from him now or on the day of the Budget for the provision which is necessary but we say that he must if he is to get better support and acceptance for increased taxation or increased insurance contributions, isolate the money coming into an identifiable fund so that people will know what they are paying for.  I think there are very few causes in Ireland <Col N="1887" /> which have a greater support across the board to all sections of the people than the cause of our widows and here I think a tribute is due to the Association of Irish Widows for the manner in which they have, in a most dignified and conscientious way, made their case during the three or four years of their existence.  Let us not ignore their plea.  We know they are justified.</P>
    <P>I suppose there is no Member of this House who is not aware, within his own circle of associations and family, of widows.  Does the heart of everybody not go out to the widow in her-distress at the time of the death and, indeed, the days and weeks and months immediately following but how soon we tend to forget the widow?  She is invited hither and thither and cared for and advised in the weeks immediately following the death of the spouse, but how often this concern evaporates with the passage of time and one feels that the widow is now adjusted, is now all right and able to look after herself, and she suffers from what Deputy Burke referred to as something of a lesser standing in our society.  This should not be so, and on reflection, each of us as an individual would agree that it should not be so, but unfortunately, it is the tendency and it was because of that tendency the widows themselves organised, so that they could lean on one another and learn from one another; but this is a terrible reflection on us all, and we must make great amends so that we can banish this feeling of insecurity and this sense of isolation which our widows at present inevitably feel because society is not supporting them and encouraging them in the many ways in which it should be doing it.</P>
    <P>I am going to anticipate a further argument of the Minister who will probably point out that the rate of pensions has not only kept pace with increases in the official cost of living index but has, in fact, outdistanced the official cost of living index.  I would say to the Minister, as I have said before, that it shows you just how utterly inadequate the cost of living index is as a measure of the standard <Col N="1888" /> of what life should be.  The truth is that pensions of all kinds have not kept pace with rising living standards, and, of course, the standards in our society have improved and it is proper that they should have improved, but it is because pensions have not kept pace with rising living standards that the void between the pensioners and people who are in more comfortable circumstances grows and that makes hardship, that makes loneliness and that makes the insecurity of widowhood all the more difficult to bear. We must, therefore, as a society take substantial steps to improve that situation. There are other ways in which the widow's lot could be improved, of course, and one of these would be to increase substantially children's allowances.  We in Fine Gael have already pointed out that we have the lowest children's allowances in Europe and if children's allowances were to be increased, as we believe they should, by at least two-thirds, it would be of some substantial benefit to widows and orphans.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully and others very properly spoke about the difficulties of widows in what are sometimes called the middle income group or the middle classes.  The aim of any social welfare code should be that in the event of the death of the breadwinner, the standard of living of the family should not be lowered in any way.  Those words are contained in our resolution, that the living standards should be maintained, and if a widow has had the good fortune while her husband was alive to live in a purchase house which carries considerable rates, then we should provide sufficient income for that widow that she does not have to sell the house; but we do not and again and again, if there is not a family available to provide the necessary money to pay rates, widows have found themselves obliged to sell out the house and to use the capital, which should be there to provide a home of money to pay rates, widows have found themselves obliged to sell out the house and to use the capital, which should be there to provide a home of equal standard for herself and her children, to pay rent on a flat, which at present rates means that the capital very quickly declines, and often times a widow finds herself in considerable distress at the end of it.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the scheme of <Col N="1889" /> rates remission is of no assistance to any widow who has not more than the bare subsistence level paid to non-contributory pensioners.  If a widow earns, or even receives from her connections, as much as £1 a week above the bare level of the non-contributory pension she is deprived from getting any assistance under the rates remission code.  This is not a criticism of the rates remission code.  It is a criticism of the gross inadequacy of the widows' pensions and the other welfare services which we should be offering to widows.</P>
    <P>One of the great shortcomings of our whole social welfare code is that there are 16 different means tests.  Most of these do not affect people who are in relatively comfortable circumstances throughout their lives.  They do not have to submit to these tests as long as they have an adequate income.  What is the plight of the widow who has had a comfortable income when her husband is alive and then finds herself thrown into the loneliness and distress of a home in which there is no man to look after her or to counsel her, and no partner to help her?  In most cases she does not know where to turn.  She does not know what she is entitled to. She does not know how to go to the various welfare offices, the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Health, the local health authorities, the local county council, or the Department of Education in order to get the many benefits to which she, in her poverty, becomes entitled.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal to recommend a system under which the Registrar of Deaths would notify the local health authority or the welfare authority in the event of the recording of the death of a man leaving a widow.  In such cases the welfare officer could call around to the widow and could assist in the preparation of a claim for the widows' pension, the medical card or home assistance, if that should be necessary, and of the claims for the many other benefits to which the widow would be entitled.  We ought to end the system which operates in this country under which the welfare code is operated in a conspiracy of silence. We do not adequately advertise our available to them and their orphan <Col N="1890" /> welfare schemes.  It is a pity that the whole welfare and pension code are phrased in language which makes it impossible even for well-lettered people to understand.  The Minister for Social Welfare should make a special effort to remedy this position.  We are quite well aware of the fact that the Department of Health, the Department of Social Welfare and the home assistance authorities are now paying out far more money to more people than they paid two, five or ten years ago.  To some extent this is because of the growth of the various societies, such as the societies which look after old people, the schemes like meals on wheels, the home visiting committees and, of course, our local authority-operated domiciliary welfare scheme. Why has the demand increased?  As the welfare workers increased and went about their work they found pockets of poverty and individuals who were suffering destitution, neglect and impoverishment through sheer ignorance of their entitlement.  A great deal more needs to be done in this sphere if real help is to be given to our people in our time in the quantity to which they are entitled.  That is why I strongly advocate that once it becomes officially recorded anywhere that a breadwinner has died the local authority should send a welfare officer to assist the widow in the preparation of her many claims.  One cannot rely on relations or friends.  In a large number of cases the relations and friends do not themselves know what help is available. There are many Deputies in this House and members of local authorities who did not know what benefits people were entitled to until they became members of public authorities and found it necessary to make inquiries.  It was only through their experience in looking after people that such people became untrained and then more experienced welfare officers.  That is a very clumsy and utterly inadequate way in which to operate a welfare service and one that no progressive society should be satisfied with.</P>
    <P>The motion asks Dáil Éireann to be conscious of the grave hardships suffered by widows because of the quite inadequate social welfare services children and calls on the Government <Col N="1891" /> to provide a comprehensive social welfare code for widows and their families so that their standard of living will not be lowered by the deaths of family breadwinners.  May we urge on the Minister to receive the motion in the spirit in which it is put before him? It is not put before him for the purpose of scoring political points.  I do not believe that the widows are in the least interested in any of us scoring points or taking credit for anything we have done in the past, or trying to blame others for not doing more.  Together we must try to do a great deal better.  Deputy O'Connell queried the wording of the motion and expressed disappointment in it in that it was not more specific.  The Deputy knows the difficulty which faces members of the Opposition of the House and back-bench members of the Government side.  They are prohibited by the rules of the House from moving any motion which may impose a charge on the public funds.  Even though we in our hearts and in our heads are convinced that this country can at least afford £6 a week for widows, we cannot table a resolution asking Dáil Éireann to pay £6 a week to widows.  That is the reality.  If the Minister comes in with such a proposal on Budget day and if he earmarks the tax which has to be collected to pay that sum, I am sure that no one in this House will vote against such a necessary resolution.  It is necessary because it is not going to provide any immense degree of comfort or any wonderful security or even rid widows of fears but it at least would be some indication that we want to bring the widows a little higher than they are at the moment and that is below the poverty line.  That is no way in which to treat the families in our society which we guarantee in our Constitution to protect.  We are not protecting or even safeguarding them. It is really a miracle that the widows of Ireland have done as well as they have.  Some of the best of our citizens, as we know, have come from homes in which the father has died while the children were young.  These people have performed miracles and we know that only saints perform miracles.  That is why I believe that the widows of <Col N="1892" /> Ireland are the unrecorded and unhonoured saints of Ireland.  We cannot honour them in this life but let us at least provide the widow with some little degree of comfort by providing a more adequate pension than our welfare services have done in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will intervene but briefly because I know that there are others who are anxious to speak.  I will say that at this stage I can see no objection to the motion before the House and I only hope that it has been tabled with the utmost sincerity and that all the speeches made in relation to the widows are quite sincere.  To me the widows are another section of all those who come under the social welfare code.  By saying that, I am not saying that I do not share the views of those who have expressed themselves in rather extreme terms with regard to the position in which widows find themselves.  I suppose we could make a similar case for every other section of our people who come under the social welfare code, if we wanted to do so.  The widows have a good case but they are not the only ones who have.  As the years go by we find the public conscience becoming more and more sensitive and more ready to accept responsibility for those whom they feel they have an obligation towards&mdash;the weaker sections of the community.  It is now becoming easier for a Minister for Social Welfare to deal with these matters than it was, I must admit.  There is not always quite the same atmosphere in the lobbies when new taxes are imposed. Indeed for whatever laudable purpose they may be imposed at the time as soon as people have to pay more in terms of extra prices that good cause, for which the taxes were originally imposed, seems to be forgotten and the Government are flogged with the accusation of unnecessarily creating taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased with all the assurances that I have got and I can assure Deputies that my sympathy is no less and, I hope, equally sincere.  We have some 125,888 widows and almost half of these receive old age pensions.  Some <Col N="1893" /> 54,695 receive pensions as widows, and 48,350, as persons over 70, receive old age pensions, leaving some 22,000 widows without pensions and not 69,000 as Deputy Ryan mentioned across the House some time ago.  But these figures do not prove anything. There is a fairly strong lobby at present in favour of widows and they have an association which is exerting itself and trying to develop a sense of priority in the matter of social welfare benefits as far as widows are concerned. I would have liked to have seen the approach in this matter a little more selective or more discriminatory than it is.  There is a vast difference in the types of widow we have to deal with and to whom society has an obligation.  My first sympathy goes to the widow with dependent children. She cannot at all be put in the same category as a young widow with no dependants, who is not much different from a single girl.</P>
    <P>In England a widow under 40 who has no dependants receives no pension and a widow who is aged between 40 and 50 receives only a limited pension. You come back then to the higher bracket and you have half the widows in the 70 and over category who qualify for old age pension.  That is why the scheme as it is is very much biased in favour of those with dependants.  I should like any future improvement in the scheme to take that important factor into consideration and it would be my intention that we should make the greatest progress in that direction.</P>
    <P>Some time ago on television I was accused of saying &ldquo;A widow with over £10 a week, a widow with five children&rdquo; which was the number of family being mentioned at the time, but what I did say was &ldquo;over £10 from social welfare&rdquo;, that was adding the children's allowances to the widow's pension. A widow with five children gets £10.25 from social welfare at present. I am not saying that that is an adequate amount but it is a lot better than what some people would have us believe they have to live on.  Prior to 1935 this country made no provision for widows and I do not know how they managed. From there on the amount has increased progressively.  Ten years ago it was 23s but it is £4.30 today for the <Col N="1894" /> non-contributory pension.  Those speakers who said that the increases only took into account the increased cost of living, that they were based merely on the consumer price index increase on the previous year, were not correct.  The amount granted in each successive year has been far in excess of the increase in the consumer price index, if it were justified merely on that.  I hope that this is part of the pattern towards which we hope to move in order to reach a figure which would be considered adequate.  I do not think that anybody in this House would say anybody under the social welfare code is getting enough.  It is always something about which we say &ldquo;That is not bad but it is not enough&rdquo;.  I suppose that will always be said.</P>
    <P>When I was talking about the pressure being exerted with regard to widows at present in order to give them priority in the social welfare code I should have said that the figures are not always made known properly to the public generally.  Deputy Corish was right when he said that the tendency is for the number on the contributory pension to increase.  That is so and they have gone up to 75 per cent. Seventy-five per cent of total widows' pensions at the moment are contributory and these pensions are not subject to a means test.  These people can work to their hearts' content, they can have any type of employment or occupation that they wish and still draw their pensions, so that it is not fair to apply that employment test to 75 per cent of these.  Only 16 per cent of the total number of widows getting pensions have children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about those who have them at the moment.  Only 16 per cent of the total have dependent children.  These people are identifiable immediately as the most deserving in the whole range of widows <Col N="1895" /> in the different categories&mdash;contributory, non-contributory, young widows, childless widows and older widows who have reached 70 years of age and move on to old age pensions.</P>
      <P>At the moment pensions cost the State £15½ million and of course to double the figure, as somebody suggested, would cost another £15½ million and, as my colleague would say, that is not beer and skittles when you are talking about £15 millions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that there are many other people to be considered also.  We must think of people who have not yet come under the social welfare code.  I am not saying this in an effort to denigrate the case made for widows here yesterday and today.  Do Deputies ever think of the married woman, with a family, whose husband is a permanent invalid and who has to struggle on and who may not have any social welfare contributions on which to call, or any income whatever and who is left completely to the mercies of the home assistance scheme?  This is only to mention one case, the type of case about which we could say a great deal.  If I went on to give cases like this I would probably be accused of trying to eclipse the great case that has already been made for this particular section.  However, I do not want to hold up the House all evening because other Deputies want to speak and as well as that I have to return to the Seanad after the tea adjournment, but I do want to say that I have every sympathy with the motion and I want to emphasise that what is involved is £15 million odd.  I have tried to outline the progress that has been made within the last ten years and which I think is tremendous progress.  I have tried to point out that there are many other sections that we must also think of. When one is dealing with figures of this magnitude a few shillings a week rapidly mount up to a great many pounds.  To give every widow in the State £1 a week without any increase for dependent children would cost almost £7 million.  I think it was in the Budget before the last that we were able to extend the allowance for dependent children to the age of 21 where <Col N="1896" /> they are still at school.  I had many letters from grateful widows whose children's education was at the most expensive stage.  They found that extension of tremendous benefit.</P>
    <P>The tendency has been and, please God, will continue to be to devote a higher percentage of the State's resources to these necessary benefits.  I hope that if and when the House is called on to vote moneys for these deserving purposes the Members will, as they have been promising in this debate, support generously any necessary taxes for that purpose.</P>

      <P>I shall not delay the House but I wish to say a few words in this important debate.  The Minister's constituency is in my area and he knows the conditions in the poorer parts of Leitrim and Donegal. When a widow is left on a small farm in a village where there is no employment, or in similar circumstances, the Minister knows how hard it is for her to live.  In the ordinary way, families are having a hard time due to rising costs and prices.  It is much harder for the widow.  No doubt the £11.25 or £10 the Minister mentioned for a widow and five children is a generous allowance but when that must cover food, clothes, books and boots and the other expenses involved in a household, each week, including perhaps a doctor's bill and medicine and other odds and ends, the sum provided must be handled very carefully by the widow.  I agree with what other speakers have said.  We know of friends left in this terrible position of having to face life with six, seven or eight children.  It is not so serious if one of the children is able to earn money, but it is very serious for the widow with five, six, seven or eight children, all dependent on her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1897" /> Cases have come to my notice of widows making a genuine effort to live and provide for their children by supplementing their pensions by going out to work and they discovered the pension was either stopped or reduced. That is one provision in the Act that should be remedied.  If a contributory worker qualifies for a pension after reaching 70 he can still earn money while drawing his pension.  Surely his situation is not as serious as that of a widow with a family to look after?</P>
    <P>The widow's pension is altogether too low.  We know of people who are finding it very hard to live.  The Minister represents my area and he knows that particularly in some of the towns in Sligo and Leitrim, widows are very sorely pressed in trying to eke out a living.</P>

      <P>When seconding the motion I said I felt sure that the motion sponsored by my three colleagues and myself on behalf of Fine Gael would meet with general acceptance on all sides of the House.  The debate clearly confirmed my hopes in that regard.  The general tenor of the debate and the constructive approach adopted by every speaker reflects the concern of the Dáil in regard to the problems and hardships of this most deprived section of the community. I am also pleased by the Minister's approach to the motion and it is only proper to thank him for having spoken so constructively and realistically on the various points raised.  It is no harm to make this point by way of conclusion: the one thing that has come out of the debate is the urgent and crying need for a review of the entire social welfare code.  We on this side of the House agree with the Minister that the widow with young children should be our first consideration if it is a question of priorities.  That view of the Minister will find general acceptance.</P>

    <P>I realise the Minister's difficulties and I realise the claims on the public purse are many and varied but I believe we have a responsibility not merely to ensure that all sections of the community will enjoy an adequate standard of living but to make provision <Col N="1898" /> for ensuring that that standard of living is maintained to a reasonable degree in the event of any unexpected happenings such as sickness, unemployment or, as in the case of the motion under discussion, the loss of a husband.</P>
    <P>I hope this motion will strengthen the Minister's hand in his fight with the Minister for Finance in the crucial days before the Budget.  I sincerely hope we shall see in the Budget that practical expression has been given to the sentiments expressed by the Minister for Social Welfare here this evening.</P>
    <P>I believe it is possible to effect major improvements in the pensions and allowances payable to widows immediately.  I realise of course that the formulation and implementation of a modern and realistic social welfare code is something more long-term but I sincerely hope the day is not far distant when we shall have a realistic social welfare code covering all classes of social welfare beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>Reform is most urgent and improvements are most badly needed in the area of widows' pensions and allowances. I hope the Minister will find it possible to secure a rather bigger slice of the national cake for this section of the community in the next Budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister did outline certain statistical information in relation to widows and he stated the proportion in receipt of contributory pensions and the proportion in receipt of non-contributory pensions.  Deputy Ryan has pointed out that there are a huge number of widows in receipt of no pension at all.  While a certain number of those not in receipt of any pension may be in the fortunate position of being well provided for financially and materially by their husband before he died, we must not lose sight of the fact that under the existing means test a considerable number, running into several thousands, of widows are deprived of any pension because their means exceed, in some cases by a nominal amount, the statutory limit.</P>
    <P>I believe the first and most urgent step that the Minister should take is to modify the means test in respect <Col N="1899" /> of non-contributory widow's pensions. This is long overdue particularly in the light of the rapid increase in the cost of living.  A strong case can be made now for a complete reassessment of the general rules and regulations relating to the means test in so far as it applies to widows.  If a widow in receipt of a contributory widow's pension works and pays insurance contributions she should be entitled to the full allowances when she falls ill.  It is a shame that such a person should be deprived of the maximum social welfare benefits in view of the fact that she is contributing.</P>
    <P>Most aspects of the problem have been covered during the course of the debate and I do not want to repeat what has been said but this motion has served a very useful purpose in that it has focused the attention of Members of Dáil Éireann, the Minister for Social Welfare and the Government on the fact that there is a large section of the community in need of assistance which only the State can provide.</P>
    <P>We in the Fine Gael Party were pleased with the Minister's reaction to the motion and we wish him well in his fight with the Minister for Finance. We hope he will succeed and that widows will get a fair deal in the Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( )  The Minister shall not make an establishment order in relation to an authority to which this Act applies unless he is requested to do so by (a) the authority in respect of which he proposes to make the establishment order or (b) the General Council of County Councils or (c) the association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When I considered this Bill I became somewhat uneasy about it and I declined, at the conclusion of the Second Reading, to agree to all Stages being taken then.  I requested, in conjunction with some members of the Labour Party, a Committee Stage in order to put down amendments for the purpose of clarifying, for my own satisfaction, at any rate, what exactly is behind this measure.  I understand that there are negotiations going on between an undefined body known as the County Managers Association and certain bodies representing local government officials.  The Minister told us that his object in bringing in the Bill was to give him power to incorporate the County Managers Association, provide it with a seal and authorise it to negotiate on behalf of local authorities with bodies representing the official side.  I understand that and I have no objection to it, but the Minister in his Second Reading speech&mdash;I am speaking from memory now&mdash;said it would be foolish not to avail of the occasion to take the very wide powers proposed to be conferred on him by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, section 3 enables the Minister to make an establishment order to establish a corporate body to perform certain functions on behalf of local authorities.  If I am right in my interpretation, the Minister has power to appoint the members <Col N="1901" /> of this body and, as far as I can see, this corporate body, when it is appointed and entrusted with the discharge of certain functions, need not refer back to the corporate body; it is not a sub-committee of it.  If it were a sub-committee it would refer back and would be subject to the sanction of the elected representatives and, if that were the position, I would understand where we were going.</P>
    <P>A county manager operates through managerial orders which come before the local authority, at least for discussion and criticism, and he is subject to section 4 of the Act of 1954, 1955 or 1956&mdash;I am not sure which year it is.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> No, not with regard to staff but in regard to certain matters, excluding health and other matters.  If I am right in my thinking, this measure proposes to give the Minister power to delegate local authority functions to some sort of puppet of his own and, if that is the case, then I am dead against it because it would be the beginning of an invasion of whatever powers are left to local authorities.</P>
      <P>My amendment seeks to provide that the Minister shall not make an establishment order to establish one of these corporate bodies unless he is requested to do so by the local authority in respect of which he proposes to make the establishment order.  That means that he cannot make an establishment order affecting Cavan County Council, or any other county council, unless he is requested to do so by the council or alternatively, he is requested to do so by the General Council of County Councils or the association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland.</P>
      <P>As I see it, this Bill could pave the way for some of the ideas in the Minister's White Paper on local government. It could mean the beginning of the end of local authorities, as we understand them.  I may be wrong in that and I hope the Minister will be able to convince me to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must emphasise once again what I said on the Second Stage of the <Col N="1902" /> Bill, that is, there is no intention of detracting in any way from the functions of local authorities.  I hope I will be able to allay the Deputy's fears in this respect and that he will accept my word as to my true intent.  There is only one purpose behind this measure and that is to enable the Minister to establish a body to provide services for local authorities and health boards.  Under existing legislation there is no method whereby these bodies can act collectively.  This Bill will enable the Minister to set up a body to provide services which are deemed to be essential for greater efficiency in the running of local authorities and health boards.  One immediate need is for a body to assist city and county managers in their dealings with staffs of local authorities and health boards on staff matters.  Experience to date shows that there have been long delays from the time claims are originally made to the time when they are actually dealt with by the managers and decisions made.  It is proposed under this Bill to establish immediately a body which will provide a service to the managers to enable them to deal more expeditiously with such claims.</P>
      <P>To deal specifically with the amendment put down by Deputy Fitzpatrick, I must say at the outset that I am not prepared to accept the amendment. The purpose of the Bill is not in any way to detract from the powers of local authorities but rather to enable suitable machinery to be established to make available to them services which of their very nature need to be organised on a countrywide basis or which, for one reason or another, cannot be provided by the local authorities individually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage the only corporate body which it has been decided to establish, if the Bill becomes law, is the one to which I referred, that is, the one to enable the local authority conciliation and arbitration scheme to operate more effectively.  We must recognise, however, that local government is constantly changing and evolving.  It is inevitable that the need for new services will arise in the future.  The central authority must be prepared and indeed, equipped to provide these services, <Col N="1903" /> either directly or through an appropriate body such as a corporate body of the kind envisaged in this Bill.</P>
    <P>For this reason the Bill is framed in general terms.  It does not give the Minister complete freedom to decide what corporate bodies will be established. Under section 7 the Oireachtas is given power to veto the creation of any particular body.  In the case of the body to which I have already referred, that is the proposed Local Government Staff Negotiations Board, the intention is that the body will provide services for all local authorities and all health boards.  The establishment of this body was decided on following consultations with the city and county managers who, as the Deputy knows, exercise all of the staff functions of local authorities, and also in consultation with the Irish Local Government Officials Union.</P>
    <P>In the same way, I envisage that the establishment of any other corporate body would be preceded by appropriate consultations with the interests concerned. To make express statutory provision for this would not, however, be desirable, in my opinion.  To limit the power to establish corporate bodies in the manner proposed in the amendment would not be desirable either because it would remove the power of initiative from the Minister who, after all, is responsible for the formulation of national policy in relation to the main local services and is also responsible for maintaining general surveillance over the whole range of local authorities' activities so as to ensure that problems and difficulties are tackled in good time.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to accept that the Minister should not be entitled, after considering the overall position, to establish a body to provide certain services without getting the consent of every one of the local authorities for whom the services are being made available, or of one or other of the local authority associations.  I do not think that any Minister will set up a corporate body unless he is fully satisfied that there is a need for it and that its services will be utilised by local authorities.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Bill is not <Col N="1904" /> designed to transfer functions from local authorities but to make services available to them.  It seems to me that the amendment may be based on the assumption that the Bill will interfere with or in some way detract from the powers of local authorities.  This will not be the case.  I would ask Deputy Fitzpatrick to accept it from me that there is no such intention.  I cannot see how it would arise when the only purpose is to enable a service to be given to the local authorities and not to take powers from them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I must confess that I now feel I was absolutely justified in putting down this amendment and that all my fears in connection with this measure are justified. The Minister has told us that the object in introducing this measure is to deal with this problem of negotiations between the City and County Managers Association and the staff. I know that.  Will the Minister tell me what else he has in mind, what other types of functions he thinks it would be expedient to hand over to this body which is not accountable to anyone?  It may be accountable to the Minister but I am now satisfied that it has not to report back to the elected representatives.  It is not subject to their sanction.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see, the Minister could entrust this body with the striking of the rates.  He could incorporate a body and there is nothing in this to provide that it can deal only with managerial functions.  If he even did that it would not be so bad.  There is nothing in this Bill so far as I can see that does not authorise the Minister to set up boards on which there need not be one elected representative. Section 4 provides:</P>
      <P>Every establishment order shall require the body thereby established to provide itself with a seal and shall contain, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, such provisions as the Minister considers appropriate in relation to the number of members of the body established by the order, the method, terms and conditions of their appointment...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1905" /> I am aware of the James Connolly Hospital Establishment Order and I am aware that it gives representation to local authorities.  This is the old idea of availing of any opportunity to get complete authority, to get a blank cheque.  I do not say that the Minister has any sinister ideas in his head but he will not always be there. There may be another Minister and some bright people in his Department may be confronted with what they regard as a difficult local authority down the country and say: &ldquo;We will deal with these fellows.  We will make an establishment order and we will operate through this corporate body instead.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister could honestly tell me now that it is not possible under this Bill to incorporate a body and ask it to strike a rate, or to hand over to it the decision to take over or not to take over roads, or to discharge such other limited functions as are reserved at present to local authorities.  That is why when I read this Bill I got this sort of feeling, and nothing that the Minister has said to date has removed that fear from my mind.  Obviously he has no idea&mdash;or if he has he is not prepared to tell us what it is&mdash;what other functions could or should be transferred.  Lip service is paid to local authorities in the White Paper and elsewhere but I believe this is part of the machinery to divest local authorities of whatever is left to them and to hand that over to the Minister.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wrote into this Bill that a majority of the members of this corporate body, or some percentage of them, would have to be elected representatives, or that they would have to come back to the local authority for sanction, that would be an improvement but when the Minister and the Minister for Finance think it fit or expedient to establish such a body they can do so and between them they will decide who the members of this body will be, and not one, single, solitary one of them needs to be a member of a local authority, I think this is the most outrageous proposition that has come before this House or the Seanad during the past ten years and I am positively and definitely against it.  It <Col N="1906" /> is dangerous; it is unnecessary; and as I say, all we know from the Minister is that somebody in his Department in their great wisdom thinks that some time in the future this sort of measure might be necessary: &ldquo;We might be able to operate it and we might be able to achieve some of the unknown ends which we may at some unspecified time in the future have in mind.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick continues to amaze me that he could draw all these conclusions from this simple Bill which does not provide the Minister with the type of powers which he is implying in his statements here.  The Bill as it is drawn up simply enables me to establish a corporate body to provide services to the local authorities and health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not enable the Minister to take powers away from local authorities.  The Deputy stated that I did not give any indication as to what other type of services might at some time in the future be required and which this Bill would enable the establishment of a body to provide. I did indicate on the last occasion in the House and when speaking in the Seanad that, though I have not any other type of service in mind at the present time, I do intend if and when the Bill passes, to make an establishment order to set up a body to deal with staff matters in local authorities. I have not made my mind up to establish any other type of corporate body, but I can give, and have given, examples of the types of service which may at some time in the future be necessary for local athorities and I mentioned specifically the question of a computer service.  This Bill would enable such a service to be made available to local authorities and health boards.  The Bill is drafted in a general way, because we do not know what types of service may be required in the future and it is as well to leave the Bill in general terms and to enable the establishment of bodies to provide such services as may be considered essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1907" /> On this matter of saying that no publicly elected representatives need be on this body and that there is no referring back to publicly elected representatives, the Deputy is aware that when an establishment order is made, that order will be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas and a motion to annual that establishment order may be made within seven sitting days.  This does give the Oireachtas the final say in whether or not the order shall become law and the final decision in that way does, in fact, lie with the elected representatives.</P>
    <P>I have not much more to say in regard to what the Deputy has been saying.  I think it is quite clear and quite simple and I take it the Deputy will accept that there is no ulterior motive, no intention in any way to detract from the powers of local authorities and no intention on my part to seek at any time to take from local authorities functions which they are operating at present.  I continue to be amazed at the Deputy's attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of prolonging this debate as I know the Minister is not in good form at present and I do not want to keep him any longer than is absolutely necessary.  I am somewhat confused by Deputy Fitzpatrick's discussion of this matter because to me it appeared, when the Bill was going through first, that this was simply a method of enabling the County Managers Association to have the service which is normally available to every trade union in this country to prepare a case for the purpose of dealing in a reasonable way with claims before it, but Deputy Fitzpatrick has suggested, and I am afraid the Minister has not quite denied it, that there may be other uses to which the proposals would apply.  I would hate to think that the original idea would be moved away from.  The Minister has said that it must come before the House to be annulled or not, but we all know that there is no record of any motion moved by a Government being annulled in the House and that there will not be as long as a Government have a majority of the Members of the House, so that I think it is <Col N="1908" /> not the safeguard which the Minister tries to make out it is.</P>
      <P>There is one question I would ask him.  I am still quite happy that the Bill as it is will do a job which I think is required to be done because there have been far too long delays.  It refers merely to &ldquo;officer status&rdquo; and I assume that the idea is to deal with officer status in local authority employment, because if it refers to &ldquo;servant status&rdquo; as well, there is the problem of who was consulted before the decision to bring this in in this way was taken. The union which the Minister has referred to have the right to negotiate for officer status and they were the proper people to be consulted, if officer status is covered by the Bill.  Otherwise, it would be necessary at least to consult with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, or some of its constituent unions, for the purpose of finding out what their views were; but personally I believe that if what the Minister says, that this is designed to give the County Managers Association the know-how which I am afraid we feel they have not got at present&mdash;otherwise, things would not drag on so long&mdash;if that is the only reason it is being set up, I could not agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick, particularly because of the fact that, as of now, the elected representatives have no say in the fixing of wages or the granting of working conditions.  They do not come into it at all.  The county manager is, in fact, responsible for staff matters and even section 4 cannot move him from that if staff matters like health matters are affected.  I want to make that point and, perhaps, the Minister could clarify it.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> In one way I am amazed at Deputy Tully and in another way I can understand his attitude.  He knows that the immediate objective of this Bill is to provide a body which will negotiate salary increases on behalf of local government officials.  I am 100 per cent with him in that, but if he reads the Bill, he will find that there is not a word in it, from beginning to end, about local government officials or anything else.  It is a Bill which will enable the Minister to establish authority to render services on behalf of local authorities.  If it were a Bill to establish corporate bodies to render such services as they were requested to render by the local authorities or by the county manager then I would understand them and I would not be so much against them but this is a Bill to establish an authority to render such services as the Minister may determine, not as they may be requested to render by the local authority in such matters as are reserved <Col N="1910" /> to them to perform or by the county manager in the sphere of managerial functions.  It is a Bill which will entrust to this body such functions as the Minister should think they should perform.  The Minister has not denied that it is not necessary for this body which he will incorporate and which need not have as one of its members a resident within the local authority area concerned to report back or seek sanction from anybody.  Certainly they will not have to seek sanction from the county manager or the local authority. The Minister has said time and again that what I say is not the intention, and that what I fear will not be done and that the sole object of the Bill is to establish a body to fix up salaries&mdash;a very laudable object but in my opinion it is the sugar on the pill.  It is part of the package deal. I am asking the Minister now does he tell me that this measure does not contain the machinery to take away from local authorities powers which they have now, if the Minister for Local Government wished to do so?</P>

The only thing is if it does authorise the Minister to introduce some other system which is not covered and, having once got permission to set up such a body, he can set up one for a different reason.

We have now reached the stage where the only difference between the Corporate Bodies Bill under the Health Act and this Bill is that the Health Act (Corporate Bodies) Bill refers to functions and this Bill refers to services. I think it is a very hairline distinction.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I cannot draw a distinction now between services and functions.  I think it is too neat a distinction to put across. The Minister would have been much better advised simply to set up his negotiating body from a sub-committee of the City and County Managers Association&mdash;a body I am not in favour of&mdash;and I agree with the Minister that I am both cautious and suspicious. I believe that I would not be discharging my duties if I were not so.  I am thinking that this invades rights of the local authorities.  I cannot put it much further than I have put it.  I say that it is at least arguable on the basis of the similar Bill under the Health Act and this Bill that this measure can be used to invade the rights of local authorities, to take powers away from the county manager in the first instance, which will then not come before the local authorities for discussion as a managerial order. If this was really a piece of machinery to enable the county councils to do something, like getting a sub-contractor to build a hospital, or getting somebody else to make a road, then they are still responsible for that; they must <Col N="1914" /> make the decision and the county manager must be satisfied that the work is done, but what I feel, and the Minister has not said that I am wrong, is that once these bodies are set up they render the service and that is that. Under the other thing they will perform the function.  I do not see any difference between performing a function and performing a service.  It is the same thing to me.</P>
      <P>I am really and genuinely alarmed about this and I do not believe that Deputies realise what is involved or what this measure can be used to do. If they did there would be far more opposition to the Bill.  The Bill was introduced in the Seanad, and I am glad of that because I like to see Bills being introduced in the Seanad, but it was introduced purely as a formal and non-contentious business, but as I say I think this is a typical departmental attitude&mdash;&ldquo;when we are at this we will slip in a section which will deal with something else; we do not want it now but it might come in useful some time&rdquo;.  That is what I am against.</P>

      <P>On the question of the words &ldquo;function&rdquo; and &ldquo;service&rdquo;.  In existing legislation, the phrase that is used when referring to the powers of local authorities is &ldquo;powers, functions and duties&rdquo;.  In order deliberately to illustrate that this Bill in no way interferes with powers we have used the word &ldquo;services&rdquo;.  The Deputy is a member of a local authority and has had long experience of local authorities and he knows how they work.  He must appreciate that at present there is no machinery by which a service can be provided for all local authorities.  They have no power at present to act collectively in any matter and there is a need now to provide a service which will be of assistance to all local authorities. There may be a time in the future when some other service&mdash;and I might mention the computer service as an example&mdash;that could be beneficial to all local authorities would have to be run by a central authority.  I am giving that as an illustration.  I do not see any great difficulties in the Bill and I would ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment.</P>

As I see it, the idea behind this Bill is to provide the services which will allow them to have that know-how, to have the experience, expertise and knowledge which will allow them present their side of the case.  If that is so I think it is a good idea.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;function&rdquo; relates to the powers of local authorities and the word &ldquo;services&rdquo; relates merely to assisting them in the carrying out of their functions and powers. It is only to help them to do their work more efficiently and more effectively. I think I have explained it sufficiently now anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The difficulty is that I am concerned that it will not be the local authorities who will decide they would like this service performed by this corporate body, it is the Minister who will decide it.  The Minister will make the establishment <Col N="1917" /> order.  The Minister will decide what functions or what services will be rendered and he will decide who will be the members of the corporate body.  If it was beyond doubt that they could only do what they were asked to do, render such services as they were asked to do, I would be quite happy with that, but the very case that the Minister makes for introducing the Bill, to wit, that the body will negotiate on behalf of the management side of the councils in wage negotiations means that the Minister must be satisfied that he can say that this body have power to negotiate on behalf of all the councils.</P>
      <P>That is a virtue that Deputy Tully sees in it, that he will have a blanket organisation here that will be able to negotiate on behalf of all the local authorities, that will bind them all and that he will know who he is talking to, and that when he has made a deal with them he will know that that deal is concluded and nobody can go back on it.  There is a lot of virtue in that and if that was all that was in the Bill I would be in favour of it but if the argument which both Deputy Tully and the Minister make is valid, it means that the arguments that I have made against the Bill and the fears that I see in the Bill are also valid because it means that the Minister can say to this corporate body, &ldquo;You go do it and do something on behalf of all the county councils in Ireland and they will be bound by it.&rdquo;  Either that is right and that is what it means or it is useless to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister is bringing it in to negotiate wage agreements which would be binding on behalf of all local authorities. That is why Deputy Tully wants it.  I can see that both from the Minister's and Deputy Tully's point of view it is a very good piece of legislation for this particular purpose because when the bargain is made and the deal concluded everybody knows where he stands and everybody is bound by it.</P>

The body it is proposed to establish under this <Col N="1918" /> Bill will assist the managers in carrying out their functions in relation to staff and salary matters.  It will not make any decisions which will be binding on the managers and staff or on the Minister or anybody.  They will merely provide a service which will assist the managers when they come together, those of them who are selected, to carry out this function on behalf of all the city and county managers.  This organisation will be permanent and will &ldquo;vet&rdquo; all the applications and will supply the managers with the necessary information when they sit down to discuss salary matters.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the whole reason for this.  They are not able to carry out their ordinary functions as managers in their own areas.  In addition to their ordinary day-to-day work within their own counties they are obliged to negotiate with staffs.  There is a large number of categories of staffs in the local authorities and health boards.  This involves a large amount of work which the Deputy will appreciate takes the manager away from his normal duties and away from the county for which, as top executive, he is responsible.  While he is away, work is piling up in his home area and because of the large volume of claims coming in and the lack of proper machinery to deal with them, a backlog was building up.  Consequently, there were long delays between the times the staff made their claims and the managers were finally able to meet them and discuss the claims and make a decision.  There have been delays of over 12 months.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> This is the section which gives the Minister power to appoint members of the corporate body.  At least he should <Col N="1921" /> consult somebody before doing that. This is the whole trend of the Bill&mdash;to give the Minister power to do everything without consulting anybody except the Minister for Finance.  The Bill should specify the number of members on the board and the Minister should consult, or get nominees from the General Council of County Councils. If we are to preserve local democracy &mdash;it may not appeal to everybody but it still appeals to me&mdash;we should consult locally elected representatives. The body set up may not have any local representatives on it.  Surely in a matter such as wage negotiations it would not be a bad thing to have an ordinary citizen, a chairman of a county council, even if he is only in a minority, to express his views?  As it is, the Minister can put on anybody he likes.  That is the whole trend of the Bill.</P>

Will he say what further duties they are likely to have because wage negotiations take a couple of months every year or two and, if the Minister is correct, this will shorten the proceedings and it will only take a couple of weeks.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 5, to delete all words after &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 24 to the end of the subsection and substitute &ldquo;shall not come into operation until a resolution shall have been passed by each House of the Oireachtas approving of same.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not propose to detain the Minister much longer.  The Bill as drafted proposes that an establishment order made by him will become law after it has been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas unless within the next seven days&mdash;which is a reduction from the usual 21 days&mdash;on which the House has sat after the making of the order, it is annulled.  I am proposing in this amendment that a resolution will have to be passed by each House, approving an order made by the Minister. This is a more positive way of approving an order of this sort than the negative way contained in the Bill which means that it will become law unless somebody does something about it.  We know that orders of this type are circulated and are deemed to come before the House and nobody does anything about them.  If a resolution of the House is necessary to give them legal effect the matter will appear on the Order Paper, come before the House on the Order of Business, the Minister will have to move a resolution adopting it and in that way some positive action will be taken.  I have put down this amendment because I do not like the whole trend of the Bill and I think this will be an added protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  As it stands, subsection (2) of section 7 requires that every order made under the Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and it empowers each House to annul the order by resolution passed within seven sittings days.  This will apply not only to establishment orders but to designation orders as well under section 3, subsection (2), amending orders under section 3, subsection (8) and revoking orders under section 5.  The provisions of section 7, subsection (2) <Col N="1924" /> are similar to those of the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, and that section appears to have operated satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>It is well accepted that the Oireachtas cannot hope to exercise detailed control over all the activities in the executive area of Government and control must, therefore, be limited to certain key points.  In so far as the present Bill is concerned the Oireachtas is being asked, in effect, to approve in principle the idea of establishing corporate bodies to provide specified services for the Minister or for local authorities in appropriate cases.  The Oireachtas is not being asked to supply a blank cheque because under section 7 it will retain the power to overrule the Minister in any case in which it considers that the establishment of a corporate body is not justified.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill as it stands the Dáil and the Seanad will in the last analysis have effective control over the establishment of corporate bodies.  It would be inappropriate to provide that every order made under the Bill would require approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas and as the Deputy well knows it would clog up the Order Paper even more than at present.</P>
      <P>If every other statutory instrument of similar importance had to be approved by both Houses the result would be unthinkable.  As the Deputy well knows hundreds of statutory instruments are made every year, many of which relate to matters of considerable importance. It is only in very rare cases that motions for the annulment of them are in fact put down.  If an amendment such as this were accepted and the principle extended to all other statutory instruments of similar importance hundreds of statutory instruments would have to be debated and approved by both Houses each year.  At present, even though Deputies and Senators are empowered to do so, they do not question the vast majority of these instruments.  For that reason, I do not propose accepting the Deputy's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to say a few words about accommodation for members of the Garda Síochána.  It is true to say that it is now easier for unmarried gardaí to get permission to live out and thereby escape from the dreadful accommodation provided in barracks.  More use should be made of the National Building Agency for the purpose of providing houses for gardaí adjacent to barracks.  This would have a two-fold advantage.  It would provide decent living accommodation for married gardaí, their wives and families, and it would also facilitate the transfer of gardaí from one area to another. At the moment gardaí find it difficult to get housing accommodation.  It is becoming more and more difficult to build houses because the gap between <Col N="1926" /> the loan and the cost of the house is widening.  Indeed, up to recently, gardaí did not qualify for a county council loan because the salary was just over the limit laid down by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Local Government, in relation to housing loans by county councils.  Building societies were slow enough to lend money for the purpose of building houses in small towns.  I do not want to labour the point but there is a great deal to be said for providing through the NBA adequate accommodation for married gardaí.  Something has been done but only a small percentage of the dwellings required has been provided.</P>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to do something to bring up the standard of barracks.  So bad was the position in my town that I wrote to the Department pointing out that the building was a positive danger both to the gardaí and to the general public.  Fair dues to the Minister; when the matter was brought to his notice a bulldozer was brought in and it lifted the building completely in a very short time. The gardaí were transferred into temporary accommodation.  I thank the Minister for what he did, but a great deal remains to be done.  It is no longer necessary to have a very big building to house the gardaí.  In the case I mentioned a good dwellinghouse which came on the market was taken and the accommodation is quite satisfactory. If we had to wait for a new Garda barracks to be built it would cost practically three or four times what this quite adequate building cost.  I would suggest to the Minister and the Office of Public Works that they should purchase suitable existing buildings which come on the market instead of erecting elaborate Garda barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the old buildings are unsuitable. When the Conroy Report was published there were 200 Garda stations without flush toilets and 160 had no running water; 84 had only out-door flush toilets away from the buildings. This is not something of which we can be proud.  As State employees the gardaí are entitled to better working conditions than that.  No Garda barracks should be without a flush toilet <Col N="1927" /> and running water.  These can be provided at the cost of a few hundred pounds.  A house will not qualify for a grant, and quite rightly so, unless it is properly serviced.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word now about the Garda band.  Prior to 1938, according to the Conroy Report, there were four Garda bands with 85 members. By 1954 the number had been reduced to one.  That was disbanded in 1965 after the band had toured the United States, bringing Ireland to America, so to speak.  According to the evidence given before the Conroy Commission the Garda band did not cost the Minister very much because there was a fund contributed to on a voluntary basis by members of the force and the band were paid for engagements. The only records of the band costing the Minister anything was in the case of a grant of £450 when it was rehearsing for the American tour. When there were four bands the 85 members were available for about half-time police duties so I suppose it would be true to say that half their salary was paid for the time they spent with the bands.  The bandmaster&mdash;he was a sergeant&mdash;held the rank of honorary superintendent and he was paid a superintendent's salary, but that was not paid by the Minister; it was paid from the fund contributed to by the members of the force and the general public.</P>
    <P>One might ask what is the necessity for a band.  My own opinion is that we should have more than one band.  A band gives status to the gardaí.  It gives the force something in which to take pride.  Not alone would the gardaí take pride in their band but the general public would be proud of a Garda band parading and playing on State occasions. The trivial and paltry amount of money involved in re-establishing the band would be money well spent.  I could never understand the decision to do away with the band.</P>
    <P>Earlier I dealt with training.  In this age the members of the force should get special training in crowd control, especially members of the force stationed in cities and large towns. Crowd control is a very sophisticated job especially when these crowds are <Col N="1928" /> engaging in protests.  They may be angry for one reason or another and they may be insulting towards members of the Garda.  Therefore, it is necessary for the Garda to have special training in dealing with such situations.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I am strictly in order in referring to the next matter but I think I am.  I should like to renew the appeal I made here some couple of weeks ago on behalf of members of the Garda who are retired. We are providing money in this Supplementary Estimate to pay salaries and wages.  It is necessary that the Garda should be a contented body with no real grievances.  The older members of the force, when they are about to retire, feel that they will be on poor pensions and that they will lag and drag behind. The gardaí who retired prior to 1968 are still tied to the 1968 pensions, although the cost of living has gone up dramatically, and although the value of money has fallen drastically. The Minister should use his influence within the Government and he should fight hard for parity for Garda pensioners.</P>
    <P>Having said that I think I could also say a word for the widows of deceased gardaí.  Some of them, I know, are living in very poor circumstances and some of them are living in poverty.  I get pathetic letters time and again pointing out how difficult it is for them to make ends meet. They seem to be living on something like the same amount as a non-contributory pension.  The most annoying part of it as far as the widows are concerned is that, if they are in receipt of a non-contributory widow's pension of £1 or 25s, or thereabouts, when they get some little increase in their Garda widow's pension, bang goes the non-contributory pension.  There is provision under the old age pension code that where a married man is in receipt of a pension, when his wife dies the pension does not drop because he loses her allowance.</P>
    <P>Perhaps something like that could be brought in to provide that where a Garda widow is in receipt of a non-contributory widow's pension&mdash;and the House may take it from me that if she is in receipt of a non-contributory <Col N="1929" /> widow's pension she is not in receipt of a very generous Garda widow's pension&mdash;and her Garda widow's pension is increased she does not suffer a loss in her non-contributory widow's pension. That is not an unreasonable request. These people usually feel very sore, and very hurt, and very annoyed when because they get a few shillings extra from one Department another Department take it away from them.</P>
    <P>I commenced by complimenting the Garda force on the great service they have rendered to the State since its foundation.  Any suggestions I have made were made in good faith.  Most of them were made on the basis of evidence given, conclusions arrived at, recommendations made by the Conroy Commission, particularly in regard to the relationship existing between the Department and the force.  I am sure that the Minister, being a young man and bringing a new mind to bear on these matters, will see to it that if the findings of the Conroy Commission in this respect are correct, the cause of grievances will be removed.  The Minister should see to it that the strength of the force is increased considerably and brought up to strength to provide an adequate service.  I do not think the aptitude test can be quarrelled with and it should be applied to recruits to see that they are, temperamentally as well as physically, and from the educational point of view, completely suited to the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the debate has only a little over three hours to go, and since there are a number of very important Supplementary Estimates to be dealt with, I do not propose to detain the House very long on this Supplementary Estimate.  Even though it is a Supplementary Estimate it is for the substantial sum of £2,550,000.  I suppose it is pretty hard for people outside this House to understand that, with the exception of £400,000, this money appears to have been spent already or is in the course of being spent.  Therefore I will just comment on what the Minister will be considering in the next couple of weeks when the Budget is being prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing I should like to say that up to 12 or 18 months ago people were <Col N="1930" /> prepared to scream to high heaven on every occasion about Garda brutality and interference by the Garda in the lives of certain citizens, people who wanted to demonstrate in a certain way and who started out to demonstrate peaceably and ended up in a clash with the police.  That seems to have almost disappeared and we are all very glad that that is so.  We do not find those people doing those things and I am hoping they have grown up and realise that the Garda are there for the purpose of protecting the general public, including those who are mostly inclined to abuse them.</P>
    <P>From its inception the Garda force has been made up of very fine types of men and women.  There are occasional lapses but from time to time we would all be inclined to get a bit angry and do something we should not do if we were provoked.  In addition, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, we may have a few unsuitable people and they can bring odium on the whole force if they do or say things which are not expected from a uniformed member of the force. In the main we must all compliment the Garda on the job they are doing under what was up to recently extreme provocation.  Not only in the city but scattered throughout the country, even in small villages, there is a tendency to thuggery, a tendency for young people to do things they should not do, not for the purpose of looking for publicity, as usual, but from motives of vandalism.</P>
    <P>This should be discouraged.  I know the Minister has referred to it and said he was increasing the number of gardaí.  I do not think the increase is at all adequate for a number of reasons, one of the reasons being that while the normal increase is 200 per year, the Minister must be aware that that is only for the purpose of replacing wastage.  Sometimes it is over and sometimes it is under the correct number. An increase of 200 per year over the next two years is surely of very little use in view of the increase in crime and the fact that apparently the tendency has been to withdraw the gardaí from the country districts and the small towns and bring them into <Col N="1931" /> the cities. I grant you that the need in the cities may be much greater than in the country districts, but at the same time I do not think the proper thing to do is to leave the country areas and the small towns entirely unprotected or almost unprotected.</P>
    <P>The closing down of Garda barracks throughout the country was used as one of the devices to make more gardaí available in the more populated areas, but we all know that there are places where the Garda barracks have been reduced to having a mere skeleton staff or have been closed and the gardaí are needed in those places.  I refer particularly to the summer time of the year and to seaside towns in coastal areas where the gardaí are put in an impossible position because along with doing normal duties in towns, they must also go out and try to direct traffic and keep order in the neighbouring resorts. No matter how peaceable the areas may be, the job is beyond them and it is a bit laughable to hear talk of the 42 hour week and the giving of time off to gardaí.  I should like the Minister to say whether it is true that quite a number of gardaí have not got time off and that it would be impossible in present circumstances to give the time off due to the present force without closing down the whole lot for a number of weeks.  Is that correct and if it is why has there not been some effort to pay overtime to them instead?</P>
    <P>I see a reference to the fact that this £1,220,000 is required for payment of overtime night duty and rent allowance. The rent allowance has been paid.  How much of this night duty at overtime rate has been paid?  How much time off is due to members of the gardaí which it appears they will never get because of the fact that there are not enough of them to go round to make up for those being allowed off?  I would also echo the comment by Deputy Fitzpatrick about the guarding of banks.  This is the greatest wastage of Garda time.  Would the Minister care to comment on what he thinks an unarmed garda can do if a group of bank robbers succeed in going to a bank, going in undetected, as they can, and raiding the bank and when they come out, perhaps with machine guns he discovers <Col N="1932" /> that they are in fact bank raiders&mdash;what does he think that garda can do except get himself killed as happened one already?  Does he not agree that the proper thing to do would be for the banks themselves, which are very rich organisations, to make the necessary arrangements to have a proper type of alarm fitted which would give them the protection they require, because a proper type of alarm which could be linked up with the Garda barracks would give a lot more protection than could be given by some unfortunate garda walking up and down all day in the cold, during last winter, without any protection at all just because somebody felt it might deter bank robbers.  I do not know where they got that idea.  I do not think it will work and it would simply result in more gardaí being injured or killed if it is continued, and I feel that it should not be allowed to continue.  I feel, as I stated here on a number of occasions, that if the situation is so desperate that guards are needed on banks, the proper guards are military guards, armed guards who will meet fire with fire.  I am sure the Minister is aware that around this city particularly over the past year or 18 months, private armies, if you like, private security forces have built up&mdash; a number of very respectable organisations, employing very decent men and doing a job which normally would fall to the police force, but they are doing the job because the owners of the properties, and indeed the people running the organisations, realise that there are not enough gardaí to do the job.  I wonder what type of liaison there is between the gardaí and these. Would it not be a good idea to have the very closest liaison because if they are doing this job and doing it properly, surely they should get the co-operation which could be given to them.  Again, in passing, is this not an example of what can be done by private concerns and could the banks not take note of this?  Why do they not hire their guards?  Why should they require the gardaí paid by the State who have far too much to do apart from this, to guard the banks?  Do not let anybody say that they are guarding the people's money because when the money is <Col N="1933" /> inside in the banks, it is the property of the banks and not the money belonging to the ordinary people of the country, as some people try to say.</P>
    <P>Again, a reference was made to the Garda Band.  I regretted very much the disappearance from the scene of the Garda Band.  I would like to know if the Minister could say what happened the instruments.  His predecessor gave me a promise that they would be available and time off available to members of the band if they wanted to continue practising, in the hope that some time they would be reinstated as a Garda Band.  I am talking about the No. 1 Band.  The Minister recently said that the Conroy Commission having recommended in a certain way, it was felt that the band would be reinstated some time but that it was pretty low in the order of priorities.  The Garda Representative Body did not consider that it was one of the most important, or indeed a very important matter.  Perhaps the Minister could spare a couple of minutes to say whether or not it will ever be possible to reconstitute it, or even as a part-time band, to keep it going.</P>
    <P>The position as regard widow's pensions has been dealt with during the debate earlier this evening and yesterday, and again this evening by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  It is one of the matters which many of us had ocassion to raise here again and again&mdash;the effect which increases in Garda widows' pensions had on their ordinary social welfare entitlement.  We have so often complaints from Garda widows who got a few shillings increase in pension and subsequently find their social welfare benefit reduced by the same amount and having spent the increased amount they got over a period of weeks, suddenly find that they have to go short for a few weeks to make up the amount.  For that reason, I feel that something should be done to make a regulation that if there is an increase in the cost of living, as there always is, which warrants an increase in the amount of benefit being paid to Garda widows, it should be left with them and not taken from them under another heading.</P>

      <Col N="1934" /> The whole question of what the Garda have to do could be debated here, but I do not propose to enter into it, except to say that one of the things which, in my opinion, is preventing the Garda from dealing perhaps more effectively with vandalism is the tolerance being shown by the judiciary when they are brought before the court.  It is ridiculous that somebody who is an utter blackguard, who has been before the court on a number of occasions and who is known to the Garda as being a person who can cause endless trouble and damage, should come before a district justice, get a part on the head and be told to be a good boy.  That is what is causing a lot of trouble.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the incidence of car and motor cycle stealing in this city is a national disgrace.  It is true, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, that the national newspapers are running an agony column showing the number of cars and motor cycles that have been stolen and a few days after showing the ones recovered as a result of advertisements.  I understand that because the Garda are so busy they just cannot get around to looking for cars, even when they are sitting unattended on the side of the street for weeks.  I consider it just not good enough to see a car lying on the side of the street&mdash;and I noticed it on a number of occasions on the Dublin-Belfast road which I use every day&mdash; obviously abandoned by somebody who stole it and ran out of petrol and to watch that car disappearing&mdash;the headlamp first, then the door handle and then the windscreen, so that bit by bit the car disappears.  Surely there must be some regulations to provide that if a car is reported as having been stolen, some effort should be made to try to get it before it has been completely stolen on the public road.</P>
    <P>Again, I am not blaming the gardaí. They appear to have more than enough to do, but is this not a very good argument in favour of increasing substantially the number of gardaí because in relation to the damage done, it would more than pay to have an increased number.</P>
    <P>The entire question of car stealing is something which must be dealt with <Col N="1935" /> by the district justices or the judges which these people come before, particularly when the people who are coming in are not from the &ldquo;bottom of the ladder&rdquo; but very often are the children of reasonably well-to-do people, and these young people have been engaged in what they consider a practical joke. They consider that it is funny to steal somebody's car.  I wonder would they consider it so funny if someone stole a car belonging to one or other of their parents?  Until we reach a state where the district justices have power to make the people who are supposed to be rearing these young people pay compensation we will have a continuation of that position.  The alternative is to send the young people to jail.  There is no use in noting that 200 cars were taken in this city in a week.  When the young people come before the courts they are told not to do this again and they get a recommendation to be of good character.  Often they do not steal a very expensive car.  On a number of occasions I have heard of people who drive from the country to work on building sites in the city having had their cars stolen.  Just imagine stealing an old jalopy with broken headlamps and a broken windscreen.  This car might not be worth more than £40 or £50 but it would be beyond the ability of the owner to replace it.  Yet, these people are only told not to steal cars again.  When the Minister is replying perhaps he could say whether there is any possibility of meeting this problem.</P>
    <P>I could continue about the unease caused by certain things which have been disclosed about the administration of the Special Branch.  I hope to get another occasion to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with some of the points made by Deputies Tully and Fitzpatrick of Cavan, not necessarily in the order in which they were made. Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan complained early in his speech about interference by the Department in the running of the Garda.  Afterwards he seemed to contradict himself by complaining that the gardaí were allegedly frustrated by not knowing Government <Col N="1936" /> policy in certain matters.  That seems to be a contradiction. He tied that in with a reference to paragraph 1267 of the Conroy Report about the alleged state of the relationship between the force and the Department of Justice.  I cannot speak with any first-hand knowledge of what way things were before I became Minister but I am not aware that there is any foundation for the implication in that particular paragraph, which seems to me to be somewhat outside the terms of reference of the commission and seems to me to deal with a matter on which no direct evidence was produced to the commission.  I am not aware on what grounds that finding could have been made.  In any event I cannot agree that there is any foundation for it.  It is no harm to point out that since the references in that part of the commission's report are constantly to the Department of Justice rather than to the Minister that I should reiterate that I, in common with each of my predecessors, accept full responsibility for the Department and for the actions of the officials in the Department.  If anybody wants to criticise the action of any official I would be glad if that criticism were directed at me and if there were less reference to the Department or to officials of it.  It is no harm to remind ourselves of the statutory definition of the role of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  He is responsible for the internal administration of the force and the function of the Minister, as set out in the Ministers and Secretaries Act of 1924, is that he has a general responsibility for law and order in the country, including the police.  It is the Minister, and not the Commissioner, who is questioned in this House and is responsible to the House and to the public.  It is the Minister who is also responsible for obtaining the money to run the Garda. Once that money is obtained for stated purposes as it is on the Estimate each year, the Commissioner has nearly as much authority as the Minister in the spending of it within the limits laid down by this House in granting it to the Minister.  I mention that because Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan complained of an alleged over-supervision of the financial administration of the <Col N="1937" /> Garda.  I do not think that the facts would bear that out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to the question of overtime in the Garda and the question of payment for it which was referred to by Deputy Tully.  Like others, Deputy Tully is under something of a misapprehension. The recommendation of the Conroy Report in this respect has been implemented. It was implemented very quickly.  This has given rise to many administrative problems.  Deputy Tully referred to the fact that it was impossible to give the Garda enough time off.  It was not possible to give them the time off to which they were entitled. The Deputy said that, in fact, they were not getting time off and that they were not being paid.  The position is that there is no entitlement under the Conroy Report for payment for overtime worked.  There is an entitlement to time off in lieu within three months and if that time off in lieu cannot be given&mdash;and in many instances it was impossible to give it in the busier centres&mdash;then payment is due and every payable claim for overtime which has been submitted to my Department has, in fact, been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Has payment been made recently?  Up until a short time ago this was not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be under a misapprehension by reason of the fact that the claim cannot even be made until a period of three months has elapsed anyway.  Therefore in practice the claims are not made for about five months but that does not entail any delay on the part of the Department or of the Garda officers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because in the very nature of the thing the claim cannot be submitted for certification <Col N="1938" /> by the higher officers of the Garda Síochána until about four months have elapsed.  The cost of overtime in the financial year that will end tonight has been about £400,000 which is extremely high and a good deal more than was envisaged at the time the recommendation was put into effect last April.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick dealt with the possible future role of the garda and in broad terms I agree with him.  Certainly I agree with the recommendation at paragraph 1182 of Conroy that gardaí should be relieved of what one could describe as non-police duties.  A number of these are set out there, such as the collection of agricultural statistics, which the commission found in 1967 took up no less than 203,000 manhours.  I am making arrangements to try to relieve the gardaí of that onerous and very obvious non-police duty.  However, they have traditionally done it and it is difficult for the other Departments concerned to adjust to a very rapid change.  New arrangements have to be brought in gradually.</P>
      <P>Similarly, I am trying to make the necessary arrangements with the Department of Social Welfare about the certification of claims for unemployment assistance.  Equally I want to relieve the gardaí of duties they have under the School Attendance Act because, apart from being a non-police duty it is unsatisfactory from the point of view of the public image of the gardaí with young people that they should have to enforce this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the inspection of weights and measures as a matter for the local authorities.  The only place that I disagree with Conroy is in regard to his suggestion that the collection of excise duties for firearm certificates be taken over by somebody else.  That is very much a matter for the gardaí and it will certainly remain within their province.  There is a further very important sector of the guards' work at present which is not mentioned by Conroy as a non-police duty because it has been very much taken for granted by everybody but which we should now begin to question, and that is the question of the enforcement of road traffic legislation to which Deputy <Col N="1939" /> Fitzpatrick quite correctly referred.</P>
    <P>We have now to consider whether or not this is a police duty properly speaking and whether the Garda Síochána as a police force should indefinitely continue to enforce road traffic legislation. It is my belief that they should not and although we are only at what I might call a very preliminary stage in our thinking on this matter, the Minister for Local Government agrees with me in principle that we must aim over the coming years&mdash;or perhaps more accurately I should say decades, because it is something that will have to be done slowly&mdash;at taking away from the Garda Síochána the enforcement of road traffic legislation and the establishment in a very gradual way, and I want to emphasise that, of a separate traffic police corps.  The very faint beginnings of that can be seen in the appointment of traffic wardens and in the gradual extension of their powers.  I want again to emphasise that this is something that is not likely to happen soon and it will have to be a very gradual evolution, but if we are to make any long-term planning for the Garda Síochána we will have to begin to plan for the years ahead in those terms.</P>
    <P>The question of planning to which Deputy Fitzpatrick referred causes me to remind him that one of the recommendations in Conroy was the establishment of a planning unit and that has been set up and it has already done quite a good deal of work.  It has not yet got around to the sort of long-term planning that would be entailed by this approach that I have suggested to road traffic legislation, because there is a good deal of planning, reorganisation and research that has to be carried out in respect of the present administration by the gardaí of their existing duties.  The research and planning unit has become very actively engaged in that and has shown every sign of being successful in the redeployment of the force.</P>
    <P>To my mind one of the most important improvements that need to be made in the way the force is deployed and the way it is equipped is the provision <Col N="1940" /> of a proper radio service.  I agree that the present radio service is deficient and does not by any means cover a sufficiently wide area of the country. This means that many gardaí have to be kept in places and on duties to which otherwise they might not have to be confined.  A guard is much more useful if he has at his disposal proper equipment and the two major parts of a policeman's equipment in the modern world are a proper radio service and proper transport.  A special survey team was set up by me a few months ago to examine the whole radio question and to make recommendations on the question of the form a national radio network should take.  I am hopeful that they will make their recommendations in a matter of months.  They have been studying radio networks in the police forces in Britain and also the radio networks of other organisations in this country.  I am hopeful that as a result of their recommendations we will shortly be able to take the first positive steps towards what I regard as the most important of all improvements in equipment for the Garda, a proper national radio network.</P>
    <P>On the question of aptitude tests which were recommended by Conroy and which were pressed by Deputy Fitzpatrick, I have no great objection to them but perhaps the best opportunity that senior officers of the Garda have for assessing a recruit's potential or aptitude for service in the force is during the five months which he spends in Templemore.  That period of five months, when he is under observation by training officers, is a more certain way, than perhaps a very short test by a psychologist, of assessing his aptitude. In view of the fact that there are over 6,500 men in the force there are very, very few misfits indeed, and I think that is due to the fact that there is this five months training period during which recruits are under observation and during which those who are unsuitable can be weeded out.  Perhaps that is the best and most effective test of a person's potential or a person's aptitude.</P>
    <P>I have dealt fairly extensively in the House in reply to questions about <Col N="1941" /> the alleged protection of banks and hoped I should not have to deal with it again.  In fact, it appears I shall.  I want to make perfectly clear that the gardaí who are on duty in the vicinity of banks are not guarding banks as such.  They are on short beats which take in the banks.  They are not there at the request of the banks.  They are there because the Commissioner, in his discretion and with the advice of his senior officers, has decided it is in the national interest to have them there.</P>

      <P>They are not there to protect the banks money or the people's money but because the Commissioner knows that their presence will prevent serious crime.  I think I may fairly say their presence has prevented serious crime.  The allegation is made from time to time in this House and elsewhere that the banks should protect their own property but if other firms spent half as much or went to half as much trouble as the banks do to protect their property we would have very much less crime.  Deputy Tully suggested alarm systems to Garda stations: in fact there is an alarm system from practically every bank in the country to the nearest Garda station.</P>

All I can say is that the gardaí are making every effort to cope with this problem which is one in which individual car owners can play a very important part.  It is extraordinary that in this city with so much stealing of cars going on, people leave their cars unlocked or in such a way that they can be fairly readily stolen. What I recommend is what the gardaí have recommended for a long time, the fitting of one or other of the anti-theft devices to all cars.</P>

Tá figiúir anseo ag an Aire le h-aghaidh scéimeanna tithe.  Tá cathú orm nach bhfuil i bhfad níos mó airgid le fáil.  Tá a fhios ag an Aire go bhfuil costais tithe nua agus feabhsúchán tí imithe suas timpeall fiche faoin gcéad le timpeall ceithre bhliain anuas agus ba ceart don Aire deontais sin na dtithe nua agus feabhúsachán tí a ardú agus a chur in iúl tré fhógraí sna nuachtáin go bhfuil na deontais sin ardaithe aige.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá rud eile ag déanamh imní dom&mdash; an scrúdú a dhéantar sul a bhfaighann duine an deontas.  Is mian liom cothram na Féinne a thúirt do na daoine a dheineann an scrúdú, ach tá cásanna speisialta ann agus cuireann sé ionadh orm an dearcadh atá ag Roinn na Gaeltachta i dtaobh na gcásanna seo. Tá a fhios ag an Aire agus tá a fhios ag an Rúnaí Parlaiminte agus ag na Teachtaí go léir ón Ghaeltacht go bpósann, abair, fear óg ó Chontae na Gaillimhe cailín thall i Sasana.  Tar éis cúpla bliain, b'fhéidir, nuair atá <Col N="1945" /> roinnt airgid acu tagann siad abhaile go dtí an sean-theaghlach féin agus ansan is mian leo teach nua a thógáil. Cuireann an t-innealtóir ceisteanna ar fhear an tí.  Go deimhin, tá an Ghaeilge ar fheabhas ag fear an tí ach b'fhéidir gur rugadh an bhean i gContae Thiobrad Árann nó i mBaile Átha Cliath agus níl aon Ghaeilge aici nó ag na páistí.  I gceann, abair, trí nó ceithre bliain nó mar sin beidh an Ghaeilge ar fheabhas ag an bhean agus na páistí ó thárla cónaí bheith orthu sa Ghaeltacht agus an Ghaeilge mar ghnáth-theanga acu.  Ba cheart don scrúdathóir gan bheith chomh géir orthu agus atá sé agus cás speisialta a dhéanamh de na daoine óga úd atá tar éis teacht abhaile ó Shasana leis an bhean nach bhfuil in ann an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  Ba chóir don Aire suim a chur sna cásanna úd. Tá cúpla cás den sort céanna agam féin i gContae Chiarraí agus is dócha go bhfuil cúpla cás ag an Teachta Geoghegan i gContae na Gaillimhe. B'fhéidir go mbeadh an tAire ábalta rud éigin a dhéanamh i dtaobh na gcásanna seo.</P>

Mar adúirt mé an uair sin&mdash;agus deirim an rud céanna anocht&mdash;tá áthas orm go bhfuil a thuilleadh airgid ag Gaeltarra Éireann le caitheamh sa Ghaeltacht mar tá a fhios ag gach duine againn nach féidir le héinne aon ní a dhéanamh muna bhfuil airgead aige.  Amach anseo ní bheidh aon leithscéal ag Gaeltarra Éireann muna bhfuil feabhúsacháin ins na Gaeltachtaí, mar tá an tairgead acu anois.  Tá súil againn go léir go gcuirfear monarchana beaga nó móra ar bun agus go mbeidh obair ag na buachaillí agus na cailíní ina ndúthaigh féin.</P>
    <P>Cuire mé ceist ar an Aire an tseachtain seo caite&mdash;b'fhéidir go ndearna sé dearmhad air&mdash;acht níor thug sé aon fhreagra orm, cé gur thug sé freagraí an-mhaithe dom ar rudaí eile.  Tá trí monarchana i nGaoth Dóbhair faoi láthair agus is mór an náire é nach bhfuil ach trí lá oibre ag na cailíní agus na buachallaí ins na monarchana sin.  Bhí mé i nGaoth Dóbhair le linn an fhó-thoghacháin agus fuaireas litir <Col N="1946" /> ó roinnt daoine ansin an tseachtain seo ag fiafraigh díom: &ldquo;An bhfuil tú ábalta aon ní a dhéanamh dúinn ionnus go mbeidh cúig nó sé lá oibre againn sa tseachtain?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Tá Gaeltacht an-mhaith i nGaoth Dóbhair agus tá an Ghaeilge á leathnú ar fud Dhún na nGall.  Is maith an rud é sin.  Caithfidh an tAire rud éigin a dhéanamh do na buachaillaí agus do na cailíní atá ag obair ins na monarchana ansin.  An bhféadfadh sé geallúint éigin a thúirt dóibh go mbeadh cúig nó sé lá oibre acu go luath?  Muna bhfaghann siad an gheallúint tá baol ann go raghaidh siad go hAlba nó Sasana arís.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt do bhóithre na Gaeltachta.  Lúifidh mé cás speisialta leis an Aire anois&mdash;cás tí tar éis an bhóthair a dheisiú.  Díreach in aice leis tá cúig tithe eile agus níltear chun an bóthar sin a dheisiú in aon chur.  Ní ceart é sin.</P>

      <P>Tá cursaí speisalta nach bhfuil leagtha amach i Leabhar na Meastachán don bhliain seo ach tá tagairt dóibh ar leathanach 49 den leabhrán seo a luaigh mé faoi Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Seo iad iad: Comhdháil <Col N="1948" /> Náisiúnta na Gaeilge.  Conradh na Gaeilge, An tOireachtas, An Chomhairle Náisiúnta Drámaíochta, Gael Linn, An Comhchaidreamh agus Glór na nGael.

Luaigh sé an caiteachas ar chúrsaí tithíochta agus dúirt go raibh díomua air go raibh sé chomh beag le dhá chéad míle púnt. Trí chéad míle púnt a bhí leagtha amach ins na meastacháin don bhliain seo ach faoi mar adúirt mé de dheascaibh na stailce stroighne agus easpa stroighne ní rabhamar in ann, nó ní raibh na conraitheoirí in ann, oiread tithe a thógáil a bhíomar ag siúl leis agus, dá bhrí sin, dhá chéad míle púnt atá ann.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Mar is eol don Teachta is iad na deontaisí tithíochta seo na cinn is aoirde sa tír.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis an gearán a bhí ag an Teachta faoin deontas £10, ba mhaith liom a chur in gcuimhne dó gur coinníoll reachtúil é.  Tá sé leagtha amach sa leabhrán mar seo a leanas: &ldquo;Níl aon chúnamh faoi na hAchtanna le fáil ag áititheoir tí mura mbíonn an Ghaeilge mar theanga theaghlaigh ag a líon tí de gnáth&rdquo;.  Sin é an dlí.  Dá bhrí sin, is coinníoll reachtúil é.  Níl sé de chumhacht ag na cigirí gan an choinníoll sin a chomhlíonadh.  Dá bhrí sin, má phósann fear ón Ghaeltacht bean ó áit éigin leasmuigh den Gaeltacht nach bhfuil Gaeilge aice&mdash;agus muna bhfuil Gaeilge aice de gnáth ní bheidh an Ghaeilge mar gnáth-theanga sa tigh&mdash; ní bhfaighidis an deontas ach dá dtosnódh sí ag foghlaim Gaeilge i gceann roint bheag blianta, mar adúirt an Teachta, bheadh Gaeilge aice agus bheadh Gaeilge á labhairt sa tigh agus faoin am go mbeadh na páistí i dteideal an deontas seo a thuilleamh bheadh an Gheilge mar gnáth-theanga sa teach. Má thagann siad ar ais go dtí an Ghaeltacht nuair atá na páistí fásta beagainín agus má thugann siad faoin <Col N="1949" /> Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim agus a labhairt séard a tharlaíonn go bhfaghann siad an deontas.  Caithfidh an Ghaeilge a bheith mar ghnáththeanga sa teach chun go bhfaighaidis an deontas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Chaithfidh na páistí dul ar scoil sa Ghaeltacht agus caithfid an t-athair Gaeilge a labhairt seo ionnus go mbeidh a fhios ag na páistí cad tá ar siúl ar scoil.  Déanann an t-athair a dhícheall chun an Ghaeilge a chleachtadh leo mar níl an Ghaeilge ag na páistí sa scoil.  Ba cheart cás speisialta a dhéanamh de na daoine sin mar is é an chéad rud a lorgaíonn siad teach nua a thógháil nuair a thagann siad abhaile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Tuigim sin ach admhóidh an Teachta, is dóigh liom, i gcás mar sin go dtiocfaidh siad isteach ar an Ghaeilge i gcionn tréimhse cuíosach gearr agus beidh siad i dteideal an deontais a thuilleamh.  Ach mar adeirim is coinníoll reachtúil é.  Tá an deontas le fáil ag teaghlaigh ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar gnáth-theanga ag an líon tí agus bheidh an-leasc orm an coinníoll sin d'athrú mar bheadh sé an-bhaolach agus is eagla liom go mbeadh an-chuid camastaíle ar siúl dá n-athrófaí an coinníoll sin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Sin ceist eile.  Tá an-chuid daoine ann adeir go bhfuil siad i dteideal sin d'fháil ach ní deireann an cigire é.  Maidir le ceist na monarcha úd i nGaoth Dóbhair, tuigim go bhfuil ceann amháin acu ag obair trí <Col N="1950" /> lá sa tseachtain ach go bhfuil dhá uain nó &ldquo;shift&rdquo; ar siúl sna trí lae sin.  Dá bhrí sin, tá gach duine á choinneáil ag obair.  Is trua liom gur mar sin atá an scéal.  Is dócha gurb eol don Teachta an saghas oibre atá ar siúl acu. Déanann siad snáithe de shaghas éigin. Dár bhrí sin, an deacracht atá ag cur isteach ar an tionscal téicstíleach ní amháin anseo ach thar lear tá sé ag goilliúint ar an monarcha seo.  Sin é an fáth go bhfuiltear ag obair trí lá in ionad seachtain iomlán.  Is eagal liom nach dtig liom a rá faoi láthair cé chomh luath a bheidh siad arais ag obair go lán-aimsire ach tig leis an Teachta a bheith cinnte go mbeidh an monarcha sin ar ais ar obair lán seachtaine chomh luath agus a thagann feabhas ar chúrsaí trádála.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis na bóithre, go ginearálta má tá an áit in a Ghaeltacht, má tá Gaeilge ann, ní dhiúltófar deontas do na bóithre.  B'fhéidir go mba mhaith leis an Teachta sonraí faoin gcás atá i gceist aige a chur chugam agus déanfaidh mé é a fhiosrú.  Ní dhiúltóimis den saghas sin más cás Ghaeltachta é.</P>
      <P>Mar a dúirt an Leas-Cheann Comhairle, níl sé in eagar labhairt faoi chúrsaí radio nó údaráis aitiúil ach ó thárla gur luadh iad b'fhéidir go ligfeadh an Leas-Cheann Comhairle dom an méid seo a rá&mdash;go mbeidh airgead don radio i meastacháin na bliana seo chugainn.  Maidir le cúrsaí údaráis áitiúila, tá an cheist sin h-iniúchadh ag roinnt mhaith daoine i láthair na huaire.  Tháinig scéala chugam ó Chomhairle na Gaeilge ina taobh agus tá an cheist á scrúdú.  Ach níl aon cheist ann i láthair na huaire airgead a chur ar fáil dó.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a comment on this?  Over the past few weeks numerous questions were addressed to the Minister.  He answered some of them but eventually found that there was a way of getting rid of them by passing them along to the Ceann Comhairle and saying they were his responsibility and not the responsibility of the Minister.  Very briefly, I should like to find out from the Minister what exactly is happening here.</P>
      <P>He will recall that I raised the question of what we call the &ldquo;long debate&rdquo; here last spring when, in fact, members of the staff of this House&mdash;as they have to do tonight&mdash;were required to remain on duty and many of them not alone were not paid for the extra time they worked, because they were not in the overtime grade or something like that, but were not given time off in lieu.  It is very easy for Members of the House&mdash;particularly those who do not believe in spending much time in the House&mdash;to say we will sit late. They seem to forget that the staff have to work late also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Originally, the established number of reporters for this House was 12. That was to cover the Dáil alone; there was no Seanad.  It may be news to the Minister but it might put things in their proper perspective if I tell him that there are now 13 reporters to cover the two Houses.  The official side claim that they cannot get reporters, but I would suggest that if the salary and conditions of service were attractive it would be quite easy to get reporters. <Col N="1952" /> Over the years reporters have left because of bad conditions, long hours, no provision for meals, <i>et cetera.</i>  One of the big complaints is that when they work long hours nobody seems to worry about when they will eat, or whether they eat at all.  Certainly they get no compensation for meals.</P>
    <P>At one time the salaries of reporters were in excess of those of newspapermen and now they are below them.  Of course, newspapermen were always considered ideal for the job.  They will not take a job now which would pay them less than they are getting at their own job.  So there is no sense in saying that reporters cannot be got because the facts are you will not pay them.  If you would pay them you would get them.  I understand that there was a time when there were slack periods and the Official Reporters revised the Official Reports and did a certain amount of indexing work.  Now there are no slack periods with the result that that work has fallen into arrears. I do not know if the Minister is aware that there is no filing done and that, in fact, everything in relation to the reporting of the proceedings of this House, and the general paperwork of this House, has fallen into arrears. There is nobody to do it.  Other Parliaments have had similar trouble and some of them employed outsiders to do the work.</P>
    <P>Something has got to be done.  It is all right for senior officials to smile at the idea of this happening and think: &ldquo;It is grand.  We are not affected.&rdquo;  I know they do their jobs and they work long hours too, but the position here with regard to the Reporting Staff is becoming ludicrous and it is about time somebody did something about it.  That is why I am delaying the House tonight.</P>
    <P>During the &ldquo;long debate&rdquo; reporters worked 36½ hours consecutively.  I know what I would say if one of my union members was asked to work for 36½ hours, even if he was paid overtime for it.  Here there was no overtime and no time off, no meals, no extra pay. What does the House expect?  What does the Minister expect?  The position was that the staff took the rough with the smooth.  There were tough times <Col N="1953" /> and there were slack times.  Apparently there is no smooth now.  All they are getting is the rough end of the stick. Something must be done about it.</P>
    <P>Over the past couple of months there were three sittings to be covered.  The Dáil proceedings were reported by six reporters, and on one occasion by five. The Seanad was covered by three reporters and the Committee of Public Accounts by two or three, plus the English reinforcements.  These were the people who were brought in from England at £29 per day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Plus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Plus £5 per day expenses, plus the cost of travelling backwards and forwards to London.  The regular staff do not get anything like that.  I do not want to be told by anybody that the English people did the job better than the Irishmen and women because they did not.  Even in this situation there are anomalies because the girls doing the job are paid much less than the men.  I think one widow, with five children, is paid at the same rate as a single girl.  A married man would get an allowance in the same circumstances.  This is the sort of stupid old-fashioned approach that is being adopted.  The sick leave has increased and when somebody is sick the staff can hardly carry on.  Recently five reporters were out sick and the remainder had to work very short-handed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New machinery has been put into operation in the Seanad and I understand that it is proposed to introduce machinery into the Dáil.  Has this reduced the number of staff required? Of course, it has not.  The position is even worse now than it was before. Reporters have to sit in the Seanad for an hour and a half at a spell, and they are expected to anticipate interruptions. We know how we interrupt here and we can guess how they interrupt in the Seanad.  For somebody doing a ten minute &ldquo;take&rdquo; it is relatively easy to spot an interruption coming and to take it down, but it is too much to expect them to concentrate for an hour and a half in the Seanad.  The Assistant Editor is engaged almost full-time on the new machinery and on training audio-typists.  The other Assistant <Col N="1954" /> Editor has retired so the Editor has to carry on on his own.  I do not know how much more ridiculous this can be. Of course, the position of Assistant Editor is vacant and a number of senior reporters were offered the job but just would not take it.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is good enough for the people who are responsible for running this House.  I put this straight back on the Minister for Finance who may say that the Ceann Comhairle has the responsibility of doing this, that and the other, but the Minister is the man who must provide the money for the job and there is no one of us who would agree to work under the conditions these people who are doing the reporting of this House and the other House are asked to work under.</P>
    <P>Almost the same situation arises with regard to the other staff.  There is no point in telling me that they have an organisation which represents them and negotiates for them because they have not a trade union in the general meaning of a trade union.  They have an association which is associated with some outside body, but they do not do the negotiating in the same way as my members&mdash;I am general secretary of a trade union&mdash;would expect me to do the negotiating for them.  While I do not expect the Minister to work miracles, and, perhaps, it is unfair to spring this on him tonight, I honestly believe that at the back of his mind he knew, because of the fact that this was raised again and again and shelved eventually on to the Ceann Comhairle, that it was going to be raised.  It is not good enough to have members of the staff of this House treated worse than they would be treated in other jobs and it is not good enough to have such a situation in relation to ushers, messengers and paper keepers.  A paper keeper who was 18 months in the job applied to be made permanent and because it was said he had not got a knowledge of Irish he was refused promotion to the staff job even though he was doing the job for 18 months and doing it effectively.  This is the sort of nonsense people do not like to have to put up with.</P>
    <P>All the staff here are doing their job well but we are not giving them <Col N="1955" /> the consideration they are entitled to. If we decide, as we decided tonight, to sit until 12 o'clock, or as often happened before, to sit until half-past one or two o'clock, it may be all right for people who come here only occasionally but it is not all right for people who are hard at work and it is not all right for the staff who must start in the morning at the normal time.  We all start at half-past ten but how does that affect Dáil Deputies?  Look around you.  They are all resting somewhere at this late hour of the night but they are doing their work, which is something the general public cannot understand when they come in here and find the benches empty.  We know that they are doing useful work somewhere else, but at least they can relax at this late hour but a member of the staff cannot.</P>
    <P>With regard to the pay, the conditions under which they work, their meals and particularly with regard to the overtime and the conditions under which they work, something has to be done.  I cannot expect the Minister to take out a wand and wave it around the House and say &ldquo;OK that settles it; everything is all right&rdquo;.  But I appeal to him, before the Dáil reassembles after the Easter recess, to try to work out some reasonable system.  He is a reasonable man and must understand the situation.  For God's sake, let him do something about the long night's work here for which certain people were not paid, and let us not have this matter raised here again and being told that they are going to get time off some time, when pigs begin to fly, as they say down the country.  Most certainly there is no opportunity of getting time off now because they have been overworked.  Why is it not possible to pay them the few pounds extra which was due to them and have done with it for good?</P>

      <P>I agree with what Deputy Tully said in regard to our staffs, particularly the Reporting Staff. We never appreciated them.  We always took them for granted until we had to import others.  I will not comment on what we imported but they were no better and I will not say how dear they were.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I think I should contribute a few words to this discussion because, due to the lack of reporting staff, the committee find themselves in difficult and embarrassing situations at times and, unfortunately, from time to time they have to suffer the embarrassment and odium thrown at them by Members of the House.  They find themselves in a position not of their own making and we certainly feel it unfair that much of the criticism arising in relation to the reporting situation should be directed at us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of this question occurs to me.  If a committee system or some such system is eventually established to carry out some of the business of the Dáil, I feel that we must have extra reporters and extra clerical <Col N="1957" /> staff.  As has been said, this cannot be done overnight.  It must be done gradually&mdash;the Reporting Staff trained and got working&mdash;otherwise, much as has happened at the Committee of Public Accounts, when the demand is made that would impose extra duty on the committee, the staff will not be available to do committee work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to say that I have not attempted, as has been suggested by Deputy Tully, to shuffle off my responsibility on to the Ceann Comhairle.  What I have done is to state the factual position, which is that the responsibility for the organisation of the work of the staff is that of the Ceann Comhairle and is not a matter in which I can or should interfere. My responsibility is to provide the necessary finance and to sanction the expenditure involved.  For example, the Deputy referred to the new method of reporting in the Seanad.  This is a matter over which I have absolutely no control nor do I wish to have any control. I say that not because I am trying to cast any responsibility on to anybody else but to make clear what the position is.  I have explained to the House in reply to questions and supplementary questions what the sanctioned staff strength is.  There are some vacancies. This is true.  However, I think it will be generally recognised that the whole resources of the Houses of the Oireachtas are under considerable pressure at the moment in circumstances which cannot be expected to recur or to recur as a normal form of activity in the House, unless, as Deputy Gibbons has said, we decide to adopt a committee system.  If we decide to do that, I agree it is a different situation but it is only reasonable to expect that in the circumstances in which we have been operating, where we have the Dáil, the Seanad and the Committee of Public Accounts meeting, the resources would be strained.  Incidentally, Deputy Gibbons, as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, apparently feels that some of the criticism that has been levelled in regard to reporters being brought in from abroad has been levelled at members of the committee?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that this was done at the request of the committee, which is an all-Party committee, to facilitate its operations but it is no longer happening and the committee, by arranging its sittings at certain times, has ensured that we can manage&mdash;with difficulty but we can manage&mdash;within the resources available to us.  Reporters from abroad are no longer engaged. The rates of pay of reporters are those determined by the Civil Service Arbitration Board.  Deputy Tully will appreciate what that implies and what it may imply in regard to any changes. I know that above a certain level overtime is not paid in the normal course. If overtime were to be paid in respect of certain particular times to some people in that category and not to others this could present problems. Having said that, I am not closing the door on the situation.  The normal procedure is that there is time off in lieu. Deputy Tully is right in saying that that has not happened in regard to the long sitting because of what has occurred since then and because of the extra strain on the resources.  In those circumstances it may be possible to find another remedy but the matter is still being examined.  I cannot give the final word on it at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>May I make one comment? Deputy Dr. Gibbons has made a remark here about the fact that the Public Accounts Committee were being blamed for the position.  One of my colleagues who is on that committee had the same idea.  Most certainly it was not my intention or the intention of anybody to blame the Public Accounts Committee for anything that has happened.  They are not responsible for the shortage of staff and they have to do their job.  There is no question whatever of casting any blame on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to thank the Minister for his suggestion of a solution to this problem. The Minister for Justice said here earlier that after three months when it <Col N="1959" /> was not found possible to give the guards time off, on the recommendation of the Conroy Commission they are entitled to overtime.  I would suggest that the same thing should apply to the staff of this House.</P>
