      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil do now adjourn.</P>
      <P>Traditionally the adjournment debate deals primarily with the economic position of the country in the year past and with the prospects for the year to come, even though the debate itself widens out into many other topics. This morning I propose to confine myself to matters economic and in conclusion to deal with any other matters, political and otherwise, that may be raised during the course of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The year 1971 has shown some important improvements on our economic performance over 1970, but it has also shown that some of the economic difficulties with which we have been recently faced have not been satisfactorily overcome.  It is expected <Col N="2272" /> that for 1971 the growth in output will be in the region of 3 per cent.  This represents a welcome improvement on the 1970 figure of 1½ per cent, but it is still below the annual average of 4 per cent recorded during the 1960s, and it is also below the level, I am confident, which we may expect during the 1970s.</P>
    <P>The 1971 figure of 3 per cent is completely in accordance with the forecast which we made for the year. I want to assure the House that the Government are not by any means happy with such a figure, but it does mean that our estimates were a realistic assessment of the restricted possibilities open to us in what everybody realises were difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>One of these restrictions was our balance of payments position.  From a situation of balance in 1967 a deficit, which reached £69 million in 1969, emerged.  Such a rate of increasing deficit could not be sustained for any reasonable period, and it became important that the trend towards greater deficits should be halted and, indeed, reversed.  In the circumstances of our economy there are two ways in which a balance of payments improvement can be achieved.  One is by cutting back the level of economic activity, since any depression in overall demand and expenditure reduces the demand for imports.  The 1970 experience provides some illustration of this.  Last year we saw a fall in the growth rate and a general slowing down in business activity because of the cement and bank disputes; we also saw some reduction in the balance of payments deficit of £62 million.  This is clearly not the happiest way in which to cope with balance of payments problems.</P>
    <P>The alternative and preferable course of action is to boost exports. Higher export earnings not only enable increased imports to be paid for, but they also increase incomes and employment for those engaged in producing these exports.  Increased exports are the key to raising living standards and curing unemployment and it has been the continuing policy of the Government to stimulate exports in all sections of the economy.  This was the basis on <Col N="2273" /> which faster economic growth was achieved in the past decade and it must continue to be the basis for future expansion.</P>
    <P>The current year shows welcome signs of a return to this pattern.  For the months January to October imports rose by about 13 per cent over the same period of 1970.  Part of this increase was due to the importation of two Jumbo jet aircraft valued at £20 million, and if these are excluded the import rise is something below 10 per cent.  Exports, on the other hand, rose by 14 per cent, which is a very creditable performance in the circumstances of the year.  Agricultural exports were particularly buoyant due to more favourable market conditions for major products such as beef and butter in the United Kingdom market.  Industrial exports, in contrast, had to contend not only with the consequence of inflation which has been forcing prices upwards, but also, and more importantly, with difficult market conditions abroad.</P>
    <P>The clearest example has been the US market where, in addition to a sluggish level of economic activity, a 10 per cent import surcharge was imposed in August.  Our more important market, the UK, has likewise experienced stagnation, or, to use the more &ldquo;in&rdquo; word nowadays, &ldquo;stagflation&rdquo;, during much of the past year although there are now signs that this situation is improving.  A particularly welcome feature of this year's trading performance was the improved situation in recent months.  For the first five months of the year imports increased more rapidly than exports so that the import excess rose by some £33 million.  In the five month period, June to October, the trend was reversed and the import excess fell by more than £13 million. To arrive at the overall balance of payments picture, it is necessary to take into account other items in addition to imports and exports of goods. The most important of these items, of course, in terms of revenue is tourism.</P>
    <P>Here the 1971 picture has been characterised by an overall lack of buoyancy.  This overall pattern is the product of a fall in the number of Northern visitors, a virtually unchanged <Col N="2274" /> level of visitors from Britain and small but useful increases from the US and European markets.  Allowing for tourism and other invisible receipts, it is estimated that the balance of payments deficit this year will be of the order of £75 million.  If the exceptional item for aircraft purchases is excluded in order to obtain a clearer comparison of the underlying trends, the deficit should not be noticeably different from that recorded last year.</P>
    <P>This balance of payments position may be regarded as reasonably satisfactory because, in addition to the improved trading performance in recent months, there has been a substantial inflow of capital this year.  The result is that the external reserves have been rising and at the end of November had reached a total of more than £400 million.  This is an increase of more than £70 million since the beginning of the year.  While our aim must be to continue improving our balance of payments position, this strong reserve position should provide the necessary flexibility of action in the coming months.</P>
    <P>A less satisfactory area of performance has been that of prices.  The latest figure available, that for mid-August, shows a rise of 8½ per cent by comparison with August, 1970.  This is an unacceptably high figure and shows that we still have a long way to go before inflation is brought to an end. It is some encouragement to us that recent rates of price rise, as shown in the August and May figures, are lower than those recorded in the preceding quarters.  This is a welcome contrast from 1970 when the rate of inflation continued to increase.</P>
    <P>It was essential that the upward trend in the level of prices be halted and as the House will recall this became the primary objective of economic policy in the autumn of last year.  The House will remember the Prices and Income Bill which was introduced, and following this Bill there came the National Pay Agreement.  This agreement was reached by the employers and unions last December.  Therefore, the prospects of achieving gradual improvement in the field of prices were greatly enhanced.  Given the terms of that <Col N="2275" /> Agreement and the large carry-over into 1971 of pay rises which had been negotiated in 1970, it was equally clear that no immediate or pronounced improvement in reducing the rate of inflation could be expected.  The Government were prepared to agree to the risks involved in accepting this gradual approach for two reasons.  One reason was the general wish of the Government to see voluntary agreements in the sphere of industrial relations in preference to imposed conditions and the second reason was the presence of strong inflationary pressures in other countries which partially offset the adverse effects which our own inflation would have on our capacity to trade internationally.</P>
    <P>Events to date confirm that the Government were correct in adopting this course of action.  The National Pay Agreement has been successful not only in ensuring more orderly and more tolerable levels of income increases but, equally importantly, in providing a much greater degree of industrial peace this year.  I would like to take this opportunity of expressing the Government's appreciation of the hard work and dedication which has been put into the formulation and operation of this Agreement.</P>
    <P>This year also saw the expected high rates of inflation in other countries, notably in Britain, which is particularly important to us from a trading viewpoint. If this external inflation has shielded us from some of the adverse effects of our own domestic price rises it could not and did not totally insulate us.  Rising costs and prices have weakened the ability of many firms to compete successfully with their foreign counterparts on both home and export markets.  This has been reflected in the poor performance in the highly important area of employment.</P>
    <P>This year has seen a sharp rise in the level of redundancies as compared with 1970.  I am not for a moment suggesting that these redundancies were caused by inflation only.  There was an accelerating pace of technological change.  This has been characteristic of modern industry. In firms which are expanding at a sufficiently rapid pace, such changes <Col N="2276" /> can frequently be accomplished without any redundancy problems.  Such firms indeed have been a major source of additional employment.  But in many other firms which have more limited market opportunities, new technology frequently means fewer workers.  For firms such as these, inflationary wage increases hasten the day when higher cost labour is replaced by higher performance equipment.  Other redundancies may arise because of the failures and shortcomings of management. Business failures have always been and will always be a fact of life.  Here, too, the presence of inflation by creating additional problems which managements cannot successfully cope with again accelerates the pace of redundancy. The increased level of redundancy created by inflation is particularly unwelcome at the present time when the economy must adapt to freer trading conditions.  Raising productivity and efficiency to the level necessary for success in a free trade context leads to redundancy in many firms.  It is important to recognise that this movement to freer trade is something which, whether we like it or not, we will have to contend with.  Whether we are inside or outside the EEC, it is something which we cannot control since international trading arrangements are largely determined by the major economies.  We must be prepared to cope with redundancy or other problems resulting from freer trade which we know and must realise necessarily will come.</P>
    <P>What can we do?  We can, I think, do one thing at least and that is to try to control the problems which are of our own making.  One of these problems is, of course, inflation.  The main counterbalance to the loss of jobs through redundancy is the creation of new employment through Industrial Development Authority projects and 1971 has been another successful year in this respect.  In the 12 months ending in September projects with an initial employment of 3,500 commenced production, while further projects with an initial employment of more than 4,000 jobs were under construction at that date.  The net result of this influx of new firms is that total industrial employment should show a slight rise this year.  In the first half of 1971, the <Col N="2277" /> latest period for which details are available, employment in the transportable goods industry was 1,700 higher than in the first part of 1970.  The figures for unemployment which show a rise of approximately 8,000 on those for December last year would suggest a poorer performance.  However, it would appear that part of the rise in unemployment reflects a drop in emigration. For the 12 months ending in October the net outward passenger movement by sea and air was only 2,000 approximately. This compares with 6,000 for the 12 months ending October, 1970, 14,000 for the 12 months ending October, 1969, and 21,000 in the same period in 1968.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the Deputy will with a mass of figures.  It is probable that the reduction in emigration and the consequent rise in the number registered as unemployed reflects, as the Deputy has said, a lack of employment opportunities abroad. I would say that the dramatic decline in emigration is partly due to that.  It is relevant to note that unemployment in the United Kingdom has risen at a much faster rate than it has here and now, as everybody is aware, it stands at a post-war all-time high.  It is against this background that the Government announced the supplementary financial measures in October last, measures aimed at boosting the level of employment here.  An extra £20 million was allocated for capital spending in the current financial year. Hire purchase and other restrictions on credit sales were removed and a reduction in the level of company taxation was announced.  Since then we have introduced increased milk <Col N="2279" /> prices, which will help to raise investment in this important sector of agriculture, and the increased spending available as a result of that will increase economic activity outside the farm.  All these measures should serve to stimulate employment in the coming months.</P>
      <P>As of now the position is one of the economy approaching the New Year in a stronger position than that which obtained 12 months ago.  We are now facing the prospect of improving our performance in 1972.  Converting these measures into solid achievement is, of course, governed by many factors, some within our own control and some not.  One of the external factors is the future trading relationships between the major countries. Since the announcement of the 10 per cent import surcharge and other measures by the US Government in August a protracted series of discussions have been taking place aimed at evolving a new pattern of exchange rates for the major currencies and also at creating the basis on which the United States import surcharge might be removed.  Following initial deadlocks the prospects of agreement now seem brighter.  The talks which took place earlier this week between President Nixon and M. Pompidou appear to have produced a greater degree of understanding of the American and French positions and we may reasonably expect, therefore, that the period of instability and uncertainty, which has characterised the international trading scene in recent months, is now nearing its close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although we are not directly involved in these international monetary and trade discussions, we are, nevertheless, affected by them.  The removal on the US surcharge should, for example benefit some exporters.  This would be of particular importance to Shannon. However, following President Nixon's announcement on Tuesday last, it is now certain that any new agreement on exchange rates will involve some devaluation of the dollar <i>vis-á-vis</i> the £. Such a change will have the effect of making Irish exports dearer in the American markets so that, even with <Col N="2280" /> the removal of the surcharge, Irish goods will be less competitive in US markets than they were in, say, last August.  While recognising that the measures taken to correct the US balance of payments problems may continue to create short term difficulties, we also recognise that it is in the long-term interests of other nations, including Ireland, that the US should regain a strong and healthy economic position.</P>
    <P>The second economy which produces much more immediate and important effects on our own economy is that of the United Kingdom.  Here the prospects for 1972 look considerably brighter.  The year 1971 has seen in the United Kingdom a minimal rate of growth and an increased level of unemployment. I have already referred to the latter.  Following on the inflationary corrective measures taken over recent months, the official forecast is of a growth rate in the United Kingdom of about 4 per cent in 1972.  This would be the highest level in recent years and it would suggest that prospects for Irish exports may be both improved and enhanced next year.  Increased prosperity in the United Kingdom would also imply greater scope for increased tourism.  However these prospects must be tempered by the feeling, unfortunately, that events in the North have been casting their shadow on economic activity between the two countries.</P>
    <P>The third area, which will assume much greater importance in future years, is that of the EEC.  The successful progress of negotiations for membership, culminating in the satisfactory arrangements reached last week for fishing, have strengthened the Government's view that membership is highly desirable and have increased their confidence that the people will endorse this course of action in the forthcoming referendum. We should intensify our preparation for EEC membership in 1972.  In the case of agriculture the recent changes in the level and structure of milk prices should enable dairy farmers to expand in the coming years.  Small farmers will benefit from the increased level of development grants and other changes and improvements in aid to agriculture <Col N="2281" /> aimed at enabling farmers to derive maximum benefit from membership of the EEC can be expected to continue during the coming year.</P>
    <P>Among the more general developments it is expected that decisions on regional development measures can be made early in the new year.  Deputies will recall that following the publication of the Buchanan Report regional development organisations were asked to prepare and submit their proposals. The results of this and other necessary work are now becoming available and the Government should shortly be in a position to consider these reports and the suggestions that are being made.</P>
    <P>Apart from specific measures aimed at individual industries or sectors it is also necessary to push ahead with the general strengthening of the economy in preparation for EEC membership. One crucial requirement is that the rate of inflation be substantially reduced in 1972.  All the signs are that it would be increasingly dangerous to continue with the level of price rise similar to that experienced this year. In all the countries which are important to us for trading purposes there are clear indications that 1972 should bring a significant fall in their inflation rates.  The prices and incomes measures in the United States are aimed at reducing inflation to 2½ per cent by the end of 1972; in France the target is 3½ per cent and in West Germany the deflationary steps which have been taken should lead to similar results. In the case of the United Kingdom the position is less clear but given the recent trends it is reasonable to assume that there will be a substantial lowering in the rate of inflation in the United Kingdom next year.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford to remain aloof from these trends.  To continue with significantly higher rates of price rise would jeopardise our competitiveness and threaten, as we all know, to create substantial unemployment.  This is not the direction of events we would wish to see.  Far from raising unemployment we strongly desire to reduce it as rapidly as possible and curbing inflation is one important element in any movement towards increasing employment. <Col N="2282" /> It will not be easy to achieve these two objectives of raising employment and lowering inflation.  It will call for dedicated efforts and occasionally painful decisions from all sections of the community.  One area of critical importance in determining the success or failure of such efforts is that of pay increases.  The National Pay Agreement will begin to terminate during 1972 and what follows in its place will have a profound effect on the prospects of success in this field.  I hope it will be possible to build on the foundations laid by the present Agreement and arrive at some new arrangement which will provide for orderly development in the incomes sphere and continuing industrial peace, during these critical transitional years.</P>
    <P>I would go further and express the hope that in formulating such an agreement it would be possible to place the major emphasis on raising employment and ending inflation as a matter of urgency even if this means some short-term postponements at the rate at which real incomes increased.  I realise this is asking a great deal but I do not believe it is asking too much.  Those of us who are privileged to have regular incomes and employment surely owe it to our less fortunate brethren to provide them at least with the opportunities to enjoy what we ourselves enjoy.  Moreover such a short-term sacrifice on our part would quickly bring its own reward because increasing employment and curbing inflation would result in a greatly strengthened economy.  A more soundly based economy is one of the best guarantees of adequate employment opportunities and faster increases in living standards for the future.</P>
    <P>I know that on both sides, management and labour, there are leaders with generosity and vision who can bring this about.  I hope they will find it possible to inspire their members at this important juncture in the development of our economy to put aside the more immediate and local needs and act in a manner which will safeguard not only their own future but will illustrate their concern for the well-being of their fellow countrymen.  The Government for its part will respond <Col N="2283" /> in an equally generous manner.  I want to say that as seriously as I can and with what I know it implies, that is an effort on the part of the Government to respond to moderation in wage increases so that when Budget time comes around we will be able to indicate how, by keeping taxation at a minimum and doing the very best we can for social welfare sectors, we can reciprocate in a reasonable manner moderation in pay increases.</P>
    <P>During the current year further development has taken place in various social areas.  Education saw further increases in the number of post-primary and university students which are now at record levels.  In the health field additional facilities and new treatment centres have become available which have resulted in improved services to many people.  House building continued at a high level while in the case of social welfare benefits additional schemes were introduced in addition to increases in the general level of benefits.</P>
    <P>The Government are anxious to see more improvements take place in these and other areas of social concern but it is important to remind ourselves that advances in these areas, as always is the case, are determined by our capacity to pay for them.  This is a further and important reason why we should try to make 1972 a year of rapid economic advance.  Even if we ourselves did not attach great importance to further economic success we should be conscious of the many who through social services depend on us to provide a standard of living which befits human dignity.  It has always been Fianna Fáil Government policy to improve the well-being of all our people. Our record of Government shows that this social commitment has been positive and substantial.</P>
    <P>The coming year will present many problems and dangers to our economy. It should provide also opportunities for more rapid economic progress which is the necessary basis for further social advance.  The Government are confident that we will enjoy the support of all sections of the community in ensuring that these opportunities are brought to fruition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2284" /> During the course of the debate other Ministers will deal with their own particular sectors and their own particular Departments.  As I have indicated already I have no doubt that this debate, even though it traditionally opens on an economic note, will widen on to many other areas.  If it is possible for me to deal with these questions as they arise during the course of the debate, when I am winding up, I shall do so but in so far as they can Members of the Government will make their contributions and deal with specific points as they arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <P>The Taoiseach at the beginning of his speech said he proposed to confine himself to economic matters and that other questions, such as the problem of the North of Ireland, might be referred to in closing.  I think that this particular Adjournment Debate and end-of-season as well as end-of-year debate is taking place at the end of what in many ways was a most remarkable year.  It was remarkable in a number of respects which not merely the House but the country could have done without.  Some of the figures which the Taoiseach quoted indicated certain changes but they were carefully selected to confuse and conceal the real facts of the present situation. In so far as the economy is concerned the most remarkable aspects of last year have been the substantial and continued rise in the cost-of-living and the substantial increase in unemployment and redundancies.  The figures which were quoted and are occasionally referred to to compare unemployment in one group of years with other years fail to take into account the fact that the alteration in the employment period orders conceals the true facts and that this year has witnessed a very substantial increase in the numbers unemployed as well as the numbers redundant, which is a new, euphemistic description for people out of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of prices, the consumer price index has shown a phenomenal rise over the past three years.  It has gone up by over 26 per cent.  It went up by 7½ per cent in 1969; 8 per cent in 1970 and when the figure for the mid-November quarter is published shortly it will very likely show an increase of <Col N="2285" /> between 8½ and 9 per cent for this year. Some of these price increases were caused by factors outside the internal control here but a number of them are directly attributable to Government action.  In 1969 and 1970 the doubling of the turnover tax was a considerable factor at a time when all the indications and arguments produced by different bodies, including the Central Bank and Chambers of Commerce and other organisations, repeated the view that the important thing was to aim at price stability.</P>
    <P>But if we look at direct Government action and the effect which Government policy, specifically within the control of Government Ministers, had on the cost of living we see an even more dramatic rise in prices.  Post office charges increased by over 50 per cent between August, 1970 and August, 1971; the ESB increased electricity charges by 15 per cent; the Minister for Finance raised motor taxation by 26 per cent; CIE increased bus fares by 25 per cent and train fares by 17 per cent.  The Sugar Company increased the price of granulated sugar by 12½ per cent and Bord na Móna the price of turf briquettes by the same figure.  At the same time as all these increases directly affecting the cost of living in every household, affecting the day-to-day or week-to-week living expenses and outgoings of houses and families were occurring, the increase in local authority charges directly attributable to health services meant that rates went up by 20 per cent and hospital charges by 14 per cent, at the same time as the Minister for Health imposed a blanket charge of £7 per annum in respect of people, some of whom were already contributing either in social welfare or voluntary health insurance contributions.</P>
    <P>These increases were directly attributable to ministerial action and ministerial decision, Government action and Government decision, in addition to other increases such as the price of bread and flour, the price of meat, the price of a whole range of commodities which increased by very substantial amounts.  This situation occurred at a time when unemployment increased and redundancies went <Col N="2286" /> up.  When the Taoiseach talks about the changes which the Government made in company taxation, our rate of company tax is still higher than in Britain, the country with which our industrialists have to compete most regularly and to which the largest share of our exports still goes.  The remarkable fact about the increase in prices in the past three years is that it was substantially higher than it was in the EEC countries in the same period. There is a difference of about 10 per cent in the rise here of over 26 per cent compared with the rise in EEC countries in the same period of about 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>While that situation was developing, and deteriorating in respect of the cost of commodities and particularly in respect of the weaker sections of the community, pensioners and others on fixed incomes, the overall situation, in the phraseology used to describe the deterioration in the tourist situation, the carefully prepared phrases to minimise or in some other way take the emphasis off the situation, is greatly aggravated by the position regarding a number of other factors that go to the very root of confidence.  In this country there has been over a number of years a rise in lawlessness, in the crime rate and in the number of incidents of one kind or another that must weaken confidence and reflect very seriously on the prospect of attracting greater investment and getting new industries established here.  Just two years ago I pointed out, first of all in a speech outside the House and subsequently on an Estimate for the Garda Síochána, that the position was so grave.  On 4th March, 1970, at column 2107, Vol. 244, of the Official Report I stated:</P>
    <P>It is a matter for concern&mdash;which has been expressed in this House&mdash; that, apart from raids that have taken place recently, the number of crimes involving physical violence, attacks with knives and so on, is such that in parts of this city people are genuinely afraid.  Old people and people living alone and those who, for one reason or another, are obliged to go out at night and to <Col N="2287" /> travel at night are apprehensive because of some cases that have occurred.</P>
    <P>I spoke on this matter also in January, 1970.</P>
    <P>What do figures in the report of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána on crime for the year 30th September, 1970 &mdash;which is the latest data available&mdash; indicate?  The report shows that the number of crimes, damage to property, burglaries, housebreaking, robbery and malicious injury increased from 4,200 in 1964 to 7,500 in 1969 The number of indictable offences which became known to the gardaí was 30,700 in 1970, as compared with 25,900 in 1969, and 23,000 in 1968 &mdash; an increase of 4,700 on the 1969 total and of 7,600 on the 1968 total.  This shows an appalling increase in crime.  For the year ended September, 1970, the number of offences detected was 15,000, or 50 per cent of the offences recorded; in 1969 the percentage was 61, the same as in 1968.</P>
    <P>This is no criticism of the detection work of the gardaí.  It is due to the fact that the numbers available to carry out the work&mdash;particularly in view of the increase in crimes&mdash;are inadequate to deal with the problem.  Another factor is the Government's attitude with regard to the challenge to authority.  We have been so absorbed in, and concerned about, the problem of the North of Ireland that we may have failed to recognise and appreciate the magnitude of the task that confronts the security forces of the State and the importance of ensuring that the institutions of the State are maintained intact.</P>
    <P>While the situation has deteriorated, the Government and members of Fianna Fáil have been at odds among themselves.  This has been a remarkable year and a further step was taken yesterday when three members of the Fianna Fáil Party applied to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for a separate room for themselves, where they will be away from, and out of direct contact with, other members of Fianna Fáil.  They want to ensure that they will not be contaminated by contact with members <Col N="2288" /> of the organisation with which they are still in external association.  This is the first time such a situation has arisen since the establishment of this State. It can be fairly said that the present Government are depending for survival on a few votes and, in effect, they are as much a coalition Government as we have had in this country.</P>
    <P>That is the situation in which the Government have carried on for the last two years.  There is a lack of confidence in the Government, there is a lack of conviction that the Government are taking the necessary measures, not only to strengthen the economy but to ensure that the institutions of State that were handed over to them in good order, of which we are all trustees, are maintained intact. Nobody, not even some members of Fianna Fáil, has confidence in the present Government or in the Ministers.</P>
    <P>We have consistently expressed the view that the Army, the Garda Síochána and the other institutions of the State should be strengthened numerically and should be given the necessary equipment.  The time has come to re-examine the position of the security forces, of the Army and the Garda, especially in view of the appalling figures shown in the report of the Commissioner.  In fact, in recent years the trend has been an increase in crimes of violence, bank raids, of injury to property and of destruction on every front.</P>
    <P>In order to divert attention from this, the Minister for Justice fastens on his bewigged friends in the Four Courts in order to have a go at them.  It is the traditional role of lawyers during the years that when one has a bad case the best tactic is to attack one's opponent's counsel.  The present situation is far too serious for such statements to be issued at the public expense.  Maybe the Minister's personal views are shared by some of his colleagues but there is no recognition of the gravity of the situation.  The Army strength is minimal to deal with security problems and the manner in which the FCA have been associated with the whole mechanism of national defence has been exposed as a fake in so far <Col N="2289" /> as making an effective contribution to the defence of the nation is concerned. When I say this it is not any reflection on members of the FCA.  The money being spent on it is wasted largely. Nobody could be trained even to the recruit stage on two, three, four, five six or even a dozen hours a week. What members of the FCA are getting that training?  What members of the FCA have regular training on any sort of a practical military basis?  The Army should be expanded and places should be offered to members of the FCA who are willing to accept them, and they should be trained effectively and properly.  In addition it is time to alter the regulations to enable married men to be recruited directly into the Army.  The ancient regulation in this respect should be amended to enable married recruits to be trained.</P>
    <P>I have said before, and I want to repeat now, that the strength of the Garda should be increased quickly.  In fact, the Army and the Garda strength should be increased rapidly.  How can anyone have confidence in a country in which the annual crime figures produced by the Garda Commissioners show a substantial and continuous rise?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach talks about the EEC and the fact that a referendum will take place next year.  I believe it is recognised throughout the country that this is a very serious national question. It has been the subject of many debates here and recently it was the subject of discussion on the Bill to amend the Constitution.  This referendum cannot be passed without our support.  It has not an &ldquo;earthly&rdquo; of being accepted by the people without our support.  In the course of the debate on the amendment of the Constitution the Taoiseach said he was prepared to consider sympathetically amendments which we will be proposing on Committee Stage.  As reported at Column 1726, Volume 257 of the Official Report, in criticism of a comment I made he said:</P>
    <P>It would be difficult to make a selection for this purpose.  The Constitution is the fundamental law of this country and there would be no obvious criterion by reference to which any Articles could be classified <Col N="2290" /> as being more fundamental than others.</P>
    <P>I do not know what legal genius behind the Fianna Fáil Government gave him that reason.  Article 4 says that the name of the State is Éire, or in the English language, Ireland.  Even the most obscurantist Fianna Fáil Deputy has abandoned the description of the State as Éire.  Article 45 says:</P>
    <P>The principles of social policy set forth in this Article are intended for the general guidance of the Oireachtas. The application of those principles in the making of laws shall be the care of the Oireachtas exclusively, and shall not be cognisable by any Court under any of the provisions of this Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court has expressed the view that these are incapable of being defined and incapable of being implemented. If we compare that with the Articles dealing with private property, Articles 40 to 44, and the Articles dealing with making war and the raising and maintaining of a single armed force under the jurisdiction of Dáil Éireann, and the Government elected by Dáil Éireann, we see that there is a fundamental distinction.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been thrown out recently that some approach has been made to Opposition Parties to establish a committee on the Constitution. When Government Ministers are short of something to say, and when they want to indicate their benevolence towards the idea of changing the Constitution to make it possible for people to live under it, irrespective of their religious or political background, they say they are quite willing to change some articles of the Constitution. I want to make this clear.  When the late Mr. Seán Lemass was Taoiseach he invited Labour Party and Fine Gael Party Deputies to join in an all-party committee on the Constitution. We appointed four people to it and the Labour Party appointed two, I think, and there were a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies on it.</P>
    <P>That Committee sat and made a number of recommendations.  It examined the Constitution most closely. We gave the benefit of the legal and <Col N="2291" /> constitutional and practical knowledge which Members of this House and the Seanad had.  What was the end result? The Committee reported and made a number of unanimous recommendations. It was decided at the initial meeting that, if agreement was not reached on certain points, the report would say so.  The only proposal the Government went ahead with was the proposal to amend the system of voting.  This had not been recommended by the Committee.  When the question of amending the Constitution was raised here on a number of occasions the Taoiseach said it was a matter for the parties concerned to take the initiative.  How can Opposition Parties, without a majority in the Dáil, make any amendment to the Constitution unless the Government are prepared to do so?</P>
    <P>Now, faced with the difficulties that confront him, the Taoiseach is full of talk about establishing a committee. Because of our vast experience we look at this with the greatest suspicion and we will not accept the suggestion that he has thrown out airily that if a committee of this sort were to be established its recommendations would be binding on its members.  In other words, its recommendations would bind the parties.  That will not wash. Nobody trusts Fianna Fáil after the previous experience.  Not merely is it not enough for us not to trust them, but their own Deputies do not trust them and some of them want a separate room.  They want a separate room because they cannot trust their own colleagues.  Is not that a fantastic situation?  The Taoiseach comes in here and quotes a few statistics about price changes, about unemployment level, about passenger movements.  As Deputy FitzGerald rightly said, in Britain one in four of the British work force is now unemployed.  One million people are unemployed.  The Taoiseach was trying to camouflage the real issues.</P>
    <P>The real issues, the real threat to this country is the fact that we have a Government in office who have no confidence in themselves and who have not got the united backing of Deputies who were elected in June, 1969, to support <Col N="2292" /> them.  It is true that they are united on one thing.  They are united so far in their belief that whatever dangers they face among themselves the greatest danger possible would be for them to face the electorate.</P>

      <P>In this Adjournment Debate it is customary to wish Deputies on all sides the compliments of the season but whatever benevolence the Taoiseach can expect from our good wishes, it will be paradise compared with the wishes expressed silently from some of his colleagues.  What they are saying about each other, and to each other, has reached such a crescendo that they now have to have separate rooms so that no report can escape.  In fact I am not sure that some of their rooms are not bugged and their telephones tapped.  That is the situation.  Is it any wonder, then, that there is a lack of confidence in the Government and in the economy?</P>
      <P>We are prepared to facilitate the passage of the Bill providing for the referendum but the people must be told clearly what are the full facts in relation to the EEC.  With great respect to those who have prepared the documents that we have seen so far, the facts have not got across to the people. The arguments being put forward are vague and express high principle.  All the talk of a concept of a united Europe, to which we all subscribe, will not get a vote unless the people know what membership will mean for the farmers, for the industrialists, for the workers and for the recipients of social welfare benefits.  There must be an explicit undertaking on the part of the Government to devote the money saved in respect of agricultural subsidies to increasing benefits to social welfare recipients and to spending it on health and other services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the figures I have quoted it will be seen that so far as increases in the cost of living are concerned, those who are hit hardest, and hit continuously, are the old, the sick, those on fixed incomes and those with large families.  The amount to be saved will be substantial but it should be possible to know precisely what the saving will <Col N="2293" /> be.  It is not sufficient merely to have vague phrases in a White Paper or in a series of documents prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  We must know what the saving will mean in real terms to social welfare classes and others who have been obliged to pay more for the necessities of life. The increases in the prices of the various commodities can be attributed to the mismanagement of the Government during the past two or three years and can be attributed directly to Government ministerial action in respect of a number of Departments and a number of decisions.</P>
    <P>A number of people have the mistaken view that if we do not join the Community, things can remain as they are.  Leaving aside the concept of a united Europe and the idea of strengthening the defence of Europe and all other worthy aspirations, the fact is that if Britain goes in, because of the volume of our trade with her, we must go in too.  Otherwise, we would have insurmountable problems in the future. This fact has not been put forward clearly to the people.  Even in respect of the agreement that has been reached on fisheries, I think the Minister may have been precipitous.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government should, in this regard, recall Talleyrand's advice that an ambassador should not show too much zeal. We all remember the amazing zeal displayed by the Minister at the RDS in March last when he was dealing with a former colleague.  In agreeing to the proposals in respect of fisheries, he may have shown too much zeal, too, because too much zeal can blunt the realities of the situation.  The agreement has not been signed so far and cannot be signed now until January but even if it is not signed then, it will not mean the end of the world for us.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with what, in many respects, is the gravest situation affecting the country.  I refer to the problem of the North of Ireland, a problem that has been discussed here so often in recent months and years that our sense of shock may have become blunted.  The situation has changed to a considerable extent.  On a number of occasions here I referred <Col N="2294" /> to articles that were in common spate in British papers in recent times.  I referred, in particular, to some articles that appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> as far back as May of this year.  It is hardly necessary to quote them again. Recent events and, in particular, the statement made yesterday by the British Home Secretary, indicate a considerable change, a change that has been brought about by some figures that I shall quote.  In the <i>New Society</i> of the 25th November, 1971 Coral Bell gave a comparison of military figures in Northern Ireland for the period 1969-1971.  According to these figures, the number of troops there during 1969 was 2,500.  In 1970 the number was 6,000 and in 1971, 14,100. The number of bombing incidents for the same years were, respectively, seven, 155 and 790 and the numbers injured by explosions were 53 in 1970 and 593 in 1971.</P>
    <P>The number detained in the earlier two years was nil, in 1971, 471.  The numbers who died by bombing or shooting were 13, 20 and 126 respectively.  This article, having compared these figures, refers to what happened in a number of other places in which Britain had a responsibility and referred, as a number of other articles did, to what happened not merely in places where Britain had a responsibility but in places like Algeria and Vietnam.  It re-emphasises what I have said on a number of occasions, and one would hope we could get across to the Unionists, or to the opinion in the North which has resisted change for so long, that the traditional British policy is to placate their enemies and abandon their friends.  Some people do not like hearing that but it is a fact.</P>
    <P>In a poll on 1st November the <i>Daily Telegraph,</i> which is a traditional establishment, Tory or Unionist newspaper, said that the proportion of the British electorate favouring withdrawal had risen to 39 per cent and the proportion who thought that the decision to send troops was wrong had risen from 13 per cent to 32 per cent. I mention this now because I want to repeat what we have said many times. This can only be settled by a political <Col N="2295" /> solution.  We have advocated and want to restate that political talks must be held between all interests concerned. This has been advocated from this side of the House for a considerable time. Over two years ago we advocated that there should be in this House an all-party committee.  That proposal was rejected not once but many times. Recently there has been a change of attitude by the Taoiseach.  It is a welcome change but it is regrettable that the change has come about because the initiative suggesting all-party talks came from the Leader of the British Opposition and the present Prime Minister in Britain.  We should be prepared to take the initiative ourselves and not be moved in this by British politicians.</P>
    <P>We said that in 1969 in the first statement we made when this crisis arose.  We repeated it in debates in this House.  We repeated it as recently as this session in which Parliamentary Questions were addressed to the Taoiseach and the response was, and I do not think I am doing him any injustice, that he would consult with Deputy Corish as leader of the Labour Party and myself as leader of Fine Gael.  We had one meeting when the thing started in 1969 and in the intervening period we have only had one single meeting.</P>

It has now gone so far that they cannot even be in physical proximity to their colleagues. If they cannot stand it how could we be expected to stand it?

    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that Fianna Fáil are full of co-operation when they are in difficulties.  They are full of co-operation now in respect of the referendum, full of benevolence and anxious to get the best amendment possible in order to put it to the people.  One of the reasons is that their <Col N="2298" /> own legal advice is not the best.  That is no reflection on the individuals. They have done their best.  But what happened?  The last place we heard of Singer was in the Costa Brava or in Madeira with a glass of brandy in each hand drinking the health of Fianna Fáil legal luminaries.  This is the situation.  The guilty escape and the innocent are in danger of being convicted.  Of course there is a great deal of talk and sometimes articles in the <i>Irish Press</i> about the guarantees that the Supreme Court provides for the citizen, a lot of phraseology about having some sort of committee established consisting of perhaps some Judges of the Supreme Court, the Attorney General and a few other people to draft an amendment that has a chance of getting through.  You need not worry about that.  If you accept what we tell you, and if you do what we suggest, we will get an amendment through that will be legally and constitutionally sound and that subsequently, through our support, will be carried in the country, carried in spite of anything that the Deputies who are now in external association with Fianna Fáil might do.  It does not matter whether they support it or not.</P>
    <P>This is a quite remarkable thing. Three Deputies are outside the party. Two others are in external association. It does not matter what they think.  We are prepared to put this through, again &mdash; and I repeat what I said earlier &mdash;because we place the national interest before party consideration. When Fianna Fáil are prepared to do that they will enjoy much greater confidence in the country.  So far as we are concerned &mdash; I repeat what I said earlier &mdash; nobody can have any confidence in a Government that refuse, first of all, to accept what we put forward in the national interest, dealing with this Northern problem.  The reason that was rejected was they wanted to get some little political party kudos out of it.  That was the reason it was rejected and there was no question of phoning back; the initiative was to be taken by the Taoiseach and he did not take it.  He says I did not ask him.  We have said it here in debate <Col N="2299" /> after debate.  I have volumes here.  In every debate that this has been discussed I advocated it and all my colleagues who spoke advocated it.  We advocated it in statements issued, in parliamentary questions addressed to the Taoiseach, and only once he said he would take the initiative.  He took it once and he never came back and now we are asked to accept.  How can anyone have confidence?  How can anyone have faith?  How can you approach with any sense of conviction when you are dealing with a Government that do not honour the undertaking they gave and that have now reached a stage in which so many of their own members want to dissociate themselves from them?</P>
    <P>We are prepared to co-operate in the national interest on this.  We are prepared to co-operate in the national interest on the EEC, but we want to be told the truth.  We do not want some cards being kept up a sleeve or put on the table face downwards.  We are prepared to discuss the basis of the essential changes.  The first thing we want is honesty in dealing with the Government.</P>
    <P>The latest suggestion is that the Constitution would be amended on the basis of an all-party committee reporting and being bound by the recommendations. We reject that suggestion following on the experience we had of the Constitution Committee in which when recommendations were unanimously agreed they were rejected. What was the suggestion?  &mdash; that the parties themselves should take the initiative. We reject any attempt to use us as an umbrella to get Fianna Fáil out of difficulty.  The Constitution&mdash; again I quote Article 28 of the 1922 Constitution &mdash; was scrupulously fair to all and offensive to none.  You are trying to get back to that now.  Who was responsible for this change?&mdash; previous Fianna Fáil leadership.  Why did they do it?&mdash;again for base party or personal motives in the atmosphere at the time &mdash; party political motives. The Articles that are now offensive did not come from Mars.  They did not come from some other planet.  They did not come from anywhere except the warped mentality of Fianna Fáil <Col N="2300" /> at the time and every Fianna Fáil ass in the country was on its hind legs braying in favour of it.  Now it is an embarrassment and you want us to get you out of the difficulty and you want to try to cement us in to get the amendment through.</P>
    <P>We will have no truck with this kind of dishonesty.  If you want to get back to the Article of the 1922 Constitution, we are prepared to put it through. We are prepared, in the national interest, to do that.  It should never have been abandoned.</P>
    <P>I recently read a comment, when I made some remarks about the proposal of Mr. Wilson that we should rejoin the Commonwealth, that it was unacceptable and one commentator in one paper said this tenuous link showed superb judgment on the part of Fianna Fáil at the time.  What sort of superb judgment was responsible for the offensive Article that is now being rejected, that has done more than any other political decision to alienate and to antagonise sections of the people?  It was this party that defended and asserted and vindicated the right of every section to fair treatment and to equality before the law.  It is on that principle, on that basis, that we wish not only the people in the North but the people in this part of the country a happy Christmas and, so far as the Government are concerned, a peaceful New Year, more peaceful than any of their colleagues can wish them.</P>

      <P>Over the past few years we have become accustomed to Adjournment Debates being commenced by the Taoiseach attempting in a low key speech to prevent those speakers who will follow him from attacking any of the policies which he is supposed to represent.  We had a repetition of that this morning.  The Taoiseach announced that as he had dealt only with some of the economic matters his Ministers would be coming in and they would deal with the points affecting their own Ministers. If this is not a new one, I am not very long in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to the Taoiseach that what he did was, he got some of his people to get him a few handy statistics which any dog in the street would be able to get if he went to the trouble, and trotted them out in this House as the gospel of Fianna Fáil.  If he thinks for one moment that the collective responsibility of the Government will be vindicated by a statement like that he has got another think coming.  I may not be very long in the House but I can assure the Taoiseach that if that is his line he will not be very long Taoiseach of the country.</P>
      <P>I particularly disliked the approach of the Taoiseach today because we have had a succession of contrary statements made by Ministers so that from one minute to the next it is impossible to know what exactly is the policy of Fianna Fáil on a fundamental issue. When they are brought before the bar of this House and questioned, the usual reason given is that, of course, they are expressing Government opinion and that, in any case, there is no problem. The Minister present here nearly owns the expression &ldquo;no problem&rdquo;.  It does not matter if the sky is falling, it is no problem to Deputy Brian Lenihan, Minister for Transport and Power, and it is no problem for the Government because they could not care less what he says or what any other Minister says.</P>
      <P>There was a blatant attempt by the Taoiseach this morning to shrug off the situation in the Six North Eastern Counties as if it did not matter.  Would he like to tell me what particular Minister will get the job of representing the Government point of view on that issue?  Is it the gentleman who is now sitting beside him, who has his hands already more than full in Brussels?  Is he going to get the job or will it be the Minister for Justice, who has been making statements about his own personal position at the expense of the State for the past couple of weeks? Perhaps it is the Minister for Defence. That would be a great choice.  He would be the man to do it because we expect that what he would say would be what he would consider to be honest.  Perhaps I had better leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2302" /> The position as far as the Six North Eastern Counties are concerned <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Republic is that very few of us in the House or outside of it can state what is the Government's policy.  I hope that the Taoiseach will spell out what is Government policy on the North.</P>
    <P>It is all right to say we want a peaceful solution.  Do we not all want a peaceful solution?  Are all of us not against sin?  But how does the Taoiseach propose to bring that about and for how long will he continue to take the present attitude towards statements made about what is happening on the Border?  I was reminded by somebody after the Taoiseach had come back from his talks with the British Prime Minister and Mr. Faulkner that when he told what had happened at that meeting somebody said it reminded him of a ball game&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the way I heard it. If the Taoiseach wants to deny it, well and good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not bother to deny it until it was said in this House. Now I deny it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach reads what is in the newspapers.  It made us all look a bit ridiculous and I am glad he has denied it.  To continue the story, two children from one street were playing ball and a child from another street came in and he tried to play and the ball was kicked over his head.  Mr. Faulkner must have said what he did because he had listened to the Taoiseach's statement and from what he said it seemed obvious that it was not the same discussion the Taoiseach and Mr. Faulkner had attended.  This is the horrible thing about the present Government.  One cannot get from them a definite statement that can be taken as fact.  I am not saying they are telling lies but they have got into a habit of telling half-truths and believing them and it is only afterwards that the sordid truth comes out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is about time this situation was changed.  I suggest that during the remainder <Col N="2303" /> of his time as Taoiseach he must put his own house in order.  I also suggest that he should stop looking over his shoulder at Deputies Blaney and Haughey because I believe an awful lot of what is happening is being ruled by the impression that &ldquo;You cannot go too strong on that because the boys would not like it&rdquo;. If the boys do not like it I suggest they should &ldquo;lump&rdquo; it.  People are beginning to get sick and tired of the way this is being dealt with as far as the North is concerned.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party &mdash; Deputy Cosgrave spoke today on this matter &mdash;believe there should be a peaceful solution.  Eventually everybody must sit down and settle the Northern situation. We do not believe in murder, no matter who commits it, no matter who lays a bomb or who shoots an unarmed civilian, or whether it is carried out by men in army uniforms, whether they are trained army personnel or whether they are B Specials cooked up under a different recipe. It is murder and we think it is wrong they should be allowed to do it without comment from this part of the country.  We also think it is wrong that an old man in this part of the country should have his door broken down and be killed by people who obviously did not think they were killing him, because they bandaged his legs after committing the incident which subsequently killed him.  We blame the State because the State is responsible for law and order on this side of the Border and that is its job.</P>
    <P>As far as the far side of the Border is concerned&mdash;I said this last night&mdash; if the British Army feel that more protection is needed, that there are armed people moving across the Border from this side, there are enough of them there, 22,000 of them, to guard that side of the Border.  If they want to do it they would be far better employed doing it than doing what they have been doing, carrying out early morning raids, damaging life and property, attacking children in the streets &mdash; doing the things which they were not sent to Northern Ireland in the first place by Mr. Wilson to do.  When they went there first they <Col N="2304" /> did so to keep the peace, as a group who would ensure that the peace would be kept.</P>
    <P>When I hear people say that the British Army were sent there I must emphasise that they have been there for 50 years and that they had been there for many years before.  Additional troops have been sent there and the British Army there has been built up from 4,000 or 5,000 a few years ago to a total of 22,000 now.  Whether they are, as many of them must be, decent young men from decent families, they are working under orders in the North which quite obviously shows they are prepared to attack men and women and to shoot them down in cold blood, as has been happening in the North.</P>
    <P>Since I entered public life I have always defended the right of soldiers because they are under a peculiar sort of discipline.  They have to do what they are told and it is quite obvious that what is happening in the North has to be done by those soldiers because that is what the soldiers are told to do.</P>
    <P>This brings us back to the situation in which the Taoiseach must take the initiative in an effort to get discussions started.  There is no point in talking about a ceasefire.  Why talk to people who have not been able to make contact in any way with those they are supposed to be fighting?  How can a cease-fire be arranged?  Why can the Taoiseach not get involved as quickly as possible in the situation which is building up now where the people of Britain, the ordinary people, are getting sick and tired of what is happening in the North, sick and tired of subsidising a group who have had control for so long that they think they are God?  It is about time they found out the truth.</P>
    <P>Another point which I am afraid has been overlooked is that in the North at present there is a group of people who are firmly convinced that Britain is about to abandon them.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to this earlier.  It is quite true.  I heard a television report the other night.  A number of those people were speaking among themselves <Col N="2305" /> and they made it quite obvious that they would not be surprised at all if Britain decided she had enough.  Why has this situation built up?  For a number of reasons, the main one being that the ordinary man and woman in Britain have turned completely against what is happening in Northern Ireland because their troops are being killed and injured &mdash; not because of the justice of the case, unfortunately, but because their troops are being killed and injured.</P>
    <P>Here we have a paradoxical situation where because of the activities of people being condemned in this House something is building up which appears to be leading towards a united Ireland. In this situation we cannot just sit back and say: &ldquo;Those fellows should all be locked up, shot up, what have you,&rdquo; and at the same time when those fellows do something which seems to be hitting out at the Northern Parliament and the Unionists, say: &ldquo;That is a blow for us.&rdquo;  We are on one side or the other.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Taoiseach, the Government and the people must clear their minds quickly on this aspect.  In regard to internment, the Government here have done practically nothing to try to bring to the notice of the world at large exactly what is happening, if they cannot get it across to the people in Britain.  World opinion should have been built up about the terrible atrocities that have occurred.  How can anybody in a civilised State, or a so-called civilised State, be a party to, first of all, the arrest in the middle of the night of the fathers of families, the breaking down of doors and the destruction of furniture, internment without trial at any time of up to 1,000 innocent people who have had no connection with any political action and in many cases interrogation in depth which is a nice name for torture?  What have the Government done about it?  In Paris last June I had the experience of attempting, with Deputy Harte, to have a discussion with the British representatives who were present at that conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union on what was happening in Northern Ireland.  At first other members of that delegation, including a <Col N="2306" /> Fianna Fáil member, agreed to take part in the discussion but subsequently they backed down.  Did they back down because they had contacted the Government in Dublin, or were they advised not to take part?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I got an impression that they were advised not to take part, but these people obviously now had not the courage of their convictions.  They were afraid to look over their shoulders in case Big Brother would see them. On two occasions some of the group met the British representatives and discussed the situation with them, but the Fianna Fáil members did not take part. I do not know what they gained by that.  Incidents like this have prevented the real facts about Northern Ireland being published throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the FCA.  I do not agree entirely with what he said.  So far as the FCA are concerned, there are in that organisation a substantial number of dedicated men without whom it would be impossible to defend the country properly.  These are people who are not available to take up full-time soldiering but who are prepared to spend most of their spare time defending the State.  They deserve the thanks of the State and of the people.  Like every other organisation they have a number of people who are not very useful.  Does the Taoiseach know how safe our Army barracks and camps are at the present time?  How well protected are they? Can the Taoiseach say that he is quite sure that they cannot be overrun by a small group of subversive elements who might be inclined to do so for reasons of their own?  This happened in Drogheda.  This is a serious matter which occupies the minds of many people who are engaged in the defence of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been talk of a big recruiting campaign next February.  The Minister for Defence mentioned it last night.  We have had such campaigns over the last couple of years but most of them have not effected much improvement because the numbers leaving the Army have offset the numbers <Col N="2307" /> joining it.  Something must be done to build up an Army.  It cannot be done by vague talk of a big campaign.  If we are serious about the defence of our country we must be sure that we have the men and materials necessary for this job.  The Government have not done their best.  The Minister spoke about the £3 million which he was going to spend on extra equipment.  It was shown that this £3 million had been spent earlier in the year on some equipment which was not exactly the top-class equipment which the Minister gave us to believe it was.  That is the sort of activity which makes people disillusioned about any attempt to run a regular Army here.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest respect for the Gardaí and for what they are attempting to do.  They are being badly let down by the Government.  The crime figures are growing for a number of reasons.  The personnel required to cover all areas have not been recruited. Men who are promised a 40-hour week with extra days off find that it would take about three years to catch up with their days off if they all decided to take these days at the one time.  The Minister for Justice has told us that he hopes to recruit an extra 400 men and to have 200 of them in uniform this year.  The Minister has not told us how many men have left the Garda force in the last 12 months. There are many people in the country who are simply bandits and who are taking advantage of the overworked gardaí and making themselves rich at the expense of the ordinary people.  I have very little sympathy with banks which are being robbed because they have not supplied their own protection. If the banks want to be protected they should pay for such protection.  They should not expect an unfortunate guard to walk up and down in the cold outside their premises while the bank is open.  What could such a guard do if someone came along with a gun?  He could be killed.  Commercial organisations should realise that it is their job to protect their own property.  The Gardaí should be engaged in protecting life and public property, and in the prevention of ordinary crime.  The present Government seem to think that it <Col N="2308" /> is sufficient to place a guard outside a bank.  The unfortunate guard will be lucky if he escapes getting a bullet in his back.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach gave us figures which could be extracted from statistics in half an hour by anyone and then he told us that his Ministers would explain anything else that was asked. Collective responsibility does not seem to be working well today.  The Taoiseach must make up his mind about whether he is running the country himself or whether he is not.  It was bad enough to have Deputies who did not vote when they knew the Government was safe, but it is worse still to have a situation where even the Ministers do not seem to be anxious to participate in supplying the Taoiseach with the facts and figures which he should have this morning.  Those of us who are speaking now are at a decided disadvantage.  We do not know what the Ministers will say.  Some of the figures which the Taoiseach gave must be scrutinised carefully.  The particulars which the Taoiseach gave us do not seem to tally with what we have got. I am sure that our officials are able to get the documentation just as well as the Taoiseach's officials are.</P>
    <P>It is said that statistics can lie.  It appears that the figure of 2,000 people which the Taoiseach gave for emigration this year is incorrect.  The Taoiseach must be joking.  Almost 2,000 people have left some counties.  If the Taoiseach wants to know why I say that, I will point out to him that the Minister for Finance on a television show recently gave a figure of 5,000 people who emigrated.  The Minister also gave some figures for the last inter-censal period.  The figures do not seem to be correct.  If the Taoiseach got the figures from the Minister for Finance I am not surprised that they are wrong.  The increase in the population in Leinster was 80,129; in Munster, 20,684; the decrease in Connacht, 12,187 and in the three counties of Ulster, 1,398.  Yet the Minister for Finance stated on a television programme that every county had an increase in population in the inter-censal period.</P>
    <P>A recent preliminary report on the inter-censal period, 1966-71 showed a <Col N="2309" /> net emigration of 60,924 people, an average of 12,000 annually.  I asked the Taoiseach when he was speaking did somebody forget to put in the &ldquo;1&rdquo;.  The figure he should have given was 12,000 instead of 2,000.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also said he expected the growth rate to be 3 per cent in 1971.  It was 4 per cent in 1969 and 1½ per cent in 1970.  Over the three years, 1969-71, the average annual growth rate was 2.8 per cent approximately. This is in contrast to the 4 per cent which was envisaged in the <i>Third Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> The Second Programme was abandoned half way through and it looks as if this one is gone, too.</P>
    <P>Industrial development is down very badly this year and this reflects the trading conditions and the uncertainty in the private sector.  Employment and unemployment figures should not give any difficulty because we have the actual figures just as the Taoiseach has. One of the things I cannot understand is that, while the number of people who have lost their jobs far exceeds those who have found jobs, the Taoiseach trotted out the chestnut that for 1971 there were projects started up to September which would give 3,500 extra jobs and that there were under construction projects which would give another 4,000.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I had a discussion during Question Time with the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Colley, on this question of the jobs created by new industry.  The Minister made no distinction between jobs actually crated and what he called a projection which would show the number of jobs which would exist in an industry after a number of years in full production.  I would suggest that what the Taoiseach has given us here today is the number of potential jobs if these industries get into full spate; it may be 3,500; if someone is looking for a grant he makes the numbers as big as possible.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said the number of people unemployed was over 60,000. He could have said &ldquo;over 70,000&rdquo;. because last year there was a new type of benefit introduced in social <Col N="2310" /> welfare which allowed people at 65 years of age, under certain conditions, who are signing on at the unemployment exchange to switch to retirement pension until they are 70 years of age. There were people who were normally on the unemployment register and by taking them off it the number on the unemployment register, according to the Minister for Labour, was reduced by 4,000.  Therefore, if on the 12th November, 1971, the number of people shown on the unemployment register was 62,851, and we add 4,000 to that plus an increase of 4,000 to 5,000 which has occurred in the last two weeks, we find there are now at least 70,000 on the unemployment register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>And that group are liable for income tax now.  They were not before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  As Deputy Kavanagh has pointed out, there has been a lovely refinement added by the State in respect of these unfortunate people.  While until a few years ago old age pensioners were not liable for tax, if some of these people who had contributory old age pensions for which they paid with their stamps all their lives had any other income which brought them over the tax free allowance they became liable to income tax on their pension.  Subsequently widows who took a job or who had any other income found they were paying income tax on their widows' pension.  The Minister explained the other day that the State was very generous, that it did not apply this to non-contributory pensions.  Who does he think he was codding?  The non-contributory pensions are so small that they could not qualify, and the means test would ensure that they would not get a non-contributory pension at all if they had any income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion was made last year&mdash; and I thought it was a good one and I recommended it here and outside the House &mdash; that when people reach 65 years of age they could draw the retirement pension in the local post office. As Deputy Kavanagh pointed out, the State intervened.  If they were drawing <Col N="2311" /> unemployment benefit they would be costing the State extra money in signing a couple of times a week and having officials dealing with their claims and so on.  The State saved all this when they were drawing by way of pension book, but the State decided to apply the same conditions as for the contributory old age pension, and these poor people found themselves paying income tax on what was, in effect, unemployment benefit under another name.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, the Minister for Social Welfare, that bright little man who likes to help everybody, decided that contributory old age pensioners who were not holders of a medical card must pay the extra 15p per week or £7 per year if their income was under £1,600 &mdash; goodness knows the income of many of them is under a quarter of that &mdash; in order to ensure that they would be entitled to hospital treatment.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach talked here this morning about the National Wage Agreement and the efforts to combat inflation, that it was necessary to hold down costings and wages.  He believed they were not being held down enough but that people were making an effort to help the situation.  Most certainly the State are making an effort to help by deducting income tax from pensions and wages.  The unfortunate person who is working and stamping an insurance card has a deduction of 15p or 3s per week in his wages.  He also has to pay 9p, which is almost another 2s, for the purpose of helping his fellow worker who is unemployed, making a total deduction of 24p.  On top of all that the income tax authorities are deducting tax on the first £100 at the full rate of 7s in the £ whereas last year it was only 4s 8d because the bright sparks who put into the Budget statement of the Minister for Finance that the single man or woman earning under £600 a year would get an extra £125 tax free and that the married man earning under £1,000 would get an extra £250 tax free did not add that the rate would be increased from 5s 3d to 7s in the £. The result of this is that the trade union officials are finding it extremely difficult to persuade their workers that <Col N="2312" /> they should stay on the wages which were negotiated for them last year. We know who is responsible for forcing the issue and making it impossible to hold the line.  I believe the State have deliberately increased the cost of living.  Possibly they have not been able to stop what they call inflation by taking money out of the workers' pockets in any other way.  We cannot blame them for not trying because, of course, they introduced the decimal currency earlier this year and we all know what happened prices then.  They are now talking of introducing the value-added tax which, of course, will have the same effect.</P>
    <P>All those things are being done while the man who is depending on a small week's wages is told that he must not rock the boat, that he must not cause inflation.  He is told that if he gets an increase he will cause inflation.  I have never been able to understand why the person who has big investments and who is able to get a very high income from his investments or the senior civil servant who can get a 10 per cent increase in between national wage agreements is not accused of causing inflation, but Johnny Smith who works in the bog or on the road will rock the boat or cause inflation if he gets some small increase.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the increase in the price of milk and suggested that the small farmers of the country will get on very well with this increased price.  My information is that the net loss to the 10,000 gallon farmer is a ½p per gallon.  He receives 1p per gallon but gives back ½p which makes it a 50 per cent reduction.  The 100,000 gallon supplier can have an additional income of £2,600 per year but the man at the bottom of the scale will find himself with 50 per cent less on the milk price alone than he had last year.  We are told that this is to help the farmers of this country to prepare for the Common Market.</P>
    <P>The overall rise in prices is expected to be 8 per cent or 8½ per cent in 1971 but I would hazard a guess that it could possibly go higher than that. From mid-February, 1970 to mid-August, 1971 the following increases are noteworthy.  The consumer price <Col N="2313" /> index went up by 22 per cent, the food index 13 per cent, clothing and footwear 16 per cent.  Despite this we are told that there is no reason why workers should not accept the wages which they have, that they are doing all right.</P>
    <P>I want to be fair to the Taoiseach but I think he attempted to put a twist on the balance of payments which was not correct.  We can go back to statistics and you can say anything you like with statistics.  He said there was a deficit of £69 million in 1969, £72 million in 1970 and it is expected it will be £76 million in 1971.  He then said that of course this included the Jumbos.  Why should it not include them?  Did they not come in and had they not to be paid for?  Did our external assets not suffer as a result of the purchase of two Jumbos?  Where are the Jumbos now?</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that when they commenced the purchase of the Jumbos they made an agreement with some outfit in South America that they would loan them the Jumbos for the winter period and take them back again?  They expected the money they would get for this transaction would cover some of the loss on the Jumbos. Is it not a fact that that firm backed out of the contract?  Is it not a fact that the law case which has been threatened against that firm would be throwing good money after bad because the fellow in Europe who can collect money from somebody in South America has yet to be born?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the fly-in of the American aircraft into Dublin.  I have a point of view which all of my colleagues do not share with me.  I believe it is in the interest of the tourist industry of this country to fly one American line into Dublin, that it should turn around and go back.  I understand that this will result in a very substantial increase in the tourist industry in this part of Ireland and in the country as a whole.  Apparently it is wrong because of the fact that they cannot be directed directly out of Dublin Airport into the extreme south or south west.  I believe the capital city and the east are as much entitled to a portion of the tourist earnings as anybody else.</P>
      <P>Early this year, when this matter was first discussed, the offer was made by the American airlines that they would agree to fly one airline to Dublin, touching down on each occasion, dropping their load at Dublin and turning back.  After negotiations had been carried on by an extremely inefficient Minister for Transport and Power for about nine months we arrived at the situation where he began to brag last week in this House that he thought he was getting back to the situation where they would be prepared to stop each plane at Shannon, come to Dublin, turn back and only one aircraft would do this.  Therefore, he was now telling us that he hoped to get back to what he was getting a year ago.  I am glad he is not a trade union official in my union because if that is the type of negotiations he carries on he would be in trouble pretty often.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be no problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>He has got a problem on his hands now which he may find it difficult to get out of.  I believe the Minister knows as well as everybody else, who is taking an interest in it, that the final solution will be the one I have just mentioned.  He knew that early this year; he knows it now and he is trying to cod the aircraft workers and people who are working in Shannon and the <Col N="2315" /> people living in Johnny Geoghegan's constituency in Galway although I do not know whether he sees them at all. If he does he should tell them that these people must understand that the Government have in the past made a deal with an American airline and there is no point in codding anybody any longer.  We all know it and that is it.</P>
      <P>Again, we had just a reference from the Taoiseach to the wonderful situation, it is alleged, we have in agriculture. The Minister for Agriculture, in a long speech the other day, and an even longer reply, gave us the impression that it did not matter what happened to the rest of the country, agriculture was doing well.  If it is doing well he is the only person who thinks so.  The utter stupidity of making statements, which he must know are incorrect, is one of the things I can never understand.  Why cannot Ministers be men, stand up and tell the truth and, even if it is the first time in their lives, say: &ldquo;Look, things are not as good as they should be, but we hope to do this, that and the other.&rdquo;  Instead of doing that they try to give the impression that everything in the garden, in agriculture in this case, is lovely and all they have to do is to sit back.  Then they throw in the wonderful bonanza about the Common Market.  Some of those who speak for Fine Gael are at one with Fianna Fáil on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to tell Deputy Cosgrave &mdash; he said Fianna Fáil could not win the referendum without Fine Gael &mdash;that he would want to listen to the voice of the sensible backbenchers in Fine Gael just as the Government would want to listen to the voice of the sensible backbenchers in Fianna Fáil who, though they may not say much publicly, influence a very substantial vote and, when the votes are counted at the end of the referendum, certain people may be in for a big surprise.  Nobody will deny that there are certain sections of agriculture which, if things continue as they are, are bound to do well.  The big cattleman will do well.  The small fellow who supplies the calves should get some of the crumbs; he should <Col N="2316" /> not do too badly.  The fellow who raises sheep and lambs may do well. Most certainly Deputy Corish put his finger on one aspect last night, an aspect from which the Government are shying away though they make statements about it; I refer to beet.  Dr. Mansholt when he was here recently thought the Irish mad to pay the price they did for sugar because the highest price in Europe is so much lower.  The position is similar in the case of butter.  Has anybody gone to the trouble of checking on what the costs will be if we go into the Common Market?  We know the prices.  What will the cost be to produce under those terms because, if we have to pay a high price for food, clothing and other necessities we will certainly not continue, as the Government seem to think we should, on the low rates we are getting at present, and I include even Members of this House in that.</P>
    <P>The trouble with the Common Market is that some people tend to get a little too hot about it.  They think there is a very big vista opening up to them in Europe and, if they get in there, they will be big people.  Like the Taoiseach, although he denied it, they will be important people, taking trips to Europe and taking part in certain discussions.  It will make them important and they will be well looked after.  We are thinking of the man working on the land and the men and women working in the factories.  There is no joy for them in the Common Market and even Fianna Fáil Ministers have not tried to put it across that there is anything in it for them. Today, the Taoiseach trotted out a new one.  Regional policy, moryah! We were told about the regional policy the Common Market has.  We know they have none.  They have agreed, if any country wants to try such a policy, to consider it.  As Deputy Cluskey asked yesterday, is that why the farmers in Brussels are on strike?  Is that why they have blocked the roads with their carts?  Is that because agriculture is doing so well in the Common Market or is there something else at the back of it?  Are they just trouble-makers?  It is very unfair that the Government and certain members of Fine Gael <Col N="2317" /> should try to sell something to the people which is not there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us forget it now.  The Taoiseach referred to imports and exports and he said that in 1970-71 imports were up by 15 per cent and exports by 10 per cent; things were not as good as they should be, but the position was improving and, in the second five months, our exports exceeded our imports.  One can take any set of months to give one the answer one wants.  One does not have to stick to facts.  The Taoiseach just took a particular period, five months, which happened to suit him.  Five months is an extraordinary period to take unless we are going to decimalise the year as well as everything else.  If <Col N="2318" /> he had taken six months the picture would be different.  He did not want to do that of course.</P>
      <P>He talked about our external reserves now being £400 million, up £70 million on last year.  Would the Taoiseach tell me what good that has done to the ordinary man-in-the-street in this Republic?  What has he got out of it? What use is it to him?  I remember the time when there was full employment in Britain and everybody had not only one job but two jobs.  Britain owed £1,000 million at that time.  I am not sure that it is such a good thing that we have increased our external reserves by £70 million this year.  If that £70 million were invested at home we might be in a better position than we are and we might not have 70,000 unemployed.  We on these benches have made the case that we should attempt to repatriate our external reserves but it is not an easy thing to do; however some effort should be made to do this instead of bragging about getting more money out of the country so that someone else can invest it.</P>
      <P>I do not think either the Taoiseach or Deputy Cosgrave appreciated the significance of what they were saying when they talked about redundancy. We are not talking about casual unemployment or about people who have been knocked out of a job by accident; we are talking about the loss of permanent jobs.  A person does not become noticeable as somone who is redundant unless he has been more than two years in employment.  One did have to be in employment for four years in order to be able to draw unemployment benefit, but that has now been reduced to two years.  If in the first nine months of this year 5,800 people were declared redundant that means 5,800 jobs have disappeared. This fact should be brought home to those who tend to try and brush it off casually as if it was a case of a man being knocked off for a week or a couple of weeks.  It is a very serious matter and the Taoiseach and the Minister concerned have got to give more attention to this particular problem than they are prepared to give at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the £20 <Col N="2319" /> million increase in capital expenditure. It is said it is impossible to know somebody unless one can get into his mind but the Taoiseach talked about curbing inflation and at the same time he talked about injecting £20 million into the economy.  Because we deal every day with people who are unemployed or sick we know that money is very tight.  There are people who can go into a bank or a finance house and borrow whatever sum of money they require because they have the necessary collateral, but there are people who find it extremely difficult to find the 50p necessary to buy a half bag of coal which will heat their little room until the end of the week when they receive their pittance from the Department of Social Welfare.  The plight of such people should be borne in mind when efforts are being made &mdash; I assume from what the Taoiseach has said that he has something in mind because at the time the £20 million was injected into the economy he gave a warning that there would have to be economies &mdash; to further deflate the economy.</P>
    <P>Somebody behind me wondered if he would cut Ministers' salaries as he did before, although I do not think it was very successful last time as Ministers insisted on getting them back before very long and apparently that is not going to be the device used this time. I am sure the Taoiseach knows of some way to deflate the economy.  Deflating the economy is all very well but the end result is usually that the people with very little are left with even less and this is one of the sad things about it.  This country will never be able to have full employment until we have money flowing in from all sources.</P>
    <P>On the Fóir Teoranta Bill a couple of weeks ago I spoke about a factory which had been closed down.  If that factory could have got £50,000 or £60,000 it would have probably been able to recover and continue in operation for a long time but because the State said that money could not be given, the factory closed down and 120 people lost their jobs.  When they were working their wages were about £25 a week which meant that £30,000 a week was going into the town.  When the <Col N="2320" /> factory closed down the workers went to the exchange and drew their redundancy pay and they will continue to draw unemployment benefit of about £10 per week for the next 12 months. At the end of that 12 months those people will have got from the State, on condition that they do not work, over £50,000.  In addition they will not have paid any income tax &mdash; most of them were paying heavy income tax &mdash; they will not have paid insurance stamps or the 15p for the health stamp.  This is the sort of thing which is landing us in the mess we are in.  Anyone who does not think we are in a mess should have a look at the situation in the country generally.</P>
    <P>The reply I received to a question last week is worth recording.  As we all know our best customer for all types of goods is Great Britain, our second best customer is the Six Counties, even with all the troubles, and a bad third are the six EEC countries.  In the midst of the trouble we are exporting more goods of a greater value to the Six Counties than we are exporting to the EEC countries.</P>

      <P>Yes, as Deputy Hogan has said we have a positive trade balance with them, unlike one country which buys £27 worth of goods from us although we buy £100,000 worth of goods from them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the Ministers are going to make statements.  I understand a Bill to deal with malicious injury claims is to be brought in shortly.  It will be very welcome.  A number of local authorities, including the one I have the honour to be a member of, have very heavy claims for fire damage.  All the properties we are asked to pay damage on were heavily insured but the insurance companies <Col N="2321" /> have refused to accept liability in each case until a malicious injury claim is processed.  The trouble with a malicious injury claim is that if the person who owns the property succeeds in winning the claim it can take several years before he gets the money and this is not being taken into account. The insurance companies insist in every case on malicious injury claims being made and, therefore, the loss to the insurance companies as a result of the colossal fire damage is relatively small.</P>
      <P>Despite that fact the insurance companies have notified their customers with effect from now that all fire insurance risks on commercial property are being increased by over 100 per cent.  I know someone whose insurance was £7.20 has received a bill for £16.48 They did not blush when they said it was because of the very high incidence of fire throughout the country despite the fact that it will not cost them much because they will not even pay a donation to the fire brigade in order to keep down the cost of fires.  Like the motor insurance business and everything else the Government will probably set up a committee or a commission and whoever is in Government in five years time will get a report which will be completely out of date.  The one on motor insurance does not look as though it is going to be brought in.</P>
      <P>I believe we have reached the crossroads. No matter what side of the House we sit on we must be seriously affected by the situation where, for party reasons only, the Government are not prepared to take steps which they should take.  First of all they have to decide whether or not the matter which they are discussing is likely to be resented by some of the people who half left them &mdash; those who have a foot on each side of the fence &mdash; and whether they are likely to cause a castle revolution and bring down the Government. They have to decide that what they are going to do is not what is best for the party, not what is best for the country but how far they can go and still carry the support of these jokers who were at one time such loyal supporters of what Fianna Fáil stands for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment is growing and employment <Col N="2322" /> dropping.  Redundancies particularly are growing very substantially. The cost of living has gone completely haywire and it appears, according to design, it will become worse in the next few months because of value-added tax particularly, while wages have been tied because the trade unions entered into an agreement to which the Government were a party but are not prepared to keep their part and you have workers worse off now than they were 12 months ago.  Then you have the &ldquo;hit-me-now-with-the-child-in-my arms&rdquo; approach which the Taoiseach always adopts when he is in trouble.  The Taoiseach talks about the North.  What has he done about the North?  Can he tell us of any concrete action he has taken that has in any way helped the situation in the North? I do not think there is any and I think he does not know himself what Government policy is on the North.  I do not think they have such a policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave made a comment today which was made previously by Deputy Corish and which I repeat: this is an issue which affects everybody in this country and there should be an all-party committee to discuss it and an all-party policy on it.  That can easily be achieved if we get around the table and decide what are the aspirations, as the Taoiseach says, of the Irish nation. What exactly do we want when we find one of the Government speakers saying one thing and another saying a different thing next day?  Is it any wonder people in the Falls Road or Bogside or elsewhere in the North are confused as to what exactly the South could or would do for them if they got the opportunity.</P>
    <P>The approach made by outsiders, including Mr. Wilson, Mr. Maudling and Mr. Callaghan, while containing items with which most of us would violently disagree showed that at least they were interested enough to study the matter and try to provide a solution. Flipping across to London and sitting in the same room with the Prime Ministers of one or two other countries, coming back and saying what he thought happened is not good enough from the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>As far as I and the Labour Party <Col N="2323" /> are concerned we want to make it clear that the Taoiseach should at this juncture tell Stormont and the British Government that we did not create the Border.  That is of their making and if we are not satisfied and they are not satisfied with what is happening they have sufficient police and military, call them what you like, to patrol or protect the Border and it would suit them a damn sight better to do that than what they have been doing in the past six or eight months in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach this morning gave some figures which show that in 1972 we shall have a growth rate of about 3 per cent.  He also gave figures to show that emigration is at what I believe is an &ldquo;all-time low&rdquo;. Some Opposition speakers have criticised the emigration figures and refused to accept them.  I am no statistician; the proof I have of the low rate of emigration is the number of people coming to me and to other Deputies in Dublin and from them one learns the numbers that have arrived back here from Britain.  It has been said that they have come back because of the trade recession in Britain where almost 1,000,000 are unemployed.  It is true that people have come back because of that but they have returned for other reasons and many who have come back have been able to find employment. They have rejected the British way of life and shown a natural desire to settle in their own country.  We certainly welcome them.  There should not be any disappointment such as was shown by Fine Gael Deputies this morning at the fact that the emigration figures are so low.  Surely we should rejoice to find the population rising through the natural birthrate and the return of many of our people from Britain and perhaps elsewhere.  If Fine Gael do not want to make capital out of emigration they should show that they welcome the great reduction in emigration figures.  Let them try to take emigration out of party politics and stop trying to gain political kudos out of the emigration rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It cannot be denied that many families are coming back and to this city particularly.  I hope that any other <Col N="2324" /> Dublin Deputies or Cork or Galway Deputies can also show that people are returning.  Preliminary census figures show an increase in the population for the second time since the Famine.  Therefore, we are given a foundation to build a State which can offer each individual the right to live and work here and pursue happiness as he sees it, bearing in mind the rights of others.</P>
    <P>Before passing from the opening remarks of the Taoiseach and Deputy Cosgrave I must say that I deplore Deputy Cosgrave's cheap jibes at this party.  In mentioning the trouble in the party he spoke very derisively of members who are no longer members of this Parliamentary Party.  Let me remind him of the Statement by Deputy Richie Ryan a little over a year ago when he warned Deputy Cosgrave to beware the Ides of March, that the long knives were being brought out by some people in the Fine Gael Party and that they were going to knife their leader.  I do not know if this was true but I believe Deputy Ryan thought it was true and this is the point.  He did not meet with any cheap jibes from us at that time because it does neither the party nor democracy any good to have this jeering and sniping when there is trouble in any party.</P>
    <P>This happens in every State where there are democratic parties and where members are free to speak their minds. If Fine Gael are suggesting we should have some kind of set-up here where people will not express their views on any matter you would then have a very poor type of democracy which would not last long and would develop into either a communist or a fascist state. Despite all our faults we have not and do not want either type of government. We have a democratic Government well led by the Taoiseach who has shown, particularly in his handling of the northern situation, that his basic ideas will pay off if we are to have peace, not just peace at any price.  We want peace, but not peace at any price. The peace we seek will give rights to the minority in the North and will stop the bloodshed.</P>
    <P>The population is increasing and a considerable number of our emigrants <Col N="2325" /> are returning.  We welcome this but we realise that there will be financial and economic problems as a result of our increased population.  Economists tell us it is easier to solve an unemployment problem when there is a rising population rather than when there is a decline in the population.  Like other urban Deputies, I am concerned about the impact on housing.  In the <i>Third Programme for Economic Expansion</i> it was stated that we would need 17,000 dwellings each year in order to meet the backlog and to provide housing for new families and for people returning to this country.  Last week the Minister for Local Government issued figures which showed that we are making progress but we cannot afford to be complacent about the housing situation.</P>
    <P>We realise that no country in the world has solved its housing problems, whether it be totalitarian States such as Russia or China or democracies such as the United States of America, France or Germany.  Housing is one of the basic needs of man; more of our problems arise as a result of bad housing, particularly in Dublin, than any single other cause.  In 1972 we must invest to a very considerable degree in the provision of housing.</P>
    <P>In Dublin city there are 4,000 families on the approved waiting list. I am not impressed with the word &ldquo;approved&rdquo; because any person in need of a house, who cannot provide it himself, must be housed.  There are another 4,000 people on the unapproved list, making a total of 8,000 applicants.  When we allow for the increase in population and the fact that houses become obsolescent and must be replaced, we can calculate that we need 10,000 houses in the city.  Even if the Government were in a position to allocate the necessary money to provide these houses, we would not be able to build them because I do not think the building trade could expand its operations to such an extent.  It is true that many of our craftsmen are returning to this country and I am sure that they will find jobs readily.</P>
    <P>In addition to having the necessary funds and the craftsmen needed to build houses, we must plan the new suburbs and urban renewal of the city areas; by city I mean not only Dublin <Col N="2326" /> but Cork, Waterford, Galway and other areas.  In most of the cities there are areas that need re-development.  In Dublin there are some dilapidated and run-down areas but it is encouraging to see that there are not so many slum areas nowadays.  This is thanks to the efforts made by the first Fianna Fáil Government.  They set in motion a housing programme and it became the &ldquo;in thing&rdquo; to build more houses and flats for the people.  We are reaching the stage where we can claim to be among the best housed nations in the world but this is no reason for complacency. We should not be content until all the applicants are housed.</P>
    <P>I do not think any country will ever have a surplus number of houses except a country that is dying.  When a country is dying it has not a housing problem but I am thankful to say that this is not the case with our country. In Ireland there is a demand for better housing and social services.  Young people are not prepared to accept the standards their parents accepted.  They set their sights high and this is desirable because, with this kind of attitude and thinking, we can build a good society.</P>
    <P>Many young people today have difficulty in getting deposits for their houses.  In this connection I welcome the efforts of the Minister for Local Government to provide low-cost housing. Young couples deserve the chance of starting off their married lives in proper accommodation.  Our Constitution gives protection to the family and one of the best ways of doing this is to provide proper housing.  A tremendous amount is being done but I should like to see added impetus being given to the housing drive so that we can clear the slum areas in this city and provide accommodation, properly planned by competent architects and planners.  Young families should know they are part of a society that cares for them.  Our country has an opportunity of showing what a small nation can do. We are blessed that we have no ghettos where people of a certain persuasion must live but it is sad to read of the ghettos that exist in another city.</P>
    <P>The older people in our community <Col N="2327" /> deserve more consideration.  With the increased expectation of life, the care of the aged presents some problems. It is sad to go into a local authority hospital and see the many old people in these establishments.  It is no reflection on the hospital authorities or the dedicated staff who look after these old people.</P>
    <P>Our whole conception of this problem is wrong.  It should be our ambition to keep people out of institutions and not to force them into them.  In recent years there has been a great drive forward in the provision of flats for old people by the local authorities and by religious societies like the Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Catholic Housing Aid Society, the Legion of Mary and a few others.  Last week I attended the opening of some flats.  The site was given by the builder, the merchants contributed the material, and the workers built them.  They were handed over free to the Catholic Housing Aid Society.  This shows an awareness in all sectors of the needs of old people.</P>
    <P>Awareness is not enough and sympathy is not enough.  It will take hard work and perhaps heavier taxation to provide the old people with proper housing standards.  We should show our appreciation of these old people not by putting them into institutions but by giving them proper accommodation in flats or houses.  They should receive proper attention from welfare workers.  Let us show the world that we care for our old people. It is said that the mark of any civilisation is how it treats its old people.  Let us make a big effort in 1972 to drive forward relentlessly on the housing front so that by the end of 1972 we will have cleared up a lot of the backlog. We must be prepared to give until it hurts to provide for our old people.</P>
    <P>From housing to social welfare is a small step.  Some of the most heartening remarks I ever heard in this House came from the Minister for Social Welfare when he announced that he is preparing a new social welfare code.  I am sure we all feel that, while our social services are not the greatest, they are not the meanest.  We took £134 <Col N="2328" /> million out of the economy for social welfare this year.  By a reorganisation of our social welfare structure and the injection of more money, we can come up with a model social welfare system which will not be a copy of some outside system.  Each country tries to suit the aspirations of its own people.</P>
    <P>In 1972 I hope we will have the opportunity and the privilege of seeing a new social welfare code introduced. It is not our intention to create what is known as a welfare State.  Welfare states in other countries provided money but they did not promote the welfare of the aged.  The fears of old people in some of these countries are realistic. Our system must be in keeping with our beliefs and our teachings.  When we have the new code completed we will be able to say: &ldquo;Here is a system devised by the State aimed at giving old people the greatest possible benefits which the State can confer: not only a pension and a house but welfare workers to ensure that they are not cast aside and left in some old flat or house but that they will be remembered each day.  It will be brought home to them that our society does not forget them and that, far from being a burden on our society, they are a great asset because of the service they gave the State when they could do so and because of the fact that an aged population has a very stabilising effect on a society.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the National Pay Agreement.  We all realise, without being economists, that unless the economy is buoyant and inflation is curtailed the weaker sections of the community will suffer.  The National Pay Agreement is due for renewal I hope.  Unless we are all going crazy we must have such a renewal. The national wealth created during the year will have to be distributed in the most equitable way possible.  I have great confidence in the good sense of the Congress of Trade Unions and the employers' organisations.  I am sure we will have peace on the industrial front and that an equitable settlement will be reached on wages and salaries and that the worker will be given a just return for his work.  We must build up the economy so that we can disburse <Col N="2329" /> the wealth we create to the workers &mdash; the use of the word &ldquo;workers&rdquo; is a bit out of date in that sense because everybody works, even the man who will draft the agreement&mdash; and to everybody concerned.  I hope and, indeed, pray that an agreement will be worked out between all concerned.</P>
    <P>We are accused of being very bad at industrial relations but this is one of the few countries in Europe with only one Trade Union Congress.  I welcome this fact, and long may it be so.  It shows that there is a great degree of unity in the trade union movement.  We have one Trade Union Congress which operates both North and South, with a slight variation.  Therefore, the trade unions can speak with one voice.  I wish the employers' organisations would form one body also so that the two voices would be heard with the blessing of and under the jurisdiction of the Government.</P>
    <P>In a few months time we will be facing the Referendum which will make it possible for us to go into Europe. The changes put forward are necessary, we are told by the lawyers, if we are to join the European Economic Community. This is a great task to put before the people.  We must all think very hard on this whole question.  Never before have we had to face the problem of whether we should integrate with a united Europe or stay outside.  Many people say there is no alternative. There may not be an alternative but I do not think our attitude should be that we are going in because we cannot stay out.  This country can contribute quite a lot to Europe.  We will have a voice in the European Parliament.  We can play our part in making a better Europe.  If the Germans and French who were involved in two world wars in less than 50 years could sink their differences in the pursuit of a common goal surely we can do the same.</P>
    <P>However, we must tell the people that for us the Continent will not be a land flowing with milk and honey. There will be tremendous problems to be faced on entry.  Perhaps this is the greatest issue that has confronted this State since its foundation.  Membership <Col N="2330" /> for us will entail severe competition with countries that have an industrial history which goes back to the industrial revolution.  So far as our agriculture is concerned, we might say that we can hold our own with any of the other countries and, indeed, on the manufacturing side, we have many firms whose modern plants and techniques qualify them to face the competition that will have to be met.  Their ability has been proved by our increasing exports not only to Europe but to the United States and to some of the Iron Curtain countries.  At the same time, membership of the Communities will require tremendous effort both by the Government and by the people generally if we are to avail ourselves of the many benefits that membership offers.  We must gear ourselves to meet this great challenge.</P>
    <P>In joining the European Communities, we will be helping to ensure that there will not be another war in Europe in the foreseeable future.  Some of the socialists here criticise membership on that point and say that we are too trusting and that what is being created in Europe is another power bloc.  At the moment there are at least one or two countries who, because of a threat from a mighty power close to them, are afraid to join the Communities but I hope that, eventually, other countries will join.  It was shortly after the war that caused death and injury to 28 million people in Europe and elsewhere that interest in a European Community was first mooted.  Those who conceived the idea had in mind the safeguarding of Europe in the future.  For that reason we should join but there are other issues involved.  For instance, membership for us would mean a better standard of living for our people in a peaceful environment. Therefore, it would be unworthy of Ireland not to join.  From the earliest times we have been associated with Europe although there were times when that association was not a free one. In the past, too, some of our people were forced to seek refuge on the Continent. The fact is that we are more orientated towards Europe than we are towards Britain and I hope that our membership of the European Communities <Col N="2331" /> will enable us at last to cut our ties with Britain and that we can start thinking in a &ldquo;European&rdquo; way rather than in an &ldquo;Anglo&rdquo; way.</P>
    <P>In the context of the EEC it will be necessary to amend certain articles of the Constitution.  Perhaps some of its Articles are not particularly important but, during the past few years, there has been a demand from certain quarters for the amendment of the Constitution on certain matters.  I believe that I speak for many people in this regard when I say that any attempt to amend the Constitution so as to give us all the advantages &mdash; I use the word derisively &mdash; of the Anglo-American society, will be met with strong opposition.  Our Constitution is a good one.  It was drafted by Irishmen for the Irish people.  Of course, no Constitution is so sacrosanct that it cannot be amended, but let those who are demanding the scrapping of the Constitution or the wholesale amendment of it tell us what they would put in its place.  We have not heard from them so far on that point.  One can only be suspicious of the motives of those who are exponents of the liberal line all the time.  What kind of society do they want?  However, our people are capable of making up their minds on these matters and I am sure they will not be prepared to forsake the principles they hold dear in order to jump on the liberal bandwagon.</P>
    <P>Any changes that are contemplated will have to be examined in great detail to see whether they are justified. The Constitution reflects the sentiments of the people and I wonder often whether, if we had the power to extend it to the whole of this country, there would be the present bloodshed and hatred in Northern Ireland.  In relation to the North one is always a little nervous of saying anything that would kindle the flames of hatred and brutality that are part of that territory. The blame for the trouble there cannot be laid at the door of the Orange Order or of the AOH or anybody else, but the blame must rest with Great Britain because she was the author of partition and it is partition that has given rise to the injustices and inhumanities <Col N="2332" /> of that area.  If Britain tomorrow morning wants to end this she can act with statesmanship as General de Gaulle acted with Algeria.  She can tomorrow do what he did with the Algerians &mdash; pull out of there, compensate them for losses and assure them of an income for X number of years. Perhaps there is not an exact parallel between Ireland and Algeria but there is a rough parallel.  It is near enough to call on any statesmanship which the British Prime Minister or his Home Secretary may have to make some attempt to stop this disgrace, which is not Ireland's but England's.  She can see, only 100 miles from her shores, this going on and she is subsidising it all the time.</P>
    <P>I, for one, do not want to see the British subsidies cut off from the people of the North but this is not a matter of Catholic versus Protestant. It is a clash between the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have nots&rdquo;.  In the North they have the highest unemployment rate in Europe, the jobs are just not there, and the Unionist oligarchy will hold on to power to the very end so that they can give out the jobs and the gifts of office.</P>
    <P>It is a strange thing that Britain where they are always talking about democracy, still sends over subsidies but when any section, whether it is a democratic party or an illegal organisation, tries to take some of the goods sent over by Britain, the British Army is sent in, not as a peace keeping force, it was never meant as that.  An army of occupation is an army of occupation and they all act in the same way. When we saw a youngster in Belfast a week ago being arrested by the British Army we were reminded of the last war when we say photographs of Nazi troops doing the very same thing.  The only difference was in their headgear. The Nazi soldiers wore helmets, the British wear tam-o'-shanters or berets. There is no difference in outlook.</P>
    <P>The British Government have a blind spot in regard to Ireland but there is evidence that there is some thinking going on.  Whether it is being forced by the British Labour Party I do not know.  I do not trust them an awful lot.  It was a socialist Government that brought in the 1949 Act <Col N="2333" /> which made Partition permanent.  Unless Britain at this eleventh hour takes matters seriously and stops fooling around and unless she controls her soldiers who are carrying out all sorts of intimidations we may have a situation in the North and outside it a thousand times worse than we have at the moment.  I was told this week by a man from the North that one of their new tactics is to go into a Catholic area and as people pass them by to mouth profanities against the faith of the minority there and utter lewd words.  This is the peace keeping force.</P>
    <P>I am not a man of violence by any means but the British should ask themselves how far can you push people before they revolt.  When the French people revolted against Nazi occupation Britain named them the freedom fighters.  In the North they call them gunmen.  The analogy is that the French people were suppressed by the Nazis and the people of the Six Counties are suppressed by the British.</P>
    <P>I never accepted that this is a matter of Catholic versus Protestant.  I have seen the Protestants living in Shankill Road, in Sandy Row and in parts of Derry and their conditions were no better than those of the Catholics but the Unionist politician, with his cunning, has succeeded so far in keeping these two sections apart by telling the Protestant workers what would happen to them in a united Ireland or if the Catholics got control.  I know it is hard to say it but even now I see a gleam of hope from the Protestant workers.  I look forward to the day when the Protestants who live in the Shankill Road or anywhere else or who work at Queen's Island or in the linen mills will cast off the Unionist yoke and realise that they are Irishmen and that their place is in a Thirty-two County Republic.  We are prepared not to make concessions or sacrifices because I believe we have made all we possibly can but we will ensure that when we eventually have a Thirty-two County Republic the man from Shankill or Sandy Row or the ship worker from Queen's Island will have his place not by any grace of ours but because he has a right to his status in society and we respect his right.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government have <Col N="2334" /> handled the situation as well as it could possibly be handled.  The Taoiseach has said that Stormont must go and I think that even the people in the North who thought that Stormont was sacrosanct are beginning to think differently. At the same time, we do not want to suggest simply that Stormont must go.  This would be a kind of signal for illegal organisations to do their work.  If Stormont goes there is enough common sense in the Six Counties and down here to work out a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>First of all Britain must get out of this and stop acting the hypocrite, shedding her crocodile tears over the happenings in Ireland, when all the time she, by her subsidisation and the attitudes of her Prime Minister, is encouraging the Unionist Party to hold on and that eventually they will have all the subversives conquered.  To the Unionist mind a subversive is any man who speaks his mind against the establishment. That is why today there are hundreds of people in Long Kesh internment camp.  They have never been given a trial so the Unionist Government cannot say they are guilty. This is all done in the name of British democracy.  The Government have done everything possible to bring home to Britain that this is her problem, that there is only one Irish nation and that Britain cannot, by any kind of trickery, create two nations.  This is 1971 and we have had peace in Europe for quite a few years.  If Britain requires the Six Counties as a status symbol of dominion power she must forget this.  If she pulls out with good grace I am convinced that the minority and the majority there and the people down here under the common name of Irishmen will be able to work out a solution so that we will not have any more Shankill Road or Ballymurphy ghettos.  We will have a society where a man, irrespective of his faith, will be guaranteed full rights of Irish citizenship and where he will be, I hope, assured of employment and housing and all that kind of thing and where, if these things are scarce, as they are scarce in Britain and the Six Counties today, he will be assured that it is not because of his religious or political <Col N="2335" /> belief that he does not get a job or a house.  We will build a society here, with their help, which will be able to afford to each one of them who wants to be an Irishman a full life and full freedom.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, judging by the news we heard last night, there is a change coming over British thinking.  Nobody minds Mr. Heath conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra or sailing his yacht in the Irish Sea but we could point out to him that there are much more serious things, not alone for this country but for the British Prime Minister because we saw in other countries that where a strong power held a weak power the weak power was not beyond going to another strong power and asking for their help. The Algerian settlement may not be the ideal one but it is something to go on and I would prefer an Algerian settlement to a Cuban condition.</P>
    <P>A matter that we must always dwell on is that we have, as has been shown, in our society a small but militant subversive group that will not bother about the niceties of democracy in trying to achieve their aims.  When people in this House condemn the Government for not maintaining law and order, they are just playing politics because, knowing of the actions of some of the men in these subversive groups, I think the Government and the Garda are doing a very good job.</P>
    <P>I come back to the point that I mentioned at the outset, that subversive groups thrive on British stupidity and as long as the British are so stupid as to try to maintain a border which is completely out of date they will only attract people into subversive organisations.  Even at this late hour it is time, as the Taoiseach thought some time ago, that Stormont must go and at long last the native people in the North must start to rule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate provides a forum for the House to review the preceding session but because it comes at the end of the calendar year it is an opportune time to look back at the entire year's activity so far as the House is concerned.  To my amazement, the Taoiseach in opening the <Col N="2336" /> debate and, if you like, setting the tone in which he would like to see the debate conducted, managed to avoid making more than a passing reference to what is the most important feature on the Irish landscape at the moment, the situation in Northern Ireland or the Six Counties, as the mid-Atlantic Republicans in Montrose are wont to call it.  The situation as I see it is so serious that the entire debate should be concerned with it and matters of economics fade into complete insignificance when put beside the appalling situation that prevails at the moment in Northern Ireland.  We had the spectacle of the Taoiseach quoting percentages of inflation or deflation increases in France, Italy and Germany while people in this country are being murdered and being maimed.  That situation did not get more from him than a passing reference and an indication that he would deal with Northern Ireland when he concluded the debate.</P>
      <P>This debate should be exclusively concerned with that tragic situation and this House was entitled to hear from the Taoiseach a résumé of the activities of himself and his Government in relation to that situation over the past year, a resumé which would tie in with a positive policy of action to resolve that situation and which would indicate what further steps will be taken to effect a resolution.  Instead, that situation was ignored and it is an amazing thing that that should be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surveying the Irish political landscape for the past year, the one inescapable feature is that we have again in this small island a civil war raging. One would have thought that the bitter experience of 50 years ago would have taught all persons in this island such a sorry and sore lesson that never again would we have a civil war situation here.  The actual horror of war and the extra viciousness that seems to arise during a civil war are bad enough in themselves but a civil war leaves behind it a terrible, protracted heritage of hate and even 50 years after the civil war in this country that heritage of hate still exists, well diminished, I am glad to say, but nevertheless it still exists.  It is a tragedy that we should <Col N="2337" /> again have a civil war situation in this country.</P>
    <P>I know that people of certain views will put forward the proposition that the struggle in Northern Ireland is not a civil war, that it is a struggle against the forces of British imperialism and that, as Deputy Moore says, if Britain disappeared from the scene in the morning, everyone would be happy. This is ignoring the reality of the situation up there and it is ignoring what is actually happening up there because when you have a war you have to consider that you are going to have casualties and the casualties up there are in the vast majority Irish people and the vast majority of those casualties have resulted from attacks by Irishman upon fellow Irishman.  No one can deny that.  We had the situation where an Irishman was shot by compatriots while he was watching television in what should have been the sanctity of his own home, in the presence of his wife and children.  We have had other Irishmen assassinated while going about their everyday activities, setting off for the day's work. They have been assassinated by fellow Irishmen.  We have the situation where an Irishman, when visited by fellow Irishmen intent on destroying his home, according to their version, attempted to defend his home and he was shot, he was murdered.  Yet people would claim that the struggle is against the British forces and against British imperialism.</P>
    <P>I think the reality of those killings which I have mentioned is that Irishmen killed fellow Irishmen because they disagreed with their political views.  If that situation happens within the boundaries of a nation civil war is raging.</P>
    <P>The last incident that I recalled, in which Senator Barnhill was murdered in his home, was so apppalling that the political leader of one of the IRA groups was so appalled by it that he sought to attribute the blame for it to a terrorist section of the British Army, the SAS, until members of his own organisation, in a statement, did not admit responsibility but, regrettably, claimed responsibility.  I think we are <Col N="2338" /> closing our eyes to reality if we deny that a civil war is raging.</P>
    <P>Civil war is a most frightful plague to afflict any country.  We had it here before and those of us who were born after it do not know the physical horror of it but we can experience the spiritual famine it has produced in this country. It was interesting to read in last Tuesday's <i>Irish Times</i> a copy of a letter written by A.E. to that paper at the time of that first civil war in this country.  In that letter A.E. spelled out, in the elegant way a poet commands, the fallacies of civil war and its evils.  Spelled out in that letter are the difficulties in the way of persons who try to induce a settlement of a civil war and of the attitudes that cause a civil war.  I should like to quote from that letter to give an indication of how apt it is today.  The writer is dealing with the righteousness of the cause that drives men to do things in a civil war that one would never expect civilised man to do.  He explains the motives that could have driven fellow-Irishmen to do the things to a compatriot that I have mentioned earlier.  He states:</P>
    <P>Now, the certitude of the soul that its ideal is life, too often begets a moral blindness with regard to conduct, and its purity of motives is taken as absolution for its sin.</P>
    <P>How apt that is today when we consider the terrible deaths and murders that have taken place and how they have been explained by reference to the purity of the motives of the murderers.  They are blinded by their ideals so that they are unable to see the illogicality of their actions.  As I have said, it is a tragedy that this situation should pertain in Ireland today, but the reality of that situation has to be realised and that reality is that we are in a state of civil war.</P>
    <P>Happily &mdash; that is a selfish word in the context in which I propose to use it &mdash; the civil war is confined to Northern Ireland, but I wonder for how long will that situation be happy in that limited context.  Is it not inevitable that it will overspill to this part of the country? This is one country and what takes place in the northern counties does not take place in an insulated atmosphere: <Col N="2339" /> it affects inevitably and unavoidably this part of the country and I have a terrible fear that the civil war which is raging there will overspill into this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I might quote again A.E.'s wisdom, his prescience in relation to this situation. He said that the effect of the conflict cannot be confined to the organism of the State which is assailed &ldquo;any more than a fever can be confined to one limb in the body&rdquo;.  We say so often that this is one nation, but if a civil war is raging in one part of it it is inevitable, unless something is done, that it will spill over into the other part, and I regret to say that the symptoms are already apparent.  We have in this country illegal armies.  Only a fool would deny that.  Those armies are composed of persons of varying mentalities, some motivated by an idealism, albeit misguided, others being plain criminals, as witness the bank robberies, but those unlikely armies whose only parade grounds are the graveyards of Ireland are a fact existing within this jurisdiction.  Their very existence is a symptom of the danger of civil war.</P>
    <P>We have even stronger symptoms. On two occasions personnel of the regular Defence Forces of this country have been attacked by illegal armies, once in Kippure and more recently in Drogheda.  We have had explosions, numerous bank robberies allegedly for patriotic reasons, again pointing to the ideals of A.E. when he stated that the ideal begets moral blindness.  We have had numerous bank robberies involving vast sums of money in the name of patriotism, carried out by armed men, presumably members of those illegal armies, and if we are not content with the evidence that those symptoms show we have the statement of Ruairí Ó Bradaigh, the leader of one of them, or of the political front for one of those illegal armies, quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 14th December.  He made a speech in Cork in which he is reported as having said:</P>
    <P>The fight in the North was in grave danger of leaving the Twenty-six Counties far behind.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>We must show them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2340" />&ldquo;them&rdquo; being the people of Ireland &mdash;&mdash;that we want to disestablish both states, North and South.</P>
    <P>That kind of statement must clinch, must confirm the danger to which I have referred.  If the leader of the political front of an illegal army says that both states, North and South, are being sought to be disestablished, surely we must regard it as being an attempt at the negation of democracy.</P>
    <P>I have not had time to read today's newspapers but I heard on the radio this morning that some other spokesman from one of these illegal organisations had made a statement to the effect that the level of garda activity in relation to these illegal organisations is now unacceptable.  That statement is also terrifying and must give cause for worry.  In spite of this clear evidence, these dangerous symptoms and these statements of threat to this institution, this Parliament and democracy, the Taoiseach, in opening this Adjournment Debate at this critical time in the life of our nation, contented himself with the economic statistics.  It was a travesty of a performance by a Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I hope that the threat of civil war, which is now raging in Northern Ireland, does not extend here.  The symptoms which I have described are present.  They are becoming more frequent and more menacing.  I feel seriously and grievously apprehensive that these symptoms and threats constitute a grave danger to this Parliament, this democracy and its institutions, the courts which we see being ignored, the army which we see being humiliated, and the Gardaí, whom we see being humiliated also.  No action is being taken by the democratically elected head of the State or the democratically elected Government.  How long will the situation continue before there is some fatal and irrevocable escalation?  Will we then find ourselves for the second time in 50 years plunged into the horrors of fratricide?  I do not know what would cause this.</P>
    <P>The Government seem to be careless of their obligation as guardians of the institutions of this State.  They have allowed the garda force to be run down, the Army to be inadequately equipped and, above all, have <Col N="2341" /> restrained these bodies of loyal men from exerting the authority of the State when the situation arose.  They have allowed the professional integrity of our police force and of our soldiers to be insulted at will regularly, and have put them in a position where they dare not interfere with bands of armed civilians who are presently roaming this country.  This state of affairs cannot continue without grave danger to this nation.  I charge that the Taoiseach has been guilty of a serious breach of duty and a serious breach of trust which he, as head of this Government, carries, in failing to take steps to ensure that the institutions of this State and our democracy would not be in any way endangered.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has come in here and opened the debate on the adjournment of this Parliament and all he can talk about are the rates of inflation or deflation in Germany or Italy.  This is an appalling performance by a man who is the head of a democratic republic. Is it any wonder that the situation in the North has escalated and that the political solution which is the only viable solution seems as far away as ever?  Any initiative has come from Westminster and not from this Parliament. It has come from the Opposition in Westminster.  Thank God there are some politicians somewhere in these two islands with the gumption to propose a political initiative.  Mr. Wilson has proposed that there should be discussions between parliamentarians from all parliaments within these islands.  It amazes me, when one considers the appalling toll that has taken place in the North, that these talks did not commence within days of the suggestion for them being made.  Five hundred people have been injured in the North in 1971 and 126 people have been killed there.  Those totals are increasing every single day.  How many months have passed since Mr. Wilson made his proposals?  Many weeks have passed certainly.  I would have expected that our Taoiseach, as the potential leader of the entire country, would have taken a firm initiative to try to arrange, as a matter of extreme urgency and utmost gravity, that these talks would take place and that there would be no worrying about positions, <Col N="2342" /> stances, attitudes or of losing face by sitting at a table with the Opposition or with the Prime Minister of Stormont.</P>
    <P>These petty, party political considerations should fade into the background when the reality of the situation is that fellow-Irishmen are being maimed and killed daily.  I find it hard to understand the lack of urgency and of energy on the part of the Government in getting these talks under way. One reason is perhaps that they have put themselves &ldquo;out of court&rdquo; in Westminster by the spectacle of our Minister for Foreign Affairs describing the British Government as being composed of lunatics.  Until reconciliation is achieved the solution to the Irish problem is no nearer.  We will not achieve reconciliation by being insulting.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach proceeded to England for two series of talks with the British Prime Minister.  These talks seemed to be completely non-productive.  We do not know why.  What puzzles me as an ordinary Irishman is why in this terrible situation at this stage in our country's history, when there is such a danger that the troubles in the North will overspill down here, the Taoiseach and the Government are not showing more energy in getting talks under way to achieve a political solution.  The position is so serious that attitudes and the necessity for formalising agenda must be disregarded.  They should not stand in the way of arranging a conference immediately.  I mention this inter-parliamentary conference because on the whole political horizon at the moment it is the only solution or initiative that has been suggested.  One would have hoped and expected that it would have been followed up most urgently and most energetically.</P>

      <P>In a speech which I made in Cork city on Saturday, the 11th December, I mentioned the suggestion I made a short time before that the Churches might come together to examine the Constitution.  I added that there are areas affecting the framing of a Constitution where the Churches have a special interest and that these areas needed no definition by me.  I also said that it would be a significant step forward if some effort were made by the Churches to harmonise their views on the widest possible spectrum of matters in which they have that special interest.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, further to the statement made by the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland following the killing by members of an illegal organisation of Senator John Barnhill, he would comment on the allegations made by Mr. Brian Faulkner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that a deliberate attempt is being made to conceal the failure of British policy in the North by attempting to shift the focus of attention to the Border area. Therefore, I reiterate my rejection of allegations that the Government are in any way responsible for the continuing daily tragedy in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every objective observer is well aware that the causes of violence in the North lie in the refusal of civil and human rights to 40 per cent of the population in the area for a half century &mdash; a deprivation which current policies are not correcting.  The House is aware that I have repeatedly made this point direct to Mr. Heath; it is indeed regrettable that British policy should seem to be inspired by those responsible for the attempt to continue discrimination against the minority in the North notwithstanding the cost to the British economy, the British Army and British prestige.  I repeat that violent activity is generated and sustained almost totally within the Six County area.  To the extent that there is cross-Border activity &mdash; Lord Windlesham who is a Minister in the present British Government spoke, in the British House of Lords on the 23rd September last, of &ldquo;relatively few crossings <Col N="2346" /> by terrorists&rdquo;&mdash; we have employed our resources to the full and we strive to improve our security arrangements whenever possible in the Border areas.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows the difficulty of policing the Border and, therefore, I repeat the suggestion I made months ago, and frequently since, that the Irish and British Governments should jointly ask the United Nations Security Council to provide a UN observer group to operate on both sides in the Border area in order to establish the facts and so serve to expose or prevent activities prejudicial to the peace.</P>

    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will identify the Saint James whose name has been adopted to replace the name of Saint Kevin attached to the major hospital of the Eastern Health Board; and the reasons and authority for and the means adopted to achieve the change of name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the negotiations which led to the setting up of the corporate body to administer St. Kevin's Hospital, it was considered desirable, by the parties involved in the negotiations, to change the name as a reflection of the change intended in the management of the hospital and its development as a teaching hospital.  The joint negotiating body considered a variety of titles which might be appropriate to the new situation.</P>
      <P>In arriving at a decision about this, account was taken of the tradition in this country to name hospitals after saints.  The name of St. James has historical associations with the area surrounding the hospital, going back to medieval times.  The local Catholic church is called the Church of St. James and the hospital itself is bordered by James's Street &mdash; the address of the hospital being No. 1 James's Street.  There was formerly a Church of Ireland parish of St. James in the locality.  In medieval times the customs post on the road to the west was at St. James's Gate, a famous landmark which was close to the holy well of St. James &mdash; the centre of a great fair. I understand that the St. James involved in these associations is St. James the Apostle, the brother of Saint John the Evangelist.</P>
      <P>The name of St. James was incorporated in the Establishment Order under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 14 June, 1971, and was also circulated to each member of the Oireachtas at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to answer Questions Nos. 5 to 7 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose essentially what the Deputies who put down these questions are trying to do is to ascertain from me why I have changed my mind about warning notices on cigarette packets. I am on record, I know, as saying that I rejected the concept on the grounds that it would have little or no practical effect.  However, the Chief Medical Officer of my Department who represented me at the Second World Conference on smoking held in London from the 20th to 24th September last, reported to me that a number of countries, including the United States of America and the United Kingdom, who were committed to warning notices on <Col N="2349" /> cigarette packets, were of opinion that, apart altogether from their efficacy, warning notices were regarded as an overt indication of a country's seriousness about anti-cigarette smoking health education.  I accepted this as a valid view and I sought the co-operation of the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers Advisory Committee which was readily forthcoming and which resulted in the agreement about the warning notices of which Deputies are aware.  I have incidentally had copies of the Code of Practice agreed between me and the manufacturers placed in the Library.</P>
    <P>Legislation will not be necessary to implement the warning notices.  As to the warning notices on cigarettes for the export market I am assured by the manufacturers that they will conform to the requirements of the countries to which they will be exported.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that all this information was available when the Private Members' Bill was introduced by Deputy Cooney, Deputy Harte, Deputy O'Connell and myself, and the reason the Minister made a change was that he knew that in a free vote he would be defeated?  What is the difference between the morality of this and the morality of a drug pedlar or a drug pusher selling a drug which he knows to be dangerous to a consumer and damaging to health and refusing to draw the attention of the person to this fact?  Having agreed to do it here, why does the Minister not insist on the tobacco companies doing it when they are exporting this dangerous drug for consumption in countries other than Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not make a lengthy statement about it.  It relates to the comparative danger of cigarette smoking, indulging in dangerous drugs or indulging in alcohol.

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">

      <P>I have had circulated to Deputies the details of the arrangements on fisheries which we agreed with the Community on 12th December.</P>
      <P>I am fully satisfied that, under the review clause we have agreed, such arrangements as we shall require to ensure the maintenance of the livelihood of our fishermen, the conservation of fish stocks in our waters and the continued development of our fishery industry can and will be continued after the initial period of ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the possibility of the Norwegians continuing their negotiations and ending up with an agreement which may disappear into the one we have got?  Would the Minister consider whether our review clause can be altered in the light of any further gains made by the Norwegian side?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is aware that the Norwegians were waiting until everyone else was finished and there were rumours that they would get special treatment.  No matter how long I waited to make my decision the Norwegians <Col N="2356" /> would wait longer.  In those circumstances we had to get on with it and we received the categorical assurance of the Community that the review clause, and the procedures prescribed, represented the final Community position and that they must be of uniform application to the present member States and to all the applicant countries. It was on the basis of that categorical assurance that we were able to reach a final decision with the Community.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister was it not possible for him to secure for the south-east the same terms with regard to territorial waters as he got for other parts of our coastline? Why are we to be subject to that extension only in the case of certain shellfish and not in the case of anything else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In my consultations I found out quite clearly where the fish are.  My information was that the herring are within six miles of the east and south-east coasts.  In the west the herring go out between the six and the 12 mile limit.  What I got was got in terms of protecting our fisheries.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware the six to 12 mile limit has already in it six other countries with traditional rights; they are already fishing there for certain types of fish.  The main protection was directed towards fish within the six miles in that area.  The other countries have lost nothing.  They have gained something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say whether there is a possibility that the Community may interpret the review clause in a special way for the Norwegians, without changing its wording, and, if something of that kind happens, is he clear that he can and will go back and ensure that we get whatever further concessions Norway may get by a form of interpretation over and above what we have got at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to be quite clear on this.  I interpret the review clause to mean that in ten years time an examination will be carried out and the considerations that were brought to <Col N="2357" /> bear on the present negotiations will be brought to bear on these further negotiations as a result of that examination. My interpretation is that we will then be in a stronger position because we will be a member of the Community and, as a member, we can continue, I believe, after the ten years to protect the rights of our fishermen and our fishery development, just as we have done now.  If that interpretation has anything added to it in future negotiations for the benefit of the Norwegians I would expect that further interpretation to apply also to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to multilateralise the agreement.  We could not possibly, on behalf of this country, accept anything added to the review clause that would diminish in any way the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Or any special interpretation of the clause to benefit Norway?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Norway has an enormous fishery problem and Norwegians may need to have it spelled out to them that, in the review clause, the special position of their fishermen will be taken into account. I have already pointed out our special position with a developing fishing industry. Anything that applies to the extension of the review clause should apply to other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another question. I was not dealing with that. There are traditional rights on the <Col N="2358" /> south-east coast and it is in danger of being overfished, but that has nothing to do with my negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot put them out.  They are in the Six 12 mile belt by right and nothing in my negotiations can change the London Convention of 1964.  To answer the Deputy's first question, what I said was that shellfish on the east coast go out to 12 miles and, for that reason, we got 12 miles on the east coast.  To make it quite clear, I was offered crustaceans and I included prawns, oysters and scallops, <i>et cetera,</i> and the word &ldquo;shellfish&rdquo; was brought in to cover all types. On the east coast they go out to 12 miles.  On the south coast they go out to six miles.  They are protected on both.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>And he has allowed all trawlers from the Community countries to come within six miles of the south-east coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not entitled to be there.  The ones that fish for <Col N="2359" /> herring have rights and protection on that part of the coast, as far as we are concerned, is required in the inner six miles.  The new agreement might bring in fishermen from Norway and Denmark, but I doubt if it will.  There is nothing in the European negotiations which would change the London Convention of 1964.  There was no possibility of cutting out.  I had to deal with the situation in which there was a regulation in the Community giving access not alone to baselines but right into the shore and into the estuaries and I got them out from that to cover all our fish.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the ESB that, following requests from a number of electrical wholesalers the National Wiring Rules Committee, in April, 1970, suspended until February, 1971 provision 2 (b) of the national wiring rules regulations.</P>
      <P>The electrical wholesalers had complained that the interim time allowed between publication in March, 1969 and proposed implementation in December, 1969 of the Regulations was insufficient to allow them to prepare for disallowance of the NDZ fuseboard. As a result large quantities of NDZ fuseboards remained in stock at the time of the implementation of the regulations.  There was no question of safety involved in the disallowance of this fuseboard&mdash;it was purely in the interests of standardisation.  That answers the question the Deputy was asking earlier.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state in respect of the Erin Foods plant at Tuam, County Galway, the number employed in sales promotion in Great Britain and what effort is being made to find new markets for the produce of this factory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The major portion of Erin sales in Britain, including sales of potato products, are made by the staff of the <Col N="2379" /> company's export sales division and their subsidiary marketing companies, a total staff of 14 in all.  Agency selling arrangements are carried out through the joint marketing company, Heinz-Erin Limited, and through a major British company who specialise in the institutional sector of the market.  The agency selling arrangements give access to a sales staff of approximately 120.</P>
      <P>Erin Foods are making intensive efforts to secure new markets and sales of potato products from the Tuam factory have increased significantly in markets outside of this country and Britain in the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The market in Europe and America is suffering considerably from over-production, to the extent that the Americans are exporting to Europe, the Germans are exporting to Britain and now the French are processing and dehydrating vegetables. In the circumstances, would the Minister care to hazard a guess about what effect this will have on the plant at Tuam?  I ask this question in good faith; I do not want any premature information and I am sure the Minister does not wish to create any undue fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true to say that perhaps another version of what the Deputy is suggesting is that there is a certain amount of dumping on the international market by some countries. It is also true to say that in the case of potato flake the market is heavily guarded by patents and licensing arrangements which make entry into new markets difficult.  However as I have indicated, there has been an intensive effort in the last two years which is reflected in the fact that this year approximately 12 per cent of total production at Tuam will go to markets other than the United Kingdom.  This will amount to £114,000, as compared with sales of only £38,000 to outside markets in 1970-71.  Despite the difficulties I have mentioned, intensive efforts are being made and some success is attending these efforts.  I have no reason to believe that in the long term the future of Tuam will be endangered.</P>

      <P>As yet this question has not been considered.  The Deputy will appreciate that the pension scheme for unestablished employees came into operation only on 1st January, 1970.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education (a) whether he is aware of a device apparently used when the roll-call is taken immediately class begins so that children, particularly those in large families, who may be ten, five or fifteen minutes late are marked absent and so qualify for retention in a lower grade class for a second year for other than educational reasons; and <Col N="2387" /> (b) whether any system exists of checking the absentee incidence of roll-call figures against the prosecutions for true absentee incidents in such circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any such device or practice.  The relevant rule provides that roll-call must be completed not later than 40 minutes after the time fixed for the commencement of formal instruction at the school meeting and that a minimum period of ten minutes shall be set down in the time-table for it.</P>
      <P>Prosecutions under the School Attendance Act are not undertaken unless it is clearly established that there is wilful neglect on the part of the parent in sending his children to school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that the framing of a question such as this is an insult to the teaching profession?  Has the Minister any evidence to suggest that this practice exists anywhere but in the mind of Deputy Browne?  Is the Minister aware that Deputy Browne is in favour of a device which would ensure that there would be no large families attending any school?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he has any information about the charge made that there are primary schools where the children think they are in sixth grade while they are in fact working at fifth grade programmes; and further that reports for VEC purposes are made out by teachers in such schools as if the children were in fact working in sixth grade programmes, while in fact working at fifth grade level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether in view of the policy now current in certain areas whereby, through fear that closure of a primary school may follow the reduction of the averages, (a) whole classes of pupils are being deliberately held back and not promoted to a class equal to their educational potential and <Col N="2388" /> (b) the books from year to year may not be changed to a higher standard but merely substituted for different new books of the same standards in order to deceive the children and parents, he will state what action he intends to take to verify and, if necessary, remedy such abuses.</P>

      <P>The planning and building of these schools is being dealt with as part of a programme which involves rationalisation in planning, bulk purchasing, serial tendering, <i>et cetera,</i> designed to effect very considerable savings in costs.

      <P>Is it not a fact&mdash;and the Minister must know it is a fact&mdash; that this letter represents the very deep concern felt by a number of clergymen of all denominations and individual citizens because the community schools are not developing along non-sectarian lines but on very narrow Catholic sectarian lines?  Not only is it unfair to the minority here but it must have a very grave and deleterious effect on the attempt by our people to establish a united Ireland into which the Protestant minority could safely enter without fear of the sectarianism implicit in this proposal.</P>

Would the Minister agree that in a country marked by so much religious discord&mdash;and with the great tragedy in the North of Ireland because of the divisions in the community&mdash;his attitude does not give much grounds for confidence amongst Protestants about the safety of their civil rights in a United Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education why he proposed to introduce segregation of the sexes in the proposed new community school units in Tallaght, County Dublin in view of the fact that the presence of boys and girls in the same school unit in Tallaght and of co-education in some classes had not given rise to any problems and that segregation was not being sought by the parents of the pupils in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that before the board of management were appointed it was announced that the school would not be co-educational.  If it is a matter for the board of management, how was anybody authorised to make this announcement before they were appointed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy the reply.  In his question the Deputy mentioned that there is co-education <Col N="2395" /> in only some classes at the moment and I have no doubt that the situation in the community school will be that there will be co-education, particularly at leaving certificate level in the case of subjects for which there will be less demand.  I am stating clearly now that the matter is one for the board of management and I will not go into that any deeper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that at this meeting in Tallaght, his Parliamentary Secretary, in my presence, said in regard to this question that while co-education might be introduced in due course it would not operate in the first instance and that the existing measure of co-education in the vocational school would be abandoned?  If what the Minister says now is correct, how could the Parliamentary Secretary do that before the establishment of the management body?</P>

      <P>The situation is that we have no doctrinaire situation in relation to co-education.

Indeed, statements have been made to me in relation to my own constituency to the effect that co-education will be discontinued in vocational schools because it is not acceptable.  The Minister is now putting it into operation in Tallaght because before the board of management was set up it was stated that it would not be co-educational, so we are back to square one.</P>

What interests me very much about this whole discussion is that one would imagine that consultation with parents in relation to schools was something that was a normal feature in this country.  Of course, I am pioneering something completely new in relation to parents, in regard to the management and, very particularly, in a situation where after three years the parents of the children attending the school will elect their own representatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in Tallaght was that the two religious organisations wished to start secondary schools there but I prevented them from doing so.

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he will reconsider his decision to require a school (name supplied) to cancel the appointment of an additional teacher who had been appointed by the school some months before the Department's circular was issued requiring schools to submit for approval appointments of additional teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department do not require this school or any other school to cancel an appointment.  I have already explained the position in this regard in reply to the Deputy's previous question.</P>
      <P>The school which the Deputy has in mind was allocated an additional incremental post this year.  In fact, it has been treated very liberally in the matter of staffing and in relation to the overall position there is no valid case for sanctioning a further additional incremental post in the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in January, 1971, teachers were appointed and that in May when they telephoned the Department they were informed that staff already engaged would be allowed to stay on but that subsequently this was cancelled?  Why was the cancellation done on the telephone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the teachers was sanctioned and as the Deputy is aware this school has a very good pupil-teacher ratio.  The other case in the school involves a Higher Diploma in Education student.  This school got the incremental teacher because of a general agreement with ASTI.</P>

      <P>The Government's intention to provide a sum of £25,000 to assist group farming projects was announced in the 1970 Budget Statement.  Subsequently, my Department entered into consultations with the advisory service with a view to formulating a suitable scheme.  This scheme came into operation in June last and provision for it was made for the first time in this year's estimate.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the high British market prices for cattle this year, there have been little or no weekly deficiency payments for some months past under the UK fatstock guarantee scheme and, accordingly, no payments have become due on carcase meat exports from here under our support scheme for such exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in reply to a similar question by Deputy L'Estrange on 2nd December, such difficulties as the meat factories may currently be experiencing arise from the continuing strong de- <Col N="2431" /> mand and high prices for live cattle exports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the demand for live exports of Irish cattle to Britain is to a great extent determined by the fact that extra subsidy is available for cattle slaughtered in the British factories because we do not pay as big a grant as the British Government pay to their factories?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The real reason for the situation that obtains in the fresh meat industry is, as I said, the fact that deficiency payments had reached vanishing point for a great part of last year and therefore support price payments by our Government to our factories have not fallen to be paid. It is from this payment of the deficiency that the meat factories made a large part of the profit.  This situation I have presently under review.</P>

      <P>As regards part (c) of the Deputy's question, I might say for his information that the outward boundary of the continental shelf is not determined by distance from shore.  The 1958 Geneva Convention of the Continental Shelf defines the continental shelf as the submarine area adjacent to the coast but outside territorial waters to a depth of 200 metres or beyond that limit where the depth of water permits exploitation.

If, on the other hand, the dispute is not about the identification of the area in which an incident occurred but about whether that area is in the North or in the South, the county engineer or one of his assistants is consulted and no doubt, if it were necessary for him to do so, he would consult the Ordnance Survey map.</P>

      <P>In a case where two townlands are in dispute, on whom does the Minister rely for evidence?  He has stated what happens if members of the Garda Síochána are present.  If <Col N="2435" /> members of the Garda Síochána are not present when the incident takes place, on whom does the Minister rely for information regarding the incident?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the members themselves were not present at the time of the incident, they would ask people who were present at the time what the circumstances of the incident were. Unfortunately, one cannot always rely on that sort of information, but if the Garda were not present themselves they would have to assess that as best they could.</P>

      <P>If an incident took place when members of the Garda Síochána were not present but 300 or 400 people, including councillors or Deputies of this House claimed that the incident took place in the Republic or that something was fired into the Republic, and if they had an independent photograph or photographs to substantiate their evidence, on whom would the Minister then rely for evidence?</P>

      <P>It is not for me to defend the decisions of the courts which appear to be disapproved of by some gardaí but I can give a categoric assurance that there is not the slightest truth in any allegation that the Government as a body, or I myself as Miniser, have at any time sought to interfere with the prosecution of these crimes.</P>

Is he aware that in reference to a particular case mentioned by Deputy L'Estrange, an armed robbery in Cork which had no political significance, they are very dissatisfied that a man was given a four years sentence by a judge who stated that he did not consider him to be the ringleader, that he was giving half the sentence he would ordinarily give?  The other two men involved who shot at the gardaí had their case transferred to the Central Criminal Court in Dublin, the State case was presented&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 to 98, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The need for Garda escorts, or for other forms of Garda protection, is a matter for the professional judgment of the Garda themselves and it is not the practice to disclose information as to the protection afforded in particular cases.</P>
      <P>Some apparent breaches of the law in relation to number plates on some lorries are being dealt with by the Garda in the normal way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the employer in this case, North Kilkenny Meat Exports Limited, has locked out these employees because of their becoming members of a trade union and wishing to remain members of a trade union and, in view of this totally irresponsible and provocative action on the part of the employer, does the Minister feel justified in spending public money helping out and assisting the employer in this way?</P>

      <P>There is no question of helping out or assisting this employer <Col N="2445" /> or any other private individual as against some other individual or group.  If there is a civil trade dispute that is a matter in which the gardaí do not intervene on either side but, where the gardaí have reason to be apprehensive of the possibility of injury or damage being caused, they take whatever steps they, in their own professional judgment, think proper to prevent such injury or damage.</P>

      <P>There is an increase of 28 per cent in the estimated number of dealings lodged in the Land Registry in 1971 as compared with the actual number lodged in 1970.  I understand that it is this increase that is mainly responsible for the growth in delays.</P>
      <P>A reorganisation scheme affecting the Mapping Branch is at present under active examination.  There are, however, substantial problems to be overcome in the matter of reorganising this particular Branch and I cannot say that a solution is in sight in the immediate future.  On the other hand, I am very conscious of, and concerned about, the shortcomings in the Branch at present and attempts to remedy the position are being given priority.</P>
      <P>The reorganisation of other aspects of Land Registry work is now well advanced and a major reorganisation scheme designed to increase efficiency in the registration of dealings is at present being put into operation.

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 112, 113 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his Question No. 20 of 25th June, 1970, on the subject.  The further assessment of housing needs for the period commencing 1st April, 1971 has not yet been carried out.  Families are rehoused by Dublin Corporation in accordance with a statutory scheme of letting priorities which includes provision for the re-housing of persons being displaced from unfit dwellings by operations under the Housing Acts. There were 162 such cases on the Corporation's approved waiting list when it was last revised in November 1970.  The waiting list is compiled on the basis of the number of persons in a family and does not show children separately, and accordingly details of the number of families with one or two children are not available in my Department.  As regards the question of re-housing such small families, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 287 of 28th October, 1971.  I am informed by the Corporation that accommodation offered to smaller families is not restricted to any particular area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government why it does not appear to be possible to secure simultaneous ministerial sanction to the <Col N="2452" /> acceptance of a tender and to the borrowing of money to finance that tender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of loan for a local authority project is normally based on the amount of the approved tender, since it is not possible to get a reasonably accurate estimate of cost before that stage is reached.  When the tender has been approved the process of the loan application normally proceeds without undue delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be easy for the Department to process the loans at the same time as the other matter.  While what the Parliamentary Secretary says is correct about it not being possible to finalise it in most cases if the Department are sanctioning the tender they know the amount and therefore his excuse is not quite valid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>While the present method may have certain disadvantages it has other advantages which the older scheme did not have.  We can get a better and a quicker utilisation of the amount of money available.  The old system of allocating a loan to a particular housing scheme where in a number of cases tenders were not accepted and where the road contractor withdrew his tender&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he cannot arrange to have the loan considered at the same time?  Why must the tender be six months in the Department and the loan application a further six months in the Department?  By that time the cost of the houses has gone up and naturally contractors are kicking at that stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The State grants for the houses have been fully paid. Three of the grants were paid to the person who built the houses and the remaining grants were paid to the purchasers of the houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that an inquiry would be appropriate.  The local planning authority, Offaly County Council, have specific powers under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, to ensure that development is carried out in accordance with the terms of the planning permission given. For example, where development has not been carried out in conformity with the permission, the planning authority may serve an enforcement notice under section 35 of the Act on the person who commenced development or on any other person who has carried out or is <Col N="2454" /> carrying out development authorised by the permission.  Non-compliance with an enforcement notice is an offence and carries legal penalties.  It is a matter for the council to take such steps as they consider appropriate in accordance with their powers to secure the completion of the roads and other services on this estate.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>In County Cavan over the last 12 months, the average delay between date of receipt of notification that a grant house was ready for inspection and the date of inspection was about four weeks.  The corresponding delay between date of inspection and payment of grant was also about four weeks, where cases had matured for payment.</P>
      <P>There is no undue delay generally in dealing with housing grant applications in Counties Cavan, Laois and Offaly.  Every effort is made to ensure that inspections are carried out as promptly as possible.  In some cases, payment is deferred where work is not completed in accordance with grant requirements or the applicant fails to comply with conditions governing the payment of grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2455" /> In the country as a whole over the last 12 to 18 months, there has been a sharp upward trend in the numbers of grant applications being processed in respect of new houses and the installation of water and sewerage facilities. In recent months, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of cases maturing for payment and steps have been taken to expedite payment in these cases.</P>
    <P>This week, four extra inspectors are being assigned to the work, and the possibility of recruiting further inspectors is being considered.  The administrative staff is adequate to meet normal requirements.  Nevertheless, the general position is being kept under review, particularly in the light of the upward trend in housing applications.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2461" /> The maintenance of public water supply systems is a matter for the local authority.  As regards the recent interruption of supplies in a section of the Dublin city system, I am advised by the local authority that on Saturday the 4th December, they found it necessary to shut off the water supply to enable a major watermain to be relaid in connection with the scheme for extension of the Ballymore Eustace treatment works, which is designed for improve water supplies to the city and south county.  Due to this work the 24&rdquo; watermain from Saggart to Stillorgan emptied and in the process of recharging this main excess pressure built up near Stillorgan reservoir with the result that a burst occurred.  When the burst was located at 7 a.m. on Sunday, steps were immediately taken to call workmen from their homes and work was put in hands without delay.  Work continued throughout Sunday night and was completed by 8 a.m. on Monday. It was then necessary to recharge some 11 miles of 24&rdquo; watermain from Stillorgan to Saggart before domestic supplies could be restored to normal.</P>
    <P>This had to be done with great care to prevent a further burst.  Every possible precaution is taken by local authorities to prevent interruption of water supply but it will be appreciated that it is not feasible to eliminate completely the possibility of such bursts occurring in the system from time to time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton is quite right.  This is not a priority question at all and the extensions he is referring to were carried out years ago.  He must have come across them only now and I do not know why they were included in the file.  The only one involved in this is the one to Nine Mile Stone which is a logical extension of the Ashbourne scheme in that a considerable number of new houses have been erected and they have no supply. Arrangements have been made for septic tanks to deal with sewage and they have not got the water to work them.  It will be a health hazard if it is not dealt with quickly and it is pretty rough that it should be in his Department for so long.  It would cost a relatively small amount of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

Preliminary results have already been conveyed to the county engineers and a full report on chemical and biological analyses covering four seasons is shortly expected.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate from the detailed reply which I gave to questions put down on 12th November, 1970, that action towards improving the traffic situation in Dublin is being approached by Dublin Corporation through short-term measures of traffic management and longer-term schemes for road improvements and the construction of new facilities.  I take it that the Deputy's question relates to the latter. I would not have details of schemes which are at various stages of planning by the corporation and consequently I cannot say when such works will commence.</P>
      <P>The location of the major schemes submitted to my Department in 1970 and in the current year and on which work has commenced are: St. John's Road; Dodder Park Road Extension; Kylemore Road; Finglas Road; Griffith Avenue Extension.</P>
      <P>Traffic management schemes on the Rathmines and Ranelagh routes and on the North and South Quays are also under way.  The total estimated cost of these schemes is £996,000.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply of the 2nd of this month to a similar question from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2471" /> Objections and representations with respect to the Dublin city draft development plan included submissions regarding Dublin Bay.  These were individually examined and my information is that they were given due and proper consideration.  The importance to be attached to any particular objection or representation was a matter for the corporation as planning authority to determine but I understand that the bulk of those received in regard to Dublin Bay were less concerned with the actual provisions of the draft plan than with certain tentative proposals of the Port and Docks Board published in 1965.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, sets out the consultative procedures which must be followed by a planning authority before making a development plan for its area.  These procedures give members of the public, other local authorities, certain prescribed bodies and all other interested parties opportunity for making their views known to the planning authority before the making of a development plan.  Planning authorities are not precluded from using, and frequently do use, other informal consultative channels which they may consider appropriate in addition to those provided by law.</P>
      <P>The present plan for Dublin city is the outcome of the publication of two successive draft plans and lengthy consideration of numerous objections and representations, and I am satisfied that the procedures were adequate to enable the public to make their views known and were fully used.</P>

    <P>That the Dáil do now adjourn.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(The Taoiseach.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Questions I was making the point that the situation in Northern Ireland is, in effect, a civil war situation and that there are very disturbing symptoms in this part of Ireland that there might be an overspill down here.  I drew the attention <Col N="2484" /> of the House to what these symptoms were: attacks on personnel of the Defence Forces, frequent armed robberies of banks, explosions and, above all, provocative and dangerous statements by self-confessed leaders of illegal bodies.  I was making the point that these matters threatened the very existence of this State, and threaten all our institutions including this Parliament, because some of the leaders of these illegal organisations have stated that it is their object to disestablish this State and set up their own form of Government.  In fact, one of those bodies has taken what it considers to be the intial step in that direction.</P>
      <P>All these activities have been ignored, seemingly, by the Government. The ignoring of these actual and positive threats is, to my mind, a serious breach of trust by the Government and a breach of their responsibility for the sovereignty of this Republic.  I suppose it is understandable that when faced with a bully one's first inclination may be to appease the bully but that is always a fatal mistake because the bully only gets bolder.  This is what is happening.  It is exemplified by a statement in today's papers on behalf of the IRA that Garda activities have now reached a level unacceptable to the IRA.  This is a frightening statement, a statement I would have thought the Taoiseach would have dealt with in opening this debate.  I certainly hope he will deal with it before the debate closes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This statement is proof positive that you cannot appease these people.  They have no responsibility to an electorate. They own no loyalty to anybody or anything except their own ideal and their ideal may be undemocratic.  It may be warped.  It may be dangerous. It is almost certain to be strong and it is full of danger for this country.  I hope and pray that the confrontation which appears to be coming closer every day that passes will not actually have to take place.  The only way in which that confrontation can be avoided is by finding, by whatever means possible, a settlement of the northern problem because if that problem is settled the temporary ground on which this anti-democratic movement <Col N="2485" /> is flourishing will be removed. Some politicians are under the impression that there is widespread national sympathy for these people.  I would disagree because the people realise that this movement is undemocratic and that its sanction is the bullet and not the ballot box.  If people are not aware of this, it is the duty of the Government to make them so aware so that should there be any sneaking sympathy for this illegal army, that sympathy would disappear.  The real settlement of the problem lies in the removal of the root cause and that is the trouble in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would have hoped that the Taoiseach in his speech at this stage of the year might have indicated some gesture of reconciliation that he could make that would de-escalate the problem. He might have been able to show us a practical political initiative.  He might have been able to announce that in view of the worsening daily situation in Northern Ireland he would strive to hasten the inter-parliamentary talks proposed by Mr. Wilson and which, at the moment, represent the only thing on the political horizon that has within it the seeds of a solution. Instead, we had the Taoiseach at this serious stage of the nation's affairs dealing with economic statistics.</P>
    <P>It amazes me as to why there was not an urgent and active taking-up of the Wilson suggestions.  The position in Northern Ireland is so serious and so bloody that anything that could have within itself even a remote hope of settling that problem, should have been pursued vigorously and actively. All we have had have been expected political reactions to the different situations as they arise and a denial that this Government is in any way responsible for keeping the Border sealed.  It is a practical impossibility to keep the Border sealed.  There have been visits to Chequers and the platitudes that followed.  There have been representations at diplomatic and personal levels.  We have had all the ordinary events but this situation is extraordinary and demands some startling initiative.  The sad fact is that the Taoiseach is not capable of giving <Col N="2486" /> a novel initiative and the Government have no inspiration to help him give it. This is the sad situation at the moment.  Nevertheless, I appeal to the Taoiseach, as Leader of the Irish people, to consider the only possible solution on the horizon&mdash;Mr. Wilson's proposals&mdash;and to take whatever initiative he considers necessary to take those proposals from the talking stage to the active stage and to forget about old stances and conventional attitudes, to disregard personal political fortunes and not to worry about any particular body or group that might be offended. Let him get around the table tomorrow, if possible, and he should not let the Christmas holiday intervene. Indeed, the spirit of Christmas would be the ideal time for getting these talks under way.</P>
    <P>It amazes me to an extent that I cannot express adequately that the horror of what is going on in Northern Ireland and the urgency of the situation does not drive the leaders of the three Parliaments into immediate and urgent consultation.  It amazes me, too, that the Taoiseach could open this debate on an economic basis.  I would hope that, perhaps, when this debate has concluded the position might be different and that the horror of the statistics given to us&mdash;500 people injured this year and 126 killed&mdash;would have driven the Taoiseach into action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Cooney, I listened with a sense of almost moral repugnance to the manner in which the Taoiseach introduced this debate at this stage of the nation's problems. However, I am afraid that my agreement with many of Deputy Cooney's points ceases there.  I regret to say that some of what I have to say this evening will be distasteful to people like Deputy Cooney and Deputy FitzGerald, whom I admire, and that also there shall be some feeling of reluctance on my part. In spite of that, it is better that things which are true should be said rather than ignored.  Problems or realities will not disappear by a failure to refer to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a member of this House for less than two-and-a-half years.  I entered the House as a relatively young <Col N="2487" /> Deputy which I trust I may say I am yet.  For me it involved a sense of awe. To walk down those steps meant a great deal to me at that time.  I experienced a sense of awe and a sense of being a member of an exclusive democratic establishment, I regard myself as having been given some permanent place in the history books by the Irish people.  I recall writing in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> within weeks of my election of the sense of pride I experienced in passing into this Chamber, past the pictures of Brugha, Collins, Tom Johnson and Kevin O'Higgins and past the busts around those walls which remind us perpetually of the circumstances in which this House was born, the circumstances of republican pride, the circumstances of violence, circumstances not mandated by the ballot boxes except to the extent that the 1918 general election may be seen to have mandated the republican campaign of the Irish Republican Army between 1919 and December 1921.  I think it is a moot point whether that strange election of 1918 could be held to have given a mandate for what was subsequently done.  Certainly, there were Deputies in this House in the years between 1919 and 1921 who viewed with distaste and displeasure the action of Collins, of Breen, of Treacy, of Séamus Forde, who died only yesterday, and people like that and disowned them and yet, ultimately, came to inherit the victory that the men of violence won.</P>
    <P>I came into this House with a sense of awe, knowing of the debates that had taken place here, the exchanges that had taken place, knowing of the men of stature and integrity who had sat on these benches, feeling a very small and frightened boy for all my years of academic experience and my years of marginal involvement in Irish politics, feeling a great sense of pride to sit where these men had sat before. I confess I have lost that sense of awe and feel only a sense of the most intense depression permeating my attitude to this House and to this Government, a sense of depression increased, rather than alleviated, by the Taoiseach's divisory introduction to this <Col N="2488" /> adjournment debate.</P>
    <P>It is said by political journalists, who are much more experienced than I am, that every Dáil carries its own character and its own flavour.  Who am I to judge if this is true?  If this Dáil has a characteristic it is that a smell of death and corruption, in every sense of that word, has hung over it since the events of May, 1970, a sense of impermanence, a sense of living from day to day.  I may have had the misfortune to have been elected to serve my first term in what is probably one of the worst Dáils and with one of the worst Governments in the history of this State. Rarely, I imagine, have the standards of politics dropped as low as they have in this Dáil.  Rarely has the atmosphere been so bad, so negative and so unconstructive as it is in this Dáil.</P>
    <P>The other day I had a group of students in the gallery coming from the university in which I work.  They had to witness the spectacle of a Deputy and a Minister exchanging compliments over the issue of whether or not the Minister in question had or had not paid some illegal funds to his father-in-law.  I do not know which was the more disgraceful, the occurrence, if it had occurred, or the Deputy who made the suggestion that it might have occurred.  One way or another, I thought it a disedifying exchange and I could not help hoping as I listened to it, and listened to many other similar exchanges which take place at Question Time in this House, that among the bevies of prospective voters, school children, who are brought up to that gallery, that there were not any people who were taking civics, that there were not any people who were being instructed in respect for this institution. I hoped that if there were they would be deaf momentarily to what was going on around them.</P>
    <P>I am in my first term.  Maybe I am naïve, even at the age of 36.  A very senior member of the press corps once said of me that I must lose the habit of blushing like a virgin as the backwards and forwards interplay of accusation and counter accusation occurs at Question Time.  Perhaps I should, but perhaps, on the other hand, the relative newcomer can see something <Col N="2489" /> which is lost upon the more experienced politician.  Perhaps as I look up at that gallery, not heavily populated now, inevitably, but heavily populated at Question Time, perhaps I can feel something of the contumely with which this House is regarded by people outside, a very naïve and apolitical thing to say, perhaps, but I wonder just how fully it is realised by every Deputy in this House and, more particularly, the Ministers of the present Government though I do not concentrate on them exclusively.  I do not claim that they should take the whole of the blame.  I wonder if it is realised just how low the whole practice and art of politics&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think I may have unintentionally got under the skin of the Minister for Transport and Power by a reference I made to exchanges between himself and Deputy L'Estrange.  I want to make it quite clear to the Minister for Transport and Power that I do not think Deputy L'Estrange was right to raise the matter he raised.  I was simply adducing that particular exchange as an instance of the level to which discussion in this House can descend from time to time. If the Minister thinks I am a hypocrite in saying that then I apologise to him but I think my view of the standard of that kind of exchange, which is quite a common occurrence in this House, is a view widely held outside this House.</P>
      <P>Never in the history of the State has the practice of politics been brought so low as by this present Administration. It has now reached the point where we are so reduced that we are hiring an international public relations organisation which previously handled the affairs of Biafra.  Of that organisation, Mr. Harold Wilson said that he thought it had done Biafra a disservice by overselling the condition of that unfortunate former country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, I do <Col N="2490" /> not think the practice of politics has ever been brought lower in the State than by the current Dáil and it is distressing to me, as a young man, to say this.</P>
      <P>The debate on the Adjournment is customarily introduced by the Taoiseach and it customarily ranges over a very wide field; in fact, as I understand it, almost any field.  Since this debate was introduced by the Taoiseach, it is necessary for me to say a few words about the Taoiseach himself.  I have never indulged in personalities in this House and I do not intend to do so now except in the sense that any public political figure is entitled to be criticised on his public political performance. Over the last few years the Taoiseach has developed a remarkable style of politics, to use an American term, by which people tend to say, &ldquo;The Taoiseach is honest.  The people around him are corrupt, power crazy&rdquo; and that sort of thing.  I think we have come to realise the unpleasant fact in this present Dáil that the Taoiseach himself more than any other individual is responsible for the lowering of standards in political life in this country.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has a record as having been a reluctant politician, reluctant to enter into politics in the first instance, in 1948, reluctant to accept a Parliamentary Secretaryship, reluctant to accept a Ministry and reluctant, we are told, in 1966, to accept the leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party.  All I can say is that for a reluctant Taoiseach he has shown a limpet-like determination to cling to that seat which contains an energy and a power of suction worthy of a better cause. Throughout all the events of the last two years, the determination of the Taoiseach to retain that corner seat has taken precedence over every aspiration or need of this country.  This has to be identified as a fact.  There are very few politicians in the history of western European politics who would have gone through the contortions which our present Taoiseach has gone through in order to retain power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Always in the popular press we are told of his reluctance, of his imminent departure to the Park, or somewhere else.  I have come to believe and to see <Col N="2491" /> and I think the majority of the public will come to believe and to see that he will never leave that seat until he is forcibly taken from it by the back of the neck, because he loves it above all else, including the good of his country.</P>

Fianna Fáil, which presented a united image in 1969, is a very changed party today and looking around these benches and listening to the Fianna Fáil Party, listening to the Taoiseach introducing this Adjournment debate today, I sometimes, in all seriousness, ask myself what is the authentic Fianna Fáil Party which I once used to admire and of which I was a member for a short time, before I knew better.  Is the voice of the Taoiseach who introduced this debate today, who would not be sitting in the seat he is sitting in if he had not won five all Ireland medals, who had not made up his mind what his politics were until 1948, who was touted for by Clann na Poblachta, by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, the authentic voice of Fianna Fáil or is the authentic voice of Fianna Fáil the voice of Deputy Neil Blaney?</P>

      <P>I remember the late Seán Lemass telling me an interesting and moving story about how he recruited Deputy Blaney's father as one of the earlier organisers of Fianna Fáil, in 1926.  Ever since that date, the Blaney family have worked for Fianna Fáil&mdash;over 40 years.  Now Deputy Lynch, the reluctant and veritably recent politician, finds himself in that seat.  Deputy Blaney, whose family had served Fianna Fáil for 40 years unbrokenly, finds himself in one of the back benches, with his political future possibly in ruins around him.  I hold no particular brief for Deputy Blaney. There are many things that he has said and done which I dislike, disapprove <Col N="2492" /> of, disagree with, but I cannot help remembering back to 1968, in my television past, which Deputy Dowling frequently reminds me of, when I was covering the 1968 Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, I listened to Deputy Blaney doing as only he could do, standing up before a Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis which was denouncing Taca and making one of the most moving, and brilliant speeches I have ever heard, proving that the continuity of Fianna Fáil was unbroken by a phenomenon like Taca, ending by turning a resolution hostile to him into a standing ovation, sweat pouring down his face. I admired him that night, even though I disagreed with him.  I wonder if he would make the same speech now that he is out of the party?</P>

I admired their populist roots, their defence of the small farmers in the thirties, their campaign on land annuities, their adherence to the desired change in the Treaty settlement, the constitutional policies of Éamon de Valera.  Slowly <Col N="2493" /> that party changed until they became two parties.  I predicted this in an Article I wrote for <i>Studies</i> as long ago as 1964, when I stated that the Fianna Fáil Party had become two parties&mdash; the party of big business on the one side and the party of their original roots on the other.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an interesting and historic fact that before the resignation of ex-Deputy Boland from the Department of Local Government only two Irish Cabinet Ministers in history had resigned on obvious or ostensible points of principle, Deputies Paddy Smith and Noel Browne.  Deputy Boland may have left this House but he took with him a moral stature which was enhanced by his readiness to throw away the Ministerial <Col N="2494" /> Mercedes for which so many of us are alleged to be hungry.</P>
    <P>I wonder how many on these benches would make a comparable sacrifice.  One of the saddest nights of my life was that when I witnessed the spectacle of the back of Deputy Haughey going up those stairs to vote confidence in a Minister in whom publicly he had expressed lack of confidence. I do not blame Deputy Haughey in the slightest.  I am too fond of Deputy Haughey and too great an admirer of him to blame him for it.</P>

      <P>It would be nice to think that the public were capable of discriminating between the Fianna Fáil Party and the rest of the House, but I do not believe they are.  If there is any virtue in what has happened in Fianna Fáil it may be that at last the monolithic structure of Irish politics may break down and some more realistic form of political divisions may occur.  This is something many of us have been longing for in the last 26, 27 or 30 years but which has not happened.  At the moment, if an open vote were taken on such issues as community schools, contraception, <i>et cetera,</i> the divisions within each party would become apparent.  I am prepared to admit this.  So ridiculous have our politics become that if music were played here and a circular game of musical chairs were conducted by the Members of this House from which different Members stepped down to different benches when the music stopped, the public in general would not notice the difference as far as a lot of Members of this House are concerned.</P>

      <P>We have a House now.  In relation to the death of Senator Barnhill, Deputy Michael O'Leary is reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> as saying that an onus rested on the Taoiseach to urge the Attorney General to bring the officers and members of the IRA executive before the courts as accessories to the crime.  The Deputy felt that the Taoiseach should urge the Attorney General to take similar action against a rival faction of the same organisation.  I do not know whether Deputy M. O'Leary used precisely those words or if they are subject to the interpretation which an ordinary individual like myself would put upon them.  If the implication of that statement is that Irish soldiers or Irish police are ever to be put into a position where they act as felon-setters for Mr. Brian Faulkner, I want to dissociate myself totally from that statement at whatever cost it may be to myself.  I think that I may speak for a great number of my party in saying that.</P>

      <P>I am being frank now and the Minister for Transport and Power will accept that on this occasion.  Where crimes are committed in this State as, for example, in connection with the unfortunate death of an elderly man in County Meath, who was apparently suffocated or beaten to death, then it is the proper role of the Garda Síochána to search out the perpetrators of that crime and to bring them to justice, but when Irishmen go across the Border into Northern Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think that those who go across the Border into Northern Ireland to carry out armed attacks upon Unionist installations should not be placed in the same category as ordinary criminals in this part of Ireland. I do not propose that it should be the function of the gardaí to collect them and to hand them over for extradition.</P>

      <P>I hold no brief for indiscriminate murder or violence in the North.  The fact remains that as stated in both the Constitution of this country and the Constitution of my party the 32 counties of Ireland and the islands surrounding them are one natural entity and the Border which separates the Six Counties from the remaining Twenty-six Counties is an artificial border imposed under the threat of immediate and terrible war by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, ratified by the trick of the Boundary Commission in 1925 and perpetrated finally by the Republic of Ireland Act, 1949.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For decades people have gone North on this mission of freeing the North. Perhaps they have been ill-advised.  I do not know.  If they have been ill-advised, they have been ill-advised by the stories they have read in the <i>Sunday Press,</i> the stories of barrack <Col N="2499" /> attacks written by the late Ernie O'Malley.  They have been influenced by the history books from which children were taught until recently.  Are we now to say that they were reprobates and criminals?  I am not prepared to do so.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, spoke of the possibility of extradition of people to the other part of the island held under British rule.  I always understood that it was impossible to extradite from this sovereign Republic a person accused of an essentially political offence.  This was found so in the judgment in the case of Seán Burke.  If the Minister or the republican Government of Fianna Fáil are seeking to utilise the powers of extradition, why do they not look for the extradition of the murderer of 16-year-old Martin McShane, because he will never get justice from a court in the North?  The British soldier who shot down that boy, while he was playing, will never be brought to justice by any northern court.  How many protests have been made about the death of Martin McShane?  Who has mentioned Martin McShane in this debate before I did?  It can be said that one can blame these people for the violence they are fostering, but if they are wrong they are wrong in a long, historic and unbroken pattern of wrongs.</P>
    <P>As late as 1929, three years after our President, Mr. de Valera, severed his official connection with the IRA he said in the Dáil that those who continued in that organisation which he had left can claim the same continuity as they claimed until 1925.  When the bonfires burned for the 1932 election victory, it was Deputy Aiken who went to tell George Gilmore the good news and in the words of Peadar O'Donnell &ldquo;the gates flew open&rdquo;.  And so the tradition continued in that slightly constitutional party.  Now suddenly &ldquo;republican&rdquo; has become a bad word. Violence, in which that party was born, has become an unthinkable and meaningless word.</P>
    <P>I attack the indiscriminate use of gelignite and bombings in the North which kill innocent bystanders.  It is disgraceful and disgusting.  It is more likely to entrench sectarian divisions <Col N="2500" /> in that section of my country than it is to have a good effect.  What then can be done to help?  What are the people supposed to do?  Are they supposed, like Patrick Pearse, to don the full regalia of uniform and to hoist the tricolour in Donegall square and allow themselves to be machine-gunned by 22,000 British soldiers?  They have to resort to the tactics which are forced upon them.</P>
    <P>Collins learned this lesson.  In the GPO Major John MacBride, before he died, asked &ldquo;Why did we not take to the hills?&rdquo;  Collins, then a young man, learned that to sit down in dignity to be killed, while it might prove a regenerative sacrifice, would not win victory.  Collins was honoured a great deal on those benches.  He is venerated as the architect of the Treaty.  He is not celebrated as the supreme guerrilla leader of the whole period, the architect of the military victory of 1921 and possibly the most archetypal of brilliant guerrilla leaders in the whole history of the western world.  He is not honoured for that.  He is not honoured for the fact that he organised what can only be described as a campaign of assassination&mdash;use the word &ldquo;murder&rdquo; if you like&mdash;between 1918 and 1921. All the same phrases were brought out then as are being brought out now by the British Press.  As Graham Greene, the distinguished English Catholic novelist, pointed out only the other day, every day Lloyd George and Hamar Greenwood would say: &ldquo;We have murder by the throath, it is nearly over,&rdquo; just as today, ignorant, remote blimps like Sir Harry Tuzo say: &ldquo;We have the IRA finished.  Well, we did not have them finished last month but we will have them finished this month.&rdquo;  Now the latest is that they are going to have them finished in March.</P>
    <P>Every day in that period Lloyd George said: &ldquo;I will never sit down with murderers,&rdquo; but as Graham Greene pointed out in that same letter to <i>The Times,</i> ultimately he had to sit down with &ldquo;murderers&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>My apologies.  I am not trying to rake over old historical ashes here.  All I am trying to do is to grasp some unpalatable truth which is that this country was born and bred in violence and has been taught to love violence for 50 years; that the children have been brought to worship and make heroes of people who exercised violence.  Perhaps we are wrong and that Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien is right.  At least Dr. Cruise-O'Brien's stand is consistent.  He thinks 1916 was wrong.  He thinks the whole thing was wrong.  I do not.  Perhaps he is right, but certainly he is consistent.  He does not say: &ldquo;Violence was all right until I got into those benches in 1932 and then it ceased to be all right.&rdquo;  I can understand his position.  I cannot understand the dismissal of violence by the pacifist federal Republicans of that side of the House who were born from this tradition.  They attack bank robberies, so do I, but the greatest architect of bank robbery after Lenin, who invented the policy of appropriation, which was a polite word for bank robbery, was of course Collins himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were taught to believe all these traditions were right.  I was taught to believe they were right.  In 1944 on my ninth birthday my birthday presents were: Dan Breen's <i>My Fight for Irish Freedom,</i> Desmond Ryan's <i>Seán Treacy and the Third Tipperary Brigade.</i>  I was brought up on this.  Now I am to <Col N="2503" /> be told it is wrong.  All right.  I can make the transition.  I am old enough, but what about the younger people who are bred on this, bred on the barrack attacks, bred on Seán South and the rest?  I challenge any Deputy on that side of the House, even now, to deprecate violence.  I challenge the Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, to go down to Limerick and say that Seán South was wrong in 1957, or whenever it was, and that the song <i>Seán South of Garryowen</i> should never be sung again.  I wonder would he do it at the Fianna Fáil cumann.  I somehow doubt it.  Yet these are the people who, sitting upon an historical tradition of violence which they fostered themselves, tell us that we must eschew these people and possibly even intern them, as was suggested in this House.</P>
    <P>Always we seek to sweep this problem under the carpet to make it go away.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs went so far as to issue a Ministerial directive not so long ago to Radio Telefís Éireann that they were not to show interviews with these people, the Provisionals and the Officials, a decision which placed him on all fours with his distinguished counterpart in Great Britain, Mr. Christopher Chataway, a fact of which I hope he is proud.  Does the refusal to admit that these things exist, that these people are recruiting, that they have a glamour which appeals to the young, amount to statemanship? Does it make the problem go away? It is a fact of life which we have to accept.  What directive will come next? Will a directive be made that public pronouncements from the Labour Party should cease?  If I may introduce a note of flippancy to lighten the somewhat historical tone I am taking, if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs were to make such a directive in our respect it might be the greatest electoral favour he could do us.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, has asked the IRA to step out of the way and stop hindering the processes in which that party is engaged to end Partition.  What steps have they taken to end Partition?  As far as I can see, there have been only two steps to end Partition since the retirement <Col N="2504" /> of Mr. de Valera and perhaps even further back than that: (1) under both Deputy Aiken and Deputy Cosgrave, the ritual of getting up at the United Nations and saying that Partitution is a bad thing, provoking yawns of boredom from everybody, saying: &ldquo;Those Irish are at it again&rdquo;; (2) junketings of bodies like the Anti-Partition League, speeches to the Irish Club and the NUI Club in London. Are these serious attempts to end Partion?</P>

      <P>I am endeavouring, with your help, to draw my remarks to a conclusion.  To me, until the Civil Rights Movement came to attention in 1969, the desire and intention of this Government to end Partition was a ritual lip service to the principles, expressed about as meaningfully as the comparable hypocrisy of Deputies who get up here in this House and speak about two sentences in Irish which they repeat when they revert to the spoken vernacular of everybody in this country, barring about 3 per cent of the population.  What has changed since 1969?  The Civil Rights Movement changed it first and when the British Army went on the aggressive and the Unionists went on the aggressive at Burntollet, these changes began.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does anyone think that Mr. Harold Wilson would have come over here to talk to the leaders of the three Irish parties and others two years ago when he had the power to do so?  Of course <Col N="2505" /> he would not.  When the Minister for Finance is finished saying that the IRA should get out of the way let us grasp another unpalatable truth.  It is unpalatable to me.  If the settlement of Partition is in any way in the offing and if the Taoiseach has his seat at the high table which settles it he will have been shot into that seat by the events in the North not by any efforts of his own.  He may not like these truths but truths they are.</P>
    <P>What have we in turn done down here to prepare ourselves for the ending of Partition?  Nothing.  Dr. Paisley, Mr. Boal and others have drawn attention to the defects in our social services, in our legal code and in our Constitution. The most the Taoiseach has been able to reply to this is to suggest that he would convene a meeting of the Churches which might throw up suggestions to change the Constitution.  He will not grasp the nettle himself and make these changes.  He will not accept the Bill which Dr. Browne and Dr. O'Connell are putting forward in this House on contraception, a Bill with which I want to associate myself, whatever cost that may be to me.  He will not grasp that nettle.  No, he prefers us to make the running on that so that when the Taoiseach stands in that corner there and says he is prepared to make constitutional changes, if he calls an election Deputy Paddy Power, Deputy Meaney, Deputy Flor Crowley and many others will be sent around the country to say that we in this party are alien, materialistic, communist, reds, pinks, queers and every other kind of thing.</P>
    <P>What kind of hypocrisy is that, that one type of intellectual stance is maintained on the front benches thanks to the guaranteed loyalty of the 60 or so Deputies who sit behind them and who can be guaranteed to go around the country and traduce our characters for putting into the cold light of print what the Taoiseach pretends he wants to do. What kind of honesty or sincerity is that?  It is the most blatant, utter hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>Let us face one or two final truths. If we are going to ask the North to join us in any other circumstances other than bombing and geligniting them into <Col N="2506" /> this part of the country, and I agree with Deputy Cooney that this is a horrible prospect to have to face, then we will have to grasp these nettles.</P>
    <P>What is the record of Fine Gael on this?  They have a similar ambivalence. Deputy Cosgrave boasts that the 1922 Constitution was non-sectarian and he spoke today about equality before the law.  Last Friday Deputy Oliver Flanagan got up and said that the Constitution is sacrosanct as it stands at present and under no circumstances must it be altered.  This is the same trick all over again.  Who is sincere around here or who is not?  I see Deputy Cooney grinning with embarrassment and I do not blame him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not grinning with embarrassment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not often speak in this House as frankly as I am speaking tonight but I intend to say what I have to say and nobody will stop me. If we mean anything here we have to show that this Twenty-six County portion of this country is worthy to invite the North to join us.  This means a revision of our laws.  I see no moral worth in Catholic virtues which are retained in this State by the legal imposition of sectarian chastity belts. I do not think the Lord would welcome me into heaven on the grounds that I did not divorce my wife when the State made very sure that I could not divorce her in the first place.  What sort of morality is that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will need true community schools.  Question Time today showed how ready we are to embrace the concept of true community schools.  I wondered, listening to the discussion on the community schools and other subjects today, how sincere the people on the Government benches are about the ending of Partition.  I would love to see the ending of Partition.  I would love to see 30 or so Ulstermen come into this House with the Reverend Ian Paisley, the most vocal and pronounced of them all.  I wonder how Deputy Faulkner, the Minister for Education, would like to have to handle the draft of questions he got today on community schools if he had Dr. Ian Paisley sitting over here speaking on <Col N="2507" /> behalf not of 5 per cent but 25 per cent of the population?  His face would be even redder than it was today and God knows it was pretty red then.</P>
    <P>I see the necessity for a socialist solution to this problem in both parts of the country.  My tradition is the tradition of O'Donnell and Gilmore.  I am sorry to see some of my own colleagues are repeating the historical mistakes made in the past and apparently turning the path of Labour away from the Republican tradition.  They shall not succeed in doing this and if they do this party will no longer contain me.</P>
    <P>There is a socialist solution and it is the achievement of a pluralist society, a non-sectarian society on both sides of the Border, and a just society on both sides of the Border, a society of equal opportunity.  In Derry, nothing was more tragic to me than to see the exchanges between soldiers and unemployed Derry youths on a Saturday afternoon.  One set of unemployed workers fired rubber bullets at another set of unemployed workers which threw stones back at them.  There were unfortunate English soldiers for whose trigger happiness and neurosis at the moment I do not greatly blame them.  They are people transported from Lancashire towns, where they could not gain employment, and find themselves in this strange place where they need maps to find the Border.  Usually they cannot even find the Border when they have the maps.  They fire at people they do not know, unemployed Catholic youths who throw stones at them. I never in my life saw a more tragic situation.</P>
    <P>One of the saddest sights I saw in Derry was a bewildered Negro soldier sitting at the wheel of an armoured car with an expression of stoic perplexity on his face, wondering what on earth was going on around him while the stones and rubber bullets flew.  Of course, you have got to condemn those who indiscriminately plant gelignite in public places but you have also to accept the horror of institutionalised violence.  To me institutionalised violence is only quantitatively and not <Col N="2508" /> qualitatively different from the violence of killing.  If I was an unemployed Derry worker whose wife was a shift worker in a shirt factory, and I had a son and I saw the full lifetime before him contained only unemployment like my own unless he left this country, I would feel if someone handed me a gun or a rock that it was the proper thing to use it.</P>
    <P>It is we, not them, who are to blame. It is not the violence that is to blame. It is the stagnation of this State that is to blame, the failure of this House that is to blame, the bankruptcy of these two statelets that is to blame. Sometimes, looking around at the irrelevancy of politics, looking around in a situation in which more time is spent on exchanges of personal abuse at Question Time here than has been spent in the last two years on unemployment, housing, redundancy, health, I sometimes feel even as Pearse felt that the generation of which I am a member, a relatively junior member, thank God has deserved the catastrophe it has brought upon itself.</P>
    <P>Nothing the Taoiseach said today suggested that his mind was in any way open to a structural change in our society which would speed the ending of the division of our country.  Nothing the Minister for Education said in his discussion on community schools would suggest that his mind is in any way open to structural change.  I ask every Member of this House, those few who have listened to me, those who have interrupted me and those who were not here to examine their own and our&mdash;I include my own&mdash;collective consciences as to whether we have not brought this disaster upon ourselves.  I ask them to consider that, if we are washed away in a tide of violence, it may be precisely because we have ceased to justify ourselves as a parliamentary assembly.  Certainly, if the suggestions, the ways of friendship, of amity, of pluralism, of social justice which go forth from this House towards the North and towards our underprivileged people, if they continue to be on the level of the contemptuous indifference of the Taoiseach's <Col N="2509" /> speech this morning, then we shall have no right to complain if the public turns its back upon this assembly.</P>
    <P>Many years ago I wrote&mdash;I quote my own words&mdash;</P>
    <P>The day of the movement, of the charismatic leader, is for better or worse dead.  The future is with the type of politician exemplified by Wilson, Maudling, Erhardt, Brandt. Whatever palms are going will be the prize of the party which finds such leaders and convinces an apathetic electorate of their novelty and their genuineness.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest danger is that no party should succeed completely in the immeditate future in performing this operation.  If this is so, young talent will be siphoned off from the political parties into non-partisan political activity. </P>

        <i>Studies</i> in the spring of 1964.  What a horror of a personal judgment that was!  What a judgment we are inviting upon ourselves in this House in these days!  No single man can take more blame for that than the Taoiseach, the Taoiseach who has put his continuance in office before every other consideration, put it to the point of humiliating his closest colleagues and the traditional familial architects of his party's longstanding success.  I quote from Verdi's setting of Shakespeare's Falstaff: &ldquo;h'onore oladri,&rdquo;&ldquo;Honour, you thieves&rdquo;.  Honour is dead in this House.</P>

      <P>I want to eschew the historical exercise in which Deputy Thornley engaged.  It is sad to listen to someone who came in here as recently as 1969 engage in the rhetorical and historical polemics about matters that, in 1971 terms, are no longer relevant. Since the events of which Deputy Thornley has spoken we have had a second world war.  We now have a situation in which the world is moving closer all the time because of communications of every kind, communications of which the Deputy has had experience.  We are now moving into a situation in which no country is an island on its own.  Some of the people who formed part of the intellectual <Col N="2511" /> and philosophical basis of the labour socialist movement are the very people who first saw that nationalism was an outdated philosophy and that internationalism was the proper thing.  International socialism was, of course, the mainspring of the formation of the USSR, as Deputy Dr. Browne, quoting Lenin today, said earlier in this House.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that, because of the very nature of modern communications, frontiers and barriers are not what they used to be.  What counts now is how we go about organising our society best to achieve the maximum standard of living for our people.  In other words, how can we attain a society in which justice obtains to the maximum degree?  In my view there are certain fundamentals we must face.  The first is entry into the European Economic Community.</P>

      <P>I said the mainspring of the whole European idea was grounded in internationalism, and rightly so, and the socialist parties of Europe were the parties mainly concerned&mdash;I say this in a positive and constructive way&mdash;in the creation of a united Europe that would be a power of its own, a united Europe which would eradicate national frontiers and eliminate the various versions of shirts, Brownshirts, Blackshirts, Blueshirts, and all the other people who sought to indoctrinate Europe with totalitarianism. International socialists sought to ensure that in a united Europe after the war there would be no more wars and it was in this atmosphere that the whole idea of a united Europe was created and the forerunners of that idea were people like Paul Henri Spaak of Belgium, Willi Brandt of Germany, George Brown of Britain, well-known Labour socialist politicians, <Col N="2512" /> pushing a consistent line and a philosophy with which I agree of international social exchange.</P>
      <P>It certainly is very strange that, despite what happened at the conference recently in Dún Laoghaire, where international European socialists sought to get the Labour Party on the rails properly, it does appear that they are putting up a token opposition to our entry into EEC, but, in fact, if they get their philosophical sights right, they must see that entry into Europe is essential from the philosophical point of view of uniting with our brethren in Britain and Europe and essential from the very practical point of view that as far as our workers are concerned more than 50 per cent of the jobs in Irish industry at the moment are dependent on exports and, as Deputy Cosgrave rightly said this morning&mdash;and this should be spelled out&mdash;will be outside the curtain or blanket of a tariff wall unless we enter Europe if Britain goes in.</P>
      <P>In addition, we have the positive benefits deriving from the agricultural policy of the Common Market.  I have been having my troubles with the American Government recently on the air rights issue and I notice that the American Government have protested in the past few days to the EEC about its Common Market agricultural policy and this is precisely the area that benefits Ireland most, precisely the area in which the late General de Gaulle achieved for France, because of its high agricultural content, the tremendous advantages for the high percentage of French people who depend on the land&mdash;roughly in the same proportion as here in Ireland, 30 per cent&mdash;it was in this area that he achieved these for France within the Common Market.  We stand to gain immediately on accession, by will of the Irish people, I hope, on 1st January, 1972, to the extent that through the transitional period, there will be a build-up to a 50 per cent increase in price as far as cattle and dairy products are concerned.</P>

      <P>The reality of the matter, as Deputy O'Donovan and the House know well, is that in 1971, in a situation where a market of over 250,000,000 people is being created, in a situation where you have specific guarantees in regard to beef and the <Col N="2514" /> dairy products I have mentioned and in a situation where you have Britain going in along with Norway and Denmark, no sane person in Ireland can advocate Ireland staying out of that type of trading bloc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes the Irish people have a habit, and it is a weakness, of ignoring the facts of life, but here we are 3,000,000 people in the Republic who will shortly be living on the periphery of a trading bloc of 250,000,000 people, in a world in which China is growing strong, in which India is apparently growing stronger, in which Russia is strong and in which America is flexing her muscles and is strong also.  In that type of world, we cannot go it alone.  Let us face the facts of life. They are brutal and tough, but they are realistic.  We cannot go it alone and we must go in, whether we like it or not, and I would argue for going into Europe on the merits of the situation, for going into Europe one way or the other&mdash;unlike Deputy Esmonde, I am a total believer in the European involvement, but I put it further&mdash; and this is the reality which ordinary common sense Irish people will see&mdash; on referendum day&mdash;that the facts of life are that we must go in.  We cannot face a situation in which an external barrier built around Britain and around Europe can exclude this island of 3,000,000 people, when over 50 per cent of the jobs in Irish industry depend on exports, and our agricultural markets are entirely in Britain and Europe where we would hope to benefit when tariffs and quotas are cut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the basic facts that arise in regard to our EEC application.  I am certain that the Irish people&mdash;contrary to the misconception often expressed on the media that they are gullible and foolish and we heard it from Deputy Thornley who is an ex-media <Col N="2515" /> man himself&mdash;are the most highly sophisticated people in the world when it comes to making political decisions.  We have proved this in America and we have proved this here, and I think rightly so in certain situations and in certain instances.</P>

      <P>I take the Deputy's point, but I am certain that on this particular referendum the great mature body of people here, and the Labour Party, too, if they are honest and go out and talk man to man to the people of the country, know and every one of these members knows in his heart of hearts that we must join the EEC and it is complete nonsense to put up a facade of resistance.  We can argue the technical details on Committee Stage of the Constitution Amendment Bill.  I am sure that amendments can and will be considered by the Government, and points of view met but the basic reality is that we must go into the EEC, must go into Europe, and join this trading bloc because prosperity and the standard of living and expansion of employment we want in this community of ours depend on membership of this trading bloc and these are the facts of life.  The only people who are really in their heart of hearts opposed to it are people not <Col N="2516" /> represented in this House at all.  The only people really opposed to it are the anarchists, the Maoists and the left-wing head cases we have right around the country.</P>

      <P>But we have not got the Labour Party seriously against it.  We know the view of the President of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, Senator Fintan Kennedy, and we know the view of all the serious-minded people in the Labour Party.  They are fundamentally agreed with us that this has to happen. I understand&mdash;I have been in politics for some time&mdash;the reason why the Labour Party have to put up a facade of opposition&mdash;for optical reasons, to present an opposition&mdash;but I feel that it is time we were honest with the public in this matter.  That is why I referred initially to the fact that all the European socialist parties have been traditionally in the forefront of European unity because by reason of their association with international socialism &mdash;they are genuinely socialist parties&mdash; they have been opposed to nationalism and parochialism in the narrow form and have been concerned with mankind and humankind irrespective of class or frontier.  I understand that recently a number of international socialists from Europe came to Dún Laoghaire to tell the Labour Party the facts of life.  I do not know how that conference went.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be straight with the people. We are here as representatives of the people: let us cut out the labels. Deputy Cosgrave this morning made a very petty speech, in my view, talking about what room certain people occupied in regard to some committee attendance.  This sort of nonsense from the Leader of a major political party is utterly out of tune with what people require in 1971.  They want leadership; they want to know where they are going; they want to know the future. They want it spelled out and properly planned for them by political parties in this Assembly and by the Government. If we are not the Government there must be an alternative Government that will plan properly also.  It should <Col N="2517" /> be spelled out loud and clear without party politics that this little country&mdash; it is a small country and a proud country&mdash;that has gained its independence and which contains three million people within the Republic and hopefully waits for the day when there will be four-and-a-half million people in this island on the fringe of Europe, from the viewpoints of our future prosperity, standard of living, way of life and enrichment in every sense of the word, practical, material and cultural, must go into Europe.  If we do not, we must live on ourselves and God knows what will happen then.  We can merely escalate the sort of dangerous situation we have in the six north-eastern counties down here because there will be nothing for us to do but eat ourselves.</P>
    <P>Let us get down to practicalities and have no more nonsense, no more phoney or dishonest debates or arguments. I want to emphasise another aspect that has not been referred to already or sufficiently emphasised.  I have spoken about the obvious social benefits that will accrue to the agricultural community in the Common Market and I have emphasised that as regards the non-agricultural community the fact is that we must go into EEC because we must have an outlet for our exports on which employment is now over 50 per cent dependent.  This is the material side of it: these are the practical, political grounds for it.  Again, I have sufficient confidence in the capacity of all our political parties and in the capacity of whatever Government are elected to govern this country. The situation in which we will sit in a European Parliament, have representation on the European Commission and on the Council of Ministers will, far from diminishing, substantially enhance our position in regard to being a nation among the nations of the world and in the sense of having a real say, making a real contribution and having a real stake in what is happening and affecting Britain, Ireland and Europe generally. When we shall have the same representation in a European Parliament as Belgium and the Netherlands and have the same votes in the qualified majority sense in the Council of Ministers as Belgium and the Netherlands, <Col N="2518" /> two very powerful countries, bigger, more prosperous and more populous than our own, and when we have the right to sit around the table with them in the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission and argue our case, that is the situation in which you will see a real end in a practical way to the problem that bedevils the north-eastern counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed it is one of them: there are many answers.  I think every Deputy in honesty must acknowledge that the EEC was set up by international socialists who wanted to get rid of the Hitler and Mussolini type of nationalism and wanted to establish a socialist, classless and fair society with equality of opportunity across all west European boundaries and do it democratically as against the totalitarian manner in which it was done by Lenin, as Deputy Dr. Browne said earlier, in Russia.  Democratic socialists sought to establish this type of framework in Europe.  We now, along with Norway, Denmark and Britain, are about to join this Community and, in my view, that Community which is designed to get rid of wars and prejudices and class struggles is the area in which our voice can best be heard through the representation I have mentioned in the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission.  That is where our voice will really count and where we can ensure that, just as EEC has ended wars between France and Germany, we shall end silly little border troubles in this island and between this country and Britain.  In that Community the British will finally have to sit around the table for the first time in their lives because for hundreds of years they have played the balance-of-power game in Europe and played the <Col N="2519" /> repression and suppression game in Ireland.  For the first time the UK Government will be around a table with Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Norway and Ireland, as a party and not as the one in charge.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to know the facts I can give him the exact figures. The British representation both in the Parliament and the Council of Ministers will be the same as that of the Italians, the French and the Germans and will be only twice as much as the representation of Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium.  These are basic and very important facts.  I agree with Deputy Cosgrave in what he said this morning, that we should spell out the facts of life to the people.  He had a valid point in that all of us who sincerely believe in the complete and utter necessity for this action&mdash;I take it most of the Labour Party agree with it also because these are facts&mdash; have not sufficiently made this case known to the public.  This was possibly a valid criticism by Deputy Cosgrave this morning.  The facts are so basic and fundamental that we must go in. I have mentioned them on the material side.  We cannot afford to be outside EEC, apart from the basic implications regarding jobs and agriculture. For the first time, it will give this country an independent place around the council table in Europe where we can influence power in a Europe where already the media and the views of Governments are highly sympathetic to our point of view in regard to the six north-eastern counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a Europe where the kind of nonsense and stupidity being perpetrated in the six north-eastern counties by London and Stormont is anathema, where sectarianism and class strife do not enter into any society that exists in the EEC.  Around the Council table and in that Parliament we can wield some power.  At the present time we are on our own; we are not members of the Commonwealth of Nations, we are not members of the European Economic Community. We are a small country and the British Government and the Stormont administration&mdash;and the British <Col N="2520" /> Army which is being utilised by these two administrations&mdash;can and are wielding the big stick.  The only area of opportunity open to us within which we can exercise our undoubted political sophistication and where we will have positive representation is within the EEC.  There we can mobilise the support and help of other European countries and, when the frontiers and borders are gone in Europe, this straggling border in our island of 4,500,000 people will not exist.</P>

      <P>On the Indian subcontinent recently, the United Nations proved to be highly ineffective.  I should like to see in a European society much of what Deputy Thornley spoke about; a society where people who are opposed to us at the moment in the Six Counties, people who are members or supporters of the Unionist Party, can play a meaningful part in a united Ireland and in a united Europe.  They have a considerable contribution to make and it can be made in the reforms that are necessary in our Constitution and our laws to allow for a completely free and open society in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am certain that when we get down to practical talks it can be done.  At the same time, I think it would be ill-advised for us to embark on constitutional or legal reforms on the basis of trying to bait other people to join us.  This kind of mean and petty action is not on.  We can get round to talking with people, with all the Churches as the Taoiseach has suggested, with the people who do not agree with us from the national point of view.  We can get round to amending our Constitution in the context of meaningful talks as suggested by the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, Mr. Wilson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooney agreed with Mr. Wilson's suggestion of the parliamentary parties in the two islands meeting and discussing matters.  I met Mr. Wilson when he was here, as did other <Col N="2521" /> members of the Government, and we got our ideas across to him as to how this might be done.  Deputy Cooney appeared to suggest that this was an idea out of the blue by Mr. Wilson. In fact, Mr. Wilson came here to see the situation, he visited everyone who was interested in having a non-violent solution, he met the elected representatives of all political parties North and South and, on that basis, he made his suggestions.  We agreed with some of the suggestions but there were others with which we disagreed.  At any rate, it is important that the elected representatives in this island and in Britain should get together and talk about the problems in the north-eastern part of this country.</P>
    <P>Violence begets violence and there is no point in going back on history.  What is wanted is a stop to violence and this applies to the British Government and the Stormont administration as much as to anyone else.  Violence has escalated substantially since the introduction of internment and since the attitude has been taken by the northern administration and the British Government that a military solution is the only one.  All sensible people know that this is not so; they know that the only solution is to get people round the table and to start talking.  This is necessary as the first step in a long series of painful steps towards the eventual reunification of the country.  I am referring to reunification in the real sense&mdash;social, economic and financial&mdash;and the financial implications of a united Ireland are substantial.</P>
    <P>As a first step towards eventual reunification, there must be a declaration of intent on the part of the British Government.  Mr. Wilson suggested this and he mentioned a period of 15 years although this is probably too long. We must start costing it out in a practical way, in economic, social and financial terms.  We must work out in detail how it can be done so long as there is a commitment by a British Government.  This is the only solution of the problem with which the two islands have lived since 1921.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged now that the Orange card was played as a part of <Col N="2522" /> British politics for many years&mdash;if we want to go back in history we will see that they started the violence&mdash;but that Orange card is no longer a valid card to play.  The ordinary people in Britain now elect their own representatives; no longer are there the hierarchal parties in Britian that existed when the Orange card was played.  The newspapers and the media in Britain are asking serious questions about British involvement in the perpetuation of this sectarian hell in the six north-eastern counties.</P>
    <P>I am not saying, as Deputy Kavanagh suggested, that the EEC is the solution of the Partition problem. However, within the framework of the European Community I can see this island evolving towards unity within a European unity.  In Europe we will have a greater political strength by reason of our representation in the European Parliament, in the Council of Ministers and in the European Commission. We will have a far greater strength <i>vis-à-vis</i> the British than we have at the present where we are isolated, where we are nobody's friend and where we do not have friends. These are the basic political facts of the situation and I should like to emphasise this aspect with regard to one matter which is current in my Department, namely, the matter of American landing rights in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are a small country and in this instance we are faced with a real exercise in muscle on the part of a very powerful Government who have in the New York landing rights an ace card to play.  They have played this card and have told us that after 18th August next we do not land or take off at New York airport.  This is an example of the type of world in which we live.  We are living in a different world from the world in which people fought for an independent Ireland in 1916 and 1922.  They struggled and rightly achieved an independent Ireland.  In many ways the old notions of living alone, the old notions of Sinn Féin, have to be adjusted, adapted and changed.  These are the facts of life.</P>

      <P>The one way in which we can achieve power and strength is by membership of the EEC, membership of the various institutions of the European Economic Community.  In that area we can influence decisions, and help decisions to be made in our favour and, in general, take our rightful place among the nations of the world.  We can get nowhere if we condemn ourselves to living in a ghetto on the fringe of Europe and think that three million people in this Republic can say to one-and-a-half million people in the other part of this island: &ldquo;We have a Constitution and a way of living different from yours and we do not want you.&rdquo; We do not want that.  We must say to them: &ldquo;We will have a Constitution that will meet you.  We want to have a community in which you can take part and, in addition, we want you to be with us with Britain and the other countries of Western Europe in a practical trading and economic bloc that makes sense to the Chinese and the Russians and the Americans today and, at the same time, links us to people with whom we have a cultural and spiritual affinity and people with whom we can join in the exercise of power in a Christian and European way.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Transport and Power is the first Minister who has referred in this debate to the situation in Northern Ireland.  I do not know if he is aware of the fact&mdash;I think most people are aware of it&mdash;that there is considerable apprehension in the country at the moment, that many people go in fear of their lives and that many people fear that law and order will break down or has broken down to a large extent here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a debate like this the major subject that should have been dealt with by the Government is the question of a united Ireland.  A kind of a hint has come from the Minister for Transport and Power that there is to be some sort of a political <i>détente.</i>  He has not clarified that.  His leader made no reference to it whatsoever.  In fact, the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party has twice seen the British Prime Minister. <Col N="2524" /> He has also met the leader of the British Opposition and so, I gather, have a great many Members of the Government.  To date we have had no indication of the political initiative that is to be taken in this House or by this Parliament, to settle the question which is of burning interest to everyone in the country whether they are extreme Republicans or constitutional nationalists.</P>
    <P>I am a constitutional nationalist and I have always been one.  I am not ashamed of that.  My views appear to be sanctified now by the Leader of the Minister's party.  The Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party has become a constitutional nationalist.  The definition of a constitutional nationalist is a person who believes in settling a difficult situation, be it surrounded by physical force or otherwise, by political negotiation. Let me say at the beginning that, if the Fianna Fáil Government want to settle this question, if they want to have the backing of the political forces, and if they want to have the legally elected representatives of the country behind them they cannot do it alone. Nobody is more cognisant of that fact than the British Government and all the Members of the British Parliament.</P>
    <P>There is no getting away from the fact that in every statement the Taoiseach makes in relation to a united Ireland, and in relation to the situation that is escalating daily in Northern Ireland, he is looking over his shoulder, uncertain of whether he has a united party behind him.  The same situation exists north of the Border in the so-called Stormont Government. Mr. Faulkner, the Prime Minister, is looking over his shoulder all the time wondering if he has the support of the people who sit behind him for anything he may do or endeavour to do.  Therefore, without beating around the bush, I think it is time for the Taoiseach to set up a national commission.</P>
    <P>By a national commission I mean a commission of all parties who are prepared to go and negotiate for a united Ireland and prepared to negotiate to try to get back to normalcy, to get away from the streets and the bombs and the Molotov cocktails, or whatever you like to call them, and bring the situation back into the political arena. <Col N="2525" /> The sooner the Taoiseach takes his courage in his hands and sets up such a commission and indicates to the British Parliament and the Northern Parliament that he is prepared to negotiate with them for a settlement the better.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk about the offer made by the leader of the Opposition in the British House of Commons.  I cannot see that it gets us anywhere.  It has done one thing for which Irish nationalists have been waiting for 50 years.  They were waiting for somebody in the British House of Commons to indicate that some day Partition will end.  They were waiting for some British Parliamentarian&mdash;and I presume this politician speaks for his own party&mdash;to indicate that some day Ireland must have the right to govern its territory, its seashore and all that belongs to Ireland as one island.  That has been indicated by the leader of the British Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Belonging to an old political family who had dealings with British Governments going back over a long number of years, I suppose I am always a little suspicious of British Parliamentarians. I happen to be rather suspicious in this case because the gentleman who made that statement&mdash;I think he suggested 15 years, and the terms were that we should go back into the Commonwealth again&mdash;is the leader of the Party who were responsible for passing an Act in the British House of Commons which perpetuated Partition.  Perhaps, as the French say, it is the <i>amende honorable</i> on the part of the leader of that Party now.  Anyway, it is something. It is a step forward that somebody recognises the fact that the monster which the British have created and which has remained unchanged for 50 years must be destroyed.  It is not a question of waiting 50 years for it to escalate.  I am old enough to remember that there was a physical force movement in full swing in the country which was ultimately responsible for securing for us such freedom as we enjoy at present.  Every ten years or so over these 50 years we have had a blow-out of some sort.  The British Government must accept the fact that <Col N="2526" /> they must destroy the monster they created themselves.</P>
    <P>The information may be incorrect but I understand that the situation is negotiable at the moment.  It is not only negotiable in the confines of the British Parliament but also in the Six Counties.  I understand that they have come to realise that it has gone beyond their control and that what unionism meant in the past is, if not a dead, a dying force.  Therefore, the Fianna Fáil Government have a terrific opportunity to open negotiations.  To open negotiations and to discuss the unification of Ireland they must have a united Parliament behind them.  I am absolutely certain that our party are willing to negotiate on political terms. We are willing to negotiate in an effort to settle this outstanding problem which is of so much importance to all of us.  The Taoiseach's remedy is to amend the Constitution.  In the name of God, does it mean that if we accept divorce and accept certain methods that are being suggested to bring us into alignment with what would be the political or, if you like, the religious thinking in Northern Ireland, we will create a united Ireland? That is only a red herring.</P>

      <P>I have thanked the Minister for being the one Fianna Fáil man who referred to Northern Ireland although he did not throw much light on the situation one way or the other.  I have no inside information with regard to the thinking within Fianna Fáil but we do know that everybody whether he be Unionist, constitutional nationalist, provisional IRA, official IRA or anything else is interested in the question of solving this problem but all we had from the Taoiseach was a statistical abstract with no reference to what is going on in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I say to the Taoiseach that he should take his courage in his hands and bring together the leaders of the different parties.  I cannot speak for the Labour Party but from their speeches I understand that they, like us, eschew physical force and that they <Col N="2527" /> do not wish to see parliament dragged down.</P>

      <P>I can say that for 40 years they have been making a strong contribution towards the maintaining in this country of constitutional authority.  The Taoiseach should set up a commission at once. Perhaps the best way of doing this is to form a commission of the leaders of the three parties who would be prepared to negotiate and discuss a united Ireland.  Of course there are problems involved as there is bitterness and sectarianism and as there is a hatred that is probably unrivalled in any part of the world today but the people who are responsible fundamentally for that are extremists, but, of course, those who are really responsible are the British because it was they who created this monster that pervades our society, be it north or south.  The sooner that the Government have the courage to do that, the better will be our chances of finding some solution to the future of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to accept the suggestion of the British Labour Party with regard to the troops remaining in the North for 15 years and of us re-entering the Commonwealth as a basis of negotiation, these suggestions are worth considering.  There is an old saying that unless one asks for more than he expects he will not get as much as he wants and in this case Mr. Wilson is asking for a lot.  Perhaps the leader of the Labour Party or the SDLP would use his influence with him and point out that in 15 years time there will not be any Ireland left to settle if the present situation continues and innocent people will have died in their thousands.  Therefore, I am suggesting to the Taoiseach that he approaches both sides and initiates discussions as soon as possible I do not know what other solution there is.  The present arrangement is turning largely into a slanging match on both sides as to who is responsible for most atrocities. Of course there are atrocities on both sides and where there are injustices there are bound to be atrocities.  There <Col N="2528" /> was injustice 50 years ago, as I remember so well.</P>
    <P>No matter what part of the world one goes to he will find that wherever there has been conflict, there was eventually a political solution.  The most recent example of this is East Pakistan where the conflict began because of injustice and ended in physical force, the physical force that was perpetrated by the Pakistanis.  Ultimately the Indian Army stepped in and abated it and it appears now that a political solution is imminent.  In his speech, the Minister for Transport and Power put forward a suggestion for a united Ireland.  His suggestion was that within the confines of the EEC we would achieve a united Ireland.  Certainly, membership of the EEC would help towards a united Ireland but it would not be sufficient to settle the grave sectarian problem and to get rid of the hatred and bitterness of the North.</P>
    <P>Deputy Thornley made a very interesting speech but he posed many questions without giving any answers to them.  One suggestion he put forward for a united Ireland was a socialist republic.  I can understand the sentiments of the Irish Labour Party in desiring a socialist republic but we must be reasonable in our thinking and we must realise that if the Labour Party cannot win a majority in the South, they have very little chance of winning the majority that will enable them to give us the socialist republic to which they refer.</P>

      <P>We have no alternative but to join the EEC.  Those who tell us that we should not join have never really given us any alternative. They have said that we should have an external association.  We would not get that because only an under-developed nation can have an external association. I take it that although we have had many years of Fianna Fáil Government we are not an underdeveloped nation in the accepted sense of the word.  We grow enough food in this country to enable us to eat so we have been saved being turned into an under-developed nation by the misrule of Fianna Fáil over the years.</P>
      <P>They say we could have an external trade agreement.  The basis of our economy is agriculture.  We are an agricultural country and we must acknowledge that fact.  Australia got a trade agreement with the British which ensured the sale of all their agricultural produce over a period of 15 years, which has now expired.  They were enabled, during that period, to build up industries to give practically full employment to their people and to have a big investment of money in the country.  I want to convey to those who think we should not go into the EEC that if we have a fundamentally sound agriculture here, which we will have, we will have an investment of money here and we will have the wherewithal to buy the raw materials and to start the industries.  The argument against the Common Market then is that our industries will be unable to survive. Why should they not survive unless we price ourselves out of everything by excessive wage demands and so on?  I see no reason why we should not survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told we should not join the EEC because it is economically unsound. We have relied for 50 years and more on the British economy.  We <Col N="2531" /> have tied ourselves, financially and otherwise, hand and foot to the British. Britain is not the powerful nation that she was.  She has not got her overseas territories and as a result she has not got the rich dividends pouring into her coffers.  She is unable to provide us with the wherewithal which she provided before.  Therefore, we must look for a wider market.  I would imagine that anybody concerned with the economics of this country would accept that simple fact.</P>
    <P>Whether Britain goes in or not, it is my personal view that it is in our interest to do so.  We can still do it and survive and we can still sell to Britain, even if we are in and she is out of the Common Market, our major export which is store cattle.  Only the other day the head of the agricultural section of the EEC said that even if Ireland and Britain were both members of the EEC we still would have a large store trade with Britain.  I go further than that and say that even if Britain is not in the Common Market we will still have the store trade with her because nobody in the world will be able to provide store cattle for her except ourselves.</P>
    <P>One could speak about the EEC all night.  I do not propose to detain the House any longer.  I hope that when the Taoiseach replies he will clarify the position of the Government in relation to the disturbances in Northern Ireland and give some indication of their policy and some assurance to the people that instead of waiting and letting the days drift by with nothing happening there is some definite political move on foot associated, as it must be, with all political parties to end something that none of us really want.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal briefly with the principal question before the House in this debate&mdash;the relationship between Irish men and women south of the Border and our fellow Irish men and women in Northern Ireland and our mutual relationship with Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might feel that one should flounder in a welter of despair because we as a people have not been able to bring about national unity.  This has been the historic failure of Irish people. The assistance we have received from <Col N="2532" /> Britain, British politicians and successive British administrations down through the decades, has not succeeded in breaking that deadlock.  So many criticisms have been expressed over the past 12 months of the Labour Party attitude and so frequently have we been pilloried for a variety of attitudes, for example, the cheap sneer of Deputy Colley who accuses us of being anti-national, whatever that might mean, that it is necessary to restate the fundamental political objectives of this, the oldest political party in this country, a political party which has made an historic contribution to the emergence of parliamentary democracy in this country and a party which prides itself on having had a relationship with political parties in Northern Ireland over the decades.</P>
    <P>National unity, the unity of all the people of this country in one parliament one day with one common set of laws, with a common sense of national identity and purpose&mdash;this is the basic objective of the Labour Party.  Our aim, therefore, is not merely to have territorial unity or, indeed, a unity of our people north and south, much as we see that as the first objective.  We also want to have a particular kind of society.  It has been said that we want a socialist kind of society. This, I think, would be partly true It has been said that we want a republican kind of society.  This would be equally partly true.  However, 200 men and women have died in the North.  They killed each other, were killed by British troops or were what the Provisionals call &ldquo;accidents of war&rdquo;.  When we look at that list we feel that an all-Ireland socialist republic, which is our objective, is something that is very much in the distant future.  We must state it because it is a fundamental objective of the Labour Party.  I have always held this view ever since my father told me anything about politics.  My father was a founder member of Fianna Fáil.  For many years he was a member of that party.  He resigned when he became a national executive member of the union of which I am a member, the Transport Union, and when he found that party drifting away from what he regarded as the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2533" /> My father always impressed on me that the distinguishing feature between the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil, in particular, was that the Government party obsessively regarded itself as the party which would bring about territorial unity while we in the Labour Party go very much further than that; we aim at uniting the Irish people, first of all, with a set of complementary aims and objectives, North and South, not merely by removing the ditches along the Border or by filling in the craters on the roads and then taking away the customs posts and then saying that we have achieved national unity.  This is and always has been the concept of national unity of Fianna Fáil.  It is a very limited circumscribed concept.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has always been distinguished from other forces of political evolution in the country and in many respects from other parties in the House in that we regard ourselves as a democratic party, not only socialist but socialist democratic, totally committed, I would stress, to democratic means.  It is rather important to stress this in Dáil Éireann.  As a political party we reject and repudiate and will oppose by every means in our power any attempt at usurping by violence the democratic parliamentary processes of this State which are based on the authority of the Irish people.  As a political party we certainly will not have any hand, act or part in any proposals which would be classified as slightly constitutional, in the historic Fianna Fáil sense, or in the quasiviolent approach of, for example, many sections of the IRA.  In simple terms, we, as a political party, do not propose to have at our backs a small private army or a large one for that matter.  We stand by the authority of the Irish people.  Whether we increase or decrease our electoral support by virtue of standing by that fundamental principle of society, we will accept the decision of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>We have one other distinguishing feature as a political party, in sharing the objectives of all Irish people that this island should be one nation and, as is being repeatedly pointed out by the Leader of the Labour Party, <Col N="2534" /> Deputy Corish, should be one State, to use a phrase&mdash;the correct phrase&mdash; used.  But we say that political adherence to that objective of national unity does not, and never will, give any Irishman, North or South, in Cork, Kerry, the midlands, on the Border or over the Border, licence to assassinate in cold blood a fellow Irishman who does not accept or support the national objective of national unity.</P>
    <P>This is repetitive but there are so many apologists for violence in our State, there is such superficiality in a great deal of thinking in Ireland in relation to violence, that it is necessary to state this.  Of course, those who are furthest removed from the violence are the most superficial.  There is a great deal of pub analysis, a great deal of dinner party analysis, a great deal of superficial political analysis by people engaged and involved in politics of the question of violence.</P>
    <P>In the name of a common loyalty and having a sense of Christian respect for fellow Irishmen, we condemn the use of violence one to another in convincing one another of the need for national unity.  It is in that setting that we condemn and repudiate and detest those who organised and perpetrated the political murder of Senator John Barnhill.  We say that in the Republic. Some people would ask, on the one hand, you condemn the murder of Senator Barnhill but what about the young boy who was shot, do you condemn that shooting also?  That would be to fall into the trap of comparing life with life.  That is not the issue.  The life of every single Irishman is sacred. I am shocked, appalled and dismayed at the number of Irish men and women who profess to be Christians who glibly say, &ldquo;It is war.  It is violence.  Men lose their lives.  You cannot be terribly discriminating&rdquo;.  I do not want to engage in a slot machine type of reciprocal condemnation.  I would be prepared to condemn the killing of any person whether that person is an innocent child in a pram outside a furniture store, or a youth playing on a football pitch, or a Senator at the end of his days.  I am appalled at the callousness; I am shocked by it I have met it in the streets of Dublin People say, &ldquo;He was an old man&rdquo;.  As a <Col N="2535" /> Christian, what reply can one make to that?</P>
    <P>My father was a Member of the Seanad for four years.  Are we now to have Mr. Cathal Goulding or Mr. Mac Stiofáin putting him on their reprisal list?  My father is only 76 years of age. I would imagine that he is expendable in their concept of political extermination. My father fought for the freedom of this country and is very proud of the fact.  If he were to disagree with their concept of the political future of the country, I would rather imagine his age would not be any barrier.</P>
    <P>There is a callous mentality displayed in the casual acceptance of violence. I suppose one does become hardened, just as the American soldier 30,000 feet up who presses a button and destroys two or three square miles on which human being live in Vietnam becomes inevitably hardened.  Violence becomes the norm.</P>
    <P>Many people have asked why we are talking about the murder of British troops.  They have been murdered.  They ask: &ldquo;Why are you always talking about the murder of Unionists?  Why do you condemn that and you do not condemn or kick up a holy hell about Catholics shot by British troops?&rdquo;  I do not think that kind of selectivity of death condemnation gets us anywhere. The fact is that those people are all dead, tragically, and they cannot make any contribution towards the unity of this country by their deaths.  This is total human waste of potential, of families, of children, of human lives, in the pursuit of a national objective which by their deaths recedes further and further on the horizon.</P>
    <P>In the Labour Party we predicted this would happen.  It is cold and bitter consolation to the Irish Labour Party that we did so, that we predicted a drift towards sectarian civil war. We get no thanks for it.  We have been accused, in predicting this, of adopting a weak attitude.  We have been accused of being anti-national.  We have had the sneers of Deputy Colley from his eminence of power hoping to hop into the seat of the Taoiseach. He tried to couple the names of Deputy Cruise-O'Brien and Deputy FitzGerald in Dublin South East.  He <Col N="2536" /> was of course, playing politics.</P>
    <P>We have rejected the policy of the gun and the bomb, the policy of assassination.  We have denounced that approach to political action.  Our attitude towards the British Army is well known.  One would want to be a peculiar Irishman not to deplore and not to condemn their appalling tactics as well as the tactics of some Unionists, some like John Taylor who, I hate to say, is one of the most hated men in the Republic and, I am sorry to say, probably one of the most popular men in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is the great divide, the great problem facing the country.  Because we have tried to influence the political area within our sphere of influence, and that is the Republic&mdash;we do not own the British Army or issue orders to the Orange groups or to the RUC and we do not run the British Government&mdash;we have been condemned.  We, the Irish Labour Party, have had our influence felt within the British Labour Party.  There have been most unfair, stupid accusations which prejudiced people usually make.  Accusations like these are the favourite trap which most people with prejudiced opinions fall into.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, Deputies Hillery and Colley are still rather ambivalent in practice, yet still rather selective in many of their actions and condemnations of violence.  There have been many manifestations of this.  There has been the selective condemnations of the IRA.  There has been very careful selectivity in the condemnation of British policy.  One gets the impression that the Fianna Fáil attitude is one of hoping to God that things will blow over and that they will get on with the game of power&mdash;it is a question of power&mdash;and that on that basis the best thing to do is to have a foot in all camps.</P>
    <P>I am particularly proud to say that the general attitude of the Labour Party has been one of consistency, of seeking a voluntary reunion of our people.  We make no apology to anybody for that&mdash;for making appeals to sectarian elements for an end to violence.  We hope this will have effect in a great many instances.  As a political <Col N="2537" /> party we have tried to bring pressures on labour trade union opinion in Britain with which we have direct contact and where we can have direct influence.  Of course, we do not have the slightest influence on the Tories in Britain any more than does the Taoiseach. He did not exert influence in his successive meetings with Mr. Ted Health.  He was notably unsuccessful at the Chequers conference.  We have tried to bring home to the British Labour Party and to the trade union movement there that only the British Government can remedy the situation in Northern Ireland and that there is a grave responsibility on the British Government to start the process of finding a way in which the two communities there can live together in peace.</P>
    <P>We know that many people will place obstacles in the way of action by the British Government&mdash;there are many people, north and south, who will try deliberately to sabotage efforts to end the problems of Northern Ireland. The Provisionals do not want a political solution.  They want a civil war in Northern Ireland and the quicker and the bloodier the better. They believe that out of that civil war will come peace on their terms and on their terms alone.  If that goes askew they do not at all object to transferring the civil war to the Republic. They would not be unsympathetic to that approach.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is no doubt whatever that while the responsibility lies on the British Government to break the deadlock in Northern Ireland the Provisionals will try to scuttle it.  The Officials equally will try to scuttle it. They would try to scuttle any general approach by the British Government. The Fianna Fáil Party will always try to be careful about being in on the act if they can get political kudos out of it.  In the process, if they are not careful, they, too, could scuttle the general concept.  We are not in a happy situation.  The extreme Orange bigots in Northern Ireland and many members of Mr. Faulkner's Cabinet, notably Mr. John Taylor, would valiantly attempt to destroy any effort <Col N="2538" /> by the British Government to bring about a political solution.</P>
    <P>The British Government, particularly a Tory Government&mdash;knowing the total insensitivity, incompetence and the chequered record of previous British Governments on matters of this kind and their total failure to grasp the real issues involved&mdash;are in great danger of continuing to underestimate the problem grossly.  The Provisionals do not want a settlement.  The more internment we have in Northern Ireland the happier they are and the more prospects of internment there are in the Republic the happier are the Provisionals.  The British Government may propose half-measures which will not result in any solution or they may propose solutions which of themselves will be unproductive.  The most counter-productive solution to date has been the cratering of the Border roads. This was a provocative and stupid measure.  It was designed largely for confrontation purposes and that has rightly been rejected by every responsible public representative, North and South.</P>
    <P>The principal efforts of the Members of this House must be directed towards directing the British Government into a realisation of the problems of Northern Ireland and how radical they will have to be to find a solution.  We have not been very successful to date. I do not believe that the Taoiseach has succeeded in conveying to the British Government the basic essentials of the problem.  The Taoiseach has returned each time with the word &ldquo;unity&rdquo; driven into his mind, and any little straw in the wind or any Press statement which contains the words &ldquo;national unity&rdquo;, which might bring comfort to the Fianna Fáil grassroots, is seized upon as a glorious development. The Fianna Fáil Party practically clasped Dr. Ian Paisley to their bosom.  Deputy Colley nearly discovered the republicanism of Ian Paisley while Dr. Paisley went to the nearest newspaper office with a press statement &ldquo;conning&rdquo; the synthetic Republicans down here with his version of a new Constitution.  Paisley is a very adroit politician in terms of timing.  He had a good master in that regard in Brian Faulkner who totally upstaged <Col N="2539" /> the Taoiseach at Chequers when he almost put him into total oblivion.</P>
    <P>We should not underestimate the capacity of Mr. Faulkner to upstage the Taoiseach.  The function of all parties in Dáil Éireann is to convince the British Government to take the correct radical initiatives in relation to Stormont and in relation to the security situation in the North.  We have failed to do this so far.  We have indulged in long-range rhetoric, such as Deputy Dr. Hillery discovering the semantic meaning of the word &ldquo;lunacy&rdquo; and putting his own interpretations on British policy and then clapping himself on the back wondering how brave he was to say a few naughty things to the British Cabinet.  This is the kind of impact which we make on British opinion.  It is neither productive nor conducive to a solution.</P>
    <P>The first essential of any solution in the North must be that it reassures both communities in Northern Ireland about their basic rights and gives them a real sense of sharing in the making of decisions in Northern Ireland.  This essential has not been accepted yet by the British Government. It has not been accepted by the Unionist regime.  It has not been advanced in any detail or in any meaningful manner by the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach asks the British to give him something about the 1949 Act or to tell him that they will have another look at the 1921 Act.  He asks them to mention the word &ldquo;unity&rdquo; in the Press release and to let him go home and have a general election.  He tells them that he will come back for another chat after such an election. This is his rather inept approach to the situation in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have to come back to the implications involved in reassuring both communities in Northern Ireland about their fundamental democratic rights. The first reassurance must be that the reforms of 1968-69 will be carried out to the letter of the law and in full in Northern Ireland.  There must be full, written guarantees in Northern Ireland that the reforms will not be eroded or dropped or modified in future.  This is the essential basis of a negotiated settlement <Col N="2540" /> in Northern Ireland.  A guaranteed role in government for the minority in Northern Ireland is also involved, and not just the setting-up of extra Parliamentary committees there.  The allocation of a few more seats in the Senate or merely increasing the number of seats at Stormont will not suffice.  In the future in administration and executive authority in Northern Ireland the minority constitutionally must have a guaranteed role in government, representing themselves and having their own share of power.</P>
    <P>These are repetitive propositions in this House.  Everybody has become obsessed with watching the tragedy unfolding in Northern Ireland.  We have become obsessed with the daily bombings, shootings and political assassinations and the daily round-up by the British troops and their terrorist tactics. It does not matter whether the troops were unemployed people in Lancashire or not.  They are now employed in the British Army as soldiers.  A great deal of what they are doing is not acceptable to the Irish people in the North or in the South.</P>
    <P>The minority in Northern Ireland must be given essential, basic guarantees. Slowly but surely this is happening. It is about time that Mr. Maudling, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Heath and all the political leaders, North and South, began considering a peaceful solution. The Labour Party spokesman has been advocating this kind of peaceful solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Labour Party spokesman is unduly preoccupied with what Mr. Heath says. He is concerned with what the Labour Party and the trade union movement in Britain say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party are obsessed with the activities of the British troops on the Border.  This is about the most comfortable obsession one can have unless one is living in that vicinity.  As far as the northern majority are concerned, the basic requirement is the guarantee that they will not be handed over or forced into unconditional surrender to a State which in its present <Col N="2541" /> form they regard as an illiberal State, as a State dominated by sectarianism. In the British-Irish-Stormont-Unionist negotiations we must guarantee the rights and liberties the Northern Ireland majority expect.</P>
    <P>The Northern Ireland majority at present have a guarantee of security from the British Army who are doing a pretty rough job on their behalf.  The people there wish it that way.  They approve of what the British Army is doing.  We want to see the British troops phased out.  However, if they are going to be phased out, as they must be phased out, we cannot have a northern majority in a political vacuum.  We must ensure that both groups get this guarantee of peace and security in a united country.</P>
    <P>I do not think this kind of solution is impossible.  There are far too many Deputies here who have reached the stage where they cannot even talk about these solutions.  All they have ever talked about is the gun, of a coercive solution, the solution of, as I have repeatedly said here, six divisions, six days and we have six counties. For half a century that solution has not worked and politicians in the Republic have not bothered to exercise their imaginations on a possible solution.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the solution I have advocated and which the Labour Party have advocated will be unacceptable to some existing politicians both in Northern Ireland and in the Republic.  The guaranteeing of minority rights in Northern Ireland is as unacceptable to Mr. Brian Faulkner as the guaranteeing of minority rights in the Republic in regard to education is unacceptable to the Minister for Education, Deputy Pádraig Faulkner. We have on each side of the Border a man who oddly enough I would not regard as being sectarian.  Neither Deputy Pádraig Faulkner nor Mr. Brian Faulkner is sectarian, but both of them have been reared in a particular cultural and religious environment, in a particular tradition and in a particular ignorance, which is the most dangerous thing of all.  Therefore, their actions are sectarian.  This was the most tragic thing to be noticed today on the community schools debate.  For <Col N="2542" /> a solid 40 minutes we could not get it through to the Minister for Education that what he was saying about the control of community schools amounted to sectarianism, bigotry and exclusivity. We failed to get through to him, just as we would fail to get through to Mr. Brian Faulkner in Northern Ireland, the idea that those who would want a united Ireland and who would want a share in the running of Northern Ireland are worthy of Cabinet rank.  That is why a bigot like Brian Faulkner would say: &ldquo;Anybody who believes in a united Ireland cannot be in my Cabinet.&rdquo;  That is why a bigot, an ignorant bigot like Deputy Pádraig Faulkner, the Minister for Education, would say: &ldquo;No Protestant can be on the board of management of a community school in the Republic.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Personally I like the Minister for Education.  He is a fine type of person, but he is the product of Irish society and it is tragic that he should be in such a sensitive position at this time in our history.  I mean it only in that sense, with no intention of attacking anyone here.  The twin essentials I have advocated, of guaranteeing to the minority in Northern Ireland a constitutional role in decision-making and guaranteeing to the majority in <Col N="2543" /> Northern Ireland that they will not be coerced into the Republic will be very vehemently opposed by politicians in the North as well as in the South and will be equally opposed by some churchmen, North and South.  The churches, North and South, cannot shrug off their responsibility in regard to the current situation.  This is not just a sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland or a political conflict in Northern Ireland.  It is both sectarian and political and I do not care whether sectarian is put before or after political.  It is time Mr. Maudling got up off his indolent British backside, did a bit of work in Northern Ireland, came over a little more often and consulted a bit more with the elected public representatives in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I suppose, having callied it that, it settles the problem for Fianna Fáil.  The name of the game is what you call the country.  That solves the problem <i>á la</i> Fianna Fáil. Of course, we are still left with the problem.  I suggest that there now devolves on the politicians, north and south, to negotiate with the British Government on the outline of approach that I have suggested and if we manage to do that there will follow from it much greater co-operation, north and south, between the two administrations. When political normality arrives in Northern Ireland in the very distant future and when the normal democratic processes begin to operate in Northern Ireland we should then have the right to set up inter-parliamentary relationships north and south, joint consultations between politicians north and south in respect of a whole range of legislation, the future trading relationships of this island within the Common Market and the urgent need to have mutual joint regional development along the whole border area in Northern Ireland.  These are obvious areas of joint consultation.</P>

      <P>It was happening to the credit of the late Seán Lemass who, <Col N="2545" /> in many ways, thought ahead of his time.  He sowed many seeds but of course there are many people in Fianna Fáil and outside it who did not particularly welcome that approach.  This is the tragedy of the situation.  Of course, there were more in the North than in the South who did not want it to develop on that basis.  If normal relationships can be restored between both parts of the country and if the obstacles, which I have outlined, can be overcome I have not the slightest doubt that there will eventually be national reunion in this country.  I regard this as an aspiration to be achieved.  When one mentions the word aspiration every Fianna Fáil hack interpreter of words rushes in and says: &ldquo;This is a diminution of your wish for a united Ireland.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>At times it would not be too hard for the democratic parliamentary processes of this State to be usurped such is the level of contribution that comes from this House. It could be taken over before many Deputies would know what happened. It is necessary that we seek assurance that we will resist any attempt at usurping the democratic parliamentary processes.  As an Irishman, I have no desire to see the security forces of this State humiliated in the way in which they have been humiliated in recent months.  I have no desire to see the security forces placed in a position in which they must acquiesce in a total lack of clarity of Government approach.  Now, if one is honest in politics, one is inevitably misinterpreted.  I do not stand for internment without trial but, while I am a Member of this House, I will not hand over to any outside organisation the running of our parliamentary processes.  If the electorate decide they want someone else, then there is always the ballot box to bring about a change of political representation.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party would like to place on record its solidarity and its desire to see strengthened the trade union movement North and South.  The common loyalty of Belfast and Dublin workers and of Derry and Cork workers, such as it is at the moment, is, indeed, very fragile, very tenuous, and has, in my opinion, suffered some weakening.  I am sure all would approve the concept of promoting the solidarity of Irish workers North and South for social, industrial, economic and other objectives.  There is, I think, a lesson to be learned by this House.  The historic unity of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions as of now is still intact. We want to see it remain intact and no person worthy of the name of trade unionist should try to destroy that essential solidarity North and South.  It is part of the future building-up of a united Ireland and we want to have that framework retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, in the Labour Party, accept the philosophy of Connolly, who came to us from Belfast, and Larkin, who likewise <Col N="2547" /> came to us from Belfast.  Both made a tremendous contribution to our independence.  They preached the unity of the working class, Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter, on both sides of the Border.  It is with these the future unity of our country lies, a voluntary unity of all the people.  It implies very clearly that the real differences that exist must be removed by dialogue and by the preservation of communication. These differences will not be removed by land mines, by cratering roads along the Border, by booby traps, by political assassinations, by ambushes of workers going to work or troops moving from one area to another.  This is not the solution.  This, I know, will all be misinterpreted, but the Labour Party places its reliance on peaceful means and the repudiation of violence.  That, however, is not to be taken as acquiescence by the Labour Party in the treatment meted out to the minority or to the political division of our country.  On the contrary, as socialists, we have always opposed implacably institutionalised violence, such as that practised by the Unionist Government, and the denial of civil and political rights of the minority.  We have certainly put this on record and we resent bitterly those who read just what they want to read, interpret what they want to interpret, and selectively pick holes in statements by Labour Party spokesmen.</P>
    <P>We have demanded the ending of internment without trial.  We have said this <i>ad nauseam.</i>  The Minister for Foreign Affairs asked how often do we have to tell the British? How often have we told the British with very little result?  There are those in the Fianna Fáil Party who say the Labour Party did not say it often enough.  Unless we hire a fleet of jet planes and dot the sky with our opposition to internment I do not know how we can get it across that we are against internment without trial.  I have been in London.  There we met the executive of the Labour Party and we told them of our total opposition to internment without trial.  We have called on the British Labour Party for support in this.  They may well be the next Government and we have called on them to support our <Col N="2548" /> objectives.  We have also called for a full investigation into the adequately documented allegations of British Army brutality.</P>
    <P>It is a sobering thought that the brutality and the torture have not been confined exclusively to the British Army.  It is not unknown in the Special Branch of the RUC who are Irishmen all.  They have earned a dirty reputation. The evidence is fully documented by the SDLP.  It is sobering to think of what some Irishmen can do to one another when they want to impose their will or extract information.  We have also called for the withdrawal of British troops.  We have added the proviso, and even the Provisionals are adding the proviso now, that as soon as conditions improve and public safety is assured we want the withdrawal of the British troops from Northern Ireland. We have not called, and I personally have not called, for the direct total abolition of Stormont.  I think this would be a mistake.  We have not done that kind of exercise because we believe firmly that Stormont, with all its manifest failings, all its injustices, all its ineffectiveness, is nevertheless a step towards national unity and a step towards the ending of sectarian manipulation of power in Northern Ireland on which the Unionist regime has rested a great deal of its approach.</P>
    <P>There is one final point I would make in this regard, and it is that I feel strongly that the Taoiseach should not advocate courses of action which are counter-productive, which in fact will not bring an easing of the situation and, by and large, will not make an effective contribution to the solution of the problem.  One of the propositions put forward <i>ad nauseam</i> by the Taoiseach is the bringing in of United Nations troops.  I think it is about time that proposition was dropped.  Where one has a situation in which almost 30,000 men are engaged in a security operation, so-called, in Northern Irelad, where the Border is crossed by thousands of people each day in both directions, where the Border is a very open border, even at the height of security and even where several hundreds of Irish troops and police on this side help to patrol it.  I strongly doubt&mdash;and I do not think the Taoiseach <Col N="2549" /> should advocate it&mdash;if the bringing of United Nations border patrols or observation patrols into the Border areas would make any contribution towards solving the real problems of Northern Ireland and the real problems of effecting a political solution in that part of this country.</P>
    <P>By harping on it in the manner in which the Taoiseach has harped on it and in being repeatedly repudiated and rejected by the British Government and by the Northern regime, showing that this is not on, and then to keep at it hurts the credibility of the Government, such as remains of it, and above all, hurts the normal pride and wishes of all parties to bring about a solution.  I would strongly question the effectiveness of 20 or 30 Swedes or Finns, augmented by a couple of platoons of troops from Western Europe, moving about the Border and trying desperately to find it on many of their maps, and with the language problem, I am afraid it would be a source of considerable amusement to the cartoonists of the national newspapers, North and South, and indeed a source of eternal amusement to the population in the immediate vicinity of the Border.  Therefore, propositions which are unrealistic and which have no real prospect of acceptance should not be put forward by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>These, then, are my views.  I feel at the end of the year, when everybody is so depressed, particularly about the role of Dáil Éireann, the major responsibility for the depression must rest with the current Cabinet.  I have always doubted the capacity of the current Cabinet to get to grips with the problems of Northern Ireland.  The Cabinet is scared out of its wits in case it might have any honest clash of opinion within it in relation to Northern Ireland policy.  This is very evident from the undertones of the approach of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the approach of the Taoiseach himself.  The collective competence of the Cabinet is now open to question on the premise of even knowing very much about the North.</P>
    <P>If one looked, as I did this afternoon, along the line of the Cabinet <Col N="2550" /> benches and asked them &ldquo;When were you ever in Northern Ireland?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hands up all those who crossed the Border in the past two years before you were ever made a Minister of State; hands up those who ever were in Derry or Newry or Warrenpoint or up in Coalisland and hands up those who will even this year send a Christmas card to friends in Northern Ireland&rdquo;, I think that on the Fianna Fáil benches one could count them on the fingers of one hand.  Yet there is massive personal confidence in the ability of the Government to handle the situation in Northern Ireland.  So far as I am concerned, if I were on an interview board as a trade union official, in the case of at least half the Cabinet, on any race relations job, I would not employ them at £1,500 a year, never mind at £6,000 odd of the taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>That is a harsh comment, but it is merited in terms of political performance and merited in terms of Fianna Fáil internal performance.  The tragedy is that while the Taoiseach merely goes through the motions of surviving &mdash;personal political survival&mdash;this country is in urgent need of massive changes in social and industrial legislation. In a situation where we have an hours of work Bill urgently needed, the official hours in this country are still 48 hours a week by statute; in a situation where the Cabinet should be drawing up an equal pay Bill&mdash;they have had the Commission's interim report before them since last September&mdash;they have not yet reached it at Cabinet level; in a situation where you have a Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, still in operation which the Government have not even sat down and amended; in a situation where the Government should be bringing in social and industrial legislation in relation to the extension of joint consultation in our State-sponsored bodies; in a situation where the Government should be implementing even a couple of paragraphs of the costly Devlin Report; in a situation where one could list right across the board the innovations of a legislative nature which have not been brought in, the Government, in sheer bemusement and transfixed over the problems of Northern <Col N="2551" /> Ireland and their incapacity to deal with them, have failed to deal with these urgent problems.</P>
    <P>I remember on &ldquo;The Politicians&rdquo; programme the other evening, I made the comment that we needed a comprehensive national social security system in legislation whereby one would have income-related benefits and wage-related contributions.  This passed over the head of the Minister for Labour and Social Welfare as though the proposition just did not exist.  This is the kind of country we are living in, a country in which I get a letter from a classmate down in Cork who was working in a woollen mill which has gone into voluntary liquidation and who says that his wages are over £1,600 a year&mdash;he is a constituent of Deputy Barry's and is living in a suburban house and, earning £1,750, is over that income limit&mdash;in a textile plant.  He is now redundant.  He has sold his car, is selling his house and has to emigrate.  He is on the way out simply because he did not qualify for redundancy compensation as he was over the insurable limit, and when this can be the fate of any one industrial worker, simply because the Government raised the social insurance level for 750,000 workers from £1,200 to £1,600, never did anything else, never introduced social insurance for all wage and salary earners, we can find ourselves with many redundant workers of the middle income group who will be on the side of the street with no benefits open to them.</P>
    <P>These are the serious social and political problems within the Republic which have been and are ignored. When I see Dr. Scully's publication now about farm income in the west of Ireland and general income in that region and look through the plethora of publications relating to agriculture &mdash;for example the recent one concerning State expenditure on agriculture&mdash; containing substantial recommendations on the whole fabric of the Irish economy, I do not think we on this side of the House can be held responsible for the despair and depression many Deputies feel.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I feel strongly that the country needs an alternative Government. <Col N="2552" /> I know the Irish people want it. I know they are sick and tired of the political spectacle of so-called men in this House who were arrested, dragged through the courts, pilloried by the Taoiseach and publicly crucified by him and yet, as men, they marched through the Lobbies and voted in support of him and accepted total personal humiliation, one might even say degradation, as politicians simply to stay in power and simply so that their political party stay in power.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the disenchantment and increasing disillusionment of the people with Irish politicians, both North and South, has grown because Brian Faulkner has failed to give leadership in Northern Ireland and the Taoiseach has failed to give leadership in the Republic.  The people of both areas have been floundering about waiting for political leadership, have not got it and will not get it from Ted Heath or Mr. Maudling because the politicians in power in the North are so obsessed with the exercise of power that Mr. Faulkner has his legs wrapped round that chair in Stormont and will not let go for God, for charity, for the British Army or the IRA.  The Taoiseach has his legs wrapped round the Fianna Fáil chair of government and he will not let go either if only for sheer pride and stubbornness, the only quality he now has for which I respect him in taking on a section of his own party.</P>
    <P>But that is not good enough in terms of leading the country: it is not good enough to run a country on a reserve of personal political stamina and that is all the Taoiseach is using at the moment.  He has lost any sense of Cabinet innovation, of giving leadership. Rather than giving leadership he reacts to events in the country.  That at the end of 1971 is not something that we want to live with.  It is something that I personally from the Opposition benches do not want to see continue in the national interest.  I, therefore, urge the electorate to replace this Government very soon.  I am convinced that there is enough collective intelligence and ability and, above all, honesty and integrity on the Opposition Benches to form an effective political administration which will <Col N="2553" /> take the initiatives so urgently required in the national interest, irrespective of personal or party political kudos.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to say something about the crime position that has been mentioned by a number of Deputies.  It is a fact that the increase in the incidence of crime in this country in recent years is matched by corresponding or greater increases in other countries even though most of them for very many years have had a substantially higher rate of crime so that, starting from a much lower base so to speak, a higher percentage increase might have been expected here.  Likewise, the detection rate here, while unfortunately it has fallen, still compares very well with that in other countries in which urban populations are growing.  I think it relevant to make this reference, even if only in passing, to the position in other countries because in view of the highly developed communications which exist now between all parts of the globe it is unrealistic to suppose that we can escape the impact of what is happening all around us.  I think we must accept that, despite our best endeavours and intentions, it is almost inevitable that the crime rate here will tend to become higher than we have been accustomed to in past years.</P>
      <P>To say this, is not to be complacent about the present situation&mdash;quite the opposite.  I want to make clear that I fully accept that we must make every effort to curb, and if possible, reverse the upward trend in crime which has been manifesting itself in recent years. The fact is that we have been taking, and will continue to take positive steps to strengthen the effectiveness of the Garda in dealing with crime.  I have arranged for the recruitment of an extra 400 gardaí this year and next year over and above the replacement of normal wastage.  Over 100 of these have already taken up duty and by next month the full 200 provided for this financial year will have done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has already been said here that an increase of this order is inadequate.  I must emphasise that to speak of an increase of 400 men as if that were the whole story would be very misleading <Col N="2554" /> as to what, in fact, is being done.  In addition to the increase of 400, which is the first ever increase in the strength of the Force, there is the fact that female clerical assistants are taking over routine office work from the Garda.  Up to last month 68 had been recruited and the immediate target which I am very hopeful we shall reach is the recruitment of 150 of these clerical assistants by the end of March.</P>
    <P>I should like to make clear that generally speaking the recruitment of female clerical assistants means in practice not the release of just one garda on to the beat but a fair bit more than that because a trained typist can do the amount of work that would previously have been done by gardaí unsuited to clerical work, much more quickly and efficiently.  Furthermore, parking controls in the cities are more and more being exercised by wardens thus relieving a substantial number of gardaí for other work.  I should like to see local authorities throughout the country exercise more freely and more rapidly their powers to appoint traffic wardens&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to enable the Garda to concentrate on matters which are more strictly police duties than the regulations on minor aspects of traffic law such as parking.  I like to think that the development of the warden system signifies a gradual development of separate enforcement of the less serious aspects of traffic laws by people other than the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimate for the purchase of vehicles for the Garda fleet this year is almost twice what it was last year. I intend to push ahead from year to year with the strengthening of the fleet. In addition, work is in progress on a new Garda communication system for Dublin and on a national radio network. I have no doubt that the benefits of the new system will be far-reaching. With regard to the national network, it became clear that the permanent system which is being planned would take several years to complete and I could not accept a time-scale of that order.  A special temporary project has been initiated to give reasonable coverage <Col N="2555" /> over the entire country until the permanent network is in operation some years ahead.  This temporary system is expected to be in operation within the next six months.</P>
    <P>With regard to organisation, the Garda are adapting their methods of crime detection to meet current problems. One recent measure that I consider to be of significance is the creation in Dublin of a special Garda task force, consisting of a superintendent and 26 other ranks.  This task force has already proved itself to be a useful weapon in the fight against crime and I hope that further similar untis will be created in the future and I hope will be in urban centres outside of Dublin also.</P>
    <P>The Government's determination to see effective action taken against the illegal possession of firearms is reflected in the enactment of the Firearms Act, 1971.  Among other things, this increased considerably the maximum penalties for the unlawful possession of military type firearms and ammunition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the subject of explosives, may I repeat that more than half of all the explosives that are used commercially in the North are manufactured here.  It follows that if explosives are stolen in the North it is more likely than not that they will <Col N="2557" /> have been manufactured here.  In these circumstances, the point so repeatedly made by Unionist spokesmen in relation to the origin of explosives used unlawfully there has no validity whatever. Of course, it serves a valuable propaganda purpose from their point of view and that is why it is used.</P>
      <P>I want to reiterate once again in this debate that the Government are firmly committed to take every possible action under the law against subversive elements that seek to achieve political objectives by violent means.  Time and again from my earliest days in office I have made it clear that the law will be enforced to the fullest extent that is possible against persons who engage in unlawful activities of this kind.  Illegal organisations, as we know them, are unworthy of the support of right-thinking persons.  They have been given no mandate to act on behalf of any section of our people in any part of our country and have no right to claim that they have one.  They are utterly undemocratic and they represent nobody but themselves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was saying that some Deputies who may not be aware of the law, may believe that some allegations which they make may be true, but there are other Deputies who are familiar with the rules of evidence and with related aspects of our law, and I am faced with the choice of concluding that, when they come in here, they forget what they know outside, or, alternatively, they take the view that they are entitled to look on this whole problem as a legitimate political game.  It is, I suggest, too serious a matter to be a subject for political expediency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One way or the other I think the time has come for me to spell out the matter in plain terms for the benefit of members of the public and for the benefit of such Deputies as are willing to listen.  Unfortunately, in a matter of this kind I cannot give the sort of detail that, in many ways, one would wish to give to make the position clear, <Col N="2561" /> because that would be, as it were, of assistance to those one would wish to prosecute.  Within these very definite limitations I will endeavour, in some small way, to give some examples of the sort of problems we face from the legal point of view.</P>
    <P>I could almost sum it up in advance by saying that the position in a nutshell is that, if we are to get convictions in relation to certain activities of illegal organisations, we will need a very substantial change in the criminal law of this country and in particular in the rules of evidence.  The question Members of this House must ask themselves, if they are sincere about this problem, is whether they would be prepared to support the sort of changes which would, in fact, be necessary to bring about convictions in all the types of cases in which I and the Government, and I would say nearly every Deputy in the House, would like to see convictions.</P>
    <P>However, before I go on to develop the point any further with regard to the sort of difficulties that exist, I should like to put on record that a very great deal has been and is, in fact, being done within the strict limitations of the law as it stands.  The gardaí have had a substantial measure of success in dealing with subversive elements.  The facts are that prosecutions have been brought in every case where there was admissible evidence on which charges could be based.  They have carried out effective and widespread searches as a result of which they have seized large quantities of illegally-held firearms, ammunition and explosives.  Apart from prosecutions relating to firearms, <i>et cetera,</i> there have been prosecutions for other offences, for example, the making of unlawful collections.  Over 250 people have been, or are in the process of being, prosecuted for making these collections. Most of these have already been dealt with by the courts and varying penalties have been imposed in nearly all of these cases.</P>
    <P>It may be alleged and, in fact, it has been alleged that some of these people are self-confessed members of illegal organisations and that membership of an illegal organisation is an offence.  I freely concede that, at first glance, this <Col N="2562" /> seems to be&mdash;and I stress the words &ldquo;at first glance this seems&rdquo;&mdash;a valid point.  It is because I concede this that I think it necessary to spell out in some slight detail, but without going into all its ramifications by any means, why, despite the appearances, it is not, in fact, a valid point.  There is nothing to be gained by bringing people before the courts on criminal charges where it is quite clear that under existing rules of evidence there is no possibility of having them convicted.  This is the position, for instance, in relation to many speeches reported in newspapers which may appear to some people to be open admission of membership of illegal organisations.</P>
    <P>The first point to bear in mind is that newspaper reports are not evidence against the people making the statements. To provide admissible evidence it would be necessary for us to subpoena the journalist who heard the statement made so that he could give oral evidence of what was said.</P>

      <P>I will break off my train of thought on that point for a moment to deal with the position where Gardaí have attended public meetings on my instructions and have taken down, in so far as they could, a verbatim account of certain statements that were made.  They have been doing this for several months past on my instructions.  I have seen the statements and I have seen the full files.  They have come up through the State Solicitors to the Attorney General's office.  The Attorney General has directed prosecutions in a number of these cases and these prosecutions are pending.</P>

I have read these files in detail and I have read the comments of the law officers on them pointing out the deficiencies. I can say, as a lawyer, that I recognise those deficiencies notwithstanding the fact that the gardaí have endeavoured so far as possible&mdash;and it is only possible at a very definite minority of these meetings&mdash;to get a verbatim report and notwithstanding that a surprisingly large proportion of those cases did not produce sufficient admissible evidence to enable the law officers to recommend a prosecution.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and in some cases I think in respect of membership of an illegal organisation.  To go back to the question, for example, of a journalist attending a Press conference &mdash;and it is not my experience that the Garda are invited to the type of Press conference to which I am referring now&mdash;a question is raised immediately as to whether a journalist if he were subpoenaed and if he were willing to attend, and I am by no means certain that any journalist would be anxious to attend a court, would be able to testify to the exact words used at a particular point.  However, assuming he could so testify, the main obstacle still remains, that is, that although what the person who made the speech meant to convey was quite clear to his listeners, a court is not entitled to read between the lines.  A court can convict only where it is <Col N="2564" /> satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, and the benefit of any ambiguity in what is said must be given to the defendant. For example, a Member of this House may be satisfied that where, in a particular context, a speaker sets himself up as a spokesman for what is known as &ldquo;the republican movement,&rdquo; he means to be taken and is understood by most of us to be speaking on behalf of the organisation that call themselves the IRA, but there is much difference between being satisfied that that is so and proving it in court.  We have come up against this problem time and again and the Attorney General, quite rightly, is not prepared to bring a prosecution in the type of case where he knows he is bound to fail.  If the Attorney General were to bring cases where he is almost certain of failure, he would be, strictly speaking, abusing his office.</P>
      <P>One question that may, perhaps, occur to Deputies and certainly one that occurred to me very early in my examination of these sort of problems &mdash;and God knows I have been examining this during the past 12 or 18 months more than perhaps any other problem &mdash;is this.  How is it that 20 or 30 years ago convictions were obtained for these sort of offences which we find it almost impossible to get convictions for now? The Garda have pointed out to me&mdash; and I do not think I give away any secret in saying this, because the people concerned are now advised very well by lawyers, whereas 20 or 30 years ago they did not have lawyers&mdash;that where convictions for these sorts of offences were obtained in the past, they were almost invariably obtained not on the basis of spoken words or speeches at meetings or otherwise but on the basis of the possession of incriminating documents.  The capture of those documents on a particular indivilual led to his almost certain conviction. Unfortunately, incriminating documents are difficult to come by on the persons of any of these sort of people today.  It was not, apparently, the done thing for subversives of this type of 20 or 30 years ago to consult lawyers.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>They were doing it, <Col N="2565" /> as it were, on behalf of mother Ireland. Today they have the best of legal advice, and they have it beforehand as much as they have it afterwards. If there are Deputies who, apart from trying to make political capital, believe genuinely that not enough is being done, I ask them to face the realities of what I have said and to ask themselves if they would be willing to accept substantial changes in the rules of evidence and perhaps in other aspects of the criminal law.  There is one particular type of case which comes to mind immediately in this regard, that is, a case where a criminal act has been carried out&mdash;for example, an explosion or some serious damage to property&mdash; and where a person is interviewed by the Garda and is able to tell them enough about the incident to constitute strong evidence against those who were involved, including being able to tell the Garda the actual names of the persons involved, but who makes it very clear to the Garda that under no circumstances would he be prepared to go into court and give evidence to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Off hand, I can think of several serious incidents that occurred here in the nature of explosions during the past 12 months or so and where that has been the position, cases in which the Garda are certain, absolutely and morally, that certain identifiable people have carried out those crimes.  They have evidence in the sense that they got their information from people who were quite certain of their facts but who, at the same time, made it very clear to them that they would not go to court to give evidence and that, if a charge were brought and that person were asked or even subpoened and forced to go to court by the prosecution, he would deny ever knowing anything about the matter or having told the Garda about it.  That is a very frustrating position for me and for the Garda, but, nevertheless, it is one small example of the sort of incredible difficulty that we must face in trying to deal with matters of this kind.  One way that other countries deal with that type of situation is not the way that in the past we have resorted to, namely, internment and I stress &ldquo;in the past&rdquo;. <Col N="2566" /> On the Continent they bring a person before an examining magistrate who has been described as half policeman and half judge but who, basically, is a judicial person.  The examining magistrate asks questions and a refusal to answer such questions may of itself be an offence or a crime of some type for which that magistrate can impose punishment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what the Deputy is talking about but I shall refer to that in a moment.  In the United States they do not work this system through judicial inquiry but through Congressional inquiry where they have power to impose long terms of imprisonment for contempt of the inquiry.  This type of inquisitorial as opposed to accusatorial proceedings is foreign to our law but I may say to the House that in my frustration I have considered and am considering yet the possibility or the feasibility of some sort of inquisitorial procedure of that kind.  It would be a total departure from our legal tradition, a tradition that goes back for hundreds of years. For that reason such a procedure might be suspected by many people but it is an idea that has its merits from some points of view.  Perhaps Members of the House and others might give some thought to it and express their views on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the problems.  For example, one of the problems in connection with section 52 to which Deputy FitzGerald referred, is that it is contained in Part V of the 1939 Act.  To bring in Part V, the Government would have to make a proclamation of the existence of a certain situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have contemplated, for example, a short Bill here taking section 52 out of Part V, in other words, making it part of the permanent law rather than part of a law that is only brought in now and again.  One of the difficulties that we run into with section 52 is that on the face of it it may well <Col N="2567" /> appear to be in conflict with certain international obligations which this country has assumed since that section was used previously and also the effectiveness of the section is somewhat open to doubt now, where you have people who, when asked to account for their movements, are prepared to account for their movements in a way that was never envisaged, I think, when that section was passed and, therefore, section 52, which was passed in 1939, is very much less effective today.  We can see that straight away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <P>Not only that, but the Garda Síochána say that they are positively satisfied that with the exception of a few incidents, training exercises by small numbers of persons, there is no basis whatsoever for this allegation.  By small numbers the Gardaí mean half a dozen people or less.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>And even such small groups seldom engage in the open-air in anything that could be classified as training.  It is true, of course, and here I am back to the earlier point I was making, that if the Gardaí find half a dozen people, whose background they know, engaged in a walk in the hills they may be in no doubt that it was not love of nature that brought them out for their walk in the hills but unfortunately that is not evidence of anything.  I would emphasise, however, that the Garda Síochána have given me the most categoric assurance that allegations that training and drilling are going on here on any scale in the open are just not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that there have been minor battles close to the Border between British forces and what must be assumed to be members of unlawful organisations has been utilised by some Northern Ministers in support of the argument that members of illegal organisations living south of the Border habitually make incursions across it into the North.  The evidence simply does not support that argument. It is true, however, that the wholly <Col N="2569" /> senseless policy of blowing up and spiking Border roads, that is being pursued by the British Army, has caused grave inconvenience to the local people on both sides of the Border and has provoked resentment and ill-feeling on a wide scale.  It is a policy of violence which has played directly into the hands of subversive elements who are availing themselves of the situation created by the understandable resentment of local people and have sought to escalate the violence by shootings, burnings and explosions.  Property on both sides of the Border has been destroyed, lives have been lost.  I hope the British Government will quickly come to realise the futility of what is being done.</P>
    <P>This provocative policy can only have been adopted to placate the right wing of the Unionist Party without any regard for its effect on the people in the Border areas or for the dangerous situation that it creates.  There is no justification for it and no evidence that it has produced any worthwhile result.  One thing is clear.  It has demonstrated how artificial a boundary the Border really is.  The obvious foolishness and futility of the cratering policy must lead any objective observer of the situation to fear that the Unionists and the British between them have ulterior purposes in the policy to what they publicly proclaim.</P>
    <P>Among other accusations that are regularly made by Northern spokesmen is the one that shelter is given down here to people who have committed serious crimes in the North, that is, crimes related to the current violence.  Frankly, this kind of charge, which I refuted in a statement I made yesterday, annoys me, because what the people concerned know well is that what is at issue here is whether or not there should be extradition for political offenders.  It boils down to that.  However much one must condemn the current campaign of violence, and we all condemn it, we must accept, and the authorities up there must accept, that the offences in any particular case may be held by any court, domestic or international, to be political, and in accordance with the terms of the European Convention on Extradition, to which <Col N="2570" /> we and most European countries have subscribed, as well as in accordance with the terms of the Extradition Acts in force both here and in Britain and in the North, political offences are not extraditable.  It is not just a matter of countries not being expected to extradite for these offences.  The fact is that extradition for political offences is positively forbidden by the Convention to which all of us, practically, in western Europe, including ourselves, subscribed.</P>
    <P>I, for my part, have on occasion been asked to exercise certain powers which are vested in me by the Extradition Act to declare that a particular offence was a political offence.  I have never once done so because I believe that such a decision should be left to the High Court or the appropriate court to make on the basis of sworn evidence produced in public.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to give the House briefly some figures in relation to extradition warrants in this country. The position is that in the calendar year, 1970, which is, of course, the year for which the latest figures are available to me, 169 warrants, 23 of them from Northern Ireland, were received for execution here and 140 warrants were issued from here, 20 of them to Northern Ireland.  I want again to repeat what I said yesterday that on no occasion have I as Minister, or the Government here, exercised our power not to enforce a warrant.  In each case where the person concerned was available the gardaí have arrested the person on foot of the extradition warrant and in accordance with the law of this country, which is very similar to the law of all Western European countries and have brought that person before the court.</P>
    <P>In a few cases where there is this political, Northern, violent background the courts have seen fit not to issue extradition orders in respect of those warrants.  That is a matter on which I will not comment one way or the other but I want to make it perfectly clear that these people have been brought before the courts and, if they have not been in fact extradited, that is a decision of the court and a decision of the court is something that I am not prepared to criticise.  I am not prepared <Col N="2571" /> to say it is wrong.  Neither, for that matter, am I prepared to say a court decision is right because if I praise decisions of any court it is a natural corollary that where I think they are wrong I should criticise them and I will not do that.  I do want to say this before I sit down.  There has been a lot of talk inside this House and outside it about the courts recently.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because I feel that our courts are one of the most important part of our basic institutions. If it is suggested that in some way the courts should be interfered with, that in some way their decisions in regard to political or quasi-political or allegedly political offences should be changed and heavier penalties or more frequent convictions should be obtained, that suggestion may be made by many people in good faith but it is immensely damaging to the whole fabric of our society to make it.  I do feel and seriously suggest that the last people who should make that suggestion are the Opposition in a Parliament because, if that interference were to take place, presumably the people who might be forced to do it, who might most easily impose their views, would be the Government.  I certainly never have and never will&mdash;and I say this in the most solemn form&mdash;I have never sought to influence our courts. Notwithstanding any private disagreement I might have with particular decisions&mdash;and it is more difficult for me in many ways to stay quiet about it, if you like, because my frustration is greater, being the person concerned with law and order in this country&mdash; no matter what frustration I might feel I will never utter that criticism because, if I were to do so, I feel I would gnaw away at the most important single section of our three basic institutions, <Col N="2572" /> the legislative, the executive and the judicial.  Because of the fundamental national importance of the independence of our Judiciary, I would urge, for that reason, that whatever frustration or whatever disagreement any people might feel, either inside or outside this House, that likewise, that criticism that might be welling up would not be expressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This was an interesting contribution by the Minister for Justice.  Obviously, it was the contribution of a man on the defensive.  It would seem that the Minister would like us to gather that the law as drafted or as administered, for constitutional or other reasons, makes it difficult for him to be as effective as he would like to be in the control of subversive activities here.  Unlike the Minister, I am not a lawyer and I am not conversant with the intricacies of the problems with which he has been concerned for the past year or two but I did see the picture some considerable time ago in the <i>Irish Times</i> of a man in uniform collecting money publicly in Dublin, with placards stating &ldquo;The IRA need funds&rdquo;.  I do not know what exactly happened in that case.  Was that man taken into custody?  Was he prosecuted? Was he asked did he have a licence to collect?  And so on.  These collections are taking place up and down the country and one does not hear very much about it.  Yet, if we in Fine Gael have to carry out a collection we have to go through all the <Col N="2573" /> roundabouts of getting a permit and I am sure that if we did not do that we would very quickly have the guards after us to know why did we not get a permit before we began to collect in such-and-such a place.</P>
      <P>I did not stand up specifically to deal with the points raised by the Minister for Justice.  He has dealt extensively here with the question of extradition. We are all familiar with that, that political offences do not lend themselves to extradition procedures.  That is a universal practice.</P>
      <P>The difficulty about the Minister for Justice and the case he presents is that he has lost credibility, not particularly due to himself but by virtue of the fact that he is a member of a Government who have lost credibility and the position is now that no matter what they say on the far side of the House everybody on this side doubts them.</P>

      <P>Let us review the past two years, which have been a most interesting two years.  To begin with, there was a tribunal set up to inquire into the RTE &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; moneylending programme. A colossal amount of money was spent on that inquiry.  The only people who benefited by that were the lawyers.  They had a good innings.  I doubt if anybody else got any value from it.  I doubt if it did any good for our society.  I doubt it if made any difference to Telefís Éireann.  A few disgruntled people emerged from it. By and large, I am still wondering what it was all about and what all the money was spent on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were two major arms trials. The first one was an abortive effort. Again, one does not know exactly how it happened that we had an abortive arms trial, that a judge withdrew and another trial took place.  Again, what accrued from it?  What did we gain as a people from it?  We exposed <Col N="2574" /> ourselves.  Our good name as a nation was sadly damaged.  The trial seemed to end up in some kind of indeterminate position.  Any other Government, on foot of those two trials, would have resigned, but not our cliff-hanging performer, Deputy Jack Lynch, the greatest cliff-hanger now in Europe.</P>
    <P>Then we had the inquiry in which I was personally engaged, in the past 12 months, the Public Accounts Committee Inquiry into the alleged misappropriation of £100,000.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past year or two we have been treated to an arms trial.  We have had an all-night debate, something, I think, we have never had since the foundation of the State.  We have had allegations of perjury.  We have had allegations of lies being told in this House and outside it.  Yet Fianna Fáil remain in power.  Those they saw fit to throw out of their ranks go up those stairs and turn left to keep them in power.  The cliff-hanger still hangs on.  We had an exhibition outside this House, a pitiful exhibition by the party in Government, at Ballsbridge at an Ard-Fheis&mdash;the baiting of poor Boland.  Fianna Fáil lived through that.  They have an extraordinary sense of survival, an extraordinary power.  Talk about the cat with nine lives.  I do not know how many lives that party have got, but they have survived. There were two or three Ministerial sackings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a resignation of a Minister and of a Parliamentary Secretary and still that party continue to profess still to represent, and properly to represent, the Irish people.  They still cling to power.  In another country, in similar circumstances, a Government would resign and allow the people to pass judgment. We have had threats of internment and now we have them crying crocodile tears about internment in Northern Ireland.  What a turnabout.  We had the Forcible Entry Bill; we had difficulties <Col N="2576" /> in this House about buildings being occupied in Hume Street&mdash;what became known as the Hume Street crisis; we had a close-down in the College of Art; we had a sit-in in University College, Dublin; and a Health Bill was introduced in this House which was one of the most amusing pieces of legislation known to parliamentarians.  It has not benefited the Irish people whatsoever.  A Minister for Health overnight became a Minister for Finance and put his hand deep into the pockets of the Irish people and took £7 million out of them, but there is no material improvement in the health services.</P>
      <P>We had a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for the first time resorting to measures in respect of RTE.  We had the Collins dictation to that authority: for the first time the Minister resorted to extreme measures to control the national television station.</P>
      <P>The two years we have passed through have been extraordinary and yet we are still expected to accept that this once great party represent the wishes of the Irish people.  We have had the astounding circumstances mentioned here today by Deputy Cosgrave and now the situation has got so bad within the party that they cannot share the same room&mdash;they are looking for special housing conditions within the building.</P>
