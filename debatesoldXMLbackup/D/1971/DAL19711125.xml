      <P>I can explain that.  There are a couple of amendments arising from the passage of the Bill through the Seanad.  I thought that perhaps the Minister could mention it this morning to facilitate the passage of the Bill.  There are just a couple of minor points which I do not think will give rise to controversy.  However, if there is any argument about it it can be deferred until Tuesday.  Late last night I endeavoured to seek out Deputy FitzGerald but I could not contact him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It was suggested to me, I think, by Senators O'Higgins and Horgan that subsection (6) might not be read in conjunction with subsection (5).  The parliamentary draftsman informed me that in fact subsection (5) as it stood would have to be read in <Col N="399" /> conjunction with subsection (6) but, in view of the arguments put forward by the Senators, I decided through this amendment to clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Were the Senators arguing in favour of subjecting subsection (5) to subsection (6) or were they arguing that it was not subject to it and they would like to keep it that way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>They were arguing as far as I can remember, in relation to the legal position.  It was simply that as I was holding in relation to the subsections as they were and the Senators felt that subsection (6) might not necessarily be read in conjunction with subsection (5) I think the only clash here would be in regard to the word &ldquo;numbers&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Were they welcoming the possibility that subsection (5) would be free from the restrictions of subsection (6) or were they deploring it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the matter arose originally in relation to the fact that they wished to delete the word &ldquo;numbers&rdquo; in subsection (6).  I did not accept this.  Then, as far as I can remember, the argument was that subsection (5) as it stood, might not necessarily apply to &ldquo;numbers&rdquo;; that, for example, the provision that the board may appoint such other officers would apply to grades, qualifications and so on, but would not apply to &ldquo;numbers&rdquo;. It was to ensure that the Bill would be in proper order, as it were, that I put forward the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the Minister is endeavouring to frustrate the wishes expressed by the Senators that subsection (5) should be free of the control over numbers in subsection (6).  If I understand it correctly, what the Minister suggested was that subsection (5) would be subject to the qualification of subsection (6), but they argued that it would not be and in order to tie it up tightly, the Minister decided to put down this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not so.  It is simply because I did not accept the <Col N="400" /> amendment in relation to numbers that from a purely legal point of view they pointed out to me that there might be a clash between subsection (5) and subsection (6).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Senators pointed out this defect to the Minister and thereby enabled him to make the change which has the effect of giving to him control over numbers of staff.  This control is improper and was something that we in this House tried to prevent.  The amendment is to be deplored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting at all that it was a defect.  In fact, the parliamentary draftsman pointed out to me that it was not so and that subsection (5) could be read with subsection (6).  In order to clarify the situation I put down the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in order to copperfasten the Minister's control and in case the Senators might be right and the draftsmen might be wrong, that the Minister inserted this.  He wanted to make sure that he would have control over numbers.</P>

      <P>I am not too clear on the procedure but if we sought to negative this by a division and if, by chance, we succeeded the effect would be the holding up of the Bill and the holding up of the College of Art and it is important that we do not do that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I agree to the Bill being Reported subject to the Minister clarifying section 11.</P>
      <P>Bill received for final consideration.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 11 of the Bill as amended in Committee, Deputies Fitzpatrick and Ryan had tabled two amendments.  These were amendments Nos. 11 and 12 on Committee Stage.  I could not accept the amendments as they were put down because they seemed to create a far greater problem than the one they sought to correct.  I was, however, afraid at the time that there was a different type of problem which was being highlighted by what Deputy Fitzpatrick said.  I asked for time to consider that situation.  In effect what Deputy Fitzpatrick said was that section 10 of the 1967 Rent Act prevents a person from selling his rent-controlled house without the consent of the landlord, that section 11 of the present Bill proposes to lift this restriction only where that person resides in the house and that if that person does not reside in the house, he can escape the restriction only by taking up residence in the house.  This is wrong. First, section 10 of the 1967 Rent Act prevents the tenant of a controlled dwelling from selling without the consent in writing of the landlord except in certain cases.  Secondly, under section 2 subsection (6) of the same Act, the owner-occupier of a house, that is an occupier who has a lease for more than 21 years, is in certain defined circumstances given the rights of the tenant of a controlled dwelling and is therefore caught by section 10. It was never intended that what I will call &ldquo;section 2, subsection (6) tenants&rdquo; should be caught by section 10 of the 1967 Act and section 10 of this Bill, which is now section 11 as amended <Col N="402" /> on Committee, removes them and only them from the scope of section 10 of the 1967 Rent Act.  Section 11 of this Bill corresponds exactly with what was caught accidentally by the 1967 Rent Act and for section 11 to attempt to do anything more than this is unnecessary and would be misleading.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick raised the case of a person who holds a house under lease for more than 21 years and who has sublet that house.  In such a case one or other of the following three situations must obtain and I emphasise &ldquo;must&rdquo; because there are only three sets of circumstances that could pertain. The first is that the sub-letting has ended by reason of the death of the tenant or by reason of the tenant giving up his tenancy or for some other similar reason.  In such a case, the application of the Rent Act ceases under section 3, subsection (2), paragraph (f) of the 1960 Act, as amended by the 1967 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Is that not subject to a certain poor law valuation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the case of a tenancy falling in after June of 1966. Therefore, it could no longer apply. The person in the case we are discussing, that is a person holding under a long lease&mdash;more than 21 years&mdash;who sublets and who regains possession after June, 1966, is not restricted in any way by section 10 of the 1967 Rent Act because paragraph (f) of subsection (2) of section 3 of the 1960 Act as amended, keeps him outside it. If, for example, he makes a new letting, post-June 1966, he has come into possession for the purposes of paragraph (f) and therefore the house has become de-controlled and the new letting is not a controlled letting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second circumstance is that the sub-letting has continued up to the present.  In such a case the tenant under the sub-letting would, where the Rent Acts apply, be restricted in regard to assignment of his tenancy by section 10 of the 1967 Rent Act.  This restriction will continue regardless of the enactment of section 11 of this Bill and nobody would suggest seriously <Col N="403" /> that it should not continue.  However, the lessee under the long lease is the landlord for the purposes of the Rent Acts in relation to the sub-letting and is not restricted by the Rent Acts in regard to any assignment that he may wish to make of his interest in the house.  In other words, if a person is a 999-year lessee and lets to a weekly or a monthly tenant, he is the landlord for the purpose of the Rent Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): So that he would sell his interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, without consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): That was the point that was causing me concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, there are only three possibilities in this situation and the remaining one is that the lessee under the long lease, who would be the landlord in relation to the sub-letting, wishes to sell his interest to the sub-tenant.  In this case, since he is the landlord, as explained in the second situation which I have dealt with, he is free to do so, so far as anything in the Rent Acts is concerned. It is the tenant's freedom to assign his tenancy that is restricted by section 10 of the 1967 Rent Act.  That section imposes no such restriction on the landlord&mdash;in the Rent Act sense of landlord&mdash;in other words, it imposes no such restriction on the lessee under the long lease, in the case we are discussing.</P>
      <P>I think the three situations I covered are the only three that are possible in the circumstances.  Since paragraph (f) of subsection (2) of section 3 of the 1960 Rent Act clearly decontrolled the sort of situation that Deputy Fitzpatrick raised the last day, and which, at the time, I thought might well be caught and since I am now perfectly satisfied that in fact it is not caught, that is the reason that I did not put down an amendment on Report Stage. I would ask the House to pass the Bill as amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): This Bill was welcomed by the Opposition <Col N="404" /> parties when it was introduced.  I say again that it is a useful Bill that has been required for a long time.  The Minister has accepted some amendments here for which we are grateful and the Bill has, I think, been improved in this House.</P>
      <P>I was apprehensive about section 2 (2) (a) and (b).  It says that a sports club will be entitled to a new lease if&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  the land is held for the purpose of carrying on the sport under a lease for a term of not less than 21 years,</P>
      <P>(ii)  the land has been continuously occupied by the sports club for that purpose for the period of not less than 21 years immediately preceding the date of the application for a sporting lease, </P>
      <P>I invited the Minister to insert the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; between those two paragraphs in order to ensure that the Bill might not be read by a court as requiring that the land would be held under a 21-year lease and that it had been used for sport during that period of 21 years.  The Minister tells me that he is advised that &ldquo;or&rdquo; is implied between these two paragraphs.  If that is so I am satisfied but the experienced practitioner who raised it with me is still not satisfied, and I want to go on record as saying that, if what the Minister has said and if the Minister's advice is not correct, then this Bill will not apply to any sports club unless that sports club has held or holds under a 21-year lease.  I know that is not the Minister's intention.  He has so said. I am just going on record now to put that case.  If the Minister's advice is correct, and I trust it is, then this part of the Bill is satisfactory enough, but if the Minister's advice is not correct, then it is valueless.</P>
      <P>Bear in mind there would be nothing inconsistent in reading these two paragraphs not as alternative paragraphs. The court could quite intelligently read them as not alternative because it could be held that:</P>
      <P>the land is held for the purpose of carrying on the sport under a lease for a term of not less than 21 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> The land must be held for the purpose of carrying on sport but it could be held for the purpose of carrying on sport and might not have been used for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (ii) goes on to say:</P>
    <P>the land has been continuously occupied by the sports club for that purpose for the period of not less than 21 years immediately preceding the date of the application for a sporting lease. </P>
    <P>It is conceivable that the court would interpret it as my correspondent fears it would be interpreted, but I am accepting, as I have to, what the Minister said, and I trust the Minister is right.  I am sure he has the best of advice on it.</P>
    <P>The same arguments would apply in respect of (b) (i) and (ii) of that section, (i) saying that a specified amount of money must be spent</P>
    <P>on erecting permanent buildings or structures on the land which are used in connection with the land for that purpose;</P>
    <P>and (ii) that</P>
    <P>on reconstructing, altering, renovating or adapting any permanent buildings or structures on the land which are so used so as to render them more suitable for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Again I invited the Minister to put &ldquo;or&rdquo; between those two paragraphs. He says it is not necessary.  The same arguments are valid.  Again, if the Minister is right, I am satisfied; if he is wrong the Bill will be a lot less useful.</P>
    <P>The Minister also accepted amendments from Deputy Cosgrave, one amendment which will do something to relieve the plight of certain tenants on the Proby Estate.  There are still a small number of tenants left out.  The Minister says that for constitutional reasons he cannot do anything for them, or that, if he did do anything for them, he would set a precedent which would create an intolerable situation here.  We can only hope that the Proby Estate will, in their generosity, and from a sense of fair play, meet these people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="406" /> I am particularly grateful to the Minister for putting section 10 into the Bill because it will give people who did not appreciate their rights between 1967 and 1969 an opportunity of availing of the provisions of section 4 of the 1967 Act.  Finally I want to deal with the matter the Minister has just dealt with.  The Minister's explanation emphasises the necessity for codifying all landlord and tenant law and all rent restrictions law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I can see the difficulty of a general practitioner, who has to deal with everything from divorce and a <i>mensa et toro</i> to criminal injuries, rent restrictions, running-down actions and all the rest being able to put his finger on the explanation which the Minister has given, never mind the ordinary lay people who are affected by these obscure sections of the various Acts which the Minister has quoted.  Anyway, the situations with which the practitioner, who drew this to my attention, was concerned were situations 2 and 3.  Situation 2 was where a man holding under a long lease wants to sell subject to a tenancy.  The Minister tells me that there is no problem there, to use a phrase of one of his senior colleagues, that that can be done without any trouble.  The other situation is that if the lessee holding property under a long lease which he has let to a tenant wants to sell to that tenant again he can do so without any restriction under the code because, in fact, he is not the tenant but the landlord for the purpose of that situation. If that is so I am satisfied with it. Generally speaking, the Minister has met the House fairly on this Bill and it is an example of the way that legislation should be handled in this House.</P>

      <P>Before I reported progress I had been making the point that Deputies should resist the temptation to use the occasion of this Estimate simply as a vehicle to carry their prejudices about particular programmes on Telefís Éireann; that this would be an abuse of this occasion; that we should all attempt to debate broad policy items in the Estimate and consider, in relation to the television station, how it fulfils its functions and whether it is best performing those functions.</P>
      <P>I made the point last night that our television station has always lived in a climate of pressure from Government quarters and that, in its lifetime, it has known only one party in Government and has become accustomed to that kind of surveillance on its activities as a television station.  In a country where there is only one television station, set up by Act of Parliament, there would always be a tension between the television station and the Government. There probably is a greater degree of tension in the relations between that station and the Government presently in power.  That Government set up the station and, over the years, at one time or another, has considered Montrose as absolutely the property of the Government, as simply another semi-State agency, requiring no different treatment from that meted out to any other State agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to ensure conditions of free expression, to ensure that people get a <Col N="408" /> television service which gives them the news and the information behind the news, that provides adult television programmes, and that is able to provide a means of livelihood for its employees who will be unafraid&mdash;and in Telefís Éireann at the moment there are a number of people who are very frightened indeed&mdash;and if we are to ensure that we would get a station which allows people to produce programmes which are honest in their production and in the intentions, we need healthy competition; we need to create a second television station.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that Telefís Éireann as at present constituted&mdash;and this problem is referred to in the Minister's speech&mdash;is an uneasy compromise between commercial considerations and what are referred to as &ldquo;considerations of public policy&rdquo;.  When we demand of the one television station programmes of high quality, programmes which do not depend for their production on purely commercial considerations, and at the same time ask the station to pay its way, we are asking the impossible.  It would seem to me that we should separate these two functions.  Let us have a purely commercial television station.  Let it be financed by, say, the newspapers. The newspapers have been complaining of the supremacy of television in recent years in communications and so on.  We should allow a frankly commercial television station to come into existence and, from the revenue of that station, subsidise a second station that need not totally depend on commercial considerations, which would not necessarily be a highbrow station but which would be able, at least, to consider the production of more quality programmes on public affairs, drama, and all the matters that interest various people.</P>
    <P>The commercial station such as I have referred to, in line with commercial stations in Britain and elsewhere, could have a healthy public affairs section.  The competition between the two stations would ensure that the needless Government interference which has proceeded in the case of Telefís Éireann would occur less frequently.  The Minister in his <Col N="409" /> introductory statement referred to the directive to RTE under section 31 in the following terms:</P>
    <P>I issued a written direction to the Authority on 1st October, 1971, &ldquo;to refrain from broadcasting any matter of the following class i.e. any matter that could be calculated to promote the aims or activities of any organisation which engages in, promotes, encourages or advocates the attaining of any particular objective by violent means. </P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that this was the first time the directive was ever given in that form.  This is true. Over the years the customary manner in which Ministerial directives were given has been by phone, suggesting that such and such an item should not be on a news programme.  We recall the instances over the years.  The advantage of giving one's direction by phone is that the patient shows no sign of the punishment administered.  It is a kind of third degree which leaves no trace.  The Minister's directive at least has the advantage over these midnight phone calls, which had been the method adopted by previous Ministers for giving directives to Telefís Éireann &mdash;that it was given openly.  If censorship is to be invoked I am in favour of the public knowing the date, the hour and the minute when that censorship was invoked.</P>
    <P>That does not mean that I defend or am in favour of that particular directive by the Minister.  If we have legislation which lays down a certain approach to illegal organisations, the burden is on the public authorities to utilise that legislation.  I cannot see why Telefís Éireann must be used as a kind of shabby second guarantor to carry out public policy which the Government themselves, evidently, shy away from.  If the Government party have an ambivalent attitude, and I think they have an ambivalent attitude, to illegal organisations I do not see why they should visit that ambivalence on Telefís Éireann and ask people whose duty it is to carry news and to explain the news, the journalists in Telefís Éireann, to carry out this kind of ambiguous directive:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" />&ldquo;to refrain from broadcasting any matter of the following class i.e. any matter that could be calculated to promote the aims or activities of any organisation which engages in, promotes, encourages or advocates the attaining of any particular objective by violence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a very broad and vague directive. It is calculated further to discourage people in Telefís Éireann from reporting news honestly.  Are we going to stand over a state of affairs where, for example, the news bulletins of Telefís Éireann carry violent activities in Belfast at weekends, and so on, and where the feature programmers are given instructions that they must not explain the origin of these actions, in other words, our news bulletins carry the shooting but the feature programmes can carry no explanations, and, at the same time, our newspapers report the news as it happens.  If this Government have an argument with illegal organisations then it must have the moral courage to pursue that argument both here in Parliament and on political platforms around the country, and it must not seek to evade that duty by passing on a vaguely worded directive to RTE in an attempt to corral journalists into curtailing their professional activities in reporting the news honestly and impartially.  As I see it, that is the job of Telefís Éireann and the primary duty of any journalist.</P>
    <P>It is their primary duty to report what is actually happening and comment on the basic facts that explain this event or that event.  The Government, of course, have been attempting to frighten independent journalists in RTE over a number of years.  The great monument erected to that particular policy was, in fact, the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; Tribunal.  They have been attempting to inculcate into RTE what I would describe as a school of auto-censorship, in which the journalist himself censors himself; in which the station, because of so many mysterious directives coming from so many Government Ministers, would appear to exist solely for the benefit of the one party in government over the past ten years, becoming simply a place in which there would be harmless programmes from <Col N="411" /> the point of view of the Government, whether home-produced or otherwise, and, if not home-produced, canned film programmes from America and Britain.</P>
    <P>The Government have been attempting to make of Telefís Éireann a harmless &ldquo;bread and circuses&rdquo; kind of show and drive it away from commentary on public affairs, frightening them with vague directives so that no programmes with an honest content could, in fact, be produced, leaving us, the viewers, finally with a station which carries no honest commentary on any matter of any interest whatever.  Well and truly might people object that, for their licence fees, they are not getting value and, so long as this heavy-handed approach by the Government persists in relation to Telefís Éireann, they will not get that value.  I suggest one way in which we could break the vicious circle would be by the establishment of a second television station. I would hope that, if we get to that stage, we could examine the authority of RTE and ensure that, in nominations to that authority, there would be a 50-50 split of representation.  Is there not greater scope for nomination of representatives to RTE?</P>
    <P>We hear the complaint that RTE has no direct contact with vocational organisations.  It is easy to see how this may come about.  We are not alone in having a Government which is anxious to curtail the freedom of expression and the content of expression: Italy and France are good examples of how Governments may manage their television stations to ensure they do not give honest expression to news and so on.  Let us admit it: one good reason why Telefís Éireann has been able to operate a tradition of free commentary has been because of the proximity of this island to that of Britain.  Unfortunately, at the moment, the BBC is under grave strain in reporting Northern Ireland events and Tory Ministers are suggesting, in the interests of patriotism, to British journalists that they must report the British Army in a certain light.  As I say, we are not alone in this drive towards greater control of the news.  It is not an exaggeration <Col N="412" /> to say there have been signs over the last year or two; there was the recent attempt, the Forcible Entry Bill, to curtail freedom of expression.  We may see in the tendency in Britain now a similar approach to contain freedom of expression by journalists on BBC programmes.</P>
    <P>I think RTE has attempted honestly to report events in Northern Ireland. There has been a bias on occasion admittedly, but the Northern Ireland tragedy is one in which we are all caught up emotionally and it is hard to report objectively.  I think this recent direction, in which section 31 of the Act was invoked by the Minister, must make RTE's attempt to cover the Northern Ireland situation impartially much more difficult.  The two objectives RTE must be permitted to carry out are to report the facts and explain the background to those facts.  The big problem will come up soon as to how exactly RTE will report the referendum campaign.  Who is to know whether RTE is not to receive further ministerial directives?  A Minister has altered custom.  He has, in fact, invoked Article 31 and there is no guarantee that, over that campaign, ministerial directives about particular programmes may not again be utilised and producers of programmes told that this or that should not be shown.  In the climate of fear in RTE at present this may very well prove to be successful. In the reporting of the referendum campaign RTE will have a very heavy responsibility to carry out in informing the public on the issues involved.</P>
    <P>There will always be in any democracy a permanent tension&mdash;it is a good thing for democracy that there should be this tension&mdash;between the public authorities and RTE.  Obviously representatives of the Government do not appreciate that this tension is one of the conditions of democracy, however awkward it may be to relieve.  We know the Tánaiste's approach.  He wants happy news.  The answer to his necessity for happy news is that his own party has probably been the begetter of some of the unhappiest news in this State over the past two years and it has produced programmes of the most gory kind for the reporting of <Col N="413" /> which RTE cannot be blamed; if the Tánaiste wants happy news, he must admit his own party was not, in fact, providing its own measure of happy news.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the new radio station to be set up in the Gaeltacht.  The establishment of this radio station is praiseworthy, but it is regrettable that the opportunity was not taken, when setting up this regional Gaeltacht station, to appoint people to that authority from, say, organisations like Cearta Sibhialta na Gaeltachta.  Cearta Sibhialta na Gaeltachta has done a great deal to increase people's appreciation of their cultural identity.  It has done many worthwhile things in the Gaeltacht in Connemara.  It is regrettable that no representative of that organisation or other organisations who have called for a Gaeltacht radio station over the years has been appointed to the Radio na Gaeltachta Authority.  I accept that a public authority which sets up a station such as Radio na Gaeltachta must have some control over the administrative running of that station, but could we not have a more imaginative way of involving local interests in the running of that station?  All RTE appointments are in the hands of the Minister.  As far as Radio na Gaeltachta is concerned one can almost say all those appointed are members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  This is a regrettable method of proceeding.</P>

      <P>Possibly.  My next point has been raised by several Deputies, but I think serious consideration should be given to the televising of Dáil proceedings.  I do not know whether we would gain any TAM ratings; it would depend on the estimate. If Fianna Fáil could arrange for a party meeting to take place at 1 o'clock on a Wednesday we might have an entertaining afternoon's viewing if the Dáil was being televised that particular afternoon.  There is a great deal of ignorance and apathy about the working of the Dáil.  Whatever party we belong to it is important that the public at large should know what goes on in Parliament.  In countries where Parliaments have been televised it has brought home to people what goes on in Parliament.  We could introduce it on selected estimates and the public could see what their representatives are or are not doing.  They could see what the Government proposes to legislate on and what is proposed by the Opposition. This would be beneficial to them when the time came for the public to take a meaningful part in public affairs. I hope the Minister will see his way to introducing the televising of Dáil debates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter has been mentioned by other Deputies and I would suggest the desirability of it.</P>
      <P>Most people work a five-day week and while I am not thinking of anything as ambitious as a University of the Air at week-ends, I believe RTE should consider televising programmes like the school programmes only in an adult form.  We hear a great deal about people finding difficulty in occupying their leisure hours but such programmes would cater for viewers who are not adequately catered for at the moment.</P>
      <P>Conditions are still bad in the Sheriff Street sorting office and I hope the Minister will do something to improve them.  The Minister is having discussions with the Post Office unions at present.  Discussions have been going on for a number of years and promises have been made.  I hope these discussions will soon come to fruition.  It is ridiculous to see the civil rights of the Post Office employees limited to the extent that they are for no good reason. Whatever British imperial reasons there may have been at the beginning of this century when the country was in a state of continuous war and it was necessary, therefore, to have this particular arm of the civil service outside the sphere of politics, I cannot see any legitimate reason in 1971 for a continuation of the present state of affairs. I hope the Minister will bring to an end speedily the limitation of civil rights which exists in the Post Office at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies from southern counties have called for a multi-channel television service so that viewers in those areas can see the BBC.  There is a demand for an alternative to RTE. The best way we can meet that demand is by the establishment of a second station.  We could use the profits from the second station to finance the public authority station.  Public affairs programmes would flourish on the second station amongst the advertising. <Col N="416" /> This would resolve the conflict which is at the heart of RTE between the commercial directions to make it pay and the more vague directions that it should project our cultural heritage.  These cultural objectives sit uneasily in the present set-up where it is asked to pay its way as well.  A break-up of these functions, the establishment of a first and second station, would better serve the needs of the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is a most comprehensive document. Although the cost of running the Department is quite high, nevertheless it is money well spent in the important field of communications.  I should like the Minister to consider changing the name of his Department from Posts and Telegraphs to that of Communications. In the society in which we live there is a great need for true communication between the State and the people.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the Northern situation in particular, many of our people in Britain are hungry for news of events in this country but it is impossible to receive a programme from RTE in many parts of Britain. People who have been forced to emigrate must feel totally neglected when they have no option but to tune in to the BBC or other stations in Britain where they will not always get a clear and true picture of the problems of this country, especially regarding the north east part of the country.  Therefore, I would urge the Minister to give top priority to the improvement of radio and television services to Britain so that our own people there, and the British people, will not have to depend on the rather jaundiced views of the British media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This should be our main objective. In the interests of truth and justice and in order to help the suffering people in the North&mdash;people of all creeds&mdash;we should ensure that they receive a daily bulletin regarding events here.  If the British people could tune in to a radio programme that would be objective and would state the facts, they would come to believe we have <Col N="417" /> been telling the truth.  In this connection I should like to pay a tribute to the integrity of the RTE journalists and cameramen for their work in many dangerous situations in the northeastern part of our country.  The only thing lacking is that the RTE station is not powerful enough to be received in Britain.  I would appeal to the Minister to get down to the task of improving the RTE station so that our programmes can be received in all parts of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago television was introduced in this country and at this stage we might ask: Where have RTE gone wrong?  Somewhere along the line they got a misdirection or they sought a wrong goal with the result that there is great cynicism among the people regarding RTE programmes.  It must be admitted that RTE are inhibited by a lack of money but among the people generally there is the belief&mdash;perhaps wrongly held&mdash;that there is a kind of squandermania in RTE.</P>
    <P>It is thought they bring people on to programmes at very high fees.  One often wonders what is the criteria used with regard to the people who appear on RTE programmes.  It may be that there is an element in RTE who want to keep up with the British Joneses.  It should be realised that we cannot, and do not wish to, compete with the BBC.  They are a much wealthier and more powerful body; they have a job to do for Britain, but RTE must do a job for this country.  Even accepting our rather limited resources, RTE could do a better job perhaps in a simpler way.</P>
    <P>Frequently in programmes dealing with politics, literature or many other subjects, RTE have, on the show, a controversial or &ldquo;way out&rdquo; person. This has happened in many instances and the people on the programme had nothing in common with the Irish public. Frequently they said things that hurt the feelings of the people but those appearing on the programmes were depicted as rather god like people to whom the public should look for guidance.  RTE have a duty to ensure that the programmes they transmit are in keeping with the beliefs of the Irish people and, although we are entering an age of expansion, it is important <Col N="418" /> that we preserve our individuality and our culture.  The word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; has been abused and I do not like to use it, but, in this context, I am speaking about the things in which we believe.  It is the job of RTE to hold up a mirror to the national scene, not to distort it.</P>
    <P>Some of the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programmes have been very good.  However, there appears to be a desire by the people who produce the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;, for instance, to present to us people who have a reputation of being &ldquo;way out&rdquo; with their views.  Last year people were introduced who were no credit to their own country, never mind being a credit to RTE.  The people who produce and direct programmes on RTE must be told to present programmes that will cater for the people who live in Ireland.  Also, we do not wish to become more anglicised than we are already, neither do we wish to become Americanised.  RTE should not show too many old-fashioned and out-of-date American films.  In fairness to RTE, I understand that the cost of importing a film from America or Britain is trivial.  At the same time, we must recognise that damage will be done to the young people if they maintain this artificial approach to the programme.</P>
    <P>I do not object to plays by foreign dramatists being shown, but we have one good Dubliner who wrote many plays for the Abbey Theatre which set box office records and not one of his plays has ever been shown on RTE.  I will take the liberty of mentioning his name because he is a former Member of this House, John McCann.  This is the type of play the people want.  They wanted his plays when they were in the Abbey Theatre but I have never seen one of his plays on RTE.  I mention that point to show that there are some elements in RTE who prefer this airy-fairy and arty approach.  People often wonder what Pearse would think if he were alive today.  Pearse did not want us to sing jazz pop songs in Irish.  He wanted us to think Irish.  We are a separate nation.</P>
    <P>This is the only station we have in this part of the country.  While it might be desirable to have a second station, that is not possible in the foreseeable <Col N="419" /> future.  The RTE Authority will have to do better than they have been doing. I know they have many problems but it is their job to overcome problems. They should give us programmes which the people will appreciate instead of bringing certain people on to television and perhaps ending up with a libel action, as happened last week, because wild statements were made.  The record of RTE in this regard is not too good.  There have been many threatened actions or actions settled out of court.  It is inevitable, I suppose, that any organ of communication will have that type of trouble at times.  It is noticeable that the newspapers very seldom get mixed up in that type of problem.  The journalists working for the newspapers are very experienced and they know their job and they do it well.  We have five papers in this city alone not to mention the papers in Cork and other places. The overall picture of the press is that it has been responsible.  It reports the news.</P>
    <P>There is a very fair representation on some of the radio programmes on politics, particularly on the Friday Report on the Dáil proceedings.  Each week the journalists working on that programme try to present, and succeed in presenting a balanced picture of the three main parties and the Independents. I am sorry that I cannot say the same for RTE.  They have made too many gaffes and they have caused too much trouble.  The Government are criticised for interfering in the free dissemination of news and views on RTE.  I heard an interviewer interviewing a leading member of an illegal organisation and, whether she meant it or not, the picture I got was that she was in full sympathy with this man. She was quite nice to him.  I will say that she was a good interviewer.  The impression I got was that she was in sympathy with this man and the implication was: &ldquo;It is just too bad that people do not understand you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I got myself into trouble some years ago when I criticised a religious programme which attempted to deal with the problem of housing.  Not one person on that programme had any special knowledge of housing but they <Col N="420" /> all proceeded to pontificate on what Dublin Corporation should do. Nobody objects to genuine criticism, even if it is mistaken criticism, if the person believes what he is saying.  On this programme we had all the old trivia about the bad condition in which the State was, how badly people were housed and how terrible it was that these people should be in power in Dublin Corporation or in the Government.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann seem to have a tendency to go for the left winger who may have no special technical knowledge. He pontificates on our problems but he represents probably only .01 of the people.  He is elevated by RTE into a position of prominence to which he has no right.  If they want to have an extreme left winger on television they should also put on an extreme right winger to balance the programme.  They should drop both extreme wings and put on representatives of the people&mdash;and I do not mean Members of this House only&mdash; but representatives of local societies who are trying to do a good job.  They should be given a voice on the air as well as the people who preach Marxist policies or Leninist policies which have no place in this State.</P>
    <P>I believe in censorship.  There must be some form of censorship in every country.  I know this is not a popular thing to say and that if I wanted to be &ldquo;with it&rdquo; I would condemn censorship but I do not condemn it.  I believe that a body of viewers should watch the programmes and make representations to the RTE Authority to raise the standard of the programmes generally.  It may be said that we are very hard on them here but this is a very important medium of communications and propaganda. Therefore we should try to ensure that the station portrays the Ireland that exists.  I do not mind them showing Ireland, warts and all.  The warts are in the minority.  Irish society generally is sound, even if it needs some improvement.</P>
    <P>I believe that radio is becoming more popular all the time.  More money should be spent on radio programmes. The setting up of Radio na Gaeltachta is a step in the right direction.  I wish <Col N="421" /> it every success.  The Minister has been criticised for his nominees to that body but we must remember that everybody in Ireland has a political opinion. Some of us make our opinions public and others do not.  Deep in their hearts all Irish people believe in one of the parties here, or perhaps some party yet to come.  There is no point in saying that the Government are trying to muzzle the voice of RTE.  The Government have the job of ensuring that the medium for which the people are paying portrays a picture in keeping with our national traditions and beliefs and that we do not have a cheap type of BBC.</P>
    <P>Earlier on I mentioned the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programmes.  The programme on the motor industry the other night was excellent.  More people are talking about that programme than I have heard speaking about any programme for many years.  The people working on that programme knew their job and did a good job.  I cannot say whether all the allegations or the denials were true but I compliment the people who produced the programme and the interviewers and the people who took part in it.  They discussed grievances or imaginary grievances in a proper way. At least they did a good job there and if RTE did more of this type of programme people would have more respect for them and would be much more satisfied about the fees they are paying.</P>
    <P>In regard to telephone kiosks in this city, which have been the target of vandals, sick-minded people, who have smashed them and torn the equipment out, I am glad to see that a new type of material, perspex or whatever it is, which is almost unbreakable, is being used.  The people who smash these kiosks should be made dwell for a moment on the thought that it might be one of their family who needs a doctor or an ambulance at night and that they might go to a kiosk only to find the apparatus torn out for no other reason than a desire to damage public property.  The Minister, in cooperation with the Department of Justice, should have a watch put on these kiosks in order to apprehend some of the vandals who smash them and make them pay for their crime.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="422" /> In regard to accommodation for post office staffs, in recent years some fine new buildings have been erected.  If I may become a little parochial in regard to my own area, I would ask the Minister: when will the Ballsbridge sorting office be replaced?  It was built in the early part of the century and now deals with a much greater volume of correspondence than in those days.  The men working there would appreciate new quarters.  I am sure there is plenty of space in the area where the new office could be erected, so that the service from that office would be improved.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House too long, and I would conclude by asking the Minister to ensure that the radio service from RTE will be increased in volume so that our emigrants in Britain can get news from this country.  If this had been done some years ago we might well have a better-informed public opinion about the happenings here.  The media in Britain colour the programmes in their own favour.  The news is conveyed that a terrorist has shot a soldier, but the soldier is never a terrorist if he shoots an old woman or someone like that.</P>
    <P>I do not want any propaganda sent out from here to the British people, only the truth.  When they hear the truth from our station they will come to realise that there are two sides to the story.  We might have to spend a few million pounds on the new station, but let us consider the amount of damage which has been done in parts of this country in the last two years and which must run into millions and millions of pounds, and that if there had been in Britain a better-informed opinion both at government level and at the level of the people, a great deal of trouble might have been saved.  I am willing to vote for an increase in taxation if the money goes towards providing a good radio station and possibly a television channel which can transmit from Lands End to John o' Groats and get over this message to the people there.  RTE should take on this important task, stop aping the BBC and forget some of the silly shows they have been doing.</P>

      <P>The number <Col N="423" /> of Deputies who have spoken in this debate is indicative of the importance of this Estimate.  One thing that strikes me is that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who should be a fixture, has never been so in the Dáil since I have been a Member here.  It is regarded as being a junior post, and I suppose when the next shake-up comes within the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party, which may be sooner rather than later&mdash;one never knows these days &mdash;possibly the Minister will be moved on again.  That is unfortunate, because this is an important Department and is becoming much more important than it was before.</P>
      <P>A good many of us got quite a considerable shock when we heard from the Minister's opening speech that he envisaged increased charges.  Postal charges have already been considerably increased in the transfer to the decimal system, and, incidentally, our postal charges are considerably higher than those of other countries, for instance Britain.</P>
      <P>The Minister is faced with an increased charge of £3 million, largely due to wages, and the increased wages are largely due to the taxation policy of the Government.  Of course, the turnover tax and the wholesale tax, although not the direct responsibility of the Department, account for the inflationary situation that exists in regard to wages.  That applies not only to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs but to every Department of State.  Furthermore, when the Minister for Finance imposes the value added tax, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may be coming back here to tell us he has a couple of million pounds more to find.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Be that as it may, what strikes me very forcibly is that every Minister introducing an Estimate here tells us in his opening statement that due to so-and-so and so-and-so charges have gone up and, therefore, more money is required.  I wonder when a Minister will come in here and talk of greater efficiency and of a reduction in costs. No one can consider for a moment that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is run with the highest degree of efficiency.  I do not want to be hypercritical of them, but there are <Col N="424" /> many economies that could be made there.  They may be restricted in their working capacity in relation to trade union regulations, and so forth, but the telephone service, to start with, could be much more efficiently and economically run than it is.  I know of a recent case in which a telephone extension was required from a house to an office, a distance of about 200 yards.  The job took ten days to complete and it required a staff of ten men. I knew that this extension was taking place and, as I was passing along the road I asked them, out of interest, why there were so many men employed. Apparently certain men could only do certain things and other men could only do certain other things.  It seems to me the job could have been done in three or four days by two men, whereas it took ten men ten days to do the work.  When one group of men finished whatever they were doing they disappeared and there was a delay before the next group appeared.  That seems to indicate the rank inefficiency which leads to considerable rises in telephone charges.</P>
    <P>If anyone is looking for a telephone in a rural area he has to pay five years rent in advance.  I do not expect that this regulation applies in Dublin but it applies in all the country areas.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs are living in a state of credit for five years.  This situation has existed for at least five years.  I see no reason for it. A telephone service is a national service. There is no reason why it should not be equated all over the country or why country people should not get the same service as those in the cities.</P>
    <P>The telephone service is in a state of chaos.  That may not be the fault of the Minister.  This situation has been developing gradually.  There is more demand for a telephone service now than there was a few years ago.  The trunk lines are overloaded.  There is evidence of that in the fact that while talking to anyone on a phone in the country the sound comes and then fades all the time.  That is a sign of overloading.  I am fortunate enough to have a dial telephone but I find that I often have to dial for a considerable period before getting an answer.  That <Col N="425" /> is due to overloading also.  We must pose the question &ldquo;Is the service being administered in the most economic and practical way possible?&rdquo;.  The answer to that is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  An autonomous body should be set up as a commercial concern to run the telephone system.  It has been proved over the years that it is not possible to provide an efficient service under the aegis of the State.  I maintain that anything run by the State is run on the basis that so much money must be spent in one place to save money elsewhere that the costs escalate resulting in total inefficiency in the service concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister must have a continuous headache from hearing about the faulty telephone service.  I spoke to a former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and explained to him that I had difficulty in getting calls.  This man told me that he had exactly the same difficulty himself.  He said that he had tried to telephone Dublin from Kildare and could not get on.  He had urgent business in his Department and was left waiting a half an hour for a connection. I asked him had he told the people on the exchange who he was. He said that he had told them he was the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, but that it did not make any difference one way or the other.  If a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs could not get through, how can an ordinary person expect to get an up-to-date service?  If one phones to Scotland the position is different.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to telephone Scotland on important business recently.  I got through almost immediately.  I got through quicker than I would get through to a local town or to a constituent of mine.  I had a clear, uninterrupted conversation.  When I am talking to some of my constituents there is difficulty in understanding what is said sometimes because of faulty diction.  Their voices seem to sink to a whisper every now and then, and it is almost impossible to hear what is being said.  The overloading of the trunk lines is responsible for that.</P>
    <P>The present telephone situation is chaotic.  I am not indicting the Minister directly for that.  He inherited this system from his <Col N="426" /> predecessors.  We should set up an autonomous body and make them responsible for the service.  We should let them issue share capital and run the service as a business concern.  Our telephone system would then be equated with that of other countries. Business people come over here and find the telephone service unsatisfactory. This damages our tourism also.  When business tycoons visit our country they like to be able to keep in touch with their business concerns in Germany, Britain or elsewhere. They are dissatisfied with our chaotic telephone situation.  The Minister should divest himself of responsibility for the telephone service.  There should be a well organised body of business people with business acumen who know how to manage such a service.  The Minister will have the wholehearted support of the country if he sets up such a body.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have spoken about television.  The function of television is to give factual news.  Television is, perhaps, the most important communication medium in the world today.  This has been acknowledged by a most important person, the Pope, who speaks for a good many people in the world still in spite of changing circumstances here and there.  The job of television is to give a presentation of the facts and present news items showing what is actually happening. It is not the commentator's job to evaluate situations.  Experts on particular subjects may be called in to make statements.  There may be symposia or sessions on television.  There are certain areas in which I feel that television has gone entirely wrong.  I said this before. The people in television seem to be terribly keen on violence in any shape or form.  Recently in County Wexford we were presented with a bus by a philanthropic organisation.  This bus was intended for use in helping mentally-handicapped children.  I do not say that television crews should have come down and highlighted the presentation of that bus.  If there had been a whisper that somebody was going to blow up the bus, the television crews would have been there with their cameras and reporters.  Perhaps <Col N="427" /> this comment also applies to newspapers.</P>
    <P>Violence seems to be news today. Escalations of trouble which take place anywhere, the breaking of the law, the burning of buses, <i>et cetera</i> are events of great interest to the television media. Surely we are not so bankrupt of news which would interest the public that violence must be highlighted at all times?  Other programmes are produced also but violence is concentrated on.  The picture presented is in no way advantageous to the Irish national image.  There are many people across the Channel who would like to think that we are gunmen and savages.  They have had every opportunity over the past 12 to 15 months for imagining that we are a nation of violence and lawbreaking.</P>
    <P>There is another point about which Telefís Éireann must be indicted.  There is a gentleman, Reverend Ian Paisley, who probably has been responsible for much of what is happening by his rank bigotry, his one-sided point of view and his mealymouthed ramblings.  This gentleman is probably responsible for much of what is happening in Northern Ireland and for the polarisation of the communities there.  He never got any publicity from anybody but Telefís Éireann.  About a year ago we had to listen to him every time we switched on our television sets.  He represents nobody in the 20th century except a few bigots in the North.  He does not even represent the decent people in Northern Ireland.  RTE used to show him nearly every day.  Thank goodness we have not seen or heard anything of the Reverend Ian Paisley for a long time.  A lot of people feel if he was stowed away somewhere there would be a greater opportunity for peace in that area.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable apprehension recently in the United Kingdom over violence on television and some organisation, whose name escapes me, has been active regarding this showing of violence.  There is a film called &ldquo;The Virginian&rdquo;, which is shown on the BBC and has been shown extensively here.  I understand quite a <Col N="428" /> lot of people, such as those who get very little fresh air in their lives, who live in built-up areas, get quite a lot of enjoyment out of watching this. Those people imagine themselves in the wild west but against that you have got to remember it is a scene of violence.  We have also to remember that we live in an age in which people have largely given up reading and they get their knowledge and entertainment from what they can see.</P>
    <P>Every time you switch on &ldquo;The Virginian&rdquo; at least half a dozen people who are quick on the draw are shot.  It is very romantic because the hero gets the bad fellow down at the last moment and shoots maybe half a dozen people. We have got to consider the effect of this violence on immature youth.  The old boys and the old girls may sit back and enjoy &ldquo;The Virginian&rdquo; but it has a bad effect on youth.  In Britain they have recognised this fact, and an organisation has been created there to try and stop the showing of violence on television.  The productions on the BBC show more violence than those shown on Telefís Éireann.  I happen to be one of the people, due to the fact that I live near to Wales, who can get good BBC reception and when I see some of their films I notice there is a great deal of violence shown on them. This new organisation in Britain hope to do something about the showing of violence on television in that country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore said it is cheaper to get British films than it is to get American films.  I prefer British films to American films although there are many people who prefer the American films.  I do not like the American twang and the eternal talk about dollars.  I believe that Telefís Éireann could probably get British films produced in the 1930s, the 1940s and the early 1950s which were quite well produced, at a much cheaper rate than some of the other films they buy.  There is a tendency on Telefís Éireann to produce the old golden silent films.  I cannot see any better entertainment than ten minutes of a Charlie Chaplin film but unfortunately a lot of those films have got worn and tattered. Telefís Éireann could show more of those.  Our young people watch them <Col N="429" /> and they are far better for them than watching violence on some of the other films.  A lot of the violence and a lot of the robbery going on among youth today is instigated by the glamour attitude that is given to the crack gunman on television.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann do a lot of good and I do not want to criticise them unduly. However, I want to refer to factual programmes and experts.  The Government have been greatly criticised for saying something on the phone to Telefís Éireann in relation to Northern Ireland.  I believe Telefís Éireann should try and instruct the public more in world affairs.  We are told by the Minister for External Affairs that we are on the verge of our accession to the EEC.  Therefore, there should be far more discussions and symposia or statements on Telefís Éireann in relation to the EEC and what it means.  At least 90 per cent of the people in rural Ireland, and I do not suppose that Dubliners have any more intelligence than them, do not know what the EEC means to us.  Surely, a burning question like that should be continually discussed on Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>This country has more charitable inclinations and has subscribed more money to charity per head of the population than any other nation in the world.  There is at the moment one of the greatest disasters that has ever been seen taking place in the India/Pakistan confrontation but we have seen very little about that on Telefís Éireann. Large sums of money have been paid by people for the distressed people in that area.  I work behind the scenes in this matter and I know that money has been paid by old-age pensioners and other people with very little money so there is a wide interest in this confrontation. It is tied up with our missionary effort, which is one of the glories of this country still, despite the materialistic age we live in.</P>
    <P>We have had very little comment on that important subject on Telefís Éireann.  It is such an important subject because the third and fourth most populous countries in the world are being instigated to war at the moment by the communistic factions, one on <Col N="430" /> one side and the other on the other. They are encouraging the people in those countries to fight to the last man. Those facts should be shown on Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>When you switch on the news on Telefís Éireann it is almost entirely taken up with events in the North of Ireland.  I agree that every instance of violence and injustice should be made known to us but there is no reason why we should have five minutes about a bus which was burned by a gang of youths in Falls Road.  At least we are entitled to hear about things going on in other parts of the world.  Telefís Éireann should realise that the Six-County problem is not the only thing of importance to the people.  We are entitled to news from other parts of the world.  I have timed Telefís Éireann news and I found one night out of a news coverage of 20 minutes, 15 minutes were devoted to Northern Ireland and there was only a synopsis of things which happened in other parts of the world.  Our television service is there for the benefit of everybody and people should see and hear what is happening all over the world. I hope that Telefís Éireann will broaden their news outlook.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a very interesting debate.  First of all, I should like to thank the Deputies for the very kind remarks they made about me and for their expressions of appreciation for the improvements they found in the various services.  I would also like to express my appreciation of the compliments paid to the staff of my Department. It was a very pleasant experience for me to listen to praise of their courtesy and attention to duties.  I can assure Deputies that the praise which they gave in areas where they felt it was due will not lead to any feeling of complacency because I believe quite strongly that there is no room whatsoever for complacency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost all the criticism offered was constructive and helpful and it is only natural to expect that there should be some criticism of a department which employs over 20,000 people throughout the country and which daily handles millions of transactions with the public. <Col N="431" /> I fully realise how important it is that post office services should be provided efficiently and at the lowest cost and I wish to assure the House that the Department will, if anything, increase its efforts to achieve greater efficiency because this is particularly necessary in an inflationary situation such as we have at present with costs continually rising.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that earlier this year we had a debate lasting more than 22 hours and extending over six Dáil meetings between 25th February and 23rd March on the affairs of my Department and RTE.  My reply was correspondingly lengthy and ranged fully over all the questions raised in that marathon debate.  I was happy to hear several Deputies in the present debate refer back to the previous one and express the view that, as it took place such a short time ago, it is scarcely necessary now to go into all these matters fully again.  I share this view and, therefore, I propose in my reply to deal mainly with what seem to be the most important points made. If I fail to deal with any point raised by a Deputy and to which he attaches importance, I should be glad if he would inform me afterwards and I shall reply fully in writing.</P>
    <P>Numerous references have been made to particular RTE programmes or series of programmes.  While I retain responsibility for general oversight of the manner in which the Authority carries out its statutory functions, the Oireachtas have given RTE independence in the day-to-day management of broadcasting services.  Therefore, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on various views expressed in regard to programmes.  I am glad to note that the concensus of opinion has been that the Authority's programmes are giving general satisfaction.  This debate will be very carefully studied by RTE and all the suggestions made by Deputies will receive consideration.</P>
    <P>I want to say very emphatically that I fully support Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins in her observation that members of the House are entitled to criticise programmes on the occasion of a review like this without being exposed <Col N="432" /> to resentment by broadcasters.  In particular, I would regard it as most reprehensible that RTE itself should be used to give expression to any such resentment. I am very sorry indeed that the Deputy's reasonable and considered contribution to the debate on the Estimate for my Department last year in respect of RTE programmes should have led to her being embarrassed by nuisance telephone calls and otherwise.</P>
    <P>In a lighter vein I refer to a suggestion of Deputy Tully who expressed surprise that nobody had invented a three inch television aerial which would serve the purpose of high aerials which disfigure skylines not only in Ireland but in cities throughout the world.  The House will appreciate that this is outside my field of activity but I suggest that Deputy Tully should apply his own inventive genius to this problem and if he succeeds I imagine he should become the wealthiest man in the world.</P>
    <P>On the question of unsatisfactory reception of RTE television in some places as raised by Deputy Crowley and others, the television coverage is primarily a matter for the Authority.  I am advised that at present coverage extends to about 98 per cent of the State and the remaining 2 per cent relates to about 900 communities with about 20 households or more.  It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to give satisfactory coverage in all areas.  Priority is being given to improving service in the more densely populated areas and three transposers were brought into service in the Mayo-Galway area of poor reception in the past two years.  The next phase in the Authority's programme is to provide transposers in West Cork and Longford. Progress, naturally, will depend on the Authority's capital position.  In addition, work is being done to improve existing installations in order to get better reception.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by Deputy Cooney that the VHF service is an extravagance. I am advised that this service was provided because it was considered to be the best and cheapest solution to the problem of providing some broadcasting coverage in areas where medium wave coverage was unsatisfactory.</P>
    <Col N="433" />

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, it has the advantage of offering greatly improved quality of reception in areas where interference from foreign stations and equipment of various kinds degrades the quality of medium wave receptions.  Statistics of the number of VHF sets are not maintained in my Department but I am informed that an RTE survey showed that in November, 1970 the number of such sets was 112,000.  It is reasonable to expect that the number has grown substantially since then.  Deputy Desmond spoke of the desirability of having local radio stations of a public service nature under the supervision of RTE.  This suggestion is one of a number arising out of developments elsewhere which will probably be considered by the Broadcasting Review Committee. There were several references to RTE Relays and participation of RTE in wired television.  RTE's efforts in this field are aimed at offsetting the advertising loss bound to result from the inevitable development of wired television. The Government's decision in March, 1970, to relax restrictions on wired television specifically permitted entry of RTE into this field, mainly with the object of protecting its revenue.  Deputy Crowley, Deputy Desmond, and others referred to the Oireachtas broadcasting studio and said that the present facilities are inadequate. This is a matter primarily for RTE and the authorities concerned with accommodation.  I am sure they will give the criticism appropriate consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Crowley, Deputy Barry, Deputy Tully, Deputy Cooney and others, mentioned the possibility of a second television channel or multi-channel viewing throughout the State. Two major matters of policy were raised in this regard.  One was the request for a second RTE television channel to provide a choice for viewers. The second was a request by several Deputies to make British television programmes available throughout the State.  In view of the fact that comparatively recently I appointed a Broadcasting Review Committee on which a number of distinguished ladies <Col N="434" /> and gentlemen kindly agreed to serve in order to advise me on the future development of broadcasting, I am reluctant to express views on proposed major departures in policy which may well be under review by this committee.</P>
    <P>However, I can say that while there appear to be few if any objections in principle to a second RTE television channel, it would cost millions of pounds and this would seem to rule out its early introduction.  As regards bringing the British television services to the whole country, obviously many considerations arise and at this stage my only comment is that the cost alone, running to millions of pounds, would be such as to rule out the adoption of this proposal at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling in the course of his very eloquent address referred to a great number of points of much interest.  Virtually all these points dealt with the day-to-day working of RTE. Since the enactment of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs does not intervene in the day-to-day activities of RTE, but I am quite sure the members of the authority will read Deputy Dowling's remarks with interest and attention&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and will take any action necessary arising from them. Deputy Fitzpatrick from Dublin asked why is there a limit of 500 in the number of outlets permitted in communal aerial systems.  The limit is intended to keep multi-channel TV systems on a local basis.  If they were permitted on an unrestricted basis they would quickly upset the advantage of better quality reception offered by our national service and would seriously affect its revenue earning capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with attention to the very lengthy contribution of Deputy Dr. Browne in relation to RTE with the expectation, from quarter-hour to quarter-hour, that something interesting would emerge from his lengthy discourse.  I could identify only a few points of substance coming within the area of my functions under the Broadcasting <Col N="435" /> Authority Act, 1960, either directly or indirectly.  As regards the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra, with whose future the Deputy seemed concerned, I can tell him it is employed by RTE and I have not become aware of any anxiety anywhere except in the mind of the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy spoke at great length on the subject of violence and its portrayal on television.  I share the Deputy's dislike for any excessive display of violence on television and like many other people I often wonder whether it has not ill effects on young people.  I am sure the Deputy will be aware that extensive investigations have been made into this subject without any firm conclusions having been reached.  However, I have little doubt that the Broadcasting Review Committee will give attention to this subject and will in turn, if they think it necessary, report their opinions on the matter. I will certainly give consideration to their recommendations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne referred repeatedly to the direction given by me on 1st October last to the RTE Authority under section 31 of the 1960 Act, directing the authority to refrain from broadcasting any matter calculated to promote the aims or activities of any organisation which engage in, promote, encourage or advocate the attaining of any particular objective by violent means.  I am afraid that after it all I am not quite sure whether the Deputy approved or disapproved of the issue of this direction.  He criticised me for having referred only briefly to the issuing of the 1st October direction.  I had not thought it necessary, in view of the enormous amount of publicity the issuing of the direction had attracted in all the media, to describe again at length in the House the reason for the issuing of the direction.  I thought it sufficient to give only the final precipitant cause.</P>
    <P>However, in order to satisfy the Deputy I will re-cover the grounds already many times trodden at the time of the issue of the direction and since.  First of all, this was the first and only time on which the Minister for <Col N="436" /> Posts and Telegraphs used the powers of prohibition conferred on him by section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  The Minister for Justice on a number of occasions had referred to the question of members of illegal organisations being given publicity in the news media and had asked in the Dáil&mdash;he did so on 28th April, 1971&mdash; that the news media should exercise responsibility in the publication of propaganda emanating from subversive sources and very often actually claiming credit for serious criminal offences.</P>
    <P>The matter was raised in the Dáil again after the broadcasting of RTE's radio news programme on 20th June, 1971, on which members of an illegal organisation were interviewed.  Questions were put down for answer by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and myself, asking if representations were made directly or indirectly to RTE about the programme.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and I reaffirmed the view that it was not in the public interest that members of illegal organisations should be permitted to use such a programme for publicising their activities.  I had communicated this view to RTE before the programme was broadcast but did not issue a direction prohibiting the broadcast.</P>
    <P>On 1st October, 1971, following the appearance of members of an illegal organisation on the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme, I invoked section 31 of the Act and directed the authority in writing to refrain from broadcasting any matter of the following class: any matter that could be calculated to promote the aims or activities of any organisation which engage in, promote, encourage or advocate the attaining of any particular objective by violent means.  That direction was issued following a Government decision and the direction remains in operation and will continue that way as long as it is judged to be necessary.</P>
    <P>The conclusion of Deputy Dr. Browne's speech was rather puzzling. He looked forward to the possibility that people from Peking, from Budapest, Moscow, Paris and other places would tune in to Telefís Éireann but he felt that that glittering prospect had <Col N="437" /> been impaired by the loss to RTE of people like Leila Doolan, Jack Dowling, Muiris Mac Congaill. Deputies Thornley and Keating were included.  Perhaps he is right but I am afraid that if the people of Peking, Moscow, Budapest, Paris and the other places are to be deterred from viewing Telefís Éireann by the absence of these individuals, the fault will not be that of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who had no say whatsoever in their parting with RTE.  As regards the last two artists named, namely, the Deputy's colleagues. Deputies Thornley and Keating, I assume they left RTE in order the better to be able to enjoy the benefits of the Deputy's company in the House. If the whole world must suffer for that loss.  I cannot see why I should be blamed.</P>
    <P>On the question of the RTE archive material raised by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, from inquiries I have learned that in the past few years RTE have built up quite a considerable library organisation in which about 40 people are employed.  In the library are stored film, sound tapes, video tapes, &ldquo;stills&rdquo; and printed material.  The purpose of the library is to serve the programme departments.  A great deal of work has been done in cataloguing and storing material, but there are still arrears to be cleared up.  All tapes, after transmission, are passed to the library where they are retained and no tape may be cleaned without the approval of the head of the programme department concerned who, in doubtful cases, might refer a particular tape to an assistant programme controller who might in turn refer the question to the programme controller.  Thus the cleaning of tapes is not a haphazard matter.</P>
    <P>Tapes could be retained for a number of reasons.  They could be retained for repeat purposes, for the end of the year review, for their intrinsic, historical or literary content, for their sociological importance.  Material of little or no programme value might be retained for its historical or sociological value.  In calculating the amount of material on video tape which can be stored one has to have regard to the limitations of space and <Col N="438" /> the money involved.  The amount of space required can be reduced by transferring the material to film.  RTE have no facilities for such transferrence and the work has to be done in England and it cost about £400 per hour to have material transferred to film as against £100 an hour in the case of video tape.  Therefore, to retain material on film is very expensive but despite all this a lot of material has been transferred to film.  As to money, RTE would normally hold used tapes to the replacement value of £120,000 to £130,000.  There is a constant pressure to keep this investment at a reasonable level, having regard to all the needs involved.</P>
    <P>A large proportion of home productions is transmitted from video tape because of the difficulties associated with the live transmissions from studios.  This means that the consumption of tape is very high and there is also a big problem involved in storing it.  There is a constant pressure to release material from tape and I understand that there are no formal written policies on this question.  RTE consider that the arrangements in force for the preservation of recorded material are satisfactory.  However, I understand, as I stated already in reply to a Parliamentary Question, that they propose to consult with the various public archive authorities with a view to seeing whether any improvements in the arrangements are practicable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins and Deputy Cooney referred to reports of the erasing of video tapes of material recording performances of the late Seán Ó Riada and the late Jimmy O'Dea.  As to the Ó Riada tapes, the decision to clean them was based on the judgment that the material involved was not of high significance in the context of the whole volume of his work and on the expectation that there would be future occasions, on which to record for television, performance of a greater importance but we all know that the composer's untimely death frustrated this latter expectation.  There is, however, a substantial amount of Seán Ó Riada's work recorded on sound tape and held by RTE&mdash;about 15 hours in all.  In addition, RTE still have some <Col N="439" /> pieces featuring Seán Ó Riada on film. These include one piece of film of which I am aware, which features the composer talking of an tAthair Peadair Ó Laoghaire.  In hindsight, of course, it could be claimed that the cleaning of the tapes in question was, to some degree, an error of judgment, and that it might have been better if the best of the material had been selected and re-recorded for retention.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Jimmy O'Dea material, only the less interesting material was cleaned from the tapes involved and RTE have retained a lot of material portraying the late artist.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan O'Higgins referred to the matter of RTE's adherence to section 31.  I am confident that the Authority will carry out the direction in its terms and in its spirit and that hey will take any necessary action to secure conformity with it in every programme section.  The same Deputy mentioned that she had experience of delays in the local delivery of letters posted in Dublin.  If Deputy Hogan O'Higgins or any other Deputy who may experience such delays will forward the envelopes in question to this Department, we shall do our utmost to pinpoint the trouble and, if possible, eradicate it.</P>
    <P>The question of stamp-vending machines was mentioned by Deputy Barry.  Perhaps I should explain that it was not practicable to convert the machines that were used for selling stamps in the £sd currency to decimal currency operation.  Therefore, it was necessary that the machines be replaced by machines of a new design.  These new machines are in two types.  One is capable of being operated by a 5p coin and the other by a 10p coin.  The first is set to deliver three stamps in the denominations of 2½p, 1½p and 1p, while the other one will be set to deliver four stamps in the denominations 4p, 2p, 1½p and 2½p.  These machines were ordered in September, 1969 but the manufacturers experienced some production difficulties and delivery of the bulk of our requirements of the 5p coin machines was completed only very recently.  These have now been installed in Dublin and <Col N="440" /> in all but a few of the provincial head post offices.  Installation of them at the few offices concerned is held up by the need for structural works to accommodate them.  None of the machines to take the the 10p coin have yet been delivered but we expect to have them shortly.  It is proposed to instal these together with the 5p coin machines at the busier centres.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond mentioned the staggering of postings by large users and said that this would prevent bottlenecks occurring.  I would like to assure the Deputy and everybody else that every opportunity is availed of to enlist the co-operation of large users of the post in this matter.  There has been a limited amount of success to date and, naturally, our efforts are continuing but it must be appreciated that large users of the service have their own routines and problems and since they pay the Post Office for the service rendered they expect the Department to adjust to their requirements rather than <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>There was reference by Deputy Coogan to the Lettermore sub-post office appointment.  The facts in this case are the same as were published in the Department's statement that was issued on 8th November and which I quote:</P>
    <P>The attention of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has been drawn to an allegation that the transfer of the sub-post office at Lettermore, Galway, is being made &ldquo;for political reasons&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The facts are that the former sub-postmaster, Mr. O'Connor, was suspended in July, 1970, following a check of the sub-office accounts, and dismissed the following month. Since July, 1970, the sub-office business has been conducted by Departmental staff in premises rented from Mr. O'Connor.</P>
    <P>The vacancy was advertised in the normal way.  The applications were considered by the Departmental selection board, and the most suitable candidate, Mrs. O'Toole, was appointed.  Sub-postmasters handle large sums of public money and the <Col N="441" /> financial standing of candidates is an important element in determining suitability.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has also been made that the new post office will be in a public house.  The new sub-office is in premises adjoining but separated from a public house.  There are many other sub-post offices similarly located. </P>
    <P>Some local people, supported by outside agitators, have stirred up trouble apparently in favour of some unsuccessful candidate.  These people have cut the telephone line to the new post office and they have cut also the telephone line of the local dispensary doctor.  By their obstruction, they have prevented delivery of mail in the area and, also, they have prevented the removal of the telephone exchange and equipment from the old premises to the present post office, virtually cutting off telephone service in the area.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I do not intend giving in to this sort of blackmail. As I said, the former sub-postmaster had to be dismissed for reasons which I have indicated and the new sub-postmistress was selected in fair competition and her appointment will stand.  So far as the agitation in Lettermore has any local support other than that of possible disgruntled relatives of unsuccessful candidates and their supporters, I am sure this can be due only to local people being unaware of the facts.  Despite the physical obstruction that prevented engineering workmen from removing the exchange from the rented premises of the former sub-post master to the new office, I withheld a statement of the facts as long as I could.  This was for reasons of delicacy but eventually it became necessary to issue the statement I have quoted.</P>
    <P>I must say something that I know will be regarded as unpopular with certain sections of the Press and this is that I was disappointed with the behaviour of certain sections of the national Press in relation to the official factual statement issued by my directive. Only one of the four national morning newspapers&mdash;the <i>Irish Times</i>&mdash; published the statement.  In fairness, the <i>Independent</i> and the <i>Cork Examiner</i> carried abbreviated versions omitting <Col N="442" /> certain parts of it but I am afraid one morning paper&mdash;the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash; omitted the statement altogether.  The <i>Evening Press</i> did likewise but the <i>Evening Herald</i> carried the statement in full.  The newspapers had been carrying quite an amount of publicity about the Litir Mór affair for some time previously and there had been no difficulty about printing misleading, one-sided statements regarding the removal of the post office, but when it came to the question of publishing an official authorised statement of the facts I am afraid I did not get a fair crack of the whip except from the <i>Irish Times</i> and the <i>Evening Herald.</i>  We read a lot from time to time in our newspapers about allegations of censorship and the serious dangers in censorship of the Press&mdash;and I believe that this is something we should all abhor&mdash;but I believe that there was a certain selective censorship by suppression, in whole or in part, by newspapers of the facts of a situation regarding which misleading statements had been published in these same newspapers.  I believe that this censorship, or this omission, may have left some of the people of Litir Mór under a misapprehension about the facts in relation to the violent agitation which some of them are supporting.  I should be most interested to see whether the <i>Irish Press</i> which omitted my statement on the 9th November last will do the same thing with regard to the statement which I have now made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which is taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very low priority.  There are other priorities such as finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  I can assure Deputy Kavanagh it is not very low on the list of priorities at all. On the telephone side, Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins had some very hard <Col N="443" /> things to say about the telephone service. She said it was chaotic in Dublin and even worse in the country.  I would be the last person to deny certain shortcomings in the service but I cannot accept this exaggeration of the general quality of the service.  As I mentioned in my introductory statement, the service handles 327 million calls, that is about one million calls per working day and the great bulk of these calls are connected immediately or promptly and without any great difficulty.  Exaggerated complaint is unfair to the service and to the people who are trying to operate it. I am sure Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins would not want to be unfair to these people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond also suggested that there was a grave deterioration in the standard of service and maintenance. Both Deputies, as well as Deputies Tully, Barry and Cooney, referred to the shortage of capital for necessary telephone development as a cause of the deficiencies in the service.  I made it quite clear in my opening statement, as I also did last March, that the capital made available for telephone development is insufficient to keep the service up to the standard we want to see and to provide fully for the needs of the community.  More money has been made available this year and I am hopeful that in future years the need will be more fully met so that we can make the maximum progress with this very essential and profitable service.  As my public statements have made clear.  I share the views of Deputies on the need for heavy investment in the telephone service.  On the other hand, Deputies will realise that other important services, such as housing, hospitals and industrial development, also have claims on the national pool of available capital.  Nevertheless, I shall do everything possible to secure high priority for the needs of the telephone service.  It is a vital service which is necessary for the whole community and also very necessary for industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the backlog of telephone applications and to the increase in the waiting list in the past year.  It was not very pleasant <Col N="444" /> for me to report this increase but, as I explained, we have lacked the resources in skilled staff and capital to meet the explosive demand of recent years.  Perhaps I should again emphasise that to meet this demand promptly as it arises requires above all that plant be available on an extensive scale in advance throughout the country. We have had to restrict our efforts to instal additional telephones within the last year because of the general need to conserve capital.  We have already taken measures, following the allocation of additional capital by the Government, to recover lost ground in this regard.  Two of the more immediate difficulties are a lack of underground cable in Dublin and a few provincial areas, and temporary shortage of exchange equipment.  We are awaiting delivery of this equipment and when we have it we will be able to do reasonably good work in a reasonably short time.  It will take a considerable time to get all the equipment to meet the expanding needs.  Planning is going ahead on the basis that all the required capital will be available.  All I can say at this stage is that I sincerely hope that I shall get it.</P>
    <P>I think everybody realises that the post office will have to compete with other Government Departments for their share of the capital cake.  I hope it will be big enough to accommodate all of us.  It must be said, however, that the telephone administrations which can command far more resources in terms of capital and skilled personnel than we can and which are more highly developed telephonically have difficulty in meeting the demand for telephones.  Deputy Desmond said that an international telecommunication consortium would dearly love to get their hand on a bloc of 20,000 or so people looking for telephones.  I can assure him that such a consortium would have far greater scope for their activities in many other countries.  For example, in Britain earlier this year there were over 300,000 people waiting for telephones; in France 400,000 people; and in Holland, Belgium, Norway and Italy there were 126,000, 42,000, 32,000 and almost 200,000 applications respectively, awaiting attention.  Even the private enterprise <Col N="445" /> systems in the USA to which Deputy Desmond referred have waiting lists. I understand there are a million or more people with shared service in the USA who are awaiting exclusive lines.  In saying this I do not wish to convey any sense of complacency about our own waiting list but merely to indicate that meeting demands for telephones is not just a problem which we have but a problem which many other countries have.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies expressed the view that if the telephone service were independent its capital needs would receive preferential treatment.  I am afraid this is an over-optimistic view. I assure Deputies that in settling the State capital programme each year the Government decide the limits that can be afforded for all semi-State as well as all State organisations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins criticised the binding of the telephone directory and said that even the ones around the House here are in bits in no time.  In connection with another suggestion of hers she said that it is very irritating to find the directory thrown here and there.  Might I suggest there could possibly be a link between these two complaints?  Certainly, the directory will not last long if it is thrown about here and there.  In response to inquiries made as a result of the Deputy's complaint and a less moderately phrased one from Deputy Desmond, I am informed that the directories in the House on occasions go to pieces because irresponsible users tear pages from them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond referred to the directory as diabolical and went on to say that a six-year-old child would put a better cover on his school book than the cover on the directory.  He added that it was dreadful, that it should be harder and that the binding is also terrible.</P>

This suggestion has been made on a number of occasions and I am advised that instead of making the directory better it would possibly have a worsening effect on it because it would weaken the binding and would slow down production by about two months and I doubt if a hole in the corner would compensate for its being two months out of date.</P>

      <P>Several Deputies referred to the provision of telephone kiosks.  There are at the moment 1,850 in the country and of these about 163 were provided last year.  In every post office there is a public telephone or call office.  The distribution of post offices throughout the country is such that most people are within a few miles, at most, of a public telephone. As a rule, towns with populations of under 500 would not support two public telephones.  Accordingly, the call office in the sub-post office usually ceases on the provision of a kiosk. The advantage lies with the kiosk in that it provides a 24 hour continuous service whereas a call office is normally open during office hours.</P>
      <P>A change of policy in regard to the provision of telephone kiosks was introduced in 1969.  It was decided then to allow a modest subsidy in the case of kiosks in rural areas and to make more rapid progress in the provision of kiosks in those areas.  It was also decided that this could best be done by replacing by kiosks the call office telephones in rural sub-post offices which were used to a fair extent.  The provision of kiosks in rural areas where there is no post office is not envisaged under the expanding rural kiosk programme.  Apart from the difficulty of measuring the use likely to be made of a kiosk where there is no public telephone, there is little doubt that, by and large, a population that is not sufficiently large to warrant a sub-post office is not likely to make nearly sufficient calls to warrant the provision of a telephone kiosk.  The effect of the 1969 decision has been to increase the number of rural kiosks provided from 48 in the year ended March, 1969, to 129 in the year ended March, 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to explain to the House that the expanded rural kiosk programme involves considerable expenditure of capital and engineering staff time and, having regard to all the urgent tasks which we have in hands, such as the extension of trunk system, <Col N="448" /> exchanges, underground and overhead cabling, connection of subscribers' lines, provision of telephone kiosks in other rural areas, that is areas where there is no post office or where the call office telephone in the local post office is little used, I am afraid we cannot do any more than we are doing at present.</P>
    <P>While the ideal&mdash;this has been mentioned by several Deputies, Deputy Crowley was very strong on it&mdash;might be to have a kiosk in every tiny community, I believe we have to be realistic in our priorities.  But I want to spell out very clearly that if a local authority wishes to have a telephone kiosk provided in an out-of-the-way place and will guarantee it against loss, my Department will arrange for it.  This has been done in some places. I see Deputy Kavanagh is smiling.  I gave him the suggestion some months ago and I think his local authority have put it into operation and the matter is under consideration in other places.  It is something that, apparently, members of local authorities are not fully aware of.  We will be only too glad to help them on this if they want to take it up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully suggested that the equipment required for post office purposes should be manufactured in this country.  I should like to inform the House and the Deputy that many engineering stores used by the post office are, in fact, made in this country. Expansion of the scope of production of equipment of this kind is, of course, primarily a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the IDA. Let me say, however, that I share Deputy Tully's views on this point and the matter which he mentioned has been receiving active consideration by the IDA and is being fully supported by my Department.</P>
    <P>Now we come to a hardy annual&mdash; vandalism in telephone kiosks.  Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins and other Deputies referred to the number of telephone kiosks which are out of action as a result of vandalism.  My Department is doing what is practicable to reduce such vandalism, which is almost entirely an urban problem.  We are trying to keep this urban problem of <Col N="449" /> vandalism to a minimum.  Sites are selected where the kiosk is likely to be least vulnerable to vandalism.  For example, we try to site them in well-lighted thoroughfares, near shopping centres, or near Garda barracks, if at all possible, but we do know that kiosks have been subjected to excessive vandalism and those that have been so subjected have to be removed to alternative sites, or else we have to take them away altogether.  Other measures have been taken to reduce the incidence of vandalism, but not with the success that we would wish. These include the replacement of small glass panes with very strong plastic material and the fitting of steel plates to the backs of kiosks to enable the coin boxes to be more securely secured. We are having reasonable success here but I should like to say that vandalism in telephone kiosks is not just a problem in this country.  It occurs in many other countries.  We are keeping in touch with other administrations to see how they combat it and, of course, we are always open to suggestions and would welcome constructive suggestions from any quarter to help us to overcome this problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald referred to a great many things and I shall deal with what I consider to be one of the important things he spoke about, namely, the reverse charge facilities. Under reversed charge facilities for telephone calls, the person who calls accepts the charge for the call made by him on behalf of the person called and requests the reversal of the charge at the booking stage.  These facilities have been available for some time on traffic between Ireland and the USA, Ireland and Canada and Ireland and Mexico.  Under the accounting arrangements revenue from all calls in both directions is divided on a 50/50 basis. Consequently this facility involves neither a loss nor a gain of revenue on either side.  As all calls are controlled by the operator in Dublin, New York or Montreal there is no difficulty in recording the necessary details for the purpose of subsequent accounting arrangements.  We have made proposals to the British Post Office to introduce reversed charge facilities on <Col N="450" /> traffic between the two countries and we are awaiting their reply.</P>
    <P>With regard to continental calls, reversed facilities are available on our direct route to France and Spain. Where other continental services are concerned, the position is that outgoing calls are booked at Dublin and passed to the continental exchange in London, which subsequently controls and supervises the call; the call is normally connected directly with the Irish subscriber. Similarly, incoming calls are switched from London.  Reversed charge facilities here could cause operating and accounting difficulties. The ordinary revenue on telephone calls from Ireland and continental countries is such that a reduction of facilities could lead to a loss of revenue to the Department.  It is unlikely that we will be able to overcome this difficulty until the new international exchange is provided in Dublin late in 1973 or early in 1974. Deputy FitzGerald said that he believed that these facilities were not in existence at all.  I shall be charitable and refrain from saying too much about this belief on the Deputy's part; if he can find the time to make inquiries he will find that the facilities are actually there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins referred to the service in the Waterville area as being a bad service.  Waterville is regarded as a well-run exchange.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Cahirciveen is also regarded as a well-run exchange.  I understand the service in Waterville was adversely affected up to about March of this year because of a shortage of switchboards.  That situation was remedied in March and there is no reason now why the service should not be a good one.  I know from what the Deputy said and from conversations I have had with her that things are not as good as I would like them to be at the peak of the summer season.  I have a certain sympathy with the Deputy because I, too, visit that part of the country when time permits.  I must say, however, that I have no difficulty what <Col N="451" /> ever in getting through to Cahirciveen exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is unfair. It could happen that something might be wrong at the Waterville end.  I shall have the matter investigated and I will get in touch with the Deputy.  Last August things were not too good in Cahirciveen because of the exceptionally busy season.  We will keep the position under review.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully referred to overloading at Navan and to the fact that outlying areas&mdash;Trim, Nobber and Athboy &mdash;were connected to it.  In the original planning it was arranged that these exchanges would be connected to Navan because Navan acts as a transit centre. This is a standard arrangement in telephone operations.  Because of the very rapid growth in telephone traffic the switchboard equipment at Navan became overloaded in the summer of 1970 and, as a result of that overloading, some subscribers encountered occasional difficulty in dialling; they got no dial tone, the engaged signal or wrong numbers.  Additional switchboard equipment was installed towards the end of 1970 and a complete overhaul of the exchange was carried out. Additional equipment was also installed this year.  The service for existing subscribers is now satisfactory. Further equipment is on order and it is expected to be installed before the end of next June.  Because of the difficulties experienced by subscribers in the area caution is being exercised about adding new subscribers pending the installation of further equipment next June.  Certain priority orders are, of course, being met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully was concerned about the provision of adequate room for extensions to new telephone exchange buildings to meet future needs.  New buildings are generally planned in such fashion as to meet estimated requirements up to 20 years ahead.  Longer forward provision is made in the case of sites when possible.  Some existing buildings are not adequate for present needs but these were planned many <Col N="452" /> years ago.  In others the demand for telephones and the volume of call traffic increased at a rate which could not have been foreseen at the planning stage.  Steps have been taken to remedy this situation and, in estimating future requirements, my Department keeps in close touch with the development authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. Barry referred to the delivery of telegrams at weekends and on bank holidays.  Arrangements for delivery on Saturday are the same as those on other weekdays.  Full delivery of telegrams on Sundays and bank holidays would not be justified. A very small number of telegrams would be involved and effective staffing would be very difficult and extremely expensive.  It must be remembered that the telegraph service operates at a substantial loss.  However telegrams are delivered to telephone or telex subscribers on Sundays and bank holidays and in Dublin city special arrangements exist for the delivery of urgent telegrams by hand.  If an exceptionally urgent telegram is received for a provincial area the Central Telegraph Office in Dublin makes special efforts to arrange for the delivery of that telegram. I can assure everybody that life and death messages always receive special treatment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also referred to the Central Sorting Office in Dublin.  Plans for the installation of a mechanised ventilation system throughout the building are well advanced and it is expected work will commence by next April or May.  The installation will take about 12 months to complete.  It is hoped the new system will provide satisfactory ventilation as well as counteracting excessive solar heat.  The staff are being kept informed about progress.  We hope the system will be in operation in 1973.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also referred to the lack of parking facilities for staff cars at the Central Sorting Office.  There is parking for bicycles and autocycles in the building.  There is on-street parking available for cars.  Unfortunately, as the Deputy said, parked cars are frequently damaged by vandals.  The gardaí have been asked to exercise increased vigilance in this area.  I will <Col N="453" /> look into the Deputy's suggestion about a possible parking space being made available in the locality for renting.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned the proposed new offices at Ballsbridge, Donegal and Mullingar.  The proposal by a private developer for the leasing of accommodation to be built to our requirements on a new site at Shelbourne Road, Ballsbridge, looks very promising and is being followed up. In the case of Donegal final sketch plans have been approved.  The Commissioners of Public Works advise that working drawings are being prepared but they cannot say at this stage when building work will commence there. I assume that this year's small Office of Public Works allocation is for the preliminary work connected with the building.  So far as Mullingar is concerned, sketch plans were received by my Department on 22nd November and are now being examined.  My remark about the small Office of Public Works provision for Donegal applies also to Mullingar.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney inquired about the proposed new post office at Longford. I understand from the Commissioners of Public Works that final sketch plans are being prepared but it is too early to forecast when building work is likely to commence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins said that postmen's uniforms were drab, dreary and ill-fitting.  Deputy Barry spoke about pre-First World War uniforms.  New type uniforms have been issued to established postmen for the last two years.  They are of a type advocated by the men's union and are made of improved quality cloth.  The old type uniform which was first issued in 1952 is still being issued on a restricted basis to temporary and auxiliary postmen until stocks run out. I am convinced that uniforms should not be ill-fitting because they are stocked in 49 different sizes and every effort is made to supply a suitable fitting uniform.  I do not think, however, we would have anything to fit the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, he is too big.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised the matter of light-weight summer uniforms for postmen.  A proposal for light-weight summer jackets was fully considered <Col N="454" /> some years ago but it was not favoured on the grounds that in Irish weather conditions warm spells are of relatively short duration and can be countered by adjustment in ordinary clothing.  We have had no great demand for light-weight uniforms from the staff in recent years.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald seemed to be preoccupied with the idea that the trunk call pass card system operated by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is something we are trying to hide.  If the Deputy took time off from other matters he would find that this is not so.  Any telephone subscriber may request to have a trunk call pass card issued to him or a nominated person.  Persons holding these cards may make trunk calls, including overseas calls through an operator from any telephone.  The charges are debited in due course to his own telephone account.  Just to show how wrong the Deputy is there are 2,000 cards in operation at the moment, but I shall be far more charitable in my remarks about Deputy FitzGerald than he was in some of his remarks.</P>
    <P>The question of pensions for auxiliary postmen was raised again this year by many Deputies.  When replying to the Estimate last year I stated that a staff claim for pensions for part-time and unestablished full-time civil servants was being considered at the general council under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for civil servants.  Since then a measure of agreement has been reached on that claim.  The agreement provides for a pension scheme for all full-time unestablished civil servants but it was not possible to agree to the introduction of a pension scheme for part-time civil servants.  The retirement gratuity for part-time staff has been improved considerably.  They now receive a gratuity calculated on the basis of one week's pay for each of the first 15 years of service and two weeks pay thereafter subject to a maximum of 78 weeks pay.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note there is general agreement that the pay of staff should continue to be settled on the basis of fair comparison with other workers and accordingly when other workers <Col N="455" /> get increases to meet increases in the cost of living Post Office workers should get them too.  Many Deputies referred to the claims for political rights for Post Office staffs.  Discussions on this claim are continuing at the Post Office departmental council under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on it at this particular stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond raised the question of whether the Post Office should have a computer of its own and whether computer work for the Civil Service as a whole should not be co-ordinated and centralised.  Co-ordination in matters of this kind in the Civil Service is exercised by the Department of Finance and the decision that the Post Office should have a computer of its own was taken only after full examination of the various alternatives and after consideration of expert advice which we received on the subject This does not rule out the possibility of centralisation later should the balance of advantage then lie in the adopting of that course.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully and other Deputies considered that the rate of interest paid by the Post Office Saving Bank is not sufficiently attractive and should be increased.  This is a matter which comes within the bailiwick of the Minister for Finance.  The present rate of 4 per cent compares favourably with the rate of 3 per cent now allowed by the commercial banks on deposits under £25,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney did not think there had been enough publicity regarding saving certificates and instalment savings. He felt the Department should review its advertising policy with a view to giving its saving schemes a glamour image.  In regard to advertising the Post Office savings service is advised by one of the leading and best known advertising agencies in the country.  I believe some of the recent advertisements do give its savings scheme a glamour image.  I have in mind the recent, &ldquo;Your passport to dreams&rdquo; slogan and the &ldquo;Back a Savings Certificate&rdquo; advertisement. An advertising campaign on instalment <Col N="456" /> savings ran for two months recently and covered all the advertising media including television, radio and the cinema.  The savings certificate campaign began in mid-November and will continue until the first week of December. A total of £80,000 has been allocated for advertising Post Office savings in 1977-72.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney thought there had been a falling off in sales of the eighth issue savings certificates and instalments savings after a good start in each case.  Although there has been some falling off both schemes are still going well.  In October sales of savings certificates amounted to £819,000 and almost 4,000 instalments savings agreements were received representing total annual savings of over £700,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins spoke of some difficulties in the collection of social welfare benefits in rural areas because of the closing of sub-post offices.  The number of offices we have closed is quite small.  The closing of a sub-post office should not create problems for old age pensioners because pensioners who are unable or who do not wish to collect their pensions personally can nominate an agent to do so on their behalf and this facility is availed of by many pensioners.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins also spoke about taking the Post Office or the telephone side anyway, out of the Civil Service.  I am sure she is aware that a rather different recommendation was made in the Devlin Report and that that recommendation and other related ones are under consideration by the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to the Devlin Report recommendation that the Post Office should be merged with the Department of Transport and Power into a new Department of Transport and Communications.  This was made within the framework of the major recommendation that policy-making should be separated from the execution of policy and, pending a decision on the major recommendations, consideration of the amalgamation proposal has not progressed very far.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne referred to the <Col N="457" /> giro system and he went on to make some rather large claims for it such as &ldquo;it could provide the Government with a large amount of capital for expenditure on housing&rdquo;.  The post office giro system is a current account system with cheque facilities which has operated with varying degrees of success in many western European countries where banking and post office remittance services have developed on different lines to this country. Giro has been established in the British Post Office.  Very high expectations had been expressed by its advocates but I imagine Deputies are aware that its success in Great Britain has been limited so far&mdash;and there have been, in fact, very heavy losses on the service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister calling that a success?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  If the Deputy thought I was claiming success for the British giro system, I can assure him I was not.  I was showing that the advocates of the giro system said it would be a great success; in fact, it has not been the success they thought it would be and they have lost a lot of money on it.</P>
      <P>For our country giro would be a major innovation and serious financial and organisational problems would have to be solved.  The view has been taken that until there is a strong public demand for this service and a clear indication that it could pay its way, the introduction of giro&mdash; although certainly a possibility to be kept in mind&mdash;cannot be given a high priority in the many demands on the Department and on the State's resources.</P>
      <P>So far as the recent bank strike is concerned, the indications are that the public found the Department's existing remittance service satisfactory.  It would not have been possible to introduce giro quickly and its introduction in the context of an industrial dispute would not necessarily have made it any easier.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald referred to the increases in postal and telecommunication charges made in 1970 and sought information concerning the increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="458" /> I am forced to conclude that the Deputy has forgotten that since those increases were made we had a 22-hour debate on the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in February and March last.  At that time there was ample opportunity, which was availed of by many Deputies, to deal with this subject.  Possibly the Deputy overlooked the matter because his attendance in the House during that long debate, which extended over a four-week period, was confined to the period when he was speaking.  Therefore, having missed the rest of the debate he was unaware of the discussion that had taken place.  However, I am anxious to be as helpful as possible to the Deputy as to where he could find information in relation to the causes for the increase in rates.  I would refer him to the Press statement issued when the increases were announced, to the notes for the information of Deputies circulated in February last in advance of the debate, and to the records of the debate itself. If the Deputy requires any further assistance I suppose I should say I will do my best to help him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan O'Higgins thought that postal and telegraph charges cannot be increased further and she would not advocate increasing telephone charges.  There has been a good deal of critical comment in some newspapers about my statement that the question of a further adjustment of post office charges will have to be considered shortly.  I should like to point out that I made this statement after mentioning that there had been an overall surplus of £512.756 in 1969-70 but that it was expected that the accounts for 1970-71 would show that this surplus had been converted to an overall deficit of £1½ million and that it appeared there would be an even higher deficit in 1971-72 and for 1972-73.  I added I was not in a position to say any more at that time.</P>
    <P>I considered it necessary to refer to the possibility that charges might have to be adjusted before long because the Department's financial position is deteriorating, mainly as a result of the inflation that has been with us for some years past.  Obviously, some <Col N="459" /> action will have to be taken to remedy this situation.  As proposals for dealing with the problem have not been prepared yet, I am not able to give the House any further information on the question of charges at present but I should like to make a few general comments on the financial situation.</P>
    <P>During this debate it was not recommended by any Deputy that post office services should be curtailed in any way. Deputy Tully was the only person to mention this possibility, but his attitude was that he hoped it was not proposed to follow the example of the British Post Office of reducing the number of deliveries.  On the other hand, several Deputies recommended that various things should be done which would involve further expenditure, thereby increasing the overall deficit.  We had many recommendations for the erection of greater numbers of telephone kiosks in rural areas as a social service, not on the basis of whether they paid their way.  There were suggestions for an improvement of postmen's uniforms; of going ahead more rapidly with the building of new post offices and improving the appearance of existing offices; improvements in the pensions, gratuities and pay of auxiliary postmen; better pay for sub-postmasters and a special allowance to cover the cost of painting their premises; extensions of scholarship schemes, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>However, unless existing services are seriously curtailed, we must face the fact that with the present charges there will be an increasing deficit in my Department's operations during the present inflationary period.  The question then arises whether this deficit should be met by the taxpayers or by the users of the services the Department provide.  In the Official Report dated 25th February, 1971, at column 2130, when introducing the Estimate for my Department, I stated:</P>
    <P>It is obviously more equitable that they should be met by the users because the public use the Post Office services in widely differing degree.</P>
    <P>A decision to meet the deficit from general taxation would benefit mostly the larger users and would mean that <Col N="460" /> the Minister for Finance would have so much less available for other purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald indicated that more frequent modest increases in charges to keep pace with rising inflationary costs were preferable to a delay in increasing charges and then making a substantial increase, such as that made last year.  I am inclined to share this point of view and in my opening statement.  I mentioned that recent and forthcoming increases in costs such as wages would make a review of post office charges necessary.  I believe I am correct in assuming from the Deputy's remarks that he and his party would support proposals for reasonable increases in post office charges to meet inescapable rises in costs.  If there is a decision to increase charges the matter will be dealt with in the ordinary way. Statutory orders, which would have to be laid before the House, would be necessary for any increase except telephone rentals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney made a fairly lengthy contribution to the debate in which he concentrated largely on the finances of the Department.  I am sure the Deputy was endeavouring to be helpful but he appears to be under a serious misapprehension about the Department's accounts.  This led him astray, so much so that I think it would be fruitless for me to attempt to reply in detail to the various points he made.  He appears to be unaware that the Department produce annually a profit and loss account with details of income and expenditure and a balance sheet in respect of all its operations, with separate accounts for the postal, telegraph and telephone services and agency services. The accounts are published by the Stationery Office and are presented to the Oireachtas annually.  The accounts for the year ended 31st March last are not yet in final form.  For this reason the figures quoted in the notes which I circulated to Deputies in advance of the Estimate were for the year 1969-70 the latest year for which audited commercial accounts are available.</P>
    <P>That covers as best I can the many many points raised in the course of the debate.  If any Deputy feels he would like a reply to anything which I did <Col N="461" /> not cover, I will certainly be only too glad to oblige him.  I should like once again to thank Deputies for their helpful and constructive criticisms during the course of this very interesting debate and in particular for the kind remarks they made regarding the staff of my Department.  The debate was a very friendly one and in a very low key.  To my mind, this is one of the few Departments which can have its Estimate debated in such a calm and sensible manner.  I am grateful to Deputies for the co-operation we got this year.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £16,806,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1972, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Transport and Power, including certain services administered by that Office and for payment of sundry grants-in-aid. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to take a Supplementary Estimate of £5,459,000 for the purpose of defraying further charges on the Transport and Power Vote for the current year, arising out of additional grants to Córas Iompair Éireann and Bord Fáilte Éireann and to provide for additional expenditure under Subhead P., Commissions, Committees <Col N="462" /> and Special Inquiries, arising out of industries like CIE and the ESB. Savings of £300,000 are also being taken into account.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that the Vote for Transport and Power was passed without a debate on 11th December, 1970, and that Supplementary Estimates amounting to £3,622,470 were also passed during the last financial year.  A motion was put on the Order Paper subsequently to enable a debate to take place on the activities of the Department of Transport and Power for that year.  It is proposed to take the motion and the current year's Estimate together.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that Deputies may have some difficulty in following comparisons with the 1970-71 provision and for this reason a tabular statement has been circulated which it is hoped will clarify the position.  This includes the Supplementary Estimates I have just mentioned.  The principal increases in 1971-72 as compared with the previous year are in the provisions for Salaries, Wages and Allowances £215,000 (Subhead A); Equipment, Stores and Maintenance £38,300 (Subhead C); Additional Grant to Córas Iompair Éireann £1,484,000 (Subhead D.3) after taking into account the Supplementary Estimate in the previous year and the present Supplementary Estimate; Grants-in-aid under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1961, £529,990 (Subhead F.1); Resort Development £100,000 (Subhead F.2); Development of Holiday Accommodation £1,300,000 (Subhead F.3); Acquisition of Land and Buildings at Airports £90,000 (Subhead G.1); Radio Equipment £100,000 (Subhead I); Rural Electrification £175,000 (Subhead N).  Small increases in other subheads amount to £92,050, bringing the gross increase to £4,124,340.</P>
    <P>The principal decreases in 1971-72 are in the provisions for Travelling and Incidental Expenses £130,820 (Subhead B.1); Investment Grants for Ships £1,065,000 (Subhead S), and the nonrecurring grant to CIE which amounted to £642,460 in 1970-71.  Small decreases in other subheads amount to £26,947 bringing the gross decreases to £1,865,227.</P>
    <P>The appropriations-in-aid show an <Col N="463" /> increase of £357,583 as compared with 1970-71.  The principal increases are Passenger Load Fee (replacing Passenger Service Charge) at Airports £110,000 (Subhead V.3); Recoupment from Eurocontrol £110,000 (Subhead V.4); Surplus on Shannon and Cork Airports £259,000 (Subhead V.8). Decreases are on the Surplus on Dublin Airport £145,000 (Subhead V.7) and Sales and Catering Service £11,000 (Subhead V.9).  The increase of £357,583 on Appropriations-in-Aid is equivalent to a decrease in the net grant and brings total decreases to £2,222,810.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the total increases and decreases mentioned above, namely £4,124,340 increase and £2,222,810 decrease, the net increase compared with the 1970-71 provision is £1,901,530.</P>
    <P>The activities of the Department fall into two main categories, those which are carried out by State-sponsored organisations and those which are administered directly by the Department. Deputies have received copies of the most recent reports of the various State-sponsored organisations. The information in the reports is supplemented by the notes which I have circulated for the information of Deputies in connection with this debate.</P>
    <P>First, I propose to deal with the State-sponsored organisations.</P>
    <P>The country's demand for electricity continued to increase at a high rate, being 10.4 per cent higher in 1970-71 than in the preceding year.  This continuing rate of increase&mdash;the average for the last three years was also over 10 per cent&mdash;is one of the highest in Europe.  It is an indication of the rapid growth in industrial development and of higher living standards generally.</P>
    <P>The growth in demand calls for very substantial annual investment by the ESB in generating, transmission and distribution equipment.  I have approved the board's forward generating plant programme for the years 1975-76 to 1977-78.  This will consist of two 250 megawatt oil fired units at Tarbert, County Kerry, and another at Pigeon House &ldquo;B&rdquo;, Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="464" /> By 1977-78, the board's generating capacity will be 2,800 megawatts&mdash; almost double the existing capacity. The estimated capital cost of this expansion is £36 million.  Further expenditure on additional generating plant totalling about £85 million is expected to come up for approval during the next three to four years.  With the development in the technology of nuclear generating plant and the growth in the unit size of ESB plant, the installation of a nuclear plant has been under consideration.  A nuclear station would provide some diversification of sources of fuel supply. While no firm decision has yet been made to build a nuclear station, the ESB have for some time past been training engineers in nuclear work and have got together a special project team to examine in detail all the technical, economic, social and financial problems connected with the operation of a nuclear plant.  The board will need to consider all aspects of such a project, which could cost up to £80 million, before coming to a decision to recommend an installation to the Government.  In this connection I might mention that a new dimension has been given to this problem by the recent discovery off Kinsale of what appears to be a promising natural gas find.  While further testing and exploratory drilling will be required before it is established that there is a gas field capable of commercial operation in this area, the ESB will be closely watching developments over the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>The capital cost of a generating plant based on natural gas would be about 60 per cent of equivalent nuclear capacity.  Existing and planned oil-fired stations could be converted to natural gas at a relatively low cost. A gas discovery within the area would, of course, have enormous advantages from the point of view of security of energy supplies.</P>
    <P>With increased costs, and bearing in mind the board's statutory obligation to keep their accounts in balance, periodic increases in charges have been unavoidable.  The cost of their main fuel, oil, did not, in 1970-71, reflect the substantial increases in price which have been imposed by the producing <Col N="465" /> countries, but in the current and following years fuel oil is going to cost a great deal more.  There were increases in the cost of turf fuels, but increases in the ESB's substantial payroll&mdash;they employ nearly 12,000 workers whose remuneration must be kept in line with national trends&mdash;and substantial increases in the cost of capital were more significant.  For some years the board have had to invest about £20 million per annum in generating, transmission and distribution equipment and, within the next decade, they could have to invest a total of over £300 million.  The cost of borrowing has risen very much and the periods for which loans are available have shortened considerably.  The result is that the necessary annual appropriations for the servicing of capital have had to be increased accordingly.  Capital is scarce as well as being expensive and the board have had to go abroad for a significant part of their requirements.  Indeed, the scarcity of new capital may force the ESB to rely for funds for new investment to a much larger extent on their own resources, that is on additional appropriations from an increased revenue.</P>
    <P>The board must at least maintain their charges at such a level that revenue covers expenditure and normal appropriations.  Servicing of capital is a proper cost of production of electricity and it will be impossible for the board, both because of their statutory obligation to pay their way and because they must be able to demonstrate their creditworthiness to prospective lenders, both home and foreign, to hold electricity prices below the cost of production.  To permit the board to balance their books by way of subsidy instead of by increasing charges would not help.  It would merely mean a transfer of responsibility from consumers to taxpayers&mdash; two groups which are largely identical. There is no reasonable alternative to enabling the ESB to meet their expenditure. An examination into the costs of the ESB is proceeding.  The net position is that once it is established that costs are reasonable, then there can be no question of the ESB not being allowed to recover these <Col N="466" /> costs and provide the depreciation and other reserves necessary to enable them to function viably.  We must, of course, be satisfied that the management is effective and that policy is on sound lines.  The management structure was recently subjected to close examination by a firm of consultants, McKinsey and Co. and their recommendations have been implemented.</P>
    <P>On the matter of policy and costs the Government has been satisfied that the ESB have been operating efficiently. Nevertheless, it felt it reasonable that these aspects should again be looked at objectively by experts and accordingly I have appointed a group to carry out the necessary investigation and to report to me.  This group is comprised of persons of high international standing in the diverse fields of activity which arise in the electric power production and distribution industry.</P>
    <P>I have been giving consideration also to the possibilities of more rational use of various forms of energy with a view to seeing whether more economic use of fuels can be achieved and more reduction achieved in the capital investment necessary to convert fuels into energy for consumption.  It is with this in mind that I have invited the ESB and the Dublin Gas Company to meet me for exploratory talks.</P>
    <P>Before departing from the question of charges, I think I should stress that, although rates of charge may appear to be rising quite quickly, the increasing efficiency of the ESB, the more widespread utilisation of the lower follow-on rates of charge and the greater use of cheaper electricity in the off-peak and night periods have resulted in the average price per unit received by the board being only 13 per cent greater in 1970-71 than it was as long ago as 1935.  This is quite an achievement in view of the erosion in the value of money in that time.  Of course, the structure of electricity tariffs varies considerably, and some consumers may feel that their two-monthly bills are high for the amount of current they use.  Actual consumption is not the sole measure of the cost to any electricity producer of having supply available to a consumer the moment he demands it however.  In some countries there is a multitude of suppliers, each <Col N="467" /> with his own tariff, instead of a single national supplier as in this country.</P>
    <P>In general, the board's tariffs compare very favourably with most West European tariffs, especially for domestic supplies.  British, Dutch and French tariffs for big industries are about the same as the board's rates.  It is true that large industrial users in Norway, Sweden and Switzerland have cheaper power but in those countries cheap hydro-power is the main source of supply.  In addition, more industrialised and more densely populated countries have much more favourable conditions for minimising distribution costs and getting the cost advantages of very large generating plants, including nuclear plants, which require a very high load factor.</P>
    <P>I dealt very fully with rural electrification when introducing the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1971, before the summer recess.  In accordance with the Government's intention, as explained at that time, the ESB are now engaged in a crash programme to complete the massive task of rural electrification which began in 1946, by offering supply at subsidised rates to all unconnected householders in rural areas by 31st March, 1975.  This programme will cost about £18 million towards which the State will pay subsidy amounting to £10 million.  This expenditure will bring the total cost of rural electrification to £67 million including direct State subsidy amounting to £27 million.</P>
    <P>The continuing and rapid growth in the ESB's activities naturally raised the question of the need for changes in top management organisation and procedures. Following an extensive review, to which I have already referred, a revised structure of top management and procedures has been put into effect.  The new structure, which draws a clear distinction between policy making and managerial functions, means that in future the board will be concerned with major planning and policy issues and their direct involvement in executive decisions will be limited.  A new post of chief executive has been established, with overall responsibility for management, and <Col N="468" /> accountable to the board for the implementation of approved plans and policies.  The new structure resulted in the appointment of directors in charge of each of the four main areas of activity &mdash; generation transmission, finance, commercial, personnel; the directors and the secretary will report through the chief executive.  Other organisational changes are also planned by the board.</P>
    <P>Harvesting conditions for peat in 1970, although not as good as 1969, were only slightly below average, and Bord na Móna reached a satisfactory production level.  On the sales side the board had a satisfactory year; substantially increased quantities of both machine turf and briquettes were disposed of in the domestic market but the quantities of both sod and milled peat delivered to the ESB were slightly down on the previous year.</P>
    <P>As regards the financial position, Deputies may recall that, by 31st March, 1968, Bord na Móna's debit balance had amounted to £4.8 million, due largely to the bad weather during the 1960s.  The Turf Development Act, 1968, was enacted to give the board some temporary financial relief in the form of a waiver of interest and the deferment of capital repayments due by the board to the Exchequer in the four-year period ending in March, 1971.</P>
    <P>By 31st March, 1970, the financial position of the board was improved considerably.  Waivers of interest, totalling £4.226 million, and commercial profits of £549,000 reduced the board's deficit to £37,000.  This improved financial position enabled the board to make good during 1969-70 deferred capital repayments, so that their capital repayments are up to date.</P>
    <P>The year 1970-71 was a satisfactory year for turf production and Bord na Móna finished the year with a credit balance of £1,408,000.  However, interest amounting to £562,000 due to the Exchequer was waived, otherwise the credit balance would have been reduced to £846,000.  This is the final remission under the 1968 Act and it leaves the board with a small reserve of funds to meet contingencies.  Harvesting conditions in 1971 were quite satisfactory and the board expect that they will be able to meet their liabilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> At the same time as the Turf Development Act, 1968, was passed, my predecessor arranged for the appointment of a firm of consultants to examine the affairs of Bord na Móna, both from engineering and financial standpoints, and to assess future prospects. The consultants have recommended a restructuring of the capital of the board and this is receiving active consideration at the present time. Indeed, I hope to be introducing legislation early next year to deal with this and other matters affecting the affairs of the board.  This will give Deputies an opportunity of discussing the affairs of the board in depth.</P>
    <P>Next, I wish to refer to developments in civil aviation.</P>
    <P>The air companies&mdash;Aer Lingus and Aerlínte&mdash;have succeeded in making a net profit in each of the past ten years.  In the year ended 31st March, 1971, the net profit amounted to £838,000 compared with £664,000 in the previous year.  Passengers totalled 1,631,000 as against 1,465,000 and cargo 49,141 tons compared with 45,113 tons in the previous year.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus passenger traffic, which accounts for about 80 per cent of the total numbers carried by the two companies, shows an increase of 12 per cent over the previous year.  The increase has been mainly achieved on the continental routes and on charters.  Cross-channel traffic, which has previously been slow to grow, increased by 9 per cent in the last financial year. The closure of the Menai Bridge was a contributory factor in this increase as also was the introduction of jet services on all cross-channel routes. The company now operate an all jet fleet of 4 BAC III's and 8 Boeing 737's.</P>
    <P>Revenue-passengers carried by Aerlínte passed the quarter million mark in 1969-70 and in the last financial year totalled 275,817.  The introduction of new promotional type fares and an extensive promotion of the winter holiday attractions of Ireland have increased traffic for the company. Over the past two years the company have introduced new routes and increased the frequency of existing routes to meet changes in demand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> The company took delivery of two Boeing 747's (Jumbos) in March, 1971, and they went into service in April and May.  The Aerlínte fleet now consists of 6 Boeing 707-320's and 2 Boeing 747's.</P>
    <P>The companies' capital programme calls for expenditure of £71 million in the five year period up to 1972-73. £29 million is being provided from the companies' internal sources, £27 million by external borrowing and £15 million by the Exchequer in accordance with the provisions of the Air Companies (Amendment) Act, 1969.</P>
    <P>While the Irish air companies passed through last year without serious setbacks, it is clear that the auguries for the current year are far from good and that, in common with other international airlines, the companies are up against very formidable difficulties&mdash; the economic recession in America, the present unrest in the North and domestic inflation.  In addition, charter competition is diverting traffic from the scheduled airlines.  In an effort to meet this competition the airlines are relying on special promotional fares at low level.  This has resulted in dilution of revenue.  We have consequently the anomalous position of traffic growth accompanied by a drop in revenue.  In fact, some of the large airlines incurred substantial losses in the year 1970. Aerlínte who traditionally carried a high proportion of lower fare passengers are particularly affected by this trend towards lower fare levels. Up to a few days ago the possibility existed of an open fares situation on the North Atlantic for next year.  However, I understand that the airlines concerned have agreed in principle to a new fares package which includes lower promotional type fares.  The situation for Aerlínte is aggravated by the increase in aircraft capacity as a result of the introduction of the jumbo jets.  On the North Atlantic the consequence is that there are at present too many seats for not enough passengers.  We had a somewhat similar situation in the early 1960s following the introduction of jet aircraft but after a few years these aircraft more than justified themselves <Col N="471" /> economically.  I am hopeful, therefore, for the future of the air companies, though growth will be slow as it will depend a great deal on improved economic conditions in the world and, for the Irish airlines, on an early return to peace in the North.  I must, nevertheless, point out that Aerlínte are likely to suffer a loss this year and also next year.</P>
    <P>I should like to bring the House up to date on the position in relation to the arrangements for airport management. As the House is aware, I asked Aer Rianta in April, 1969, as a preliminary to the setting-up of an airports authority, to assume responsibility for the management of Shannon and Cork Airports on the same basis as the company managed Dublin Airport, as my agent.  This arrangement is continuing to work satisfactorily and my Department have almost completed work on the preparation of the necessary legislation to make Aer Rianta a fully-fledged airports authority. I hope to introduce the necessary legislation after the Christmas recess.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta had an operating surplus of £1.5 million for the year ended 31st March, 1971, compared with a surplus of £1.7 million in the previous year.  Shannon Airport contributed £9750,000 while Dublin contributed £572,000.  Cork Airport had an operating loss of £46,000.  The drop in the operating surplus was due mainly to increased costs.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta acts as the Minister's agent in relation to certain expenditure and collects certain income on his behalf.  Aer Rianta expenditure is only a portion of total expenditure on the airports.  A comprehensive statement of revenue and expenditure in relation to the three airports is prepared by my Department and published annually in the Appropriation Accounts.  This statement which compares all revenues and all expenditure, including expenditure on the State services, such as air traffic control, meteorology and radio and also the cost of remunerating the capital invested in the airports, shows that the airports in the overall context still incur a deficit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> Passenger traffic at Shannon Airport dropped by 6 per cent in 1970 compared with 1969 due to a drop in transit traffic.  Traffic at the airport for the first nine months of 1971 has shown an improvement with an increase of 5 per cent in terminal traffic over the corresponding period of 1970 and an increase of 59 per cent in transit traffic giving an overall increase of 19.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Following a decline in 1967, air traffic at Dublin Airport recovered in 1968 and improved again in 1969 when passenger traffic increased by 8 per cent and freight by 11 per cent.  There was a further increase of 12 per cent in passenger traffic in 1970.</P>
    <P>After a drop in 1968, traffic at Cork Airport recovered in 1969 with an increase of 6 per cent in passengers and 33 per cent in freight.  This upward trend continued in 1970.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, large scale development works are in progress at Shannon and Dublin to cope with the needs of growing passenger traffic and large capacity aircraft.  These works include the provision of new passenger terminals and additional apron space.</P>
    <P>Work on the new terminal building at Shannon which was operational last May when the Boeing 747 aircraft commenced scheduled services into the airport, is complete.  Work on the installation of airbridges is in progress and is expected to be completed early in 1972.</P>
    <P>The Dublin passenger terminal project consists of a new terminal building and pavilion, and a two level road system.  The pavilion building was completed for use last April and it is expected that the whole project will be completed in April, 1972.</P>
    <P>The present runway system at Dublin Airport is nearing the end of its useful life and for this reason and because of traffic growth a new runway system will be required fairly soon.  A new east-west runway may be necessary within five years and an additional parallel runway at a later stage, perhaps, not for 15-20 years.  The acquisition of the necessary land is proceeding.</P>
    <P>The fire station at Cork Airport has been extended to provide accommodation <Col N="473" /> for additional fire tenders shortly due for delivery.  Visual landing aids on the main runway are being augmented. In addition, an extension of water supply facilities is nearing completion at the airport.  More detailed particulars of the works in progress at all three airports are set out in the notes already circulated to Deputies.</P>
    <P>I should at this juncture refer to the US pressures for landing rights at Dublin for transatlantic air services.  As the House is aware, the US authorities, following the Government's refusal last August to grant such rights, gave notice under the provision of the bilateral air agreement between the two countries, that with effect from 18th August, 1972, landing rights for Aerlínte at New York would be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The Government's attitude in the matter all along has been that the interests of Shannon Airport, the western tourist areas and of the national airline are best served by maintenance of the air agreement in its present form.  In view of the US action, and its consequences for Aerlínte, discussions with them were necessary. Consultations were held in Washington on November 23rd and 24th between delegations representing the United States and Ireland in connection with the air transport agreement between the two countries.  There was a full exchange of views but no agreement was reached on the matters discussed. The delegations agreed to adjourn and to report to their authorities.  At this stage I do not propose to say anything further on this aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>I wish, however, to deplore the mischievous and irresponsible attempts made by Deputy O'Donnell of the Fine Gael Party to sabotage the national interest immediately before the commencement of the discussions.  I met the various groups interested in the landing rights issue, and it was agreed by all concerned, including Deputy O'Donnell, that this was far too important a national matter to be clouded by a party political attitude.  I regret that Deputy O'Donnell broke the line in this respect.  I am glad that he was the only one.</P>
    <P>In Limerick last Sunday night and <Col N="474" /> earlier at a Fine Gael function in Galway Deputy O'Donnell spoke about a sell-out on the part of the Government in regard to Shannon.  This was designed to undermine the Government's stand on the eve of these vital discussions.  Deputy O'Donnell, however, has only succeeded in injuring his own reputation as a credible political figure.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government are negotiating on behalf of Ireland and have got their priorities right.  Shannon was started by Fianna Fáil and will always be cherished by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>As from the 1st April last I abolished the unpopular service charge levied on departing passengers at our airports. This charge is now payable by the airlines and is incorporated in the cost of the ticket.  To meet the additional cost to the airlines, I approved the introduction on 1st April, 1971, of an increase of 3 per cent on the London route and 4 per cent on other cross-Channel routes.</P>
    <P>As from 1st November, 1971, a surcharge is shown separately on all air tickets and airway bills other than those on the North Atlantic to cover the cost of air navigation services allocable to <i>en route</i> flights.  In the past no separate charge was made on the airlines for those services.  The member states of Eurocontrol and other European states now propose to introduce a charging scheme aimed at the recovery of 15 per cent of the cost of these services for a start and working up to full recovery over a period of years.  The purpose of the surcharge is to enable the airlines to recoup the cost of the new charge.</P>
    <P>The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards continues to monitor the test flights of the Concorde supersonic aircraft along the Irish sea corridor. Prior notice of such flights is received from the British authorities. So far no sonic boom effect has been detected by the institute.  Some recent sonic boom effects on the south west coast are the subject of an inquiry to the British Ministry.  Both the British and French authorities have given undertakings to us that the test flights would be routed so as not to cause supersonic booms over Irish territory.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> The incidence of hijacking and other attacks against civil aircraft have, fortunately, abated in the past year.  This type of activity, apart from the danger and inconvenience to the innocent parties involved, strikes at the very heart of the air transport industry and we must continue to seek after remedial and preventive measures to stamp it out.  In line with administrations of other European countries we have adopted security measures for our aircraft.</P>
    <P>Conventions have been concluded at Tokyo and the Hague for the suppression of unlawful interference with aircraft and I had intended to introduce a Bill in the House during this session to give effect to these conventions. However, a further convention was concluded in Montreal in September of this year dealing with sabotage to aircraft and consideration is now being given to incorporating the three conventions in a composite Bill.  In any event, I hope to introduce the necessary legislation in the next session.</P>
    <P>Air charter regulations have been tightened up and enforcement stepped up both by ourselves and the Governments of other countries.  Additionally, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) impose heavy fines on member airlines where the charters are found to be illegal.  The result is that quite a number of illegal charters no longer operate.  The reasons for strict regulation of charter operations are readily understandable. Scheduled services are essential and because they have to operate regularly in peak and valley periods, they have much higher unit costs than nonscheduled operators.  The scheduled fare is based on these costs and if a lower charter fare is made available, it is only reasonable to expect persons travelling at that fare should comply with the conditions laid down.  In the main these conditions are (i) the group should have a separate identity and objects other than travel (ii) passengers should be members for more than six months and (iii) there should be no public advertising for passengers.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recollect that last December legislation was enacted&mdash; the Transport Act, 1970&mdash;providing for <Col N="476" /> payment to CIE in the financial year ended 31st March, 1971, of non-repayable grants not exceeding in the aggregate £2.98 million.  The legislation was necessary in order to bridge the gap between CIE's then estimated net deficit of £5.63 million in 1970-71 and the board's statutory annual grant of £2.65 million.  In the event, CIE's net deficit in that year amounted to £6.171 million which represented an increase of £2.937 million on the board's net deficit in the preceding year.  The increased deficit was due largely to the effects of inflation, reflected particularly in increased labour costs.</P>
    <P>As in previous years, CIE's losses in 1970-71 were attributable almost entirely to the railway, but for the first time a loss, amounting to £285,000, was incurred on the Dublin city bus services.  The board's provincial services continued to be profitable but not as much as in previous years.  This also applied to the hotels and catering services.  Tours and private hire showed a net loss of £28,000.  A net loss of £139,000 was incurred on the board's road freight services.</P>
    <P>The total subsidy paid to CIE in respect of the two years 1969-70 and 1970-71 was inadequate to the extent of £1.268 million to meet the board's losses in those years and the inadequacy was met to the extent of £1.114 million by the deferment, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, of interest payments on capital advances due by CIE to the Exchequer in respect of those years; the balance of £154,000 was met by bank overdraft.</P>
    <P>CIE's financial difficulties show no sign of improvement this year.  It is at present estimated that the board will have a net deficit of £6 million&mdash; i.e. £3.35 million in excess of the board's annual grant&mdash;in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The consultants, McKinsey &amp; Co., who recently completed an investigation into the deterioration in CIE's financial position, found no scope for immediate significant savings.  Major savings which they do envisage will take about five years to achieve.  It <Col N="477" /> is not my intention, however, to deal here with the McKinsey Report&mdash;that is another's day's work.  When decisions have been taken by the Government on the consultants' recommendations, long-term legislation will be introduced to deal with CIE's problems. In the meantime, it is necessary, as a matter of urgency, to meet CIE's cash shortfall in the current financial year and there is no alternative to further financial assistance being provided by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made, therefore, in the Supplementary Estimate for payment to CIE in the current financial year, in the form of non-repayable grants, of £4.464 million made up as follows: £3.350 million in respect of the amount by which the board's statutory annual grant of £2.65 million is expected to be inadequate in the current financial year; and £1.114 million in respect of interest due by CIE to the Exchequer on capital advances under section 4 of the Transport Act, 1964, payment of which, as I have already indicated, was deferred to enable the board to meet its cash shortfall in 1969-70 and 1970-71.</P>
    <P>The latter payment is necessary as the interest payments due were charged to CIE's accounts for 1969-70 and 1970-71 and contributed to the board's losses in those years.  They remain a liability on the board and it is desirable that the board should be given sufficient funds to enable the liability to be discharged.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that further interest payments amounting to £804,000 will fall due for payment by CIE to the Exchequer in the current financial year, bringing the total interest due up to £1.918 million. Deputies will appreciate, therefore, that while the Supplementary Estimate provides for payment of £4.464 million to CIE, the net draw on the Exchequer will amount to only £2.546 million.</P>
    <P>I now turn to shipping.  In the cross-Channel trade we have seen within the past decade a rapid changeover from conventional multi-purpose ships to car-ferries, container and other unit-load ships, roll-on/roll-off type freight operations and specialised vessels of all kinds.  Even the pattern of shipping <Col N="478" /> services has changed.  The trend has been towards a concentration of routes and services through a limited number of ports on the east and south-east coast.  The greater use of unit-load methods of shipping in the cross-Channel trade and the mass movement of goods by a decreasing number of services have provided economies in operating costs, the benefits of which have been passed on to shippers.</P>
    <P>Since the takeover of the B &amp; I Company in 1965 the company's entire structure of services has been transformed.  Formerly passengers, livestock and loosestow cargo were carried in conventional multi-purpose ships. Passengers and cars are now carried on modern car-ferry vessels which also cater for a growing demand for roll-on/ roll-off traffic, while the use of specialised container vessels enables the company to provide a streamlined &ldquo;door-to-door&rdquo; freight service.</P>
    <P>In 1970 the B &amp; I Company's trading results showed a marked improvement over the preceding year. Gross profit increased from £480,000 in 1969 to over £1 million.  Net profit rose from £8,973 to £158,879 and this figure is expected to improve further in the present year.</P>
    <P>The company's modernisation programme involved heavy capital investment and loan capital had risen to £5.5 million at the end of 1970.  Deputies will recall the British and Irish Steam Packet Co. Ltd. (Acquisition) (Amendment) Act, 1971, which was passed earlier this year to enable the Minister for Finance to take up an additional 3,000,000 shares in the company.  This measure should help to reduce the imbalance between the company's loan and equity capital which, until this year, had remained at £1.6 million.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that in April, 1970, I initiated a review of the policies of the State companies concerned with cross-Channel freight transport.  The B &amp; I Company and CIE have agreed on objectives to preserve the national investment in the State companies engaged in the cross-Channel trade.  Agreement in principle on rationalisation of shipping operations between British Rail and <Col N="479" /> the B &amp; I has also been reached.  Detailed discussions on the full implementation of rationalisation measures are proceeding between these companies. On the car-ferry operations certain measures of agreement have already been reached.</P>
    <P>On the livestock side the B &amp; I and British Rail reached agreement in 1970 on rationalisation.  The agreement provided certain assurances on the continuity of livestock services up to 1975 with a possibility of their extension for a further five years.  Representation for the livestock industry on the board of the operating company, the Irish Livestock Transport Company set up by the B &amp; I and British Rail, has given the trade a voice in the operation of livestock shipping services for the first time.  However, the company has had a difficult year in 1970 due to the problems arising from the closing of the Menai Bridge and the failure by the cattle trade to support the company's Heysham service. As a result, the latter service is being withdrawn.  I have had discussions about the future plans of the Irish Livestock Transport Company with representatives of the company and will also be meeting representatives of the cattle trade.</P>
    <P>In April last, the B &amp; I Company inaugurated, in partnership with the Holland/America Line, a new continental freight service linking Cork and Dublin with Rotterdam and Le Havre.  This service was initiated following the cessation of the services operated previously by the Hibernian Transport Group.  This service, which has special significance in view of our possible entry to the EEC, is operating satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Ltd., which operates in the deep sea trade, had its most successful year to date in the twelve months ended 31st March, 1971.  The company has a fleet of nine vessels of a total deadweight of 180,000 tons.</P>
    <P>In 1970 the company acquired two new bulk carriers, each of about 29,000 tons deadweight.  One of these two ships, the <i>Irish Stardust</i>, was built for the company at Verolme Cork Dockyard.  Advantageous long-term <Col N="480" /> charters were negotiated for both vessels.  In July, 1970, Irish Shipping Ltd. placed an order with the Upper Clyde Shipyards for 4 bulk carriers each of about 26,000 tons.  Prior to placing this order, the company had consultations with Verolme Cork Dockyard, but because the Cork yard had a full order book they were unable to accept the order.  When, in June of this year, the Scottish shipbuilders went into liquidation the contract for the four bulk carriers was placed in jeopardy. Irish Shipping Ltd. have, however, now secured from the British Government satisfactory guarantees relating to the contract for the ships.</P>
    <P>The company's net profit, after charging full depreciation and taking all other charges into account in the normal commercial manner, increased from £508,000 in 1970 to £851,000 in 1971.  Because of a major slump in world shipping rates&mdash;rates are now at their lowest since the company was originally established&mdash;lower profits are expected in the current year.</P>
    <P>Since the announcement by Normandy Ferries that they proposed to terminate the Rosslare&mdash;Le Harve car ferry service, Irish Shipping Limited have been exploring all possible avenues with a view to providing a substitute service, even on a limited basis, for 1972.  So far, their efforts have not proved successful but their negotiations are continuing.  They expect to know the final position shortly.  The smaller shipping companies in the private sector provide for shippers a wide range of services, including container services to European destinations.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that privately-owned shipping concerns have a continuing and important role to play on the Irish Sea and on sea-routes further afield.  The tonnage of such Irish-owned shipping is, however, small, and, due to a number of factors, has been decreasing.  The reasons for this decline include the heavy investment involved in the use of container ships, and the necessity to provide for intensive utilisation of vessels operating at high frequency between a restricted number of ports.  On the longer sea-routes to Britain from west and south <Col N="481" /> coast ports a number of services have been discontinued.  This trend towards concentration of services through a decreasing number of ports, while it benefits the importer and exporter, is prejudicial to the smaller shipping companies and the west coast ports but is a universal feature of short-sea shipping at the present time.  These factors contributed in a large degree to the financial difficulties which led to the liquidation of the Hibernian Transport group of companies, among which were the old-established shipping companies of Limerick Steam and Palgrave Murphy Limited.</P>
    <P>I am aware of recent criticism of existing maritime legislation which, it is alleged, is adversely affecting the operations of the smaller native shipping companies.  Revision of this legislation is in hands now and the views of shipowners and trade unions on this subject, which were invited some time ago; are still awaited.</P>
    <P>The Shipping Investment Grants Scheme which was withdrawn recently was introduced in 1969 with retrospective effect to 1st April, 1967 at the instance of the Irish Shipowners' Association, in order to place Irish shipowners on a competitive footing with British shipowners who already had the advantage of a similar scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme enabled shipowners to obtain grants of up to 25 per cent of the cost of capital expenditure on new ships or new equipment for ships. Grants totalling £4 million have been authorised under the scheme for Irish shipping companies.  Nine new vessels have been added to the Irish Shipping Register and four older vessels modernised with grant assistance.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, the working of this scheme was reviewed.  Having regard to the fact that the corresponding British scheme had been withdrawn in October, 1970, as well as to the many demands on the limited financial resources of the Exchequer and the limited use which our private shipping companies had made of it, retention of the scheme was no longer justified.</P>
    <P>The principal commercial harbours are managed and operated by harbour <Col N="482" /> authorities set up under the Harbours Act, 1946.  Members of the authorities are elected every five years and are representative of users of the harbours, local authorities, commercial and labour interests, some members being nominated by me.  My powers in relation to harbour authorities are somewhat similar to, but not quite as far-reaching as, the powers exercised over local authorities by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>Each authority is statutorily responsible for the management, control and operation of its harbour and is obliged by statute to provide reasonable facilities for vessels, goods and passengers using the harbour.  Government policy in regard to harbours envisages that they be operated as commercial undertakings and be self-supporting.</P>
    <P>The recent revolution in shipping brought about by containerisation, roll-on/roll-off services and specialised ships, has necessitated the extension of facilities at some of our major harbours including new roll-on/roll-off and container developments at Dublin, modernisation of Cork Harbour at Tivoli, the provision of container installations at Waterford and quay reconstruction at Galway and Foynes designed to facilitate the export of ore concentrates.  State grants in recent years have recognised the need to assist harbours in catering for the new demands and in the year 1971-72 I am providing £350,000 for grants towards various harbour works mainly to meet the new requirements.</P>
    <P>Attention was drawn in the recent White Paper on Local Government Reorganisation to the fact that a number of our smaller harbours which are at present subject to the wide-ranging controls of the Harbours Act, 1946, have little commercial traffic. The White Paper accordingly suggested that these harbours should be removed from these controls and transferred to the appropriate local authorities who may be better able to ensure their development.  I would welcome reactions from the House to that suggestion.</P>
    <P>Next I come to tourism.  The original allocation for tourism for 1971-72 was <Col N="483" /> £6.23 million.  The industry benefited to the extent of £1.25 million from the additional capital allocations recently announced by the Minister for Finance to provide a stimulus to economic activity and to encourage business confidence.  This has brought the allocation to £7.48 million for the current year, which represents an increase of £1.93 million on 1970-71. The allocation includes the special provisions for accommodation and resort development grants and the grant-in-aid to meet Bord Fáilte's operational activities, including marketing.</P>
    <P>As I have explained to the House on a number of occasions, Bord Fáilte have not been taking on new grant commitments in respect of hotel and guesthouse development since mid-1969. In the meantime the moneys voted for holiday accommodation grants have been used by the board to reduce the backlog of grants due to developers.  The original allocation for accommodation grants in 1971-72 was £1.8 million.  This is being increased by £1 million, bringing the total allocation for this year to £2.8 million.  This £2.8 million will enable Bord Fáilte to effect a considerable reduction on their outstanding commitments. There will be still some arrears of grants due but these should be cleared in the course of the coming year.  I know that the additional moneys I am providing will bring significant relief to many hoteliers and guesthouse owners who had to meet interest charges on borrowing incurred pending payment of their grants.  I hope that payment of the grants will enable hoteliers to allocate increased moneys for marketing and promotional work for the 1972 season.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte are availing of the pause in the taking on of new commitments to give consideration to the overall tourist accommodation position.  The board are examining the situation in the light of the findings of a consultancy report and other relevant factors and will, in consultation with all interests concerned, formulate proposals about the accommodation needs of the future and the means by which <Col N="484" /> accommodation development should be pursued.</P>
    <P>The provision for supplementary accommodation grants in western counties has again been fixed at £100,000 this year.  This expenditure is very effective in extending tourism through-our rural areas in the west and in helping farmers and small householders to share directly in the benefits of tourism.</P>
    <P>The remaining £250,000 of the additional £1.25 million recently allocated for tourism will be spent on major resort development and will bring the total resort allocation for this year to £500,000, an increase of £100,000 on last year.  Adequate recreational facilities are essential for the extension of Irish tourism and it was to meet this need that the major resort development programme was inaugurated under which Bord Fáilte, in association with local authorities and other local interests, undertake development works in selected centres and areas.  At the 31st March, 1971 the board had expended £2.7 million towards projects costing over £4 million. The recent increase in the current year's provision will enable the board to undertake additional development works during the remainder of this financial year and I know that this will be welcome to public representatives and tourism interests.</P>

    <P>Apart from these projects, the other proposals are to a degree interlinked and the question also arises of settling priorities for the carrying out of the different elements of the overall development proposals.  Possible approaches to a phased programme of development giving priority to the works which are considered most <Col N="486" /> urgent have been fully discussed between officers of my Department and of the health board.  As a result, I hope that when the suggestions made have been investigated an agreed programme of development will emerge so that the most urgent works can proceed without delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>To be entitled to a deserted wife's allowance statutory regulations require that a woman must establish that her husband wilfully refuses or neglects to contribute to the support of her and her children.  The person referred to in the question is receiving a retirement pension by virtue of her husband's insurance under the British <Col N="489" /> National Insurance Acts.  As, therefore, her husband could not be regarded as having refused or neglected to contribute to her support, it was decided that she was not a deserted wife and her claim for the allowance was rejected. Her appeal against this decision was rejected by the appeals officer, whose decision is final.  I should add that there is no provision under the deserted wife's allowance scheme for the payment of a reduced allowance to a woman who has failed to satisfy the prescribed conditions for title to an allowance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the present British pension being paid to this woman is not being paid through any goodwill on her husband's part but comes as a result of her husband's insurance pension&mdash;that the husband did not contribute in any way to her welfare for 17 years?  The fact that she is getting this small pension now, much less than she would get if she qualified for a deserted wife's allowance here, is not through any goodwill on the husband's part.  He still refuses to contribute in any way to her upkeep, and in these circumstances would the Minister not agree to have another look at this case? The British authorities would appear to have dealt more favourably with this lady than the Irish authorities.</P>

      <P>Information on the services administered by my Department is available from a number of sources.

Personal callers are dealt with at two public offices in Dublin city, and officers have been specially assigned to deal with inquiries at the employment exchanges in Galway, Sligo, Athlone, Tralee, Wexford and Drogheda.  Inquiries may also be made at the other employment exchanges and employment offices, and from social welfare officers and local agents of the Department.  In addition, the Department's information booklet is available for consultation at post offices, and is widely circulated free of charge.

      <P>I deplore the Minister's reply, a very unhelpful and unconstructive reply on a matter of major national interest.  Appreciating that this may well require some considerable work being done in the Department, which I would have hoped would have been done continuously during the past 50 years, would the Minister now commission the Economic and Social Research Institute to undertake research into this?  Such research would not take more than three or four months.  A colleague of mine in the trade union movement can do this quite rapidly and did it in 1970.  The Minister must accept that there is a great deal of national interest in the relativity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like any research being done in this unless it comes up with reasonably accurate returns and we have been rather dilatory about getting any figures because of this.  The Deputy knows well that the basis of calculation is different.  In the North there is a contributory scheme to which every person between school-leaving and retirement contributes to social insurance. They have different qualification requirements, different rates of pay and to make a meaningful assessment on a <i>per capita</i> basis is entirely wrong. I gave Deputy FitzGerald the global figure of the cost in both areas and he then proceeded to assess it on a <i>per capita</i> basis and to work that out as a meaningful comparison which, of course, it is not.  I must admit that I was rather proud to listen to Deputy Ryan giving an interview on the radio on Sunday last.  Deputy Ryan did not seek to denigrate our services here but he upheld what I consider would be the duty of any responsible Member of this House.  Rather than make an adverse comparison for public consumption, he gave a very fair assessment of the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> unemployment insurance and assistance in both areas.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if, in view of the fact that his estimate is in the region of £50 million and that Deputy FitzGerald who is most conservative has been talking in terms of £87 million and further, that a figure of £110 million has been produced as an amount that would bring about parity of benefits north and south, he would agree that it is legitimate that Members of this House would ask him to commission social scientists and statisticians to estimate a figure from the wealth of data available from the social security offices, north and south and which is available in Britain also?  With a proper weighting of the data a very objective, independent and academic figure could be produced which would be most helpful in terms of our relationship with Northern Ireland and in terms of objective argument in this country about the social services in both areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supplementary and Additional Estimates referred to by the Deputy were composed mainly as follows:</P>
      <P>1968-69&mdash;Total £29 million&mdash; mainly, Budget increases £4.6 million, increases in remuneration and pensions £9.0 million and agricultural subsidies and wheat losses £6.9 million.</P>
      <P>1969-70&mdash;Total £36 million&mdash; mainly, Budget increases £8.4 million, increases in remuneration and pensions £9.7 million and agriculture £8.9 million.</P>

      <P>This indicates that the Supplementary and Additional Estimates required for the past three years were due mainly to (i) increases in expenditure provided for in the annual Budget (ii) increases in remuneration and pensions and (iii) payments for agricultural subsidies, which are dependent on external factors and other items which could not have been accurately forecast.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The average amounts paid to the officials referred to in respect of travelling expenses and subsistence allowances, taken together, in each of the years 1966 to 1970 are: 1966, £210; 1967, £200; 1968, £215; 1969, £238; 1970, £287.</P>
      <P>The official records do not distinguish between (a) travelling expenses and (b) subsistence allowances since they are claimed together on a monthly basis. The compilation of such information would involve the examination of each individual claim for the past five years and would not justify the time and expense involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the latter part of the Minister's explanation that there would be an undue amount of time involved.  I did not realise that point when I put down the question. However, does the Minister not realise how miserable these sums are for people who are constantly out?  These are miserable sums.  I take it the Minister appreciates that?</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to accept that.  I have given average figures.  They vary from one officer to another depending on the length of time he is out.  I do not think we can deduce from these figures alone that they are miserable allowances.  It depends on what was done to receive them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether it is proposed to cease maintenance work on the Glyde and Dee drainage at the end of November; and, if so, (a) how many men are being laid off and (b) why their period of employment this year is so short.</P>

      <P>This year's maintenance programme on the Glyde and Dee drainage scheme will be completed within the next fortnight and 24 seasonal workers will be laid off.  The period of employment of such workers in any year is dictated by the amount of maintenance needed and by weather conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will remember that last year when this work was being terminated rather early, some time in mid-December, he was good enough to intervene and have the men kept on until after Christmas.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the main reason given last year was that there was a shortage of money for doing the job, because of an increase in wages particularly, and is he aware that this year the men were not started until 1st <Col N="509" /> June instead of early in March and that they will be laid off at the end of November, and would he again use his good offices to ensure that the job will remain open until after Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of the Office of Public Works saving money because this money does not come out of the Office of Public Works; it is completely paid back by the county councils.  The full cost of drainage maintenance is recovered from the county councils involved who are entitled to be satisfied that no uneconomic expenditure takes place.  The plain fact is that the full programme laid down for this season is now virtually completed.  There will be 13 men kept on the permanent staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is repeating what has been written down for him but he must be aware that these statements are entirely incorrect and that the facts are that the money was not made available because it was not asked for by his Department and the job is not half done and it must be completed or otherwise the whole arterial drainage of those rivers will have been wasted. Would the Parliamentary Secretary have a look at it and try to have these men kept on to do very necessary work?  He did it last year.</P>

      <P>No, they are not.  The Office of Public Works decide themselves on what should be done and make a demand for repayment from the county council.  This year they did not ask for enough money and now they are laying off men because they got a wage increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) My Department does not issue licences to language schools.  There is a list of schools approved by me for providing courses in English for foreign students.  For a school to be admitted to the list I must be satisfied (1) that the course or courses which it proposes to offer are educationally sound and have a content appropriate to their stated objectives; (2) that the arrangements for the management, staffing and organisation of the school are suitable and that the teachers are suitably qualified and competent; (3) that the school premises, the scale and standard of the accommodation provided, equipment, <i>et cetera</i>, are suitable.</P>
      <P>(b)  The Dublin School of English was admitted to that list.  The usual conditions applied to the admission. These conditions contained a provision that a delegated officer or officers of my Department will be permitted to visit the school at all reasonable times for the purpose of verifying that the relevant regulations are being complied with.</P>

      <P>With your permission, A Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 60 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has now sanctioned a grant towards the cost of a new school to replace the existing Kells convent national school.  Due to the heavy school building programme on hands I am unable to say at present when this case will reach the stage when tenders might be invited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister should have expected that supplementary question because he must know on its position on the list will depend whether it will be built in the next few years or in this century at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It will certainly be built within a reasonable time.  It must be remembered that the school-building programme is an exceptionally heavy one and, for that reason, I have got to have my priorities.  I simply cannot say at this stage when this school will be built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware of the very heavy building programme.  So many schools are being built that, were I to accept all the invitations I get to open schools, I would not be doing anything else.  The Deputy can be assured we are getting on as rapidly as possible with the provision of schools in areas in which they are necessary but, as I said, we must have a priority list.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the long standing policy of my Department not to restrict the issue of licences for the export of offals from meat export factories, so that meat exporters may be enabled to pay the best possible prices to producers of cattle, sheep and pigs.  This policy has not resulted in a shortage of supplies to firms in this country engaged in the processing of offals but it involves such processors in competing for the available supplies.</P>

Is the Minister also aware that a firm called Irish Products Limited in Dublin have closed down due to a shortage of raw material and that about 60 men have been laid off?  In the interests of maintaining employment, which is well-paid employment in the factories I have mentioned, it might be advisable to reconsider the question of issuing these licences in respect of inedible offal?</P>

Neither do I accept the Deputy's implied suggestion that the price which the primary producer would get for his animals would, by the concession that he seeks, be reduced somewhat.  It is a question of competition.  There is an adequate supply of offals and people who want them have to pay the going price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The general implications of EEC membership for the poultry and eggs industry were outlined in the study <i>Irish Agriculture and Fisheries in the EEC</i> published by my Department early last year.  There has been no change in the basic situation since then.</P>
      <P>In the negotiations for Ireland's accession to the European Communities, arrangements have been made for a transitional period of five years for progressive harmonisation of feed prices.  A system of compensatory levies on imports and refunds on exports will apply during this period to offset differences between feed prices in Ireland and in other member States.  We are also seeking to maintain our animal health controls on imports of poultry and this matter is still under consideration. The Community have agreed that we may maintain our existing egg grading system for eggs which differs from the Community system, during the transitional period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Community are now more than self-sufficient in poultry meat and production is still increasing.  They have also reached self-sufficiency in eggs. The enlargement of the Community to include the four applicant States will <Col N="530" /> not significantly alter the position as the latter also have a high degree of self-sufficiency in both poultry meat and eggs.  In those circumstances there seems little prospect of any appreciable higher prices within the EEC and the outlook may be primarily one of ensuring that our egg producers and poultry processors will retain the home market.  With the growth in the trend here towards large-scale efficient production units, with the best strains of breeding stock being available and with equalised feed costs it seems reasonable to conclude that the industry should largely be able to withstand competition from any imports that might take place, for example, from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>While it would hardly be realistic to expect any increase in our output of eggs, a continuing expansion in output of poultry meat can be envisaged due to the probable increase in consumption of poultry meat with the rising price of red meats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The monopoly export functions of An Bord Bainne would not be in conformity with EEC regulations.  I have discussed the situation with representatives of the main farmer organisations, the IAOS and the board and I understand that these bodies are now formulating proposed arrangements designed to ensure that as far as possible the advantages of centralised exporting of dairy products will continue to be maintained after Ireland's accession to the EEC.  In reply to the Deputy's question of 22nd July last on this topic, I made it clear that I consider it would be a retrograde step to return to a position where over 100 creameries would be exporting individually, in many cases on a very small scale.  The farming and cooperative interests can accordingly be <Col N="531" /> assured of my support for any suitable arrangements which might prevent this position arising.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Shares of the EEC deficit of beef for processing are not obtained by international negotiation. When a quarterly estimate is announced of quantities admissible and of the rate of levy which applies, importers in EEC countries apply for import licences for their requirements. It is then a matter for commercial action by them to secure supplies from outside the EEC at the lowest prices. Our exporters have not sought to participate in this trade because the prices obtainable, taking into account import duties and whatever levies apply from time to time, are lower than are obtainable in our alternative markets for frozen beef.</P>

      <P>The policies pursued by the Government over a number of years in the field of structural improvement in agriculture, including land settlement, the small farm incentive bonus scheme, and western development work generally, parallel to a great extent the stated aims of the draft proposals for the reform of agriculture which the EEC Commission have submitted to the Council of Ministers.   The Council have not yet taken decisions on these draft proposals and until they do it would not be possible to say precisely how the various measures in operation here for the improvement of agricultural structures would be affected.  All our existing structural aids will, it is expected, fall to be examined in due course by the EEC Commission in the light of the Council's decisions.  The Government are keeping in close touch with the situation and current aids and incentives are being reviewed in the context of the evolution of EEC policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

If that is the case, surely a parallel position exists in relation to lambs on the French market since there is no common policy there either.

Secondly, formalities at the frontiers; they are not automatically illicit, on condition that they do not cause delays or distortions.  The Commission is, however, trying to obtain the suppression of these formalities.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously produce which has to be transported a considerable distance to the point of sale, whether it is the market or intervention centre, will have to bear higher transport costs than produce from an area close to the point of sale.  However, in the existing Community only a limited proportion of total production is sold to intervention agencies and on Ireland's entry into the EEC our aim must be to sell as little as possible to those agencies.  The best returns will be obtainable on the Community's markets and it is by selling on those markets that Irish agriculture will make the most of the opportunities which EEC membership will provide.</P>

Would the Minister regard such an event, as that which happened on the London market and in two instances to-date on the Irish market, as not being in the national interest?

      <P>The point in relation to Question No. 112 is that it referred to the management that would follow a take-over.  The legislation dealing with mergers and take-overs which is in course of preparation will, because of the far-reaching consequence of mergers and take-overs and because of the problems which arise, take some time to complete.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the allocation for County Cavan was increased from £35,000 in 1970-71 to £77,000 in the current year.  The provision for the scheme has not yet been determined for the year 1972-73 and consequently I cannot forecast what amount will be allocated to County Cavan for that year.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I am indeed aware that the allocation was increased, as the Minister has said, from £35,000 to over £70,000 in respect of the current year but is the Minister aware that under this scheme Cavan County Council were recently only dealing with applications made in 1967?  I take it the Minister will agree that that is a very serious backlog. Would he consider giving very special consideration to Cavan in view of the situation there?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister dealt very generously in the allocation he made to County Cavan last year.  For the Deputy's information I would like to tell him out of the £77,000 which I allocated for this year in the first seven months the actual grant expenditure totalled £10,700.  If the Cavan County Council are to use the full allocation made to them in the current year they will certainly have to speed up progress on the schemes particularly in relation to inspections if they hope to achieve expenditure of the full amount already allocated to them for the current year.</P>

Indeed, I would agree with the Minister that it would be a serious reflection on those in charge in Cavan County Council if it were not used up because there is a crying need for those schemes.  As I told the Minister they are now only dealing with the 1967 applications.  Will the Minister bear that in mind when applying to the Minister for Finance for an allocation for next year?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, in respect of the assessment of income of persons other than farmers for the higher rate of housing grants, the £25 valuation has been equated to £700 annual income, <Col N="559" /> £40 valuation to £750 annual income and £60 valuation to £900 annual income and if he will state (a) under what statutory authority or regulation this arrangement was arrived at and (b) why the standard method of a fixed figure, for example £20 per £1 valuation, has been departed from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>No income limits corresponding to the valuation limits applicable to farmers have been prescribed in respect of the special rate of grant which may be made under section 16 (2) (b) of the Housing Act, 1966, to persons who do not derive their livelihood solely or mainly from the pursuit of agriculture.  To qualify for such a grant, it is a statutory requirement that the circumstances of the person or occupier are such that he could not provide a house for his own occupation without the aid of a grant at the special rate.  In order to establish the circumstances of an applicant, the local authority assesses his income and, based on their assessment, the Minister determines the eligibility of the applicant on income grounds.</P>
      <P>It is the general practice to assess the income of farmers on the basis of £20 per £1 land valuation, for the purposes of grants.  It is felt, however, that it would be inappropriate to apply this formula to determine the amount of grant payable to a person who does not derive his livelihood solely or mainly from the pursuit of agriculture. Each such case has to be decided on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis having regard to all the relevant circumstances and, in particular, the statutory criterion that an applicant, other than a farmer, could not provide a house for his own occupation without the aid of a grant under section 16.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The eight regional tourism organisations continue to play an important role in the developing and servicing of tourist traffic.  The 107 tourist information offices provide a comprehensive service to visitors and the computerised room reservation service which Bord Fáilte introduced last year is of particular value both to tourists and to providers of accommodation. Last year, the information offices serviced 1.6 million inquiries and booked 380,000 bednights.  The <Col N="567" /> regional organisations produced and distributed 3½ million pieces of holiday literature during the year.</P>
      <P>The success of the &ldquo;Discover Ireland&rdquo; campaign aimed at promoting home holidays, will depend to a great extent on the regional organisations who have a major role to play in encouraging more of our own people to spend their holidays in Ireland.  These organisations are involved in arranging for more entertainment for visitors.  Notwithstanding progress in this field, I consider that we need a further extension of entertainment facilities for holidaymakers. There is scope here for private enterprise development working with hoteliers and the regional tourism organisations.</P>
      <P>The short season and the scarcity of trained hotel and catering staff, particularly at peak periods, are still a source of some difficulty for both staff and management.  Progress in the training of staff continues.  Last year 1,000 young people received training under the auspices of CERT&mdash;the Council for the Education and Recruitment and Training for the Hotel Industry&mdash;and the council are working with the vocational education authorities in providing training for personnel already in the industry, through day release and sandwich courses.</P>
      <P>I scarcely need say that the tourist industry is going through a very difficult period, mainly as a result of the unrest in Northern Ireland, economic difficulties abroad and rising prices. Tourist revenue in 1970, the latest year for which returns are available, is estimated at £99.1 million, a rise of only £400,000 on the previous year.</P>
      <P>The general picture for 1970 was that traffic from Britain and Northern Ireland showed a decline while returns from North America and Continental Europe just about hold their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An official estimate of 1971 tourist traffic will not be available until next year.  However, the latest passenger figures indicate that for the first nine months of the year tourist traffic from all areas, excluding Northern Ireland, showed an increase of 1.1 per cent as <Col N="568" /> compared with the same period of 1970.  It is expected that traffic from Northern Ireland will show a decrease of about 9 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>The problems affecting tourism pose a serious challenge for everybody connected with the industry.  There are some problems about which the tourist industry can do little, but this does not mean that they should confine their contribution to bemoaning the Northern Ireland situation or the effects of unemployment in Britain or international foreign currency crises. We must make an honest appraisal of the problems involved and identify those which lie within our control.  So far as the State is concerned, the Government realise that any programme of tourist promotion and development requires substantial investment and it is for that reason that, notwithstanding a difficult budgetary position this year, they have allocated nearly an extra £2 million for tourism this year.</P>
    <P>At the level of the industry, I know that there is a willingness to examine the root causes of problems affecting tourism and to tackle these problems in a workmanlike way.  Bord Fáilte have organised meetings with all tourist interests in the regions to effect a full exchange of views and to develop a greater consciousness of tourism's needs.  In undertaking this operation and in highlighting areas in which operators can improve their products and services, the industry is displaying a realism in keeping with the needs of the future.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have carried out an in-depth examination of their own organisation and a major restructuring designed to ensure the best allocation of resources and the most effective operation.  In their marketing activities, the board have decided that in present circumstances the most fruitful areas for concentrated marketing activities lie in ethnic traffic from Britain and North America, activity holidays, incentive travel and promotional work in areas of Europe which have not previously featured in the board's plans.  To improve the product, Bord Fáilte are placing a new emphasis on high standards and value for money <Col N="569" /> and are providing an additional range of advisory services in such areas as campaign planning and integrated marketing.  The board have set up a new conference bureau to promote conference business and incentive travel.  In addition to the overseas marketing activities, Bord Fáilte have now embarked on the promotion of domestic holidays.  This programme has my full support and I hope that the many Deputies who take a close interest in tourism will use their influence in encouraging home holidays.</P>
    <P>I keep in constant touch through Bord Fáilte with developments in the tourist field.  In addition, I meet the other State agencies concerned, the National Tourism Council and the various private interests in the industry. I am fully committed to the need for intensive marketing and promotional work, especially during these difficult times, as a means of counteracting the adverse factors affecting tourism growth.  Deputies will recall in this regard that last year I arranged for Bord Fáilte to undertake a special additional promotional campaign in our main markets.  More recently, at my suggestion, the board re-examined their budget for 1971-72 and have reallocated an additional £250,000 to be spent on marketing and promotional work in the current year.</P>
    <P>Although I have dwelt on the problems affecting tourism, I am confident in the long-term prospects of further tourism growth.  We cannot expect any expansion of earnings this year and one must be cautious about forecasts for next year, particularly in view of the continued unsettled position in the North.  I believe, however, that we now have a better-organised industry than ever before and that the industry will prove resilient in meeting and overcoming the present difficulties and in resuming the growth pattern to which we had become accustomed in the sixties.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited fall within my responsibility in so far as they relate the promotion of tourism and the development of traffic at Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> In general, the &ldquo;Castle&rdquo; tours and banquets promoted by the company have been successful in attracting considerable numbers of tourists.  They are also a means of providing tourists with a form of entertainment that is truly Irish in character.  The &ldquo;Rent an Irish Cottage&rdquo; scheme promoted by the company in conjunction with local interests has met with success since its first season.  Building works are in hands or planned for further cottages throughout the region.  The essential characteristic of this scheme is the active involvement of the local people so that as much as possible of the economic and social benefits will be gained by small communities off the main tourist routes.</P>
    <P>So far I have been dealing in the main with matters relating to the activities of State sponsored bodies under the aegis of my Department.  It will be appreciated, however, that the affairs of these organisations involving such matters as legislation, financing and general co-ordination of policies, give rise to a very substantial volume of work in my Department.  In addition the Department were directly responsible for the administration of a big volume of legislation relating to road, sea and air transport.  While developments and work in this area are impossible to quantify, the House may be interested to hear of some of the activities involved.</P>
    <P>Under the Road Transport Acts, the Department regulate the carriage of merchandise and passengers for reward and this involves the operation of a licensing system for hauliers, coach operators, <i>et cetera.</i>  Deputies will recall that under the terms of the Road Transport Act, 1971, the carriage of cattle, sheep and pigs was removed from the scope of the Road Transport Acts so as to allow their carriage for reward without a merchandise licence.  The Act also liberalised road haulage in that it permitted each holder of an &ldquo;existing carrier&rdquo; licence to carry all classes of merchandise throughout the State with the same number of vehicles which he had plated on 1st January, 1969, without any restriction as to vehicle weight other than those contained in <Col N="571" /> Road Traffic legislation.  In addition, existing carriers whose area of operation had previously covered the State were authorised to licence an additional vehicle.</P>
    <P>The Act came into force at the end of May last and I will be keeping a close watch on developments as the effects of the new legislation work through the transport industry.  I would expect about a year to elapse before the legislation achieves its full initial impact.  Thereafter, the need for further road transport legislation will be under continuing review.  The measures which I have taken and such others as may be necessary in the future, seek to permit and encourage the emergence of larger and more efficient haulage units in the country with consequent reductions in transport costs.  They will also help our hauliers to compete effectively and efficiently in haulage in Europe and in the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>The administration of merchant shipping legislation governing such matters as the standards of ship construction, load-line requirements, life-saving, fire-fighting and radio equipment on vessels and the certification of sea-going personnel is another important block of work.  The Department have overall responsibility for the national sea rescue service network, which involves the coast life-saving service, the Naval Service, the Air Corps, the Garda, the Commissioners of Irish Lights and the Royal National Life-boat Institution.  Co-ordination in the event of an incident is effected by the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre, Department of Defence, Haulbowline, County Cork.</P>
    <P>The Royal National Lifeboat Institution who operate the lifeboat service are, of course, financed by voluntary subscriptions.  In order to sustain the valuable services rendered by the Institution, I decided to make available to the Institution an annual grant amounting to £10,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>The merchantile marine offices at the principal ports are responsible for supervising the engagement and discharge of seamen and looking after <Col N="572" /> matters affecting discipline on board ship and health and accommodation of seamen.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the operation of the Shipping Investment Grants Scheme and the administration of the Harbours Acts.  Under the Foreshore Act, 1933, my Department manage and control State-owned foreshore to ensure that developments do not take place which are contrary to the public interest.</P>
    <P>My Department are responsible also for control of oil pollution of the sea by ships.  The relevant legislation is the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts which give effect to an international convention on this subject.  The convention has recently been amended and I intend to introduce legislation in the near future to enable effect to be given to the amendments.</P>
    <P>Two further international conventions recently adopted are designed to deal with instances of major oil pollution following shipping casualties. Ireland took an active part in the preparation of these conventions and I propose to introduce legislation to give effect to these conventions also.</P>
    <P>The administration of air transport legislation involves the certification of the airworthiness of Irish registered aircraft, the provision of the technical services necessary for the safety of operations at our airports and the licensing of flight personnel and ground engineers.  The air traffic control service clears flight plans and maintains watch and control to ensure adequate separation and safety of aircraft in flight.  The radio service provides communications with aircraft and is responsible for the provision of ground-based radio-navigational facilities for both en-route navigation and terminal area approach and landing purposes.  The Meteorological Service, apart from providing information for aircraft, fulfils a general need by providing weather information for the population in general which is of course of particular interest to persons engaged in outdoor occupations such as farmers and fishermen.</P>
    <P>In regard to air, sea, road and rail transport there are a number of international agreements and conventions <Col N="573" /> to which Ireland has acceded.  Compliance with these international requirements involves membership of a number of international organisations for which the Department are responsible.  Membership of the European Communities will have significant implications for this country in the spheres of transport and energy and the Department have, of course, been associated with the negotiations on Ireland's application for membership of the Communities.  A number of transitional concessions have been negotiated in the transport sector and attention is now being given to the preparation of legislation necessary to secure compliance with the requirements of the Treaties.</P>
    <P>This completes my review of the principal services covered by the Estimate.  If there are any aspects of these matters on which Deputies would like additional information I shall endeavour to deal with them when replying to the debate.</P>

      <P>The Minister may wonder why I put down a motion to have the Estimate referred back for reconsideration. The reason is a serious financial one but the Minister will find that I shall not be unduly critical of what he has done for us, and he has done a great deal, but I will come to that later.</P>
      <P>In the Book of Estimates which is a Parliamentary paper, the Estimate for this year for the Department of Transport and Power was £16,806,000, a net decrease of £3,500,000.  I have no doubt that when this Estimate left the Department, there was adequate provision in it but I believe that this provision was taken out by the Minister for Finance who, while I realise that there is joint responsibility for everything the Government do, is the Minister who must sanction every Estimate.  There is now a Supplementary Estimate of £4,500,000, which amount I do not believe is adequate but we will know in time whether it is adequate.  In his Budget speech this year, the Minister for Finance said as reported at column 720 of the Official Report for April 28th, 1971:</P>
      <P>My main concern has been to arrest the strong upward trend of current expenditure in recent years and to minimise additional taxation in the interest of safeguarding the National Pay Agreement.</P>
      <P>In the paragraph headed &ldquo;Conclusion&rdquo; the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I have now completed the budgetary presentation for 1971.  Its main purpose is to retard the rate of inflation which has depressed the economy in recent years.</P>
      <P>The Minister said also:</P>
      <P>The concessions and tax increases which I have announced bring revenue and current expenditure into balance at £551 million which is £61 million or 12½ per cent greater than the outturn in 1970-71.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The comparing of the outturn with the incoming Estimate was false, but there was a more serious element of fraud involved.  Undoubtedly, after lengthy discussions at Government meetings, <Col N="575" /> the extra sum of £3,500,000, which we voted 12 months ago for CIE, was taken out.  It appears in italics in the Estimate.  The case I want to make is that when this Book of Estimates was being printed, which was in April of 1971, the Government knew very well how the losses in CIE were going.  I accuse the Government of a discreditable fraud in presenting this document to us in this fashion.  I spent 20 years in the Department of Finance and when we got the Estimates we often cut them, perhaps too much on occasions, but we did not ever do this kind of thing.  It is further proof that the Government have no credibility whatever.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Minister for Transport and Power for this, but that is not to say that he was not responsible, although it is unlikely that he was.  What is deplorable is that this House should, prior to the Budget, be presented with figures that are inaccurate and fraudulent and that the Minister for Finance should then come here and claim that he was putting a stop to inflation.  At the time, the innocent Deputy Patrick Power said &ldquo;There has been a cutback in expenditure&rdquo; but I said afterwards in private to the Deputy that minus multiplied by minus makes a plus so that on the basis of that kind of logic there was a cutback.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been generous in the quantity of material he has presented to us.  I do not ever remember any Estimate with so much material given to us.  His brief runs into 44 pages and we got 35 pages of notes previously, so we have a total of almost 80 foolscap pages of material.  My criticism of these 80 pages&mdash;and I think the Minister would agree with me on this point &mdash;is that on the whole there is very little current material in it.  There are certain forecasts and a great deal of account of what happened in 1970-71 but there is very little about what happened this summer and autmun, very little material indeed.</P>
    <P>Another way of looking at it on the notes is that there were ten pages about the air companies who employ 7,000 men, seven pages about CIE&mdash;<Col N="576" /> and I am not suggesting there should not be; there certainly should be because it is a major headache&mdash;which employs 21,000 men, and there are two pages about the ESB, because, of course, the ESB is functioning the way a first-class company should function. I am talking financially now and I want to emphasise that.  I have no criticism of the air companies technically but I have a different kind of view of them financially.  There are 12,000 men employed in the ESB and the ESB warrants only two pages in the notes.</P>
    <P>The Minister did give us some additional information in his brief and I want to go through that brief as rapidly as I can.  Instead of a reduction of £4 million in the Estimate, or £3,500,000, as we had originally, there is an increase of £2 million.  I am not grousing about the method of estimation or that kind of thing: what I am grousing about is the dishonesty.  The Minister reversed the order when he came to his brief and put the ESB first. I think that is the proper order if we believe in taking the most important and the most efficient one first, but I want to ask him a question about his figures.  He says:</P>
    <P>By 1977-78 the board's generating capacity will be 2,800 megawatts, almost double the existing capacity.</P>
    <P>He then goes on to say that the estimated capital cost of this expansion is £36 million.  There is nothing wrong with that&mdash;it is assuming that we will want, in six years time, double our present capacity.  I do not know on what basis that kind of calculation is made, but I let it pass.  What I really began wondering about was the statement:</P>
    <P>Further expenditure in additional generating plant totalling about £85 million is expected to come up for approval during the next three to four years.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's Department cannot control it very well, surely the Department of Finance would have a say in the matter, though I am a bit doubtful? I met an old friend from the Department of Finance a few months ago and he made a most interesting <Col N="577" /> remark to me about that massive Department.  It is four times the size it was when I was there 20 years ago, in numbers, and he remarked to me &ldquo;Half of us do not know what the other half are doing and the other half do not know what they are doing at all&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We always say that about the other half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point in the remark because if something expands and they are dealing with problems, some of the methods of dealing with problems today are not really rational.  We could talk about various aspects of economics.  I have no serious criticism of the ESB and the way it does its business.  We all hope, to be quite frank, that this natural gas strike south of Kinsale will prove successful because it will save this country an awful lot of money.  The Minister says:</P>
      <P>For some years the board have had to invest about £20 million per annum in generating, transmission and distribution equipment and, within the next decade, they could have to invest a total of over £300 million.</P>
      <P>At the end of the next decade, these may be very different pounds.  The capital of the ESB is, roughly speaking, about £200 million at present, so that the Minister would expect it to be £500 million at the end of the decade. If money continued to go the way it has been going in recent years, it certainly will be £500 million.  There is no doubt about that, regardless of whether these grandiose plans come to fruition or not.</P>
      <P>The Minister goes on:</P>
      <P>The scarcity of new capital may force the ESB to rely for funds for new investment to a much larger extent on their own resources, that is, on additional appropriations from an increased revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of fact, the ESB is one organisation, far and away the largest organisation from the capital point of view, which has all the time provided a great deal of the additional capital <Col N="578" /> expenditure from the depreciation of plant and so on which, as I would say, has been depreciated on a very conservative basis because we all know that generators last nearly for ever, they are practically everlasting, and this has generated&mdash;I do not intend a pun&mdash;a great deal of money: the fact that the ESB is depreciating its plant at a much faster rate than is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister's brief continues:</P>
    <P>The board must at least maintain their charges at such a level that revenue covers expenditure and normal appropriations.</P>
    <P>They do, in fact, though there was a loss in the last financial year as we know, but that is quite exceptional.</P>
    <P>I think there is a slip later in the brief where the Minister talks about holding electricity prices below the cost of production.  I do not think that is meant and that holding electricity prices, I take it, just above the cost of production is more accurate.</P>
    <P>I protested before about the degree of the interference there has been by the present Government with the ESB in the way of having international consultancy bodies, particularly from the USA.  What the relevance is I do not know.  If they were brought from Switzerland or from Norway, or some other small country, I could understand. The Minister ends up speaking about a particular group and he says:</P>
    <P>This group is comprised of persons of high international standing in the diverse fields of activity which arise in the electric power production and distribution industry.</P>
    <P>I have said time and again that I have seen no evidence of any worthwhile result and I am glad to see that the Minister in his brief about CIE was very cagey about what the effect of the McKinsey Report would be on CIE.  I am glad to see him, for a change, applying a critical mind.  There is no doubt that employing a firm like McKinsey to look into our railway system is really like employing a Jumbo Jet to take people across the Irish Sea.  It is the same kind of thing.</P>
    <P>Still talking about the ESB, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> The rates are only 13 per cent greater in 1970-71 than as long ago as 1935.</P>
    <P>This, of course, is a tremendous achievement.  I think that in the main it could be said to be due to the fact that a fair proportion of our supply is still hydro-electric which was installed, even in the post-war scheme up in Ballyshannon, at very low prices.  The civil engineering work at Ballyshannon was a model of what civil engineering work should be, due to the engineer in charge, Mr. Joe McDonald, an outstanding official of the ESB.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>This is quite an achievement in view of the erosion in the value of money in that time.</P>
    <P>I agree.  He then says:</P>
    <P>It is true that large industrial users in Norway, Sweden and Switzerland have cheaper power....</P>
    <P>Why would they not, when they have water coming down from the Alps in Switzerland and the snows of the mountains of Norway?</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to describe the rural electrification scheme and I think we were all delighted with the rural electrification scheme.  The strange thing is that that despised Government, the second inter-Party Government, made more progress with that scheme in the three years they were there than any other Government.  It was one thing they never interfered with in any way except that they did get a contribution made to the Exchequer.  They do not now string six or seven miles of line up a mountain to carry electricity to a few families.  A new method has been adopted.  Of course, it should have been adopted long ago.  Taking electricity long distances to hamlets was a deplorable waste of public money. The Minister has described the new arrangements which have been made. They are excellent.  He can claim, if he likes, that they came from the McKinsey Report.  I was very sorry to hear of the death of the commercial manager, Mr. Ryder, a few months ago.  He was an excellent official.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="580" /> The Minister dealt with Bord na Móna.  I do not always make negative criticisms.  My heart went out to Bord na Móna during the terrible years of the 1960s.  There was no method by which they could deal with the climatic conditions we experienced.  They had a bad year in 1958 but by good luck 1959 was such a lovely year that the turf would have burnt out the generators were it not for the fact that turf from the 1958 crop, which was saturated was brought in to make a suitable mixture for generators.  The loss they had in 1958 they made good in 1959.  In the 1960's continuous losses occurred but they have now had three or four good years.  The Minister has not really told us what has happened this year.  I think Bord na Móna had a good year this year too.  This is November and I cannot understand why the Minister did not tell us what the position is at present.  I think it is excellent.  Bord na Móna, unlike many of the other companies, are liable for interest on all their capital and they must pay back any moneys they get on loan from the Government.  One cannot make any forecast with a company like Bord na Móna but I can say that for 1971 they will meet everything the Government asks them to do, including interest on capital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear this because the excellent officials in Bord na Móna were very perturbed. One of them said to me once: &ldquo;If you lose money continuously people begin to look at you with contempt.&rdquo;  This is one difficulty CIE have at present. They have a problem that is intractable and it does not matter whether the weather is good or bad it will remain intractable.  I hope there will be three more good years for Bord na Móna so that they can ride out some bad years. In the year 1970-71 owing to the fact that the Minister continued to forgive them the interest that was arranged in the Act, which has now run out, they were left with £1½ million.  I take it that by 31st March next they will have another £1½ million to add to that.  The Minister said that this is the final remission under the 1968 Act.  That is to say <Col N="581" /> about £600,000 of interest.  £562,000 was due to the Exchequer and was waived.  I approve of this in the case of a company that has done such excellent work as Bord na Móna.  I remember the first time I went down to Bord na Móna and saw the Bagger machines at work.  There were six men working on them and they were laying out sods as best they could.  Some years later I went down and one man was working the machine and the sods were being laid out as if on railway lines.  Now, of course, they do mostly milled peat though they still produce a good deal of sod peat.</P>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
      <P>At the same time as the Turf Development Act, 1968, was passed, my predecessor arranged for the appointment of a firm of consultants to examine the affairs of Bord na Móna, both from engineering and financial standpoints, and to assess future prospects.</P>
      <P>Why?  Do the Government believe that consultants are some kind of magicians? Most people have other names for them.  I just call them charlatans.  Most consultants are charlatans.  There was a man in this House who believed he had solved a problem when he made a rotund sentence about it.  There was another man in this House who thought he had solved a problem when he had set up a company to deal with it.  That is not the way to solve problems.  This one will not solve them either.  Per Jacobson, who was Chairman of the World Bank, came over here on the Banking Commission in the middle thirties.  He was asking such silly questions that Professor George O'Brien asked: &ldquo;Could we not arrange to give him a copy of the statistical abstract?&rdquo; I presume he thought, perhaps correctly, that we were the same as some parts of Central Africa.  Once he had time to go through this statistical abstract he did not ask so many silly questions.  I am not saying he was a silly man at all but he was asking silly questions because he was from Sweden and he did not know the first thing about this country.  I am not saying he did not know plenty about banking. I suppose he learned a great deal more afterwards.  The Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" /> The consultants have recommended a restructuring of the capital of the board and this is receiving active consideration at the present time.</P>
    <P>I do not know what that means unless it is that they have recommended that the capital of the board should be reduced or increased.  I like plain words that I can understand.  Does &ldquo;restructuring&rdquo; mean an increase or decrease?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister then came to air companies.  One does not like to be too critical.  When I asked an awkward question about the ships that are being built for Irish Shipping the other day, the Taoiseach said I was trying to tear down the institutions of State.  I am afraid a great deal of harm has been done to what I regard as the most important institution of State in recent years&mdash;this Parliament.  I was not denigrating anything.  I was talking about a different thing altogether.  I cannot understand why the two jumbo jets were bought.  None of the technical people in Aer Lingus is responsible. The responsibility rests essentially with the higher management&mdash;the board of directors.  I cannot understand why they were bought in view of the fact that the Boeing 707s had been so successful. I cannot understand why they did not buy four Boeing 707s which they would have got for about half the money.  I just do not understand this. This comes from the euphoria.  Such euphoric forecasts as the Minister made this year refer to the distant future.  They do not refer to this year. The Minister does not talk much euphoria about this year, and that is a merit.</P>
      <P>The Minister goes on to say:</P>
      <P>While the Irish Air Companies passed through last year without serious setbacks, it is clear that the auguries for the current year are far from good...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current year is nearly over.  This is what I objected to earlier on.  Why does the Minister not give us some information about the current year? For example, is what I have been told <Col N="583" /> correct, that the jumbo jets are being wintered in Texas because the climate is suitable there in the same way as, if you put a couple of horses out to grass, you put them in a suitable place or, in the summer, hunters are put on soft land, in a boggy area, as far as possible?  This is why we have the jumbo jets wintering in Texas.  What I cannot understand is why what was happening could not have been reasonably foreseen.  There is an answer to one part of it, that the big American company with which Aerlínte had a contract had folded up.  That is an explanation of part of it.</P>
    <P>There is another sentence in the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>The situation for Aerlínte is aggravated by the increase in aircraft capacity as a result of the introduction of the jumbo jets.</P>
    <P>One of the people working in Aer Lingus said to me some months ago that the cost per seat is much lower in the jumbo jets than in the ordinary Boeing jets but the fact is that if you have a whole lot of seats empty, the fact that they are cheaper means that you get nothing against the lower costs, whereas in the other case, although the cost per seat might be higher, a bigger percentage of seats will be filled both ways.  I think it is 150 seats in an ordinary Boeing jet against 350 in a jumbo&mdash;something like that.  It is all right to talk but we are a small country and I do think we ought to walk carefully and to cut our cloth according to our measure.</P>
    <P>On page 15 of the Minister's brief there is a remarkable omission, as if the Minister was going to put in a figure and then his heart failed; he had not the gumption to face up to it. There is a vacancy there and it is quite obvious that as this brief was being prepared the figure was in and something happened at the last minute and the figure was taken out.  I quote:</P>
    <P>I must nevertheless point out that Aerlínte are likely to suffer a blank loss this year and also next year.</P>
    <P>Why were we not told the truth?  It is much better.  It should be faced up to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> Why were we not told what the figure was?  There is certainly space enough for putting in a couple of million there. I do not understand why this kind of thing is done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now the end of November.  We are two-thirds of the way through the financial year and, there is no question about it, with their computers and all this modern equipment they are always boasting about, they could give figures right up to now.  If the jumbo jets are out to grass in Texas, the cost of keeping them out to grass will be a very clear figure.</P>
      <P>I then come to a point that is a purely financial point that has often struck me.  I think of the cost of the roads which is entirely met out of the Road Fund which comes from the taxes we all pay on our cars.  Of course, one can see the result out at Dublin Airport, which I now call megalopolis. I used to be like a taxi driver at the airport when my family were younger and I used to be constantly driving them out there.  I am glad to say that that is nearly over.  Now I find the greatest difficulty in seeing how to get in and how to get out.  One might as well be trying to get in and out of New York city.  I am not exaggerating.  In my opinion what is there is not necessary to the extent that it is there.</P>
      <P>There is a remark later on in the Minister's speech:</P>
      <P>The present runway system at Dublin Airport is nearing the end of its useful life...</P>
      <P>I will make a good bet that there are a lot of roads around Dublin city with much bigger potholes in them than there are on the runway systems at Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>The Minister says:</P>
      <P>The Dublin passenger terminal project consists of a new terminal building and pavilion, and a two level road system...</P>
      <P>There is another word in this which occurred also in the Minister's notes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything connected with the 747 is expensive.  Let us be clear about that.  That is one thing that we can be quite certain about.  I do not mind admitting that the whole thing is outside my understanding.</P>
      <P>The Minister lays down certain conditions about air charter regulations. I quite agree with him.</P>
      <P>Now I come to CIE.  I am following the Minister as he made his speech to make such comments as I feel ought to be made.  The increased deficit is £6 million, as against £3 million last year and the year before.  All the Minister has done, really, is to make sufficient provision to bring the subsidy this year up to what it was last year. He was good enough to give us, although it was hard enough to make it out, a stencil showing an increase of £1½ million this year on last year.  The Minister certainly supplied us with plenty of material in this stencil copy of the revised Estimate.  This shows an increase of £1,484,000.  Does that mean that the Minister is, in fact, providing an additional £1½ million this year for CIE as compared with the provision last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is they will need it.  The most interesting statement by far in the Minister's description of what is happening in CIE is the statement that, for the first time, a loss amounting to £265,000 was <Col N="586" /> incurred in 1970-71 on the Dublin city bus services.  This will shock the unfortunate people who have to use these services.  What has happened is, of course, that the huge increases in fares have compelled more and more people to use their own cars, with all the resultant congestion at certain hours in the morning and again in the evening. The chaos is fantastic.  I was going home one evening recently at about 6.45 p.m.  I would have thought that the traffic would have eased somewhat by then, but I was afraid of my life over all the four or five miles that I would hit someone or someone would hit me.  There was a continuous stream of traffic.  Before the fares increased so much, people working in offices used their cars at the weekend to take their families out; now they are using their cars to travel to and from work and that has increased the traffic congestion. If the trend continues this city will become impossible to live or work in.  The fact is&mdash;I take it the Department are well aware of this&mdash;the point of no return has been reached as far as CIE urban fares are concerned.  My recollection is that receipts for passenger fares on country buses are quite good.  I am speaking from recollection now.  My recollection is that the returns last year were quite reasonable. It is an extraordinary change from the days when the late Deputy Seán Lemass used the Dublin bus services, which were making a profit of £750,000, to subsidise the country buses.  The tuppeny fare was quite normal at that time.  I think I have made my point.</P>
      <P>The Minister says in his brief that the consultants, McKinsey &amp; Co., who recently completed an investigation into the deterioration in CIE's financial position, found no scope for immediate significant savings.  Indeed, they did not.  I admit I read only the summary with care and all they said was that they could say nothing.  With a loss of £9 million on the railways, they could say nothing.  Let us be fair to them, they did not claim any great achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indulges in a peculiar piece of reasoning.  I suppose it is necessary to make the best case one <Col N="587" /> can when one has a poor case to make.  The Minister says that an interest payment of £804,000 will fall due for payment by CIE so the net draw on the Exchequer will amount to only £2½ million.  I suppose it is better than £4 million anyway.</P>
    <P>There are times in this House when one has to be reticent.  I understand that the B &amp; I Company, who had a reasonably good year last year, are having a very bad year this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true. They are, in fact, likely to have a better year this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, it depends on what one is comparing it with.  An additional £3 million is being taken up in shares.  If you get a bigger net return from that it could still be a lower rate of return than you would get on the smaller capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Good.  I am glad to hear it.  The Minister said that this should help to reduce the imbalance between the company's loan and equity capital which, until this year, had remained at £1.6 million.  There are references then to the livestock trade: Irish Shipping Limited, who operate in the deep sea trade, had their most successful year to-date.  I wonder.  If the real value of money were calculated, I wonder if they have had their most successful year to-date, as compared with the profit they made in the year of &ldquo;Suez&rdquo;.  I just wonder and I beg leave to doubt whether, in real terms, they had a better year.  If people want to use arithmetic in this kind of situation, that is one way of doing things, but it does not give one the real answer.  I hope they succeed in getting a ship to run the Normandy ferry service.  It is <Col N="588" /> regrettable they should have baled out, especially when they were probably making a fair profit.  They will, no doubt, stick it into the English Channel, or somewhere like that, where it will be packed to the scuppers every time it crosses the English Channel.  Remembering the Bill that is going through this House at the moment, Fóir Teoranta, it was regrettable the Government did not face up to the position of Hibernian Transport.  I take it they examined it carefully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The failure of a company of that size, which had such a good previous record, shakes confidence. I am not saying the Government are not well aware of that.  I notice that they walk like mice on occasions.  I am not saying I do not approve of that.  I approve of it very much.  If you are walking on thin ice it is better to walk gently on it.</P>
      <P>There is a good deal in the Minister's statement about harbours.  Down the years I have had considerable doubts at times about the money spent on harbours in certain parts of the country. We do not seem to get very great returns from it.</P>
      <P>I want to make a few remarks about tourism.  I do not understand how Bord Fáilte were allowed to make the commitments they did make without there being some check on them.  It created untold trouble and showed their arrogance in the sense that they must have thought the Department of Finance were dead and gone, as they very nearly were.  They have run many people into serious trouble if anything like the number of hotels which are supposed to be up for sale are, in fact, for sale.  I would like to know why there is this increase of £1.3 million for the provision and development of hotel accommodation.  Is it to liquidate previous commitments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, or go a long way towards that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot but be impressed by the improvements which have taken place in towns like Bantry, Cahirciveen, Westport and Clifden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> The traffic in Salthill sometimes reminds me of the traffic in O'Connell Street but it cannot be denied that tourism has brought prosperity to many of these places.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago Elizabeth Nicholls wrote regularly in the <i>Observer</i> about conditions for tourists here but recently she has been saying that we will price ourselves out of the tourist market and, of course, there is no question about that.  Whoever thought of establishing guesthouse and farmhouse accommodation did a great deal of good for the tourist industry.  As a nation we are not as careful about what we spend our money on as other people are but one can meet quite well-off people staying in farmhouse and guesthouse accommodation.  I feel this has been the most successful angle of the tourist effort in recent years.</P>
    <P>The hotel guide produced by Bord Fáilte did not give information about when the high season begins and ends this year.  I object to this very much. My wife and I were travelling home from Achill and as I have got rather lazy we decided to spend the night in a rather nice town en route to Dublin. I asked what we would be charged for the night and when I was told I remarked that that was not the figure quoted in the hotel guide.  This was not denied but the people in the hotel pointed out the only room they had was one with a bathroom.  We went down the town to a very expensive hotel where we had a nice cup of tea and then we drove on home to Dublin. That is an example of what an easygoing fellow like myself will do.  When I started out from Achill I had no intention of driving to Dublin in the one day but I suppose I saved about £5 or £6 by not staying in the hotel.</P>
    <P>In previous years the hotel guide always gave the date on which the high season began and ended.  The high season was usually from 1st May to 30th September and the low season from 1st October to 30th April.  Why was this information taken out of the guide this year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <P>Tourists who are golfers find it very difficult to get into a golf club.  A large number of golf clubs said that if a group of four Americans, Germans or other tourists came to play golf they would be given a special rate.  The purpose of this was essentially to sell the country and get across the idea that this was a sporting country in the present political situation where the country has a reputation of being a disturbed place.  The fact is that nothing was done about this suggestion.</P>
      <P>I understand that people in a tourist business spend 30 per cent of their takings on promotion.  It has been pointed out to me that the commercial banks, who lend about £40 million one way or another, do not put one penny into tourism; they put money into fancy buildings around Dublin instead.  Many banks in New York have marble 50 feet high on the ground floor.  There must be something about human nature and banking that makes bankers believe if they have large palatial buildings people will bank their money with them.</P>
      <P>The Irish Car Hire Company were sold this year.  I know it is the policy of this Government never to interfere with what a private person does with his own business.  In fact, there was a company here who were being pressed hard by an American company named Avis who have set up a fake Irish company for the hire of cars.  They pressed Ryans Car Hire Company so hard that the Ryan company sold out to Hertz. The name Ryan was retained but that has no significance whatever.  There is a lot of trouble about Japanese tyres at present.  I wonder if these American car hire companies are using Japanese tyres?  It would not surprise me if they were.  They have only one interest in the business, namely, to make something out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister <Col N="591" /> for the amount of material he gave us. I am sorry he did not bring some of it more up-to-date.  Had he done so I would have more admiration for him.  It is not much use telling Members of the House what happened up to 31st March last.  At any rate, I am glad I scored a bull's eye about the tourist guide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a major and very important Estimate covering a wide field.  It is well to point out that in terms of direct employment the four major bodies covered in this Estimate &mdash;CIE, ESB, the air companies and Bord na Móna&mdash;provide jobs for 40,000 people, representing two-thirds of total employment in State-sponsored bodies.  The Minister for Transport and Power is responsible for 11 or 12 State-sponsored bodies.  That a Minister responsible for so many State-sponsored bodies, covering a very wide field of activities and involving highly technical operations, should submit to this House an annual review consisting of 43 pages&mdash;an average of three or four pages for each State-sponsored company&mdash;is deplorable and ludicrous. How can any Opposition Deputy, or anyone else who has not access to the information the Minister has, attempt a realistic analysis or a considered assessment of the performance of these companies?  I have said this before in this House and I wish to avail of the opportunity to say so again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one considers the considerable amount of taxpayers' money involved in all the activities under the control of the Department of Transport and Power, surely we are entitled to full details regarding expenditure.  The time is long overdue for the Government to introduce some form of public accountability. On every occasion I have spoken in the last few years about this Department, I have recommended the setting up of parliamentary committees as they exist in Britain.  They would examine in detail the performance of each State body, just as the Committee of Public Accounts carry out an examination of all the Departments.  The Minister has made a gesture towards recognising this demand for public accountability in that the annual report of Bord Fáilte this year contains details <Col N="592" /> of the people to whom grants have been paid for hotels.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not prepared to give a detailed analysis of the performance of these companies, how can he expect Deputy O'Donovan or myself to do so?  We have not access to information as he has; we have not got civil servants to prepare briefs for us.  I have estimated that if I were to do an analysis and contribute to this debate in a way that would satisfy myself, it would take me ten hours, that is, allowing one hour for each State company. I have no intention of doing this.  This annual debacle on the part of a Minister responsible for so many State bodies is intolerable.  I make no apologies for mentioning this.  I have done so before and I shall do so again if that is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister's brief consisted of 42 pages.  Despite the brevity of his statement in relation to his responsibilities, it is extraordinary that he has found space for two paragraphs, totalling almost one page, to deal with Deputy Tom O'Donnell.  I have been told by some of my senior colleagues that it is unprecedented in the annuals of this House that a Deputy has figured so prominently in a Departmental Estimate and I have been complimented by my colleagues on having achieved this distinction.  I being to think that I must have been a much more effective Opposition spokesman on Transport and Power than I realised. This morning the Minister went to the trouble of adding an additional page to the Estimate.  There was a long paragraph dealing with me on page 18 but the Minister added another page, page 18a, on which there was another long paragraph dealing with me.</P>
    <P>I should like to publicly thank Deputy Desmond.  I have no doubt his reaction is the reaction of every decent person in this House and in the country.  The Minister for Transport and Power spoke about credibility and my political reputation.  The Minister is the last person in this House who should talk about credibility or who should dare to question any Deputy's integrity.  I am proud of the confidence the people of east Limerick have reposed in me.  In 1961 <Col N="593" /> I was elected without reaching the quota and I am proud of the fact that for the first time in the history of the State I headed the poll in east Limerick for Fine Gael.  I have no doubt that not only will I do this again at the next election but that I shall do it with a substantially larger vote.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister threw in the ball and since he stooped to guttersnipe tactics I am not going to let him away with it.  I apologise to the Chair that for the first time in my ten years in this House I have had to indulge in political mud-slinging.  I have always avoided this and tribute has been paid to me by all sides of this House that I have dealt objectively with issues and have avoided introducing personalities. However, I cannot let this guttersnipe attack&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I shall expose the dirty tactics he has used not only in the last 24 hours but the tactics engaged in by the Minister, together with his stooge, Deputy Stephen Coughlan.  I challenge the Minister here and I shall refer him to a meeting of the Limerick City Council on Monday night last.  I quote from <i>The Limerick Leader</i> dated Wednesday, 24th November.  In the course of a tirade against me, Deputy Coughlan said:</P>
      <P>The Minister said to me last week that the mayor's deputation had apologised for the remarks of Deputy O'Donnell when they met the Minister last week.</P>
      <P>This is a statement by Deputy Coughlan.  I am proud of the fact that in his reply the mayor said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> I am sorry that the Deputy has raised this matter at all but I must, at the same time, deny that any apology has been made to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about sabotage.  He talks about a sell-out.  I know what is wrong with the Minister.  He refers to my Galway speech in which I challenged him and the Government to explain whether or not a deal had been done in relation to the landing rights. The Minister refers to my Limerick speech of last week.  I have it here.  I want to put the record straight.  I want to quote from <i>The Limerick Leader.</i>  I am getting a fantastic amount of publicity about this in Limerick.  Even the corporation considered it important enough to hold a special meeting.</P>
    <P>My Limerick speech to which the Minister refers is quoted in <i>The Limerick Leader:</i></P>
    <P>In a statement issued in Limerick last night Mr. Tom O'Donnell, T.D., said he wanted to issue a final warning to the Government that any compromise on the landing rights issue that would allow even one US carrier into Dublin would be tantamount to a sellout.</P>
    <P>I take it that the Minister can understand English and can read English. Does the Minister question my right as an Opposition Deputy, and as Opposition spokesman for Transport and Power, to issue a warning to the Government?  I make no apology to anyone for having issued that warning to the Government.  When the Minister accuses me of trying to sabotage the national interest I must tell him what my crime is and I gladly plead guilty to it.  My crime is that I have exposed the incompetence, the blundering stupidity and total lack of leadership and initiative shown by the Government and particularly by the Minister for Transport and Power on this whole issue of the landing rights.</P>
    <P>A bigger crime still which I have committed is that I have refused to play ball with the Minister to cover up his own incompetence and stupidity.  I have refused to play ball in the same way that Deputy Coughlan has played ball, and certain other Deputies down there.  The only sabotage I have committed&mdash;and <Col N="595" /> I stand here before the bar of this House and I make no apology for having committed it&mdash;is that I have sabotaged a conspiracy on the part of the Minister for Transport and Power, aided and abetted by certain Deputies, to sell out Shannon Airport and the West of Ireland.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that as early as last July there was a clear indication that the American Government were about to get tough about the landing rights.  At the time of the controversy about the feeder service between Dublin and Shannon, everybody knew the Americans would renew their demands and increase their pressure to gain entry for US carriers at Dublin Airport.  I have said before, and I repeat it, that I believe the Government misjudged the situation very seriously in late July and early August.  I believe that if the Government had assessed the situation correctly, instead of a Civil Service deputation going to Washington in mid-August without a real brief, without authority even to discuss the wider issues involved, a Ministerial delegation consisting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Transport and Power should have gone to Washington.</P>

      <P>Following the return of the delegation last August, the American Government issued an ultimatum to the Irish Government in which the Irish Government were informed that as from August next unless American carriers got landing rights at Dublin Airport Aer Lingus would be banned from New York.  In my opinion, the Government in their reaction to the ultimatum proved completely incompetent.  Despite the efforts made by voluntary groups, despite the reaction manifest in all parts of the country against the Americans, despite the fact that many organisations spoke out on the issue, no Government Minister made a major policy speech on it. Although we have a number of Government Ministers in the mid-West, not one of them thought it worth his while to attend one of the many meetings held down there in relation to American landing rights.</P>

      <P>Despite all that has been said and written about the various issues involved in this particular demand by the Americans, there is another place where I believe the Minister and the Government and certain State companies have fallen down very badly.  The case put forward by the <Col N="606" /> Americans was given publicity on television, radio and so forth.  The American case was that entry to Dublin would generate a considerable increase in the volume of North American tourist traffic to this country.  I have publicly refuted this.  I have challenged the American Government to substantiate this claim but I am appalled to think, despite the expertise and the knowledge available to the Minister and to the Government, that no attempt was made to inform public opinion as to the invalidity of this American claim.</P>

      <P>The position then, as I said, is that there has been this propaganda by the Americans which succeeded to the extent that a body called the National Tourism Council fell for the bait.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of this but I will refer him to a copy of a certain American tourist magazine which was circulated in the American aviation industry.  This position by the National Tourism Council did untold damage.  I condemn it in no uncertain terms.  I have seen reports of this decision in aviation and tourist journals circulating extensively throughout the United States.  The Minister's statement and mine were published in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular thesis regarding the impact of entry into Dublin on the whole volume of North American tourist traffic to Ireland that has been put forward by the Americans does not stand up to close examination.  I am amazed that the National Tourist <Col N="607" /> Council fell for this particular bait and that they decided to support the entry of the Americans into Dublin Airport.  I have referred to this matter several times in the House over the past ten years but from the detailed examination I have made during the past three or four months I have no doubt whatsoever that the case against allowing the Americans into Dublin is so overwhelming that I am amazed the Minister, the Government and semiState bodies did not do more to expose the outrageous claims of the Americans for what they are.</P>
    <P>I want to examine the case put forward by the Americans and I have here a copy of an official brief circulated at a briefing session in the American Embassy the other evening. When I read that and saw the flimsy claims on which the Americans were basing their case, I felt there was no great difficulty if the matter was tackled properly in answering every argument put forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have attempted at least four times to deal with this matter but the Minister has interrupted me.  I know the Minister does not regard this as serious.  I do not regard it as a joke nor would I smile at it as the Minister is doing now.  I regard this as a very serious issue, particularly for the people on the western seaboard. I have no doubt that the entry of even one American airline into Dublin Airport, even on a restricted basis at the outset, would be the thin end of the wedge and would ultimately lead to very serious if not disastrous repercussions for the western tourist industry.</P>
      <P>The consequences of this for Shannon Airport are very serious, indeed, but I am particularly concerned about the consequences of American entry into Dublin in relation to the western seaboard as a whole. The consequences for the national airline have been clearly defined and are pretty obvious.  What have we from a tourist point of view when we look at the west coast of Ireland as against the east coast?  I want to be as objective as possible in this in the hope that the National Tourist Council and other bodies in the Dublin region, who have been so vocal in support of American entry into Dublin, would begin to analyse this situation objectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entire west coast has only one entry point and that is Shannon Airport and the western tourist industry is absolutely and vitally dependent on the traffic coming through Shannon and particularly on tourists disembarking at Shannon Airport.  On the east coast Dublin Airport is now the terminal for 98 per cent of all scheduled Continental and UK traffic to Ireland.  The only schedule service <Col N="609" /> operated by the national carrier at Shannon is London-Shannon.</P>
    <P>The east coast has the advantage in this and also the advantage of the port of Dublin with its car ferries and shipping services.  It also has the port of Dún Laoghaire with its shopping services. It has Rosslare also and on the north-east coast there is the port of Larne.  The east coast then, has almost the entire tourist traffic coming from Britain and the Continent.  It is widely spread and widely based but the west coast is almost entirely dependent on Shannon for tourism.</P>
    <P>We have only one scheduled service from Britain to Shannon.  There is a very good reason why there are no other services, which I can explain by referring to a situation which arose last January when a Manchester-Shannon scheduled service which had been operacting for three years and which operated in the peak tourist season three days a week had to be scrapped by Aer Lingus because it could not be made viable.  I took the trouble of spending a week in Manchester to examine the reasons for the termination of this service.  It is almost impossible to sell package holidays by air to Shannon in Britain because of the simple fact that you have to add £4.50 or £5 to the fare.  This is the difference in the cost of travelling by air to Shannon compared with Dublin.</P>
    <P>If I go to Birmingham tomorrow to market a fishing package holiday in the Shannon region and I have another package holiday in the Dublin region, near the east coast, I can sell the one on the east coast terminating at Dublin Airport for £5 less than the one at Shannon.  Coming from Britain or the Continent it costs £5 more to travel on to Shannon.  Also because we have no scheduled services&mdash;they cannot be made viable&mdash;there is another reason that makes it impossible to sell package holidays by air in the West of Ireland in Britain.  It is that you must come to Dublin Airport from, say, Birmingham and wait there for two or three hours for a connecting flight to Shannon.  The people coming from the British Midlands are mostly fishermen with very heavy gear and they resist having to get off at Dublin Airport and <Col N="610" /> hawk their heavy gear with them while they await a connection.</P>
    <P>I have gone to Britain for nine successive years helping to promote the Shannon region there and on every occasion we come up against this obstacle.  We try to sell fishing holidays in the Shannon region by air in the great fishing market in the British Midlands and we find it almost impossible to do so because fishing centres close to Dublin Airport have an extra advantage.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the vital dependence of the tourist industry along the western seaboard on Shannon Airport.  The eastern region is very well served, enjoying a very favoured position from the tourism point of view because of the proximity of Dublin Airport and the seaport and the fact that across a few miles of channel, or a couple of hours distance by boat or 40 minutes, perhaps, by air, there is a mass tourist market of 50,000,000 or 60,000,000 people in Britain.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that the National Tourist Council did not display some objectivity and, at least, show some interest in or recognition of the problems of the people of the west.  If we are serious about western development, and all parties in the House are committed to that concept, if equity and justice count, the west coast is entitled to the one great asset it has, Shannon Airport.  Surely it is entitled to enjoy the fact that Shannon is the gateway to very good tourist attractions in the west and south.</P>
    <P>If the National Tourist Council reexamined their consciences on this matter and if the vocal Dublin lobby relaxed its pressure and, perhaps, if the Minister and the Government took off their coats and got down to studying this business as I have done, the answer would be clearly spelled out: it would be a gross injustice to the west of Ireland even to contemplate taking any step leading to a change in the pattern of North American tourist traffic to this country because there is no doubt, despite all the American bluff and propaganda, the entry of even one American carrier into Dublin would seriously jeopardise the <Col N="611" /> tourist industry of the west.  Anybody who studies the pattern of North American tourist traffic to Ireland over the last decade will realise the contribution it has made to the economy of the west and the contribution Shannon has made by being the gateway to the west.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of all this: the Americans claim, and in fact their whole case is based on the claim, that their entry to Dublin would substantially increase the volume of North American tourist traffic to Ireland. Has anybody seriously examined the pattern and growth of North American traffic to Ireland over the past ten years?  To whom can the growth of North American traffic to this country be attributed?  I defy contradiction on this: there is no doubt that it is due largely to the tremendous success of the promotional publicity and sophisticated marketing techniques of the national airline.  The American airlines and the American Government, are now glibly promising us hundreds of thousands of extra tourists.  Let us examine what they did on these routes in the past ten years.</P>
    <P>By comparison let us examine what the American airlines spent and what promotional efforts they made in regard to those routes.  If the American airlines are so anxious to increase the volume of North American tourist traffic to Ireland, is it not extraordinary that, despite the fact that US carriers can operate into Shannon from 14 different centres in the United States, they have never attempted to do it.  They have confined themselves to operating services from Boston, New York and Chicago.  Why do they not operate a service from San Francisco, from the West coast, from Philadelphia or from anywhere else. The simple answer is that they confine themselves to the three routes where not merely the national airline but Bord Fáilte and CIE have spent a fortune, where Ireland has spent a fortune, in the last decade in promotional work.  Now they want to muscle in on the last internal link between Shannon and Dublin.  It is muscling in on Aer Lingus and nothing else.  Whether it is for prestige <Col N="612" /> purposes or what, I do not know.  I examined this question as carefully as I could and I cannot see any strong arguments to substantiate the American claim to entry.</P>
    <P>No case has yet been made by the American Government nor by the American airlines to justify any change in the existing bilateral air agreement. I believe that no Government in its sane senses could even contemplate any compromise which would permit even one airline into Dublin on a restricted basis.  I understand from the Minister's brief that the talks have been adjourned.  On page 18 it says:</P>
    <P>There was a full exchange of views but no agreement was reached on the matters discussed.  The delegations agreed to adjourn and to report to their authorities.  At this stage I do not propose to say anything further on this aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>It is about time the Government, the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Foreign Affairs stopped cowering before this American threat and showed some leadership, some initiative and some determination to fight this outrageous act of aggression by a major power against a small nation.  Let the Government mobilise the full weight of public opinion in this country and particularly Irish public opinion in the United States.  In that way the Government would be worthy of securing the support of all sides of this House in that campaign.  Where there are any defects or where there are points which I think need clarification in the public interest I shall continue to call for that clarification.  I will not be deterred by the tactics of the Minister here today or of other Deputies who have attacked me in this House and outside it and have attempted to prevent me from speaking in the National Parliament.  Over my dead body will any Member of this House prevent me from standing up here and saying what I think is in the national interest. Despite the attempt of the Minister to question my credibility and my integrity, I am proud of the fact that last night the Parliamentary Party of Fine Gael unanimously congratulated <Col N="613" /> me on my efforts in this regard.  I am accountable to Deputy Liam Cosgrave and the Fine Gael Party.  I am proud of the confidence placed in me and of the support I have received from my colleagues.</P>
    <P>The people were appalled at the fact that neither the Minister for Transport and Power nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs went to Washington with the delegation.  As Deputy Michael O'Leary pointed out here last week, Ministers can go to New York to take the salute at St. Patrick's Day parades; they can go down to Bally-this and Bally-that to all sorts of functions, but when the national interest demanded it, when this nation was looking to the Government to provide leadership and expected a Minister or two to be in Washington, the Minister and the Government let the country down.</P>
    <P>Even though protocol may not permit the active participation of a Minister or Ministers in the negotiations which have taken place this week, I have no doubt that the presence of a Minister of State from Ireland in the background would lend substantial force to this delegation.  The Minister or Ministers could have availed of the opportunity of lobbying Government opinion there, of mobilising public opinion, of giving interviews on radio and television and explaining to the American people what this is all about. My information from the United States is that the American people do not know what it is all about, that even the American Government are not fully aware of the situation.  Perhaps they are after the last two days negotiations; I do not know.  However, I think it was a fatal mistake, and maybe at this late stage, if the negotiations are going to be resumed and if they are going to take place in America, the Minister would stir himself and take the responsibility which has been placed on him in this matter.</P>

      <P>I have so much ammunition here that I would need a jumbo jet to transport all of it.  I shall deal now with the tourist industry. This is yet another area in which the Minister has shown total incompetence and a complete inability to tackle the problems involved.  For the past two years everything relating to tourism has been solved by &ldquo;no problem&rdquo;. Both last year and this year have proved difficult for this industry.  At this stage I wish to acknowledge that recently there have been indications from Bord Fáilte of new thinking from within the board.  I am glad to say also that some of the major criticisms I have voiced during the past couple of years have been heeded and that steps have been taken to deal with these various criticisms.  During that time I have referred consistently to the need for re-organisation and restructuring within Bord Fáilte and I have pointed out continuously the urgent need for strengthening their marketing section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is very good at speaking in the first person singular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was fobbed off by the Minister on every occasion but major restructuring has now taken place in the marketing section of the board and there has been also a major re-organisation of staff.  A new marketing manager has been appointed, new divisions have been set up, a new director-general has taken over and two new members have been added to <Col N="616" /> the board.  On the surface, this might appear to indicate new thinking and policy and a major change of attitude on the part of the Government towards the tourist industry.  However, I regret to say that I am far from satisfied with the Government's policy in relation to tourism.  They are only tinkering with this industry and whatever re-organisation has taken place within Bord Fáilte is not adequate in itself to tackle the serious problems which confront the industry at present.</P>
      <P>During the past two years, and as recently as a couple of weeks ago, the Minister has attempted to attribute all the problems of the industry to the unfortunate situation in Northern Ireland. While I agree that the situation in the North has created problems for the industry here, I disagree entirely with the Minister when he says that they have been responsible for all the difficulties involved.  There are a number of other major factors which have been having and are having serious adverse effects on the growth of Irish tourism.  I shall analyse the problems, market by market taking, first of all, the British market.  Undoubtedly, the difficulties in the North have created problems in so far as the British market is concerned but long before 1969 Irish tourism was showing a downward trend in so far as this particular market was concerned.  It was showing a downward trend as far back as 1966 and the reasons for this are quite obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, in the post-war years this country enjoyed a colossal advantage in relation to tourism from Britain.  People from Britain flocked here in the immediate post-war years, when there was no rationing and they could enjoy a good holiday, with plenty of food and so on.  Then during most of the 1960s there was a restriction on the overseas spending allowance to £50 in Britain.  This meant that the British tourist was restricted to £50 spending money.  That gave him a good holiday in Ireland but it was not adequate to take him to Continental destinations. This was added to by reason of the fact that at home here we had this insidious inflationary spiral which the Government have done nothing <Col N="617" /> to tackle.  Prices have risen here while at the same time our competitive position in the British market was being seriously eroded, and particularly by the growth of the cheap package holidays to Continental destinations by charter aircraft, to Spain, France and other Continental areas.  Price-wise we have not been able to compete with them, these holidays, nor have we made any serious effort to compete with them, nor is the Bord Fáilte marketing division equipped to deal with this highly commercial situation which has arisen in the British market.</P>
    <P>We have had also another serious factor inhibiting the growth of tourism from Britain in the transport charges across the Irish Sea.  This is something to which I have referred on many occasions. Air charges between here and Britain are now becoming absolutely outrageous.  I want to warn the Minister that if the airlines get away with the further increase they are seeking in the cross-Channel routes, a situation will have been reached where the return ticket by air between Ireland and Britain will cost as much as an all-in package holiday in Spain from Britain. We are fast approaching that stage and the Minister cannot close his eyes to it. We have to face up to the realities of this situation.  I believe that, despite the adverse effects of the problem in the North of Ireland on the British market, there is still tremendous scope for Irish tourism.  It will require a new approach, new techniques, new strategy, new forms of publicity and advertising, but most of all it poses a very important consideration, that if we want to maintain our foothold in the British tourist market, we have to do something about air transport, particularly air transport between Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>I think the time is fast approaching when our national airlines will have to look at the feasibility of setting up a charter subsidiary.  This should be seriously considered, particularly in view of the fact that we cannot dispose of the Viscount aircraft on which grass is growing out in Dublin Airport.  BEA has participation in subsidiary charter companies and the Minister will have to look into this matter, because price-wise we have not got an earthly hope.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> It has become so bad now that our own Irish people are finding it impossible&mdash; they cannot afford it&mdash;to come home at least once a year as they have always done.</P>
    <P>This problem of transport charges must be tackled and I believe that there is a cast iron case for the introduction of duty-free facilities on the Irish Sea. I have no doubt whatsoever that the introduction of such facilities across the Irish Sea would be a tremendous inducement to travel and would help to counteract the high transport charges on the Irish Sea.  I have raised this matter before and I would like to know what the Minister has decided to do about it.  What discussions have been held?  Rumour has it that the Irish Government have approached the British Government in relation to duty-free facilities and that the British Government are not in favour of it.  What is the problem?  If we can overcome this problem and get our packages down to a competitive level, we can sell them on the British market.  We can sell special interest holidays like angling and other activities, particularly in the mass market in the British midlands where fishing is the main activity and hobby of the people.  We can definitely do this if we get our transport charges down, but looking at it at this stage, it appears to me that the Government, Bord Fáilte and the airline in particular will have to look at this question of charter across the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this whole question and Deputy Barrett will be particularly interested in this because I am going to quote the Bishop of Killaloe, the Most Reverend Dr. Harty. I have said in relation to the British tourist market that new techniques, new methods and new marketing strategy will have to be devised.  I am appalled at a document I have received, a document which has recently been published by Bord Fáilte and which is about to circulate amongst tourist interests.  I produced a similar document on the Supplementary Estimate last March.  I have said on numerous occasions that we need new approaches and new strategy in Britain.  I have criticised Bord Fáilte for the fact that their whole marketing policy was wrongly orientated, that it was aimed <Col N="619" /> at a top class, better off British tourist. I held up here last year the advertising schedule in Britain of Bord Fáilte for last year and I pointed out that there was overemphasis on the top-class journals such as <i>The Sunday Times</i> and <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i>, and I said that there was a need to tackle particularly the ethnic and the ordinary market in Britain, and I suggested that in future their advertising budget should be rescheduled.</P>
    <P>I particularly asked the Minister last March to bear in mind the possibilities of the ethnic market in Britain and I suggested that Bord Fáilte should do a substantial amount of advertising in the <i>Irish Post</i>, a newspaper circulating every week amongst the Irish people in Britain.  The editor, if I remember rightly, comes from Deputy Taylor's constituency.  I have here the advertising schedule of Bord Fáilte for 1972 in Britain and what do I find&mdash;<i>The Sunday Times</i> colour magazine, four half-page colour and two half-page colour BW, <i>The Observer</i> colour magazine.  This is the order of priority of Bord Fáilte advertising: <i>Daily Telegraph, TV Times, Sunday Express, Daily Express, Daily Mail, Daily Telegraph, The Times, The Guardian, The Sunday Times, The Observer, The Universe, The Catholic Herald, Drive</i> magazine and <i>The Irish Post.</i>  Down near the end is <i>The Irish Post</i>&mdash;two half-page and a second ten inch triple column.  That is the sum total of the advertising budget allocated by Bord Fáilte to the vast four million ethnic market in Britain.</P>
    <P>I challenged the Minister on this last March&mdash;he can check the record of that debate on the Supplementary Estimate&mdash;and I pointed out that the greatest potential market in Britain was among our own Irish people.  I pointed out that there were one million Irish-born people in Britain and over three million of Irish heritage and that nobody could be more easily attracted to come home to Ireland than our own people and that for the last decade, in their concern with and overemphasis on the top managing director bracket in Britain, Bord Fáilte ignored completely this mass market, that the airline fleeced them with their high <Col N="620" /> fares and that no attempt was made to devise or design a holiday package for Irish exiles.  I thought a big change of heart had come about.  I have got handouts from Bord Fáilte.  I have met the new marketing director and the publicity manager.  I was in Britain a few weeks ago and met Mr. Terry Sheehy.  I was assured that Bord Fáilte would now pay special attention to the ethnic market.</P>
    <P>I find in their whole advertising schedule for 1972 two half pages. Surely the Minister will agree with me that we should now more than ever before aim at bringing home on holiday or encouraging as many of our own Irish people as possible to come home on holiday.  What is the Minister doing about it?  What are the Government going to do about it? There are two things necessary.  I am as familiar with Irish organisations in Britain as any Member of this House and I believe that they feel sore about the fact that they have been neglected by Bord Fáilte, that no effort was made by the Government to devise cheap holidays for them at home or to give them special travel concessions. The Bishop of Killaloe, Dr. Harty, when he addressed the Claremen's Association in London, said:</P>
    <P>The time has come to ask Bord Fáilte and Aer Lingus to devise ways and means of facilitating cheaper air travel for our returning emigrants.</P>
    <P>He went on to make a case similar to that which I have made in this House.  The Minister did not agree with me last March.  He said that the policy of Bord Fáilte was to aim at the non-Irish person.  He admitted it here in the House.  It is on the record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the schedule for 1972.  All publications on which Bord Fáilte advertisements will appear are listed on this.  The main criticism made by Irish people in Britain is that no effort has been made to devise a special family package holiday for Irish people.  They are very sore, and justifiably so, about the fact that they have to pay exorbitant transport charges, that the package deals and the travel concessions available to ordinary tourists are not available to an Irish family coming home because they stay with their families and friends rather than in hotels or guesthouses.  I have put this to the marketing manager of Bord Fáilte, I put it to Mr. Terry Sheehy in London a few weeks ago and I am putting it to the Minister now that two things must be done if we are to get any substantial flow of traffic from Britain during the coming year.  We must devise a special package holiday for Irish people coming home on their annual holidays. I guarantee the Minister that if this is done the best salesmen for Irish tourism in Britain&mdash;this is where Bord Fáilte and the Government have been all wrong in recent years&mdash;are the Irish persons living in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A year ago I was in London at a reunion which the people of my own parish hold there each year.  I was talking to the chairman of that organisation and I said to him: &ldquo;You could do a lot to help the flow of tourist traffic to Ireland.&rdquo;  He worked with a large international company. He said: &ldquo;I could.  There are English families in my neighbourhood and my mates are English.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;Did you ever try to encourage them to come to Ireland?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;Why would I do that when Bord Fáilte do not give a damn about me and when the airlines are robbing me?&rdquo;  I said to him: &ldquo;I believe Bord Fáilte and the Government are going to do something <Col N="622" /> about this now,&rdquo; and he said: &ldquo;I will try it as an experiment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That ordinary working man was responsible this year for bringing 20 British friends to Ireland and they spent a fortnight here.  Surely if a fair deal were given, particularly to our 1,000,000 Irish-born people there, they in return would sell Ireland to the second and third generation Irish.  I am disgusted by the same old approach.  As I said before, the policy of Bord Fáilte in Britain during the past decade has been that they would prefer to see one managing director of a major company in the Midlands coming to Ireland on a holiday than 500 workers from the factory floor. The Minister has a serious job before him in relation to Britain.  I recommend that all the resources at his disposal should be thrown into the question of introducing a fair deal for Irish people.  As Dr. Harty said, and I quote from <i>The Clare Champion:</i></P>
    <P>The money spent by Irish exiles in their own villages and hamlets and rural areas is making as good a contribution to the economy of this country as that of the tourists from foreign parts.  The great advantage is that the Irish person is coming back to his own town.  He may not be staying in a hotel or guesthouse but he will be spending money and the money he spends makes a very important contribution to the local economy. </P>
    <P>If the Minister does not reply until next week I would ask him to check on this with Bord Fáilte.  I feel very badly about it.  I feel that I have been led up the garden path.  I went so far three weeks ago, when I was in Britain, as to invite Mr. Terry Sheehy to come to this reunion which we have had now for ten years of 500 people from Bruff and the surrounding districts. The Bishop of Limerick was there.  Mr. Sheehy came along.  We had a long discussion and he told me that Bord Fáilte were going to tackle the ethnic market with new schemes and new plans.  I pointed out to him particularly the importance of advertising in those journals circulating among the emigrants.</P>

      <P>The Minister need not talk to me about the Irish ethnic market in Britain.  I am not going to listen to him because neither he nor Bord Fáilte nor the airlines gave two tupenny damns about it for the last ten years.  I thought there was a change of heart.  I will take it up again with Bord Fáilte.  I even went so far as to make a special appeal to the emigrants when I was in Britain some time ago to do all they could to encourage their friends to spend a holiday in Ireland. That appeal was published in the papers.  Bord Fáilte helped me in compiling it.  I had to co-operate with them to the best of my ability in encouraging Irish people to come home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking through the Estimate, and particularly the Supplementary Estimate, I am not satisfied at all about <Col N="624" /> the amount of money made available for marketing.  Last year we had a rather extraordinary situation where the Minister made £395,000 available for marketing purposes.  It transpired that £200,000 of this was taken out of another fund, the loans fund, of Bord Fáilte and £195,000 has to come out of this particular Estimate.  What is the position in regard to the marketing subvention?  My analysis is that the amount of money that will be available to Bord Fáilte in respect of the current year for marketing purposes will be less than it was last year and less than it was the year before.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to consultants having being called in to examine Bord Fáilte.  I should like to know how many consultants were called in, who they were, what they did, what they cost.  As far as I can see, for the last year or two, foreign consultants have been running the Department of Transport and Power.  There was the report that all the controversy was about in the papers.  By a good bit of journalistic <Col N="627" /> strategy, some journalist laid hold of the report into the marketing angle of Bord Fáilte and it was splashed in the papers.  Why was that report not made available?  Was it not public funds that went into employing these consultants? Surely we are entitled to know what they said?</P>
      <P>In regard to the new reorganisation that took place within Bord Fáilte, I should like to ask the Minister why were not the staff notified or consulted before this scheme went into operation? Why did no staff consultation take place?  What is the position now?  What effect has this had on the morale of the staff of Bord Fáilte?  Perhaps the Minister would look into this matter, because it is important.</P>
      <P>It is my view that, despite the difficulties we have experienced in the tourist industry, the future is bright provided the Government, in particular, face up to the problems, provided that new techniques and new policies are introduced to meet the challenge.</P>
      <P>There is a second point that I want to bring to the attention of the Minister. I have been drawing his attention to the ethnic market in Britain for I do not know how long.</P>
      <P>There is a totally unsatisfactory situation in regard to the relationship between the State bodies involved in tourism.  Senator Ruairí Brugha referred to this last week in his excellent speech at the annual general meeting of whatever tourist body he is involved in.  Not merely have we got Bord Fáilte, but we have Aer Lingus, CIE, SFADCO and several others.  These organisations, instead of co-operating with one another, instead of co-ordinating their policies, instead of assisting private enterprise, are engaged in open cut-throat competition with one another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw evidence of that this summer and I received evidence of it from the United States.  There have been several complaints of these State companies literally sticking knives in each other's backs.  This is a very serious situation. It is one the Minister has failed to tackle and unless he does so there will be very serious trouble.  I saw this in Manchester last year.  There, you had <Col N="628" /> Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus, the B &amp; I, and SFADCO all operating within one small area and all competing with one another for business.  The B &amp; I are based in Liverpool and surely SFADCO should not be there competing with them.  In Sheffield, 30 miles away, no State company have any offices or representatives.  This is a serious matter.  I emphasise it again knowing the growing dissatisfaction in the private sector of the industry because of the carry-on of some of these State companies.  It should be possible for the Minister to bring these together and arrive at some formula clearly defining the functions of each State body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

It was a very serious obstacle and I am glad Senator Ruairí Brugha referred to it because I have been talking about this for the past two years and people thought I was talking through my hat but, as on most other subjects on which I speak here, I researched facts before I commented.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Supplementary Estimate is to tide CIE over its present difficulties pending the outcome of the investigation into CIE following on the McKinsey report.  The Minister promised some weeks ago that, when the Government had considered McKinsey, there would be a full-scale debate here on the future role of CIE.</P>

      <P>Since there will be a full-scale debate, and since we had a debate this time last year on CIE, I do not propose to go into a detailed analysis of the situation or give my views on the McKinsey report.  I have studied it fairly thoroughly.  I have always emphasised the vital importance of the Government formulating and implementing a national transport policy.  I have called repeatedly for this in the past two years.  I have pointed out that it is a matter of great urgency because of the important role transport will play in the European Economic Community.</P>
      <P>In the past 12 months we have had seven different pieces of transport legislation and I have criticised the Government for introducing a continuous series of unco-ordinated haphazard transport legislation.  As well as examining the McKinsey report, I trust the Government will examine the whole situation in regard to transport and that we will have a White Paper setting forth the Government's views on transport.  It would be fatal to legislate for the future of CIE by considering the railway in isolation or CIE itself in isolation.  A national transport policy has a very important part to play and the Government will have to take steps to formulate a policy which will ensure the optimum utilisation of all our transport resources. This is vital because of the way in which the Common Market transport policy is evolving.  I dealt with this earlier in the year in the debate on the Common Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>McKinsey has given rise to a great deal of talk.  Some weeks ago here I said the McKinsey report, in my personal opinion, was the greatest wastage of public funds in the history of this State.  I have since studied the report because some people said I was premature in my judgement.  I have discussed the report with transport employees&mdash;sound men who have spent 20 or 30 years operating in various parts of the CIE network&mdash; and I have no hesitation in saying that this document, which cost £60,000 to compile and which costs £3 to buy, <Col N="630" /> contributes nothing original to our knowledge of the role of public transport in the life of the nation.  One of the major recommendations&mdash;I am amused at the way this is being held out in certain quarters as a totally new concept&mdash;was that the social service aspect of transport should be separated from the purely commercial aspect.</P>
    <P>The commercial sector should be made pay for itself but the Government should subvent economic transport services in those areas where such services could be justified on social grounds.  In December, 1969, we had the 1969 Transport Bill and during that debate almost identical views were expressed by me in relation to the social needs of public transport.  I pointed out the need for normalising the accounting system in CIE.  Deputy Childers was standing in for the present Minister, who was indisposed at the time, and he pointed out that this could not be done.  I was very interested to learn that the normalisation of accounts simply meant that the balance sheet would show the commercial returns from the commercial sector of CIE as distinct from the returns from those services which are uneconomic but which are justified on social grounds&mdash;in other words the demand sector would be separated from the need sector.  This is the whole basis of McKinsey.  I do not know whether or not the Minister knows&mdash; I would not be a bit surprised if he does not&mdash;that there is an excellent research branch in CIE.</P>

      <P>In the February, 1971, issue of <i>Forum</i> Dr. Noel Whelan, Ph.D, Assistant General Manager, Research and Development of CIE, wrote an article defining the role of the railways. I have never met Dr. Whelan but I have read a great deal of what he has written.  I have compared some of his work with transport publications from Britain and the EEC countries and I have the highest admiration for his ability.  The basic recommendations, concepts and ideas behind Dr. Whelan's article are the same as McKinsey's.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>McKinsey talks about the social obligations of a public transport system.  The fact that this House is prepared to provide a subvention for CIE because it is providing transport services justified by community needs which cannot be made economically viable is proof that we recognise the social obligations of public transport.</P>
      <P>Another section of McKinsey is taken up with the question of public transport and the role of CIE in relation to our entry to the EEC.  If we become members of the EEC we shall have to accept the Common Market transport policy.  The role of the railways in the EEC has already been worked out.  Members will be allowed to operate uneconomic services on the railways provided they can be justified by community needs.  Deputy Taylor will be interested to know that they can also be justified for regional development needs.  I made an impassioned plea earlier this evening for the preservation of the west of Ireland.  I believe there is a cast iron case for subsidising transport between Dublin and the west in order to encourage the establishment of industry there and this would be permissible within the context of the EEC policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot figure out why the Government decided to bring in McKinsey. Everything I can do to find fault with McKinsey I will do in order to try to stop the wholesale importation of <Col N="632" /> foreign consultants to examine every sector of our nationalised industries. Of course, if we had a good Government and Ministers who were on the ball and doing their jobs properly, there would be no need to bring in foreign consultants.  This habit of importing foreign consultants to solve every problem is arousing grave concern throughout the country and has been the subject of a considerable amount of criticism, fully justified, in my opinion.  Surely we have consultants with the education, training and in many cases experience gained abroad who are as good as or even better than McKinsey or any of these other foreign consultants?  This is casting a very bad reflection on the type of Government we have.</P>
    <P>When the Government have fully examined the future role of CIE and the future role of the railways I hope they will look at the whole sphere of public transport.  How can any Deputy make a constructive speech on the activities of ten or 11 State-sponsored bodies to which the Minister has allotted 43 pages of script, minus the famous page 18a?  I would like the Government to introduce a comprehensive White Paper on the whole field of transport.</P>

      <P>As has been mentioned already, this Estimate covers a very wide field of activity.  What is of interest to the people I represent is the section dealing with Shannon Airport. I wonder if people in other parts of the country appreciate the fears that exist in western and southern counties about the threat posed by the American Government with regard to Shannon Airport?</P>
      <P>The airport is the hub of all activity in our region and it affects many other counties also.  It employs 1,000 people in the sales and catering services, with an annual wage bill of £1 million.  In addition, a further £1 million is spent locally on food, merchandise, hotels and other services.  This will give some idea of the enormous problem that exists at the moment.  Aer Rianta employ a considerable number of people and the airport has been developed as our transatlantic airport. As a result of the development that has taken place in the airport, 8,000 people are employed.  One can appreciate the fears expressed by the people and they believe that if the concessions which the Americans seek are granted it will be the beginning of the end for the airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> We know what led up to this situation. It is due to the determination shown by our Government in the last ten years, and particularly in the last two years when the pressure was put on at Government level.  Because of the determination shown by our Government, the American Government have issued an ultimatum that they will withdraw all rights from Aer Lingus to fly in and out of New York airport.  The result of this would mean bankruptcy for our airline.</P>
    <P>The ultimatum issued by the Americans has come as a surprise.  We have always looked on the United States as a friendly nation; they gave us to understand we were one of their favourite small nations because of the many Irish people who have emigrated to their country during the years.  In recent years two American Presidents visited Ireland and last year President Nixon went to a lot of trouble to trace his Irish ancestors.  The ultimatum can only be described as the act of a bullyboy using the big stick against a smaller person.  In my opinion the Americans have treated us as they would treat North Vietnam or some other declared enemy.</P>
    <P>As a result of the ultimatum there was a great rallying to the cause in the area.  The Shannon Action Committee, the tourist organisations, urban councils and county councils got together and declared that this was a national crisis.  The groups in the area have shown a united front.  The Deputies and Senators from the area came to the Minister for Transport and Power and he informed us of the position. He made it clear that it was not a bluff by the Americans but that it was a real issue.  At some stage it became known that the decision taken by the Americans was made at Presidential level, proof in itself that the Americans meant business.  It was obvious we were not going to get away easily in negotiations which had to take place.</P>
    <P>The first people hit by the ultimatum were Aer Lingus.  They found that their advance bookings for the period after 18th August, 1972, were in jeopardy. Travel agents in America told them there was no point in booking with them when they could not guarantee <Col N="635" /> that they could fly passengers out of New York.  This made negotiations more urgent.  We know now that our negotiators had no option but to pack their bags and come home.  I do not know what happened but I presume there was no progress to report.  The Americans maintained their position as we have done.  I congratulate the Government on the stand they have taken during the years and particularly in the last two years.  The people in my constituency and in the west of Ireland expect the Government to continue to stand firm despite what is involved. Eventually there may be an agreement signed that will not imperil the airport.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is that we make Shannon Airport the transatlantic terminal for all airlines, including Aer Lingus.  This would nullify immediately the American claim that they are not getting a fair deal in not being permitted to fly into Dublin.  They could not expect to negotiate a better position here than that enjoyed by our national airline.  This would have complications for Aer Lingus but these could be overcome.  There is no reason why a small type aircraft could not be acquired to run a shuttle service for all the airlines between Shannon and Dublin.  At the moment Aer Lingus are using their jumbo jets for this shuttle service and I understand that from the financial point of view this service is not economic.  It has been mentioned that there is a loss of about £250 on each flight.  The initial cost would be the greatest cost.  We would have to acquire the necessary small aircraft to run a proper shuttle service.  I agree that disruption would be involved for some Aer Lingus personnel but when we talk about decentralisation, would it not be far more realistic to change from one aircraft to another rather than to send a Government Department down to some town in the west?</P>
    <P>Some of the people who would be required to move to our region might not wish to do so, but there could be an interchange of personnel between other State bodies.  Some people who are already working in other State <Col N="636" /> bodies could change to Aer Lingus.  I have had quite a few requests from people working in other State Departments and bodies in Dublin for a transfer to the Limerick/Shannon area, so that difficulty could be overcome.</P>
    <P>Some cost would also be involved in providing the necessary servicing facilities but this would not be very great as far as the transatlantic planes are concerned.  We have not got servicing facilities for jumbo jets in Dublin Airport.  I understand that they are serviced in London.  We would have to build this servicing unit in Dublin in any event so why not build it in Shannon?  This would surely completely eliminate the American complaint. I would ask the Minister and the Government to give serious consideration to this and to take some steps towards having it implemented. It would put an end to this headache we have every year with the American airlines trying to overfly Shannon and fly directly into Dublin.</P>
    <P>The people expect the Government to stand steady on this issue.  They are united behind them.  All the people with whom I have been in contact are fully behind the Government&mdash; religious and others.  They have stated this publicly.  I trust that this is the stand that will be taken.  The Americans have made projections about bringing in more tourists if they are allowed to fly directly into Dublin but those projections do not stand up to close examination.  People to whom I have spoken about them are not impressed by them.  People who are already in the airline business are not convinced by them.  We should not fall for that gimmick.</P>
    <P>According to their own statistics, the American companies who fly into the capitals of countries claim that each tourist spends 3.8 days in the capital city.  Our present figure is that each tourist who stops off at Shannon spends 10.7 days in the country, not excluding Dublin.  Therefore, for these companies to fly into the capital would not help the overall tourist position.  According to the Americans, the tourists would stay for a very much shorter time.  I presume Dublin has not got any greater attraction than cities like Rome and <Col N="637" /> Paris, so we must assume that the figure of 3.8 days would apply to us as well.  We could also lose there.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out, in my opinion to cure this ill we must embark on decentralisation and we must make Shannon the terminal for all transatlantic aircraft flying the North Atlantic route, including Aer Lingus.  I hope the Minister will bear this in mind and explore it to the fullest extent. I am sure that the people who would be disrupted would not mind too much if they had to come and live in our area.  They would find it very pleasant. Any of the people I met down in Shannon who were transferred from Dublin and other places are very pleased to be living there.  We have workers from all over the country, from the North of Ireland and from every county in Ireland, I would say. They do not find anything wrong with the area.  They are quite pleased with their surroundings and they make no secret of that fact.  I exhort the Government to be as determined about this as they have been up to now and to maintain the <i>status quo</i> in Shannon Airport which is vital to the economy of the west in the opinion of everybody in the west.  It is the generating point for all tourism in the west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very natural that the question of landing rights and the overflying of Shannon should overshadow many of the other items included in the Vote for the Department of Transport and Power.  Statements were made in the House this evening and it is necessary for me, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, to make our attitude quite clear.  Some misunderstanding arose during the course of the debate and it was implied that there were divergent voices within this party. That is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us put this matter in perspective. As a party we were unanimous in supporting the Government's attitude towards preventing the overflying of Shannon.  It was decided on the direction of our leader, Deputy Cosgrave, that a memorandum should be prepared and Deputy O'Donnell, the shadow Minister for Transport and Power, was given the task of preparing that <Col N="638" /> memorandum, which, to my mind, is the best I have seen, and many have been prepared and published.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear once and for all that as a party we are speaking with one voice in supporting the Government and the Minister.  It is totally wrong for anyone to imply that at one time anyone in his party has spoken against the Government's stand. I think it is agreed that we have spoken with one voice.  Politics have never influenced us in the western region.  I am a member of the Regional Development Board in the Limerick/Shannon/ Tipperary area.  I think we were the first board to uphold the Minister's decision and the attitude of the Government on the question of overflying Shannon.  The regional tourism organisation of the Shannonside as a group and all interests involved united in support of the Government.  On my introducing a motion, Clare County Council decided to circularise all public bodies on the west and south coast.  It is wrong for anyone to indicate that there are divergent voices.  I should like to clear that up.</P>

      <P>It is necessary for all of us to express our views very clearly and very firmly now that the negotiations are not completed.  I would prefer to say they are suspended.  There may be more discussions at a higher level to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion.  There should never be any thought of disunity in this country. For too long that has impeded development. The Minister is an affable and approachable man.  In my few years in the House I have had experience of the courtesy with which he receives the Deputies&mdash;and that is also quite true of all his staff.  I was really amazed that he should make reference here to a particular Deputy, but possibly he considered it necessary because of newspaper reports and because of statements made that the Government had already made some bargain.  I do not accept that any bargain was made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be very disappointed if any responsible Government or any responsible Minister could even think of taking action without having full consultation with Parliament on an issue which affects the livelihood of many people and the economy of the State.  Possibly Deputy O'Donnell was stating what he had heard from quite a few people. I myself heard this rumour from different sources.  I am not clear where it originated, but it was floating around, and as time went on it was accepted as a fact, which of course was wrong. Now that the little storm has blown over I think we can step forward together again.</P>
      <P>This overflying of Shannon has been discussed time and time again, and it is not for me to go over the ground again which our negotiators, the civil servants, have been travelling on behalf of the Government.  However, the economy of a region depends entirely on the success of the talks which will take place shortly.  The development at Shannon has brought prosperity to that area, particularly to Clare, over a number of years, and it is vital that nothing should happen that would lead to the collapse of the economy of that area.  I do not think that will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While both Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte are both very interested in increasing the potential in tourism, they may overlook some areas.  I remember when an Total was being promoted, somebody referred to it as something being promoted during the monsoon period, when golf clubs from England were encouraged to come here.  It was not a very successful venture.  Would it not be possible to encourage our emigrants to return home by air by giving them a reduction in their fares.  The fact that they are not staying in hotels seems to be the excuse for not granting them this concession.  I do not think that is a reasonable attitude, and I would ask the Minister to see to it that Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte afford special travel facilities to our emigrants at Christmas <Col N="640" /> time or during the summer holiday period.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to find it has been decided to give an injection of a few million pounds to CIE for the railways. CIE should be considered from a socio-economic point of view because of the employment given. The railways in some counties are threatened with closure.  We have experienced that in Clare, where over three-quarters the length of the county is without a rail service.  Our roads are deteriorating and it is practically impossible to keep them up to the standard which is necessary for heavy traffic.  Development of the railways would ease this problem.</P>
    <P>I was wondering would CIE consider having bus shelters erected particularly in places from which workers go to factories in the morning and return late at night.  Some protection should be given to the travelling public and an allocation should be made every year so that gradually this amenity could be made available at various bus stops.</P>
    <P>With regard to the development of supplementary holiday accommodation, I note that the western counties got £100,000 last year but that the sum has not been increased this year. Bord Fáilte should do some new thinking on the promotion of holidays. Our experience in the past few years would seem to indicate that we have over-emphasised the necessity for developing Grade A hotels.  The fact that they have not been filled would lead us to believe that the policy has not been as successful as we had hoped.  Therefore, I would suggest that some plan should now be considered which would allow guesthouses and farmhouses to benefit from the money allocated to tourism.  British tourists in particular favour guesthouses and farm holidays.  We should provide such amenities.</P>
    <P>SFADCO can be termed a semi-State body.  They receive a subvention from the Department of Transport and Power.  They are doing a wonderful job.  They deserve any praise they get. They have shown how progress in industrialisation can be achieved.  For some reason best known to the Minister, <Col N="641" /> the Government and SFADCO the industrialisation has not extended to the western coastal regions of Clare and Limerick.  I am particularly interested in the West Clare coast where people are displeased about the rate of industrial progress.  An industrialist came and selected a site for a small factory in this area.  Somehow the area was victimised and the foundation of an industry there was deferred.  There seemed to be a penalty on the man who considered the area worth developing.</P>
    <P>If something effective is to be done about saving the west the Minister should do something about it before it is too late.  He should correct the imbalance which has been shown up in the census figures where there was a decrease of 1,000 people between one census and another.  The policies used to save the west have been wrong and should be changed immediately.  I am asking the Minister to correct the obvious and harmful imbalance which exists.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to find that electricity consumption has increased by 10 per cent.  This indicates the progressiveness of the ESB and seems to justify the confidence which the promoters of the board had when the former Deputy Paddy McGilligan authorised the building of the first electric power station at Ardnacrusha.  This scheme was described then as a white elephant. We are pleased to see that progress has been maintained there all down the years.</P>
    <P>I would like to have some indication of the sums originally intended for the development of the resort at Kilkee.  A few years ago large-scale development was envisaged there.  One stage of this development was completed. It is necessary to protect coastal towns from erosion by the sea and such work should be done before serious damage occurs and repairs prove expensive.</P>
    <P>A big hotel in Kilkee was closed during the last tourist season.  I am not familiar with the costings or with the details of the State subsidy given to the hotel.  Anyone who gets a substantial grant has an obligation to provide a service to the tourists of the <Col N="642" /> area.  I ask the Minister for Transport and Power to investigate what has happened and to decide on the course of action necessary in order to have this particular hotel in Kilkee opened for the coming tourist season.</P>
    <P>The importance of Irish Shipping Limited to our agricultural industry is often overlooked.  Our cattle trade depends on having a really efficient shipping company.  The submissions of the livestock exporters' associations in regard to cattle exports should be attended to promptly and freight rates should be adjusted.  These matters react on the cattle trade and on the prices which farmers get for their stock. British Rail should have suitable wagons available for the transport of the cattle to their final destinations.</P>
    <P>I hope that the good relationship which I have experienced over the past few years with the Department of Transport and Power, the Minister and his officials will continue.  There is just one other small point in connection with the festivals in our small towns. It has been suggested that entertainment should be provided in areas which are considered tourist areas.  In every small village and town in Clare the local people have provided that type of entertainment.</P>
    <P>The festival committees who provided that entertainment did not get adequate grants to encourage them to developthis activity from the bodies administering those grants.  Some people seem to have a gloomy view of tourist prospects for 1972.  I do not share it but I think that if in the years ahead more generous grants were given it would be a direct injection into the tourism arm which would ensure that tourists would see Irish entertainment in the form of music, song and dance as they would like to see it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with one matter mentioned in the Minister's speech and peculiarly annotated on page 18 (a) of his brief. It was, I suppose, a rather belated insertion by the Minister on another stencil&mdash;or at his behest, I presume&mdash; in relation to recent developments affecting the negotiations between the Irish Government and the US negotiators <Col N="643" /> in Washington.  I think it is important to repeat what the Minister said.  He described the recent views of Deputy, O'Donnell as mischievous and irresponsible, as sabotaging the national interest, as being clouded by a party political attitude.  He used the phrase, whatever it means, that Deputy O'Donnell &ldquo;broke the line&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>An unwritten agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that he was the only person who did so.  He suggested that Deputy O'Donnell was undermining the Government's stand and indicated that the Deputy was injuring his own reputation as a credible political figure.  Finally, the Minister indulged in the usual rhetoric about the Fianna Fáil Government negotiating on behalf of Ireland; that it had got its priorities right; that Shannon was started by Fianna Fáil and would always be cherished by Fianna Fáil.  We can excuse this party political rhetoric but I think nobody on this side of the House can excuse the Minister's deliberate insertion into his speech of an entirely unwarranted and scurrilous attack on a Deputy in such a manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, but the Deputy was not here for Deputy Coughlan's contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that Deputy O'Donnell's views on this matter were not motivated by narrow party political considerations.  From my limited experience in the House, and looking around here this evening, I consider Deputy O'Donnell to be one of the most active, competent and effective Deputies and one of the very few Deputies in this House who bothers doing his homework in relation to his responsibility as a shadow spokesman. I am not of the same political party but <Col N="644" /> I have no hesitation in saying that I consider him to be one of the finest Opposition spokesmen on Transport and Power in the history of this State since it was founded.  I think the Minister was grossly unfair; it is sour grapes, simply intellectual jealousy, losing his cool because Deputy O'Donnell, as is his right, was keeping the pressure on the Minister as an Opposition spokesman, while, at the same time, not yielding to party political attitudes.  I do not think that was Deputy O'Donnell's intention nor is it his custom.  Putting it in the normal parliamentary sense, I do not think the Minister was being fair and I think that, in fact, the Minister only injured his own reputation and further reduced the credibility he himself possesses as a political figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell accused the Minister of selling out. What is that but a party political attitude? Be fair -minded about it.  I agree with the Deputy's views of Deputy O'Donnell; he is an excellent Deputy but let us be fair about it.  He accused the Minister of selling out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy O'Donnell can be accused of <Col N="645" /> indicating that the Government had sold out in regard to Shannon.  He was quite rightly exercising his function as an Opposition spokesman to serve notice on the Government, as is his prerogative, to make sure that no such thing occurred.</P>
      <P>One might, I suppose, summarise this question as the issue of the landing rights at Dublin.  It is important that we in the Labour Party, both the Deputies from the south of Ireland and those interested in the matter in the greater Dublin area, should state and put our position on record so that there will be no illusions here or in America about where we stand.  I think Ireland stands to lose by&mdash;I would even say&mdash; any alteration in the present US-Irish air agreement that would permit US airlines to operate scheduled services into Dublin Airport in addition to their present rights at Shannon.  We recognise&mdash;we may have been slow to do so at times&mdash;that air traffic rights in a country are assets which are just as valuable as any of the normal, natural resources of a country.  Such assets involve employment, growth of income and, above all, foreign earnings.  Nowadays, such assets are only exchanged after very tough bargaining.  In some instances we have given virtual <i>carte blanche</i> to foreign enterprises to explore, if not exploit, some of our natural resources.  I had reservations about Government policy in relation to mineral exploration: I had substantial reservations about Government policy in regard to oil exploration.  I have even greater reservations about Government policy in relation to our natural gas resources and in relation to negotiations with foreign enterprises, particularly during the past ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, this country cannot afford to squander or give away in negotiation all those valuable air routes on the basis of a hunch, on the basis of an American promise or a gesture of goodwill.  From my experiences in the trade union movement, I can say that other countries guard very jealously their air traffic rights and, consequently, disagreement on this question is one which is of very frequent occurrence.  The US has had major air right differences during the past few <Col N="646" /> years with Britain, Canada, Greece, Italy, Japan, Australia and other countries.  What we are involved in with them is nothing new.</P>
    <P>Britain at present is concerned about air rights and the British Opposition spokesman has confirmed this to us and has written a good deal about it. They are trying to reduce the American capacity into the British market.  The Australians are in strong disagreement with the Americans in regard to capacity on the Pacific and South Atlantic and are opposing efforts by America to increase the capacity of their carriers into Australia.  The Americans have a great deal of experience. They know all the tricks of the trade in terms of air traffic negotiations.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and the Irish negotiators well but, like the Minister, I have no illusions about the difficulties facing our negotiators.  Having left behind us the unduly petulant comments of the Minister on the shadow Fine Gael spokesman for Transport and Power, I think we should, in the words of Mr. M. J. Dargan, the general manager of Aer Lingus, close our ranks.  He said:</P>
    <P>It would be best for all Irish interests now to close our ranks and give our Government all the support we can in dealing with the negotiations ahead on which the immediate existence of Aer Lingus depends and which will have effects on Shannon Airport, on tourism and on the balance of payments.  Ireland is, after all, a very small community as compared to the wealth and might of the country which is putting the pressure on us and the Irish negotiators have plenty of moral justification.  But the physical strength lies with the opposition and they are accustomed to using it in the airline rights negotiations around the world on which they keep a top level team permanently employed.</P>
    <P>They are sobering words said Mr. Dargan and, therefore, I would urge that the collective ability of the Minister for Transport and Power.  Deputy O'Donnell and the other Opposition spokesman be mobilised and, if you like, that the hatchet should be buried <Col N="647" /> so that we can take on the Americans in the negotiating sense in a more hopeful manner instead of trying to gut one another as was attempted in the lunch-time programme on RTE today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The US-Ireland bilateral air agreement of 1945 was amended in 1947 and it is to the credit of the then Fianna Fáil Government that in the context of 1945 it was a reasonable agreement.  It is to the credit of farseeing men in this country such as the late Seán Lemass that it has been preserved down through the years.  This country, with a total population of 3 million, has designated as its transatlantic carrier Aer Lingus-Irish. On the other hand, I would draw the contrast of America, with a population of 200 million, designating three carriers, PAA, TWA and Seaboard. That is the general situation in relation to Ireland.</P>
      <P>Under the bilateral agreement Ireland have rights to operate services to three points, New York, Boston and Chicago, and services to Chicago can operate via Boston and New York.  It is important to point out that PAA have rights to Shannon from a range of American cities, winding up with Los Angeles, Portland, San Francisco and Seattle.  TWA have rights into Shannon from a range of American cities and on the cargo side Seaboard have rights to Shannon from Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chigago, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Washington, Detroit, Cleveland. In addition to having all of these rights from those cities to Ireland, the American carriers have rights from Ireland to a variety of places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>PAA pick up from Ireland to the UK, France, Belgium, The Netherlands, <Col N="648" /> Denmark and a whole range of other countries such as Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany, Poland, Russia, Austria, Hungary and others. TWA have a whole range of other rights from Ireland.  We tend to, or the Irish people seem to, be unaware of the seriousness of the situation.  I think Aer Lingus employees are extremely aware of it and the general manager is already talking in terms of 2,000 or 3,000 jobs being lost.  That is omnious talk coming from Mr. Dargan.</P>
    <P>These are some of the countries. Seaboard have rights beyond Ireland to the UK, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, West Germany and many of the other countries I have mentioned. The rights which the American airlines have at Shannon are the fullest that it is possible to grant.  These are known as fifth freedom rights: they permit the setting down and up-lifting of passengers and cargo at Shannon, travelling either East or West, to or from any point in the world.  There is no restriction on frequency.</P>
    <P>These rights of three American carriers, compared to one Irish carrier having rights to New York, Boston and Chicago show the gross imbalance that exists between the rights that the US carriers have and the rights that the Irish carrier has.  I presume this is the nub of the arguments of the Irish negotiators.  There can be no doubt but that the balance of the present agreements is in favour of the US.  It is time that the American pressure in that regard began to yield and that they began to realise that we in this country have literally nothing to give.  In making a comparison between other European countries and American rights, it is important to bear the current situation in mind.  Three major US carriers operate into Shannon, the international airport of a country of 3,000,000 people.</P>
    <P>The only other centres in Europe in which all three US carriers operate are London, which is the main gateway to a country of 52.5 million people; Paris, the gateway to a country of 49 million people; and Frankfurt, the gateway to a country of 59 million.  In the case of Italy, a country of 52 million people, the two passenger carriers, PAA and <Col N="649" /> TWA, have rights to Rome and the cargo carrier has rights to Milan.  The two US passenger carriers operate also into Madrid in a country where there are 31 million people, and into Lisbon which is a country of 8.5 million people.  In all of the following cases, only one US carrier is licensed to operate: Poland, a country of 31.5 million people; Turkey where there are 31.4 million people; Yugoslavia, a population of 19.3 million; Rumania, 18.9 million; Czechoslavakia, 13.4 million; The Netherlands, 12.2 million; Belgium, 9.4 million; Greece, 8.4 million; Sweden, 7.6 million; Austria, 7.2 million; Switzerland, 5.4 million; Denmark, 4.7 million; Finland, 4.6 million; and Norway, 3.7 million.  West Germany, because of her history, may be regarded as a special case; one US passenger carrier operates into four of its main cities: Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Dusseldorf.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it cannot be said that we have been ungenerous down through the years to the American airlines, and this cannot be contradicted by their negotiators in any sense in terms of our claims and of our legitimate aspirations to bring about a negotiated agreement. I expect there will be a negotiated agreement but it cannot be one that would wreck the Irish national airlines that we have succeeded in building up over a period of time. No doubt, these facts are in the brief of our negotiators but they must be reiterated here.  Also, they must be conveyed to the American people but above all, they must be conveyed to the Irish taxpayer who must bear the brunt of the losses of Aer Lingus.  I am sure it is not the wish of either the Irish taxpayer, the management of the company or of the Cabinet that there would be substantial losses on the part of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>We must indicate clearly that down through the years Irish traffic generally has developed better than the traffic to European countries since Aer Lingus commenced services.  This has been due to the greater promotion of Ireland as a destination, and to the fact that an adequate service has been provided. It is the opinion of Aer Lingus, and the opinion of the trade unionists employed there and of the staff associations <Col N="650" /> with whom I have had correspondence, that, so far as transatlantic traffic is concerned, Ireland is one market to be sold in the US whether a carrier has rights to Dublin or to Shannon.  It is the belief of Aer Lingus that the US carriers have had a good opportunity of developing business into Ireland during many years and that, if they mounted promotional efforts comparable to those of Aer Lingus, the total tourist market to Ireland would benefit greatly and so would the US carriers concerned.  Likewise, if they had exploited the opportunities that are even now available to them, they could have made a great contribution to their own revenue while improving greatly total tourism to Ireland. In the meantime tourism to Ireland can suffer only if the US carriers get rights to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have been under some pressure to accept the validity of the Dublin case because I represent a constituency which has substantial hotel interests, but, in this case, local or provincial aspirations must take second place and the national interest and the interest of our national airline, as well as the interest of the western region must, by and large, take precedence. Of course it has been argued that the more carriers flying into Dublin, the more traffic will be generated.  It appears to be, by reference to some principle, that competition increases total promotion automatically.  This principle is not relevant at all to the Dublin situation.</P>
    <P>We know that Aer Lingus-Irish have only got routes between Ireland and North America.  In the North American market, they have only one thing to sell and that is Ireland.  Their entire sales and promotion efforts in the US and Canada are directed solely to selling Ireland since their own existence and future depend on the success of such efforts.  Other carriers have other interests and consequently they have a more diffused selling effort generally. We might even say that the messages can be summarised very briefly&mdash;and we see the problems facing Aer Lingus in this regard&mdash;that whereas the Irish carrier Aer Lingus adopts the slogan of &ldquo;Fly to Ireland and come Aer Lingus-Irish&rdquo;, <Col N="651" /> most of the American carriers adopt the policy of &ldquo;Fly PanAm or TWA world-wide&rdquo;.  They say &ldquo;We go wherever you want to&rdquo; and &ldquo;We go where you are going&rdquo; and whether it would be Ireland or not would be incidental.  Meanwhile they want rights to travel in and out of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus in 1970-71 spent 1.5 million dollars in publicity generally in North America.  This included plain advertising, sales material and so on, and in the current year they are planning to spend almost 1.7 million dollars, or £706,000.  These figures show that by far the greatest efforts are being made in terms of promoting Ireland in North America.  Bord Fáilte, because of the lower volume of funds which they have available from resources, spent figures which on a comparable basis would be almost half those of Aer Lingus in 1970-71, including their own special promotional budget.  In 1970-71 Bord Fáilte Éireann spending was much smaller, with the difficulties surrounding the special supplementary budget available and so on, and I would say it was a figure of around 35 per cent at most of the Aer Lingus-Irish budget generally.  That is not a great position to be in.</P>
    <P>In addition to this publicity expenditure on the part of Aer Lingus, the sales expenditure in terms of pay and overheads and sales spread throughout the United States amounted to approximately two million dollars last year. This year it will be well up, touching the five million dollar mark.  Thus I think it is important to point out that Aer Lingus-Irish&mdash;we may so summarise it&mdash;spent about one-tenth, with all that big effort, of what PanAm spent in plain advertising themselves in the United States, despite the fact that Aer Lingus-Irish revenue was only one-twenty-fifth, or 4 per cent, of PanAm revenue and when it is considered that all the Aer Lingus-Irish advertising expenditure was directed to promoting travel to Ireland, whereas PanAm advertising was directed to selling on a world-wide travel basis, some idea can be had of <Col N="652" /> the vast difference in the effort being made by the two airlines in relation to this country.  This should be stated in no uncertain terms to the American Government.  That perhaps, speaking as I am to the converted, may be old hat to many of us, but I think that the degree of reaction in this country should not be built up on a mere antiAmerican emotional basis, but on the basis that we have a case, a case which will not be dominated by ultimatums from Washington, a case which will not be dominated by the United States Government giving notice, as they gave notice last August, a year's notice, of refusal of entry for our Atlantic arm to New York.  That kind of negotiating blackmail has its dangers and it has particular dangers as far as public reaction is concerned.  I do not think that anything constructive can come out of it in terms of American negotiating policy.  That kind of ultimatum, therefore, should be dropped and negotiations should proceed on a more rational and calmer basis.</P>
    <P>We have now been about 11 years working jet operations over the Atlantic and we have extended our routes to Chicago and Montreal.  I remember my father, as Lord Mayor of Cork, travelling to Montreal on the inaugural flight, and the great pride he had, and which many Irish people had in the North American continent, was that we as a very small country could extend our international airline network into both Chicago and Montreal, and make it a viable proposition at the same time.  It must be appreciated in this country that these routes and fleet have been expanded by Aer Lingus-Irish to meet the traffic as it expanded with its own promotional efforts, and that these services are operated the year round in comparison with many of the seasonal efforts of some of the Shannon-US routes flown by TWA and PanAm.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some peculiar blockage in many people's minds in relation to the operation of interchange flights between Shannon and Dublin. I have certainly found from talking to relatives in America, or to American trade union officers when they visit this country, that the practice of interchange on an aircraft basis with Aer <Col N="653" /> Lingus, as we have between Shannon and Dublin, has been a very well known practice for a very long time in America, some of whose own airlines participate in very similar interchange agreements between their own international and domestic carriers.  There is nothing wrong in this and we should not have any inferiority about it.  We have Pan American serving the route New Orleans to Atlanta, to Washington, to London on an interchange basis with Delta Airlines and we have the Minneapolis, Detroit, London, Amsterdam on an interchange with North-West Airlines.  We have TWA serving cities I have been in on their flights, Denver, Kansas City, and Cleveland combining rights, and there are many other examples.  These are all cases in which PanAm and TWA do not of themselves have the necessary traffic rights.  They should not try to cod us with their crocodile tears in regard to Shannon-Dublin.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the very extensive and, in my opinion, unbalanced operating privileges enjoyed by US carriers into and out of Ireland are not, I would suggest, even being repaid by them by traffic growth any way comparable to that generated by the national airline in this country and this appears to be due to their failure.  They can take it or leave it as far as I am concerned, and as far as the thousands of workers in Aer Lingus are concerned, they can take it or leave it.  The American airlines have failed to exploit the very substantial rights which they possess in excess of those available as of now to Aer Lingus-Irish, namely, rights from many cities to which the Irish carrier does not have rights in the United States; secondly, they have failed to mount an adequate promotional effort for travel to this country on the routes from Boston-New York-Chicago which they share with Aer Lingus-Irish and have failed to provide a regular system of services between Boston or Chicago and Ireland.  It is not our responsibility if the American airlines have neglected the opportunities available to their US carriers and certainly it is no help to Irish tourism which could have benefited quite considerably, if these opportunities had been properly exploited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" /> Because they failed to exploit their own advantages in relation to the Shannon rights to the full, the American carriers are of course now anxious to extend their services to Dublin in order to take advantage of the marketing effort which has already been mounted by Aer Lingus at very considerable expense.  It is contended that the granting of rights to the US carriers to fly to Dublin would result in a lesser total promotional effort for Ireland.  This is the contention of the Aer Lingus management.  We might sum it up by saying that they would be taking Aer Lingus-Irish business instead of creating their own business and, as Aer Lingus money shrank, there would be less money available to spend on both sales and publicity and since the American airlines spend a smaller proportion of each dollar earned on promotional work than Aer Lingus-Irish do, and still less in promoting Ireland, the total promotional effort for this country would be less.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to dwell at length&mdash; I am not competent to do so&mdash;on whether or not the perverse competition generated would improve traffic. The Federal Aviation Agency policy paper prepared in 1963 said that two US flag carriers are justified only on routes that are thick and densely travelled.  This paper, by the present president of PanAm, has been thrown in the face of the American negotiators already.  That paper stated:</P>
    <P>Neither the interests of a sound transportation system nor of the countries involved are served when a route with little traffic is burdened by a number of carriers greater than is economically justifiable.  The demand for swift, safe passage, not forced flag flying, should determine the services offered.</P>
    <P>The paper also pointed out that:</P>
    <P>The problem of the number of carriers on a particular route or in a market extends to markets having dense traffic, such as the North Atlantic, which is now served by 19 carriers.  It must be our overall policy not to accentuate this situation which, on its face, cannot be sound.</P>
    <P>In a quite recent interview in <i>Air <Col N="655" /> Travel</i> in May, 1971, the president of PanAm also stated that the position formulated at that time still made good sense.  He went on to say that:</P>
    <P>There are only a few markets in the world on which it would pay to have two US airlines operating. Every place else it's unnecessary duplication and a waste... The public must pay a higher fare as a result, because it's not getting the most efficient kind of transportation.</P>
    <P>He said, and this should be a lesson, to us:</P>
    <P>Just look at Hawaii, eight carriers, fares going up, and they'll go up even higher because the money to make eight carriers profitable has to be greater than the money to make three carriers profitable... The argument is that this would generate new traffic... Well, the traffic growth has declined with the proliferation of carriers.</P>
    <P>Therefore, more than two-thirds of Irish terminating transatlantic traffic carried on the scheduled services of all airlines use Shannon.  Less than onethird use Dublin.  That means that for two-thirds of the market the Irish Airline, with its limited rights, competes with three US airlines with virtually unlimited rights.  To permit this competition to extend to the remaining one-third of the market which now uses Dublin would unbalance the rights in favour of the US airlines to the point of absurdity.  Therefore, if there should be any concern that Aer Lingus-Irish is lacking competition and therefore likely to suffer the common symptoms of a monopoly organisation, it should be possible to allay it.  Apart from the fact that for a very large part of their North Atlantic business to and from Shannon, they are faced with a degree of American competition matched only by the huge markets of London, Paris, Rome and Frankfurt; they also have had in the past year to compete with other carriers.  Virtually all European carriers have rights between Shannon and the United States.</P>
    <P>It is worthwhile, therefore, in terms of the Aer Lingus-Irish essential commitment to the Ireland-US market, to <Col N="656" /> look at the lack of commitment of some of these other carriers.  Air France resumed services which had long been suspended between Shannon and New York in 1967.  They operated for two seasons and then packed it up in 1969. The reasons which caused them to give up was shortage of aircraft elsewhere and the fact that traffic into Ireland had too low a yield to be worth the effort.  In other words, they gave up the route when it was no longer in their financial interests to fly it.  They cannot be criticised for doing this.  It was a reasonably sensible business decision, but it shows that carriers can have a lack of commitment and it shows that if we concede rights to one or three of the American carriers there is nothing to stop them folding up their tents and moving on when it suits them rather than when it suits this country. KLM served Ireland regularly at one stage and then intermittently and actually surrendered its rights between Shannon and the United States in negotiations with the United States to get entry to Chicago from Amsterdam. We should not be under any illusions about what we are facing in these negotiations.</P>
    <P>The impact of a substantial change in the present Ireland-US rights situation can be summed up in the variables of the negotiations.  I shall put four questions to the Minister.  Would the US carrier, say PanAm, operate via Shannon?  Would TWA and Seaboard continue to have rights to and through Shannon?  Would Pan-American Airways secure onward rights from Dublin to the UK and mainland Europe? Would there be a frequency restriction on PAA flights into Dublin?  There are a number of factors automatically affected by those questions.  There is the revenue of Aer Lingus-Irish; there is Ireland's foreign earnings; there is the promotional activity for Ireland abroad; there is employment in Aer Lingus-Irish; the survival of Aer Lingus-Irish is possibly in jeopardy; of course, the development of the Shannon region is also in jeopardy. Those are some of the aspects involved.</P>
    <P>There is a comment by the general manager of Aer Ligus which sums up <Col N="657" /> the situation which might develop.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The stark fact is that if we were to be excluded from New York we would probably have to wind up our Atlantic operation, certainly in the form which we know it today. Over £19 million or more than half our total revenue comes from the Atlantic and the obvious implication is that the destruction of our North Atlantic operation would just about halve the size of the airline in terms of fleet, organisational structure and so on.  I would not like to attempt to define for you whether it would be 2,000 jobs or 3,000 jobs that would be lost or to go into any other breakdown.  Our exclusion from New York is just unthinkable. Nevertheless if the United States carries out the formal notice they have given to the Irish Government this is what will happen.</P>
    <P>As to our attitude on the attempts by the US carriers to get into Dublin, our position is unchanged because the facts are unchanged. The three giant carriers, Pan American, TWA and Seaboard World, have better rights than we have in two-thirds of the US/ Ireland market.  They want the same plane service for the remaining third (Dublin).  It is ironical that it is our success in out-selling and out-servicing PanAm, TWA and Seaboard World, which brings the sustained pressure from them to their Government to get our wings clipped.  And that very success lulls the Irish community into the comforting feeling that Aer Lingus will be able to take care of itself in all eventualities.  Our friends' confidence in us is gratifying, but we have to explain what it would mean for us to have to take on the three US airlines out of their home market against the vast resources of capital, fleet and manpower in unbalanced competition.  More than that, they would be able to fly from any city in the US to Shannon, with one or more of them into Dublin as well, but we could be restricted to flying between Shannon and three US cities.  New York, Boston and <Col N="658" /> Chicago. </P>
    <P>Some equality of competition! I think Mr. Dargan is talking very sound common sense.  The entry of one US airline into Dublin on even minimum terms would cause grave financial harm to Aer Lingus whereas the gain to the American airline would probably be negligible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope so but I would regard it as a tragedy if on the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power, one of the most serious national issues had been allowed to go with but a few comments from a few Deputies, with no formal statement of the information we received in the House being placed fully on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to delay the House much further but I do think that it should be pointed out that Pan-American is a company owned by private shareholders and that the objectives of PanAm management is to produce dividends for those shareholders and to increase the network of PanAm.  It is no harm that a country which, of its own ingenuity and expertise, built up a national airline of which it can be proud, should point out that, on the other hand, Aer Lingus is owned by the people of the country and has always seen its task as a national one.  If we were to handle the negotiations in Washington on the American style, solely from the profit motive, that is a situation that the Irish people could not ignore, a situation which could have grave consequences. I am not referring to the effect on the <Col N="659" /> Shannon region as such.  There has been a great deal of understandable reaction from the area and from Deputies in the area but, because I happen to be a Dublin Deputy, that is not to say that I do not fully appreciate the dire consequences this revision could have on the economy of the mid-west tourist region.  I honestly do not think there is any Government policy on regional development.  It happens to come about rather than to be the result of any conscious Government decision.  Any agreement which would increase the current imbalance between the eastern region and the western parts of the country in respect of living standards, population growth, industrial development, tourism development, and so on, would be quite tragic and most undesirable.  Therefore, we want to see an agreement reached between the Government and the American negotiators which would avoid that result.</P>
    <P>These are my views.  I had intended contributing to the discussion because I have had approaches from the trade unions involved in Aer Lingus who have been very concerned about this situation but my anxiety to speak was accentuated when the Minister made his attack on Deputy O'Donnell.  He was not here when I gave my views of what he said.  A fairly sharp relationship developed between the Minister and Deputy O'Donnell over the last two years in which, inevitably, the Opposition spokesman is at a disadvantage in that the Minister has his permanent staff.  The Minister is the political head of the Department and he will have to take the political responsibility for the outcome of the negotiations.  It may be felt that, perhaps, in a very narrow sense, we on this side of the House would take whatever advantage we could get from whatever disabilities may be suffered by the Minister in negotiations, but I can assure the Minister that that is not the intention and that is not the desire and it is not the political situation that we on this side of the House would like to see created in relation to the outcome of these discussions. To that extent we wish the Minister well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> As an Opposition, we have the right to ensure that the best possible settlement is reached.  If the boot were on the other foot, if Deputy O'Donnell were sitting in the seat now occupied by the Minister, I am quite sure there would be Opposition Deputies on this side of the House crucifying the Government for its attempts to negotiate a way out of this impasse.  I have never discovered in my reading of the records of this House a Fianna Fáil Opposition giving any leeway to a Government Minister, no matter how sensitive the situation was.  I think Deputy O'Donnell was acting in the best interests of the country and of this House and I would strongly urge that there should be no further reaction on either side now that the matter is, we hope, closed.</P>
    <P>There are two minor points I want to make.  I want to ask the Minister to consider, if at all possible, the placing of contracts by Irish Shipping with both Belfast and Verolme.  Other State-sponsored companies might also consider adopting a similar policy.  I accept the reasons given for placing shipping contracts with the Upper Clyde Shipyard and we should, I think, congratulate the board and management of Irish Shipping on their successful efforts in getting out of an impasse.  However, in future, our Irish yards should have priority.  It may surprise my colleague, Mr. Paddy Hill, that an Irish State-sponsored body should place contracts in Belfast, but I believe this is something that should be done and done openly.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be too critical of the prices charged in some of our hotels in recent years, but I can assure the Minister the British lower and middle income group visitors to our shores have not found the price of drink, for example, to take just one commodity, in our east coast hotels conducive to a return visit.  The Minister should encourage both Bord Fáilte and the new Prices Commission to keep a very sharp eye on the situation.  I have no doubt he will do so.  It is a shortsighted policy to price ourselves out of a good market.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had a particularly difficult year.  It was, indeed, a year in <Col N="661" /> which no Minister for Transport and Power could hope to gain any political kudos.  Many of the things affecting the situation were quite outside the scope of the Minister's responsibility.  The Minister was not responsible for the recession in the United States of America.  He was not responsible for the rising unemployment in Britain.  He was not responsible for the situation in Northern Ireland.  He was not responsible for the sudden decision by the American Government with regard to landing rights; indeed, in that particular context, he has both our sympathy and our support.  Any efforts he makes to ensure that our tourist industry and our transport and power sector develop as an integral part of our infrastructure will certainly be supported by Opposition Deputies.  We wish him well in these things, with just one reservation in respect of a couple of pages in his introductory statement to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>I should, first of all, like to congratulate the Minister on his very detailed introductory statement on his Estimate.  The Minister is in charge of a very complex Department.  I believe he is doing an excellent job.</P>
      <P>The main point I wish to deal with is the current Irish-US air situation. I condemn, I deplore and I depreciate the strong arm tactics of the American Government against our small and comparatively poor nation; worse still, these tactics are adopted against the poorest and most depressed sector of our nation, the western seaboard. These are tactics normally associated with undiluted imperialism, tactics completely alien to traditional American policies and attitudes towards developing nations, and especially towards Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not have to remind the USA of the strong ties between our countries.  We should not have to remind them of the valuable contribution made by the Irish to the building up of modern America.  I condemn the ruthlessness of the American airlines which have been fairly and squarely beaten by our airlines on the North Atlantic route.  Despite the fact that, on balance, the current air agreement <Col N="662" /> is very much in their favour, they now seek to further accentuate this imbalance with us.  If their request is not granted they are going to terminate Aer Lingus rights into Kennedy Airport, New York.  Do they not realise the disastrous consequences that this sanction will have, not only on our national airline, but on our economy? Do they not realise they are callously trying to impede our national policy in relation to the western seaboard especially the mid-western region?</P>
    <P>In relation to the mid-west we in Fianna Fáil have a very proud record. Over the past 25 years successive Fianna Fáil Governments have caused an investment of almost £40 million at Shannon Airport giving direct employment at the moment to 8,000 people.  Shannon is the power-house of the mid-west region and its influence can be felt along the entire west coast. As Dr. Eamonn Casey, Bishop of Kerry, stated yesterday, &ldquo;Shannon is a gleaming beacon giving inspiration and hope to all our people along the western seaboard&rdquo;.  The Shannon experiment has more than justified its great architect, Seán Lemass.  Shannon Airport was conceived in 1947 when most European countries were not thinking in terms of sophisticated regional planning.  It can, therefore, be said that Shannon was the pioneer of regional development not merely in this country but in Western Europe.</P>
    <P>I warn the Americans that if they upset our national policy by forcing centralisation this will arouse anti-American feeling.  I doubt very much if the US Government wants this at a time when she needs all the allies she can possibly muster in Europe.  Last Sunday I listened to a spokesman from the US Embassy on RTE.  He went to great lengths to justify the American case for landing rights into Dublin Airport.  His case was weak and it was based entirely on this mythical imbalance which he stated was in our favour.  I took notes while he was speaking and he stated as follows according to my notes:</P>
    <P>With the exception of Berne (Switzerland) Dublin is the only major European capital into which the US carriers do not have rights to land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> We would like to obtain landing rights in Dublin because we would like to provide this service to the American people.</P>
    <P>Secondly, as a matter of equity we feel that the present bilateral agreement between our two countries is severely out of balance.  We have granted access to the Irish airlines under the terms of the agreement to a market of over 40 million people; in return the agreement limits us to landing rights in the Shannon area which has a market of 270,000 people.  In this connection we are aware, of course, that the Irish Government has created landing rights in both Dublin and Shannon to the following countries: Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland, UK, Portugal and Czechoslovakia.  As a matter of equity we feel we should not be discriminated against.</P>
    <P>That surely is a gem.  It is only half the story as the countries mentioned have only limited rights.  In fact, they are not operating into the country.  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>For 13 years we have been talking constantly with the Irish Government and have been told &ldquo;No&rdquo; on each occasion.  Now the agreement itself provides that, if either side feels that there is an inequity and they are unable to adjust this inequity through consultation or talks, then either side is permitted by agreement to suspend rights granted to the other party thereby, unilaterally, bringing the agreement into balance.  We feel that, in taking this measure, we have not used the economic muscle; we have merely exercised our rights in the agreement. </P>
    <P>To suggest that the balance is in our favour is a blatant inaccuracy.  The previous speaker dealt at length with this aspect of the air agreement.  Even to the most casual observer it must be very plain that the balance is very much in favour of America.  I presume the case expounded by the Embassy spokesman last Sunday is the official American case.  It is a very, very weak <Col N="664" /> case.  He was asked by the interviewer if he realised that, if the sanctions were imposed, they would have a disastrous effect on the Irish economy and the national airline, and the Embassy spokesman replied: &ldquo;We have a great deal of faith in the Shannon area.  American people have invested money there estimated at £15 million, employing 3,000 people.  We are aware that major hotel chains in the US are even now negotiating for locations within two or three miles of Shannon and they, like we, have great faith that Shannon is going to grow and will always be a major tourist attraction and a place where US airlines will always want to fly to.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Major hotel chains in the US may be negotiating for locations within two or three miles of the airport but the current rumour rampant in my area is that two American citizens have options on two sites between Dublin Airport and the city centre on the assumption that American carriers will be allowed in.  I realise that, apart from American pressures, there are pressures from within as was evidenced by the infamous decision of the National Tourist Council.  Hotels in Dublin already are suffering from under-occupancy.  I sympathise with them.  Business is bad and times are hard but is it any wonder?  Last August my wife and I were charged £11 in a second grade city centre hotel for a bedroom and a continental breakfast. Perhaps if I had an American accent the figure would have been doubled.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to introduce a note of discord into my speech but, like the Minister, I was bitterly disappointed at the political opportunism of Deputy O'Donnell.  In making the outrageous attack not merely on the Minister but on the Government, accusing them of a massive sell-out, wittingly or unwittingly, he undermined the Government's stand on the eve of the vital Washington talks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett, Deputy Coughlan, Deputy O'Donnell and myself, and other public figures involved, agreed that we would leave it to the negotiators. This was agreed in the Minister's office when he kindly granted us two <Col N="665" /> hours of his valuable time.  It was agreed then that nothing would be said that would jeopardise the situation or undermine the stand taken by the Government. I do not understand what Deputy O'Donnell means when he talks about a sell-out.  We heard Deputy Desmond speak about his father's elation when he went on the inaugural flight to Montreal in 1960.  It was a pity Deputy Desmond was not in Shannon in 1948.</P>
    <P>I do not like looking backwards but I must do so in this instance.  I was a victim of that massive sell-out by the first Coalition Government in 1948.  I was trying to work my way through college, times were hard, and I thought I had got a good job at Shannon Airport.  Within a fortnight the clanger dropped; there was a change of Government and that put paid to my hopes and those of many of my colleagues.</P>
    <P>I can assure everyone that as a Fianna Fáil TD for the region and from my bitter experience in 1948, I am doubly committed not merely to the preservation of the <i>status quo</i> at Shannon Airport but to its continued expansion not only with regard to civil aviation but throughout the entire sector of industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the topicality of the matter, much of the debate has been devoted to the air rights issue which is now in contention between the Irish Government and the United States Government.  Although much of the discussion here is welcome so far as putting the facts on record is concerned, it is really a case of preaching to the converted.</P>
      <P>I would hope every right-thinking Irishman would be concerned that we preserve the advantages we have at the moment under the air agreement, both for the benefit of our national airline and for the benefit of the regional development of the Shannon area.  That is our attitude and it will continue to be our attitude, and that is the reason talks have been suspended in Washington and our negotiators are returning to Ireland.  I hope to see them tomorrow and to discuss in detail what happened in Washington.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> We are preserving a firm negotiating attitude.  I should like to emphasise the fact that the United States Government for their own motives&mdash;which I do not wish to discuss&mdash;have wielded a very big stick in the form of the threatened abolition of landing rights for our national airline in New York as from 18th August, 1972.  This is a fact of political life.  There is no point in discussing this matter as if we were all goldfish in a bowl or, as I told Deputy O'Donnell, as if we were in a debating society.  I could spend two hours talking about points in favour of our retaining the <i>status quo.</i>  These facts have been made known to the American administration right up to the President of the United States.  Full representations have been made by the Taoiseach to him.  All the facts of our case that have been adumbrated here by Deputies, which are well known to the Irish public, have been made known to all levels in the American administration.</P>
    <P>This has been done over a long number of years and we have held our position.  Now the situation has been radically changed by reason of the drastic action of the present administration in serving notice of withdrawal of landing rights as from 18th August next.  This is power politics; we are not in a debating society or at a seminar. In this situation it behoves everyone, both inside and outside this House, who is concerned about the interests of Ireland, not to make wild, irresponsible and mischievious allegations about the motives of the Government who have the responsibility at the present time. There could be another Government if the people decide otherwise, but now the Government have responsibility in this matter; they have the total support of every political party in the Dáil in this matter and they have the support of everyone concerned in the Shannon region and everyone concerned about our national airline.</P>
    <P>This is not the time, by comment or otherwise, to show a divisive front. This is a time at which I would expect responsibility rather than irresponsibility, an adult approach rather than a mischievous approach.  Everyone who talks in public about this matter should remember that the Irish Government <Col N="667" /> are negotiating on behalf of the Irish people with another Government. By reason of the tremendous dependence which our national airline and the whole development of tourism in Shannon and throughout the country have on landings in New York, the United States Government have considerable pressure which they thought fit to exert in this instance.  I do not want to go into details about our dependence on New York with regard to our tourist business from North America.  All I shall say is that we depend very much on New York.</P>
    <P>We resent and deplore the fact that the American Government have seen fit to take this action but these are the facts of political life in the present American administration and apparently this is the way they are doing business now.  It is one of the brutal facts of life with which we must deal. We shall deal with it as best we can in the best interests of the Irish people.  I would appeal to all Deputies and to everyone concerned with the welfare of the country to cease mischiefmaking, to cease making party political capital because this is far too important a national issue for us to engage in any petty bickering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is rather trite.  Deputy O'Donovan opened the debate and referred to the growth in ESB activities, and rightly so.  Our growth rate in electricity consumption is one of the highest in Europe, running at 10.4 per cent on the latest figure.  It has been over a 10 per cent growth in each year for the past four years.  On this pattern in five years time we will require twice the generating capacity which we have at the moment. This will necessitate substantial capital investment and it is all-important to maintain the ESB in a profit making position having regard to their need to raise capital investment for the provision of the generation that will be necessary in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention that because I want to put the various rates increases sought by the ESB into the context that were the <Col N="668" /> ESB not to ask for the price increases required by them to maintain a balanced position in regard to their accounts, they would not be in a position to obtain the finance necessary to provide the generation that will be so essential for the national economy in the years ahead.  Any price increases sought by the ESB must be put in that context.  If the ESB were not in a sound financial position they could not raise the necessary money and in this respect the ESB are acting for the community because they are the agent of the community to provide the power required for community development in the field of economic expansion.</P>
    <P>One heartening development in recent weeks was the discovery of natural gas off the coast of Cork near Kinsale.  On a rough average, the capital cost involved in using natural gas is 60 per cent that of nuclear energy as a source of power.  The oil fired power station in the vicinity of the find could be converted fairly easily and rapidly to natural gas.  There is no great problem there.  This again emphasises another point I propose to make in the context of transport.  It is very easy to stand up here as if one were at a seminar and talk glibly about a White Paper posing all the solutions to the problem in any fields of Government activity, but I have found in the Department for which I am responsible that the whole situation is very fluid and very open at present.  In the whole field of energy it is not a time for hard and fast decisions pending the emergence of the full picture.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we may have just made a substantial find of natural gas off the southern coast.  Explorations are going on for oil.  There may be further finds of natural gas.  These explorations off our coast which have been very promising on the natural gas side so far, may change our whole attitude to our sources of supply of energy in the years ahead.  Indeed, legislation concerning nuclear energy went through the House some months ago and the thinking at that time was &mdash;and the ESB have done considerable planning on this&mdash;that a nuclear energy station was imminent.  This decision might be&mdash;and I say might be&mdash; changed completely if we discover a <Col N="669" /> substantial amount of natural gas or oil resources adjacent to our coast.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of thinking that induced me to bring the ESB and the Dublin Gas Company together as a start on the basis of working out a joint approach in regard to the utilisation of energy and deciding in what way their activities could be made complementary in relation to the provision of gas and electricity as sources of power in the major cities.  Enormous sums of money can be saved provided our attitude is not too rigid and provided that we have not got a White Paper or a blueprint on energy but that instead we go about this matter in a sensible way and discuss in a pragmatic manner what can be done and what cannot be done in view of the resources we have.  If we do not adopt this approach we could walk ourselves into tremendous financial trouble by way of capital commitments and capital investment.  With very definite signs of natural gas resources and with a fairly optimistic situation in regard to possible oil resources, we should keep all our options open in relation to the whole field of the provision of energy.  That is what we are doing.  We are watching the situation very closely.  No commitments have been made other than the commitments that are in the best practical interests of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan also referred to the capital restructuring of Bord na Móna.  He wanted to know what is meant by the proposed legislation which we will be introducing early next year in connection with Bord na Móna.  I want to emphasise that what is involved is simply that Bord na Móna capital so far has consisted entirely of loan capital supplied mainly by the Exchequer and the consultants have proposed that part of the loan capital investment be written off and that another part be regarded as an equity investment by the State in Bord na Móna.  They have recommended this by reason of their profit returns in recent years as well as justifying that type of confidence on the part of the State in their activities.  The main aspect involved in the consultants proposals for capital restructuring is to make some of the loan investment an <Col N="670" /> equity investment and so relieve Bord na Móna of the job of making a fixed return on the loan capital.  Depending on their profit making position they will be able to make a return to the State on foot of the equity investment.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan raised the question of farmhouse and guesthouse accommodation both of which have been excellent developments in regard to tourism.  They have suitably diversified and expanded tourism outside the traditional field.  He criticised the purchase of the 747 jumbo jets.  This was a commercial decision taken by the national airline and I think in the context of the time rightly taken.  Every airline in the world made a similar decision at the same time.  Every airline in the world is having trouble with them.  We are not unique in this respect.  This is a very difficult time for airlines.  Indeed, some of the giants in the airlines field&mdash;and this probably is part of the reason for the pressure by the American airlines&mdash;such as Pan-American Airlines and TransWorld Airlines are in serious financial difficulties, far more serious financial difficulties than those of our national airline.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan also referred to Bord Fáilte and to excess commitments by Bord Fáilte.  This problem arose because in 1965-66 there was a shortage of accommodation and Bord Fáilte embarked on a drive to provide that accommodation.  Quite candidly, they over-reached themselves and the whole thing rushed ahead of the growth of tourism with the result that when I took up my present position I could see that, with the mounting commitments involved by way of grant arrangements made by Bord Fáilte, if that situation were to continue to escalate, accommodation would out-run potential tourist business. Therefore, we decided in mid1969 to suspend any further commitments and to clear up the existing commitments.  With the allocation of £1 million extra towards hotel accommodation granted by the Minister for Finance in recent weeks we hope to clear away a large part of the arrears and we hope that by next year the arrears will be cleared entirely.  We are <Col N="671" /> now stretching the resources of Bord Fáilte far more in the direction of promotion and marketing.  The objective now must be to fill the rooms that have been made available by reason of the crash programme undertaken in the 1960s.  It may be that in two or three years time we shall have to embark on another programme, but at the present time accommodation is not the problem; the problem is to fill the accommodation that is available.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised a question to which he has referred before, the accountability of State companies. This is a matter which is being considered at the moment by the Government. The Devlin report had many interesting comments to make on the question of making the State-sponsored organisations accountable as are the Departments of State and, as I say, the matter is being considered by the Government in the context of the Devlin report.  I fully agree with Deputy O'Donnell that there should be some measure of Parliamentary review of State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were to do this the Committee of Public Accounts would have to be enlarged by way of sub-committees, as the Deputy suggests.  This is a matter I can see developing.  I have spoken to a number of the heads of State-sponsored organisations and they would welcome this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>They have told me the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is good for everyone concerned: it is good for the heads of the State-sponsored organisations; <Col N="672" /> it is good for the members of the Dáil and for the public, that there should be this accountability and open approach.  There is nothing worse than for matters to appear not to be open. When a State-sponsored executive comes and makes its case, in 99 per cent of cases it will fully satisfy everybody concerned that matters have been properly dealt with, and there will be an openness and a general understanding of where they are going and what their plans are.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell also mentioned the co-ordination of State bodies.  I agree fully with him in this respect, and I have had meetings held in my Department between the various State bodies of which he spoke here on several occasions and of which I took note, SFADCO, Bord Fáilte and CIE and the Airline, being the main ones, and B &amp; I in some cases.  We have got down to a basis of close co-operation between these bodies; a balance must be struck between such bodies being too competitive, commercial and so on, and having no commercial urge or commercial propulsion at all.  A little competition between them is no harm.  I can say from my evidence arising out of investigations I have made that Deputy O'Donnell is probably right in this respect, there has been a tendency in recent years to go a bit far in this direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>What I object to is, say, in the case of Manchester, that five or six State bodies have offices there.  Why not have one office in Manchester, another in Liverpool, another in Sheffield, a much wider spreadout of the promotional manpower in tourism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what we intend to do.  Arising out of recent discussions we intend to ensure that they have joint promotional campaigns and possibly joint representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would put the B &amp; I in Liverpool, Aer Lingus in Manchester, CIE in Sheffield.  There would be a tremendous coverage if the resources were spread out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more of that in the various fields and it is Bord <Col N="673" /> Fáilte that are co-ordinating this.  As far as Bord Fáilte is concerned, the main organisations there are CIE, Aer Lingus and SFADCO.  These three particularly are being encouraged to work together for promotional purposes both in Britain and America.  We have already taken steps in North America to do what the Deputy has suggested.</P>
      <P>Duty-free facilities on the Irish sea were also mentioned by Deputy O'Donnell.  I am very keen on this idea. It would be most desirable to have co-operation from Britain.  At the moment I am awaiting a decision of the Revenue Commissioners on this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell is right again about ethnic holidays, and Bord Fáilte are now concentrating on this.  I agree fully with him at this time, particularly with the adverse publicity we are getting by reason of the Northern situation, that the people on whom we should really concentrate are our own people abroad.  Obviously, they are people who know the score in regard to the Northern situation and will not be influenced by any propaganda or bad publicity.  They are the people to encourage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On that, there is the campaign going with the various Irish groups and associations in Britain. Since Deputy O'Donnell spoke I left the House for a while to contact Bord Fáilte about this and they confirmed that advertising is not the best way to get at the Irish market.  Deputy O'Donnell was critical of various advertising budget figures, that advertisements did not appear to be sent to periodicals or newspapers which the Irish would read.  The Bord Fáilte view is that direct, man-to-man promotion among Irish clubs, associations and so on is more effective than advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>What worries me is that Bord Fáilte has not the manpower to do this.  I just cannot bring the figure to mind now but I know the existing Irish associations in Britain could not possibly do it.  I mentioned <i>The Irish Post,</i> but I have no interest <Col N="674" /> in it other than to the extent that it circulates among the emigrants.  How can you physically make contact with every Irish association?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Fáilte will have the help of the regional tourist organisations because they have the direct man-to-man or county to county contact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Fáilte has not the manpower.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Through the regional tourist organisations we have the manpower utilising local contacts in the various regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Fáilte have my personal support in this effort.  In fact, I will be going to Britain after Christmas and I shall assist in every way and use my contacts with the Irish associations.  What really worried me was that, when I saw the advertising schedule&mdash;maybe I had not time to analyse it sufficiently&mdash;it appeared to me that Bord Fáilte were not really recognising the ethnic market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The advertising schedule mentioned by Deputy O'Donnell is one line of attack on the tourist market, but there are extra funds and extra personnel now being assigned, and the strategy is being developed through the regional tourist organisations to get right into the heart of the Irish ethnic market in Britain through the various clubs, associations and county organisations there.  The whole emphasis in the Bord Fáilte marketing campaign at the present time is in this direction.  I can assure the Deputy of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much criticism about consultants' reports.  This is a fairly obvious form of criticism.  If I were on the Opposition benches I would probably criticise consultants. It is fair game to criticise them.  Let us be rational about this and not too parochial.  It is important to get the advice of consultants.  The trouble with State monopolies particularly&mdash;I am excepting those in the commercial field &mdash;like CIE, Bord Fáilte and the ESB, which are in a complete monopoly <Col N="675" /> position, is that it is very difficult to quantify their performance all the time and to make sure that they are up to the mark.  There is no profit and loss measuring rod as there is in the case of commercial bodies.</P>
    <P>There is nothing more one can do, as Minister in charge of utilities of this kind, except, from time to time, when one is concerned about their performance to bring in outside advisers and to get an outside point of view so as to check and confirm one's own views about a particular matter.  This is good for the organisations.  It is good for CIE to have expert people like McKinsey's looking over their shoulders from time to time.  It is good that Bord Fáilte and the ESB should be investigated in this way from time to time.  It is only in that context that I see the value of bringing in consultants. I do not believe that the consultants have all the answers to all the problems. The Government have yet to consider fully the McKinsey report and to make decisions on that report.  Their report will be assessed and analysed and appropriate decisions will be made.  Consultants have a valuable contribution to make in giving independent advice to check against one's own views as to the performance of public utilities.  In the case of any public utility in a monopoly position, where there is not a profit and loss measuring rod, I can see no way other than this of getting down to the guts of the problems concerned with their performance.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell mentioned a matter in which he is perfectly right and that concerns the 1971 guide.  I accept the Deputy's criticism of the 1971 Hotel Guide, particularly about the lateness of its arrival.  I want to emphasise that this year Bord Fáilte have it practically ready and hope to have it published immediately after Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <P>It will be out by the 1st January and will be a considerable improvement over last year's <Col N="676" /> guide as regards production.  I would like to talk to the Deputy afterwards and to hear his views on this point.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond raised a number of points concerning the air rights matter. I do not propose to go into that matter further.  He also mentioned the question of the placing of future shipyard contracts.  I want to say as regards the four ships commissioned by Irish Shipping with the Upper Clyde Shipyards that their construction is now proceeding. There were difficulties which have been cleared.  We got very good value in terms of a loan made available through the Export Credit Guarantee Department at a very favourable interest rate of 5½ per cent.  This is good value in so far as the Irish taxpayer is concerned.  Verolme shipyard got first option on these boats but they declined the offer because of their very heavy programme.  I have received a deputation from the management and workers of Verolme dockyard in recent weeks. They suggested that, in so far as the future is concerned, they would like to have a close liaison with the B &amp; I and Irish Shipping with regard to further shipbuilding contracts.  Consultation has been organised between the dockyard and the State shipping concern with a view to working out a planned construction programme over the next ten years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor, Deputy Barrett and Deputy Herbert were all rightly concerned about the Shannon rights issue. As I have stated already I have dealt fairly fully with that point.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the question of the White Paper on transport policy. I would be inclined to have such a White Paper soon and will look after this matter as soon as we have resolved certain points.  We must make a decision on foot of the McKinsey report first of all.  We must finalise the details of the rationalisation arrangements entered into by British Rail and the B &amp; I.  These details are being worked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This work is proceeding well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and there will be a sharing of terminals and ships between the two organisations.  The <Col N="677" /> shipping consortiums concerned with live cattle are working very well and they are proposing an alternative route into Birkenhead.  That is being discussed at the present time.  This amalgamation within this subsidiary company of British Rail and the B &amp; I for live cattle shipping will guarantee that the live cattle export situation will be secure in the future.  This is important, in so far as the farmer is concerned, in order to ensure that an alternative live cattle outlet can be maintained alongside the dead meat trade.</P>
      <P>To refer again to the question of having a White Paper with a full policy statement on transport, I am keen on this and await certain decisions before we can incorporate such a transportation policy in the form of a White Paper.  We must await decisions in regard to the final rationalisation decisions of British Rail and the B &amp; I in regard to cross-Channel shipping and the final Government decisions in regard to the rail and road traffic transport situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> CIE.  I hope those decisions will be finalised within the next few months and I propose to have a White Paper published showing the way we will proceed in regard to internal and external transport on sea and land.</P>
