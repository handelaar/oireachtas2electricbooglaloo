      <P>The Public Services Organisation Review Group have recommended that a Commissioner for Administrative Justice should be attached to a Department of the Public Service to deal with the installation and operation of an appellate system in the public service.  When the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, 1971, is enacted, examination of this recommendation will be among the matters to be dealt with by the proposed new Department of the Public Service provided for in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not believe this is urgent and that something should be done immediately? Deputies are elected to do legislative work but at the present time they are being used more or less as messenger boys.  A system has been built up the effect of which is that certain Departments, especially the Department of Social Welfare, will not reply to individuals, but when a TD approaches them they are on the ball immediately.  Does the Taoiseach believe in a system which means that people must beg for what are their rights?</P>

    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state in respect of the province of Connacht (a) the population in 1954, (b) the population at the latest date for which figures are available, (c) the number of people who have left the province since 1957, (d) the number of jobs created in industry since 1957 and (e) what action the Government intend to take to provide work for people there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Population figures are available only for years in which censuses of population were held.  The population of Connacht in 1956 was 446,221 and, in 1966, it was 401,950.  It is estimated that the net emigration between 1956 and 1966 was about 67,000, which was offset by a natural increase of population of about 23,000. The number of jobs created in industry since 1957 is estimated at 6,000.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy for rural development, as set out in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development, is based on more intensive farming in economic units and the development of non-farm sources of employment by industry, tourism, forestry and fishing.  To assist the Central Development Committee and the county development teams in co-ordinating this work, the special regional development fund is being administered in a flexible manner in providing assistance for worthwhile economic projects which cannot be assisted under existing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1710" /> Commitments to date include approximately £500,000 relating to the five Connacht counties.  Help has been provided for small farmer and handcraft co-operatives, local airports, miscellaneous tourist projects, small fishing harbours, <i>et cetera.</i> In addition, assistance has been given to firms which were in danger of closing down but which had a reasonable prospect of survival if given immediate aid.  The fund is used in circumstances of distress or opportunity and is proving to be an effective instrument in promoting and maintaining the economic well-being of the west.  With its aid, a significant amount of employment and income has been guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority's programme of promoting regional industrial development involved the setting-up this year of regional offices in Galway and Sligo to promote industrial development in the Galway/Mayo and Sligo/Leitrim regions, respectively, and in Athlone to cater for the midlands district which includes Roscommon.  The authority, as part of its interim advance factory programme, proposes to construct a minimum of nine factories in Connacht.  In this connection, there is a differential&mdash;60 per cent as against 45 per cent of fixed assets&mdash;in the industrial grants scheme of the IDA in favour of the designated areas, which include the province of Connacht.</P>
    <P>In addition to the general campaign for industrial development, the county development teams, working with local groups, have commenced a promotional campaign to attract projects suitable for location in the smaller western towns.  It has also been decided to provide in each western county a limited number of prefabricated buildings for small local industries in their early stages.  These buildings will enable either staff training or the operation itself to commence immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true, despite all the Taoiseach has told us, despite all the Government's White Papers, plans and promises, that the west is dying and that over 100,000 <Col N="1711" /> have left it in the past 25 years?  Could the Taoiseach now tell us what happened the famous plan promised by the Minister for Lands last January 12 months, which got such publicity in this House, on the radio <i>et cetera,</i> regarding the provision of employment and part time work for farmers on tourism, forestry and so forth?  What happened all those plans?  Will the Taoiseach not admit that there is less money provided in the Forestry Vote this year to give employment to people in the west?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The plans referred to by the Minister for Lands are reflected in all the activities here that I read out.  I think what is more important is that we have encouraged people of the west to have confidence in themselves. We have encouraged co-operation with the State agencies.  That co-operation is gladly being given at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the figures given to the House by the Taoiseach, is it not a fact that if this trend continues Connacht is facing a situation in which it will be just wiped off the map?  Down through the years we have been given this type of assurance and promise across the floor of the House and the decline in the population of Connacht still continues.  Does the Taoiseach not think it is absolutely necessary at this time to take special action to prevent this happening?</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the figures show that the growth of income and output in those areas is lower than in the rest of the country, that it is falling further behind, which is in marked contrast to what is being achieved in other nearby countries?  Does this not clearly demonstrate the failure of Government policy?</P>

      <P>I cannot dispute these figures since the Deputy did not give me notice.  Nevertheless, I want to say to the House again that what I have indicated here are in the main new activities and they are showing results and what is more&mdash;I would like to get this across to the Deputy and to Deputy O'Hara&mdash;there is no point in telling the people of the west they are finished.  That kind of philosophy will finish them; as long as we give them hope and confidence and give them reasonable co-operation that is a far better approach than telling them they are finished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The total number of people at work was 1,125,000 at mid-April, 1956 and 1,066,000 at mid-April, 1970, the latest date for which figures are available. The percentage reduction between 1956 and 1970 was 5.2, or an average annual reduction of 0.4 per cent.  A major factor in the reduction has been the fall of about 139,000 in the numbers engaged in agriculture which more than offset the increase of about 80,000 in the number of new jobs created in the other sectors of the economy.  The fall of 59,000 over the 14 years was made up of a fall of 41,000 in the year 1956-57 and a further fall averaging 7,900 a year up to 1961.  Since then there has been an increase averaging 1,500 a year.</P>
      <P>In regard to the final part of the Deputy's question, I would refer him to a statement I made on this issue in reply to a question from Deputies Harte and Timmins on the 9th February, 1971.</P>

      <P>Are not the bare facts now that there are 60,000 fewer people at work in Ireland than there were in 1957 when Fianna Fáil last took office, despite exhortations that were made to judge the Government on their records in regard to providing employment for our own people in our own country?  Further, is it not true that the Government's action at the present time seems to result in more being provided but fewer people at work?  If we had not the safety valve of emigration to England at the present time what would happen to those people?  Are there any proper plans to give work to our own people at home in Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

There are 10,000 people alone leaving the land of Ireland every year and 10,000 people alone lost their jobs in factories and in industry last year.  The Taoiseach knows that and he is keeping it back from the Irish people.  There are factories on short time at the present time due to your inflationary policies and you are doing nothing about it.  You are sitting idly by and you are doing nothing about it.  You are not man enough to take action within your own party for the good of the country.</P>

In the first instance I want to remind the Deputy of the last part of my answer: that there has been an average increase of 1,500 a year in jobs in this country since 1961.  Secondly, in so far as the reduction in employment recently is concerned, Deputy FitzGerald in a recent article in the <i>Irish Times</i> said there was a reduction of about, I think, 8,000 industrial jobs since 1967 which he said was only marginally attributable to free trade operations but which was mainly attributable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>An annual estimate of tourist traffic and revenue is compiled by the Central Statistics Office.  The 1970 estimate is not yet available.  A provisional estimate prepared by Bord Fáilte shows that the number of tourists who visited this country last year for a stay of more than one day was 1,950,000, a slight increase on the 1969 figure.  The board estimated that there was a decline of about 600,000 in the number of day trippers from Northern Ireland.  This decline, which commenced in 1969, is attributable to the disturbances in the North.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte carried out a special additional marketing campaign earlier this year at a cost of £395,000 in our main tourist markets with the object of expanding traffic during the 1971 season.  The total grant-in-aid to Bord Fáilte has been increased to £6,230,000 for the current year, that is, £680,000 more than the 1970-71 provision. These funds will be used by Bord Fáilte in the implementation of their various programmes and activities with the overall aim of attracting additional tourist traffic and increasing tourist revenue.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that the general outlook for tourist traffic prospects from North America in 1971 is good.  The latest market intelligence from carriers and tour operators suggests that bookings for the early summer are up between 10 per cent and 15 per cent and, with the development of a late booking trend, carriers are hopeful that it will be a good season.  This is similar to the views of the tourist interests with whom I had discussions in New York on the occasion of my recent visit there.</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to be under a misapprehension as to how superannution schemes, such as the CIE schemes, are managed.  The 1951 superannuation scheme for CIE employees is not managed by the company.  The scheme is administered by a committee of eight persons of whom four are appointed by CIE and four are elected by the members.  I have no reason to believe that the committee is not managing the fund in due and proper manner.</P>
      <P>The replies to Questions Nos. 21 and 22 are in the form of a tabular statement which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>

      <P>I am informed by <Col N="1729" /> the ESB that the problem of improving the electricity supply in the Newcastle area of County Dublin is receiving attention from the board.  Last December work involving the provision of a new transformer and improvement of the network was carried out.  Further improvement work is at present planned and should be largely carried out before next winter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the year ended 30th April, 1971, the number of notifications received in my Department of the dismissal of workers <Col N="1733" /> claiming redundancy payments was 5,309, of whom 523 were in agriculture, 2,890 in industry and 1,896 in the services sector.</P>
      <P>These figures include, of course, skilled as well as unskilled workers. The first concern of the National Manpower Service of my Department is to try to have redundant workers placed in alternative jobs for which they are suitable because of their existing skills or experience.  The National Manpower Service and AnCO advise the workers fully about the training available in the AnCO training centres.  The workers are also told about the training allowances available while on training courses as well as the assistance under the resettlement allowances scheme towards the cost of travelling to the training centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the experience that, in general, redundant workers are reluctant to avail of retraining facilities, which may involve absence from their home towns during the training period. As I announced in my speech on the Estimates for my Department on 6th <Col N="1734" /> May, I am providing in this financial year £50,000 to enable AnCO to provide retraining facilities on the spot where redundancies occur in areas heavily dependent on particular industries. I hope that this arrangement will encourage more redundant workers to undergo retraining.</P>

      <P>In accordance with longstanding policy, the Commissioners of Public Works do not permit the erection of upright headstones or raised kerbs in graveyards controlled by them in association with national monuments.  This is necessary to enable the grounds and grass to be kept neat and trim, to ensure greater safety to visitors and to avoid spoiling the appearance of the monuments.  Memorial slabs and kerbs of limestone laid flush with the ground are permitted and this is acceptable to most people. Where there are great numbers of visitors as at the Rock of Cashel, it is difficult to ensure that graves will not be walked upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the four or five minutes for which I spoke on Wednesday before reporting progress I dealt with some of the implications of the Minister's statement relating to control of public expenditure.  In every Budget debate in the last five or six years the question of the continuing increase in public expenditure has been spoken about.  I note that the Minister announced a new budgetary procedure in relation to various Government Departments and a new system of block allocations to the Departments and also a new technique of programme budgets.  While economies in the cost of public administration are desirable and welcome, when a decision is being taken to cut Government expenditure certain guidelines should be applied and certain priorities introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I reported progress I referred to the apparent impact of the decision by the Government to cut expenditure on the constituency I have the honour to represent.  To me this appears to have come about for no other reason than a financial reason.  I am referring to the Government decision to axe the Institute of Higher Education planned for Limerick.  I do not accept that the decision to postpone the opening of the <Col N="1775" /> institute was taken on educational grounds: I believe it was for purely financial reasons.  I want to express again my condemnation of the Government and particularly of the Minister for Finance in so far as he has been responsible for this decision.  The people of Limerick have been promised this institute would open in September and a letter is in the hands of the University Committee there from the Minister for Education dated last November in which he promised and spelled out clearly his intention that this college would open in September, 1971.  The people of Limerick have been &ldquo;conned&rdquo; by the Government. This is an outrageous decision; it is a grave injustice to the hundreds of students whose plans have now been thrown into jeopardy and who do not know what will happen.</P>
    <P>The Government will regret this decision.  There is going to be a furore and an outcry against it such as they have not bargained for and such as they have never met before.  The forces of public opinion are being marshalled and the Government will be forced to honour their written commitment to the people of the Limerick region.  If the decision to axe the Institute of Higher Education was made on financial grounds it is a disgraceful decision which shows the complete absence of social priorities in Government thinking in relation to financial expenditure. I believe public opinion will prevail and I appeal to the Minister for Finance, in whatever degree he was responsible for this decision being taken, to reconsider the matter and make it possible for classes, even of a limited nature, to commence in September.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>If this decision was taken for financial reasons it comes within the scope of the Budget debate. I maintain this outrageous decision was reached because the Government decided to expend the money in other ways rather than on this institute. <Col N="1776" /> However, I do not wish to go outside the scope of the debate by dealing with something which would more properly come into the scope of the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Education, but I have to place on record the fact that this was an outrageous decision, which is greatly resented and about which the Government will hear more.</P>
      <P>The 1971 Budget has come at the end of a period of what can rightly be regarded as the most disastrous year in the history of this State.  When this Budget is looked at in the light of the serious economic and social problems which confront us at the present time it is a highly irresponsible Budget and like all other Budgets introduced by Fianna Fáil in recent years it was dictated by political expediency rather than by national welfare.  There is nothing in this Budget, other than the Minister's brief references to the control of expenditure, to indicate new thinking, new approaches or new planning for the tackling and solving of the many serious economic and social problems we have at the present time. There is nothing in this Budget to indicate new thinking on national development. This Budget follows the general lines of every Fianna Fáil Budget in my experience as a Member of this House for the past ten years; it merely consists of stop-gap measures, a piece off here and a bit on there.</P>
      <P>This Budget does not hold out even the slightest hope that the present Government have either the ability or the capacity to pull this country out of the economic morass in which it finds itself.  This Budget proves beyond all doubt what most people have been suspecting for a long time, that for all practical purposes since last May we have had no Government at all.  When one takes into account the internal problems in the Fianna Fáil Party with which the Taoiseach and his Ministers have had to contend it is only natural that the attention and the minds of the Taoiseach and his Government, instead of being devoted fully to the duties of the offices to which they have been elected and for which they are being well paid, have been diverted from those duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1777" /> The country is paying dearly for the Taoiseach's decision to cling to office when he should have gone to the country long ago.  Unemployment is increasing to an alarming extent; inflation has wrought havoc with the competitiveness of our exports and with the cost of living and has done untold damage to the tourist industry.  Our agricultural industry is in a state of chaos and no one can say that our social services are generous or that our health services in any way approximate to the health services of other modern western European democracies.  Local authority rates continue to increase and we have reached the situation now where the rates demanded exceed the capacity of the average person to pay.  The tragic result of the lack of government to which I have referred is the continuous erosion of national morale.  This has led to a lowering of respect for our parliamentary institutions and there is abroad today a cynicism and a lack of confidence not merely in Government but in Parliament.</P>
    <P>What is there in this Budget which could validly be claimed to be a serious attempt by the Government to come to grips with the economic and social problems which confront us at the present time?  I do not see any indication of new policy; I do not see any new thinking in relation to the development of agriculture; and I do not see any new plans to enable the tourist industry to be put back on the road to progress again.  This Budget pinpoints the complete and dismal failure of the Government in almost every sphere of national life.  The Minister referred in his Budget Statement to State aid to agriculture.  I shall deal with agriculture first because it is our most important industry.  It is the industry which offers the greatest potential for future development.  The Minister has completely ignored the realities so far as the agricultural industry is concerned. He has made no comment on the unrest and dissatisfaction right through the industry over the past year.  He has made no reference to the fact that the farmers have had to engage in a campaign of civil disobedience and take to the streets to make their just grievances <Col N="1778" /> known in the hope that the Government might sit up and take notice.</P>
    <P>The concessions given to agriculture are, in my opinion, minimal.  They are the minimum that political expediency could force a Government to concede. The concessions to the dairying industry are absolutely nonsensical.  The concessions to agriculture as a whole are utterly ridiculous when one takes into account the fact that the income gap between the agricultural and the non-agricultural sectors continues to widen. Spokesmen for agricultural organisations have stated on many occasions that the income gap was as much as £8. The most recent statements from these people indicate that the gap is widening still further.  The differential is now £9.  This is an appalling situation.  It is probably one of the most serious, if not the most serious, situation confronting the Government at the moment.  It has serious economic and social implications and serious financial implications as well.</P>
    <P>On every Budget since I came into this House I have said that stop-gap measures, small financial concessions to particular sectors of the agricultural industry, such as we have in this Budget and such as we have had in every Budget over the past decade, are not the answer to the problems of the agricultural industry at the present time.  What the industry needs most, and what this Government have failed to give it, is long-term realistic, dynamic Government planning.  There is nothing in this Budget to indicate that there is any intention on the part of the Government to come to grips with the major social and economic problems confronting agriculture, nothing other than a penny here and a penny there.  It is fortunate for the industry that decimalisation has come because the minimum increase that can be given now is one new penny. Had decimalisation not come the increase would have been, I suppose, one old penny.</P>
    <P>The great tragedy in the lack of realistic Government planning in relation to agriculture is the fact that, on the eve of our entry to the European Economic Community, the one sector <Col N="1779" /> of our economy which has the potential to compete on equal terms with the agricultural industries of other European countries is in no position to compete.  Agriculture should have been developed over the past decade to its maximum potential.  What is the position? The morale of the farmers is at a very low ebb indeed.  There is an air of cynicism and disillusionment right through the farming community. The flight from the land averages 14,000 per annum.  Had the Government really wanted to preserve maximum numbers on the land and the maximum number of family holdings that could have been done.  It should have been done.  It was not done.  It could have been done by applying the principles of co-operation and community development so successfully applied in other countries.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest tragedies in agricultural policy was the decision taken by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1957 to scrap the parish plan.  The parish plan was the most outstanding social concept of modern times.  It utilised a formula and applied principles for the development of agriculture and co-operation in agriculture which had been tried and proven in many other countries.  I refer in particular to Denmark, to Nova Scotia and to the emerging nations of the world.  The parish plan was conceived by the late Canon Hayes, the founder of Muintir na Tire.  It was put into practical effect by Mr. James Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture. It was scrapped by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1957 and since then Irish agriculture has gone steadily downhill.  Concern is expressed about the effect of entry into the EEC on our farming community.  It is said that, if we become members, thousands of small farmers will be driven off the land.  Those who say that forget that over the past 12 or 14 years an average of 14,000 have been driven off the land every year by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>So far as agriculture is concerned this Budget is utterly ridiculous.  The stop-gap measures and the small concessions will not achieve the results the Minister apparently thinks they will.  I represent a constituency in which <Col N="1780" /> dairying is the predominant industry. The situation of that industry is utterly chaotic.  For a number of years the Government have been encouraging farmers to increase milk production. When, however, milk production had reached not even the targets for the Second Programme, but 500,000,000 gallons, it was panic stations immediately, and the Government decided to cut down drastically on milk production by the introduction of this abominable multi-tier system of payment for milk.  The result is that 1970 milk production is down 14 per cent. All the indications are that more and more farmers are going out of milk production.  Some months ago there was the ridiculous and indefensible situation, a situation of which any Government should be ashamed, that when there was an opportunity of supplying 30,000 tons of butter to Britain at top prices we were unable to supply it.</P>
    <P>I have stated before that this system of multi-tier payment for milk was a bad one and one which would have serious consequences for the dairying industry.  Already after a year-and-a-half of the operation of this system all the indications are that it is doing untold damage to the dairying industry. This multi-tier system of payment is without precedent in any country in western Europe.  If we enter the Common Market the multi-tier system will have to be abolished.  I was hoping &mdash;indeed all the dairy farmers of this country were hoping&mdash;that this Budget would see an end to this system of payment for milk production.  I can see merit in a two-tier system where a small producer would get special incentives, but the multi-tier system is the most complicated and ludicrous system of payment that could be devised by man, and I know of no other country in the world where this system of payment for milk for manufacturing purposes operates.</P>
    <P>The dairying industry has fantastic potential for development.  It is one sector of our economy which has proved itself to be efficient and to be capable of producing commodities which can compete successfully with those of any other country in the <Col N="1781" /> world.  For the proof of that one need only look at the quoted prices for butter and cheese and other dairy products on the British market.  Our products are commanding premium prices, even higher prices than those obtained by the Danes or the New Zealanders. Surely commonsense would dictate that every encouragement be given to a sector of our economy which has shown this potential for development and which comprises producers who have proved themselves to be as efficient as any in western Europe?  We have a processing industry manufacturing products of top quality.  This type of industry should receive all the financial and other inducements necessary and that it is possible for the Government to give.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that the Minister for Finance did not take into account the present situation in the dairying industry or the potential for development in that industry.  I regret that he failed to indicate any intention on the part of the Government to introduce and implement what everybody in the dairying industry, farmers, creamery committees, processing people and so forth, have been crying out for, namely, a long-term, realistic Government plan for the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this Budget to indicate that the Government have any new plans or have any serious intention of tackling the question of rural depopulation. The Minister mentioned western development and certain minor concessions which he is giving in the Budget and which, he argued in one or two cases, will assist in western development.  When one speaks of rural depopulation and western development one has to take into account the key factor of the viability of the family holdings of this country.  Fianna Fáil policy has been to drive people off the land, to make the holdings bigger. This is obvious all along the western seaboard, in the south west and many other parts of the country.  If this policy continues God alone knows what the average size of a farm in this country will be at the end of the present decade. Will this be a nation of ranchers?</P>
    <P>It is regrettable, as I have said already, that the basic concept behind <Col N="1782" /> the parish plan was scrapped.  It is tragic for rural Ireland that no serious attempt was made to apply the principles of co-operation to farm production. Lip service has been given to the idea of group farming.  There is not a thing in this Budget to encourage group farming.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and various other Fianna Fáil spokesmen have talked about it. The idea, which is, of course, an extension of the basic principles of the cooperative movement, of community development, is that a group of farmers, five or six or 12 as the case may be, by pooling their resources and working together as a unit, can secure the maximum output from their individual holdings.</P>
    <P>A considerable proportion of the money allocated in this Budget for agriculture is allocated to the agricultural advisory service.  There is not one officer&mdash;and I challenge contradiction on this&mdash;in the entire advisory service of this country who is competent to advise a group of farmers how to form themselves into a group to engage in group farming.  I know it, because I tried to do it.  There is also a considerable proportion of the money allocated to agriculture in this Budget being applied to the Agricultural Research Institute.  I know that research is as necessary in agriculture as it is in industry, but what amount of research have our Agricultural Institute done and how much of the money which they got from this Oireachtas each year is devoted to research into co-operation or into group farming?  Numerous experiments have been carried out and many of them have failed.  My experience has been that where group farming has failed it is not for the usual reason trotted out by the pseudoacademics and sociologists who say you cannot get Irish farmers to cooperate. It has failed because the Irish farmers who have tried to work together have not been able to get the necessary technical advice because there is nobody available to advise them properly.  This Government have played havoc with the agricultural industry. They have done absolutely nothing to lift agriculture out of the doldrums into which it has sunk.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed in the <Col N="1783" /> course of this debate and, in fact, the Minister has referred to the question of increasing prices, inflation and the consequences of inflation for Irish industry and for Irish exports.  We have all been alarmed and many of us have had the unfortunate experience in recent months of finding industries closing down in our respective constituencies and finding redundancies in other industries. We have reached a situation which is giving cause for serious concern. Our costs of production in manufacturing industry are now higher than they are in Britain and in other countries. This is a serious problem which the Government will have to tackle but which the present Government have played about with but have not had the courage to tackle in an effective manner.</P>
    <P>High prices and inflation have an impact on another sector of the economy in which I am particularly interested, being my party's spokesman on the tourist industry.  Many reasons have been trotted out by the Minister for Transport and Power and by various commentators for the present difficulties in the Irish tourist industry. There is no doubt that high prices are a major factor.  As far as the British tourist market is concerned, we have priced ourselves into an impossible position and if we continue as we are we will price ourselves entirely out of it.  Admittedly other factors have been affecting tourism&mdash;the trouble in the North, the political situation down here and the fact that the £50 spending allowance has been increased to £150 in Britain.  There has also been a certain economic recession in the United States which affected certain types of travel to this country.  However, the most important and serious factor affecting the Irish tourist industry at present is the absolute failure of the Government to take any worthwhile steps to counteract these various adverse factors.</P>
    <P>I hoped, in fact everybody in the tourist industry looked forward to the Minister for Finance making realistic financial provision in this Budget for Irish tourism.  What do we find?  We find that £195,000 which Bord Fáilte <Col N="1784" /> spent in the last financial year on promotion and advertising has to be paid from the current Budget.  We find that the additional subvention to Bord Fáilte has been cancelled out by the increasing cost in administration, <i>et cetera.</i> The result is, as we read in the newspapers over the past week, that regional tourism companies have been forced to close down information offices.  This is a disgraceful situation in the Irish tourist industry which is a major part of the national economy, which makes a major contribution to our balance of payments and to the invisible earnings to which the Minister for Finance referred.  This industry has been encountering serious difficulties, many of which were external and outside of our own control but most of which could have been counteracted and their impact minimised if the Government had taken stock of the situation and had provided adequate finance to enable the industry to gear itself and to take whatever corrective measures were necessary.</P>
    <P>From the experiences we have had in 1970 we have not learned one single lesson.  Instead of learning from the difficulties that arose in 1970 the Government have dilly-dallied along from day to day and now at the start of the 1971 season we are in a worse position than we were a year ago.  The Minister for Finance expressed a hope here regarding invisible earnings in relation to the balance of payments.  I claim to know as much about the tourist industry as any Member of this House, particularly in relation to Britain.  I have examined it on numerous occasions.  I have made at least five or six tours of Britain in the last 12 months at my own expense.  I want to tell the Minister that he can budget for a reduction of 20 per cent in the tourist traffic from Britain in 1971. When he comes in here next autumn with a Supplementary Budget he will be looking for ways and means to overcome this reduction in the earnings from tourism.  I am absolutely appalled and I cannot understand, nor can anybody involved in tourism, the attitude of the Government to this industry over the last 12 months.  Most people connected with tourism gave up the ghost when the details of the <Col N="1785" /> Estimates for the current year were made public.</P>
    <P>There are many ways in which, with a little imagination, it would be possible to devise more attractive incentive schemes for travel, particularly attractive packages making special concessions to tourists, which could be sold effectively in Britain.  All one has to do at present is to cross the channel and go into any travel agency in Britain and ask for a quotation for a fortnight's holiday in Ireland, in Spain, in Greece, in Rumania, in Bulgaria or anywhere else and he will see what is wrong with the Irish tourist industry. He will see why there is a reduction in tourist bookings and why I am prepared to forecast here a 20 per cent reduction in British tourist traffic this year.  Deputy Kavanagh, who represents a constituency which is vitally involved in tourism will, I am sure, bear me out.  I am sure the people of Bray have told him.  A person from his constituency who is vitally involved told me in the past few days.</P>
    <P>I believe that if a realistic subvention had been given to tourism this year&mdash;never was it more necessary to strain the purse strings&mdash;we could have mounted a crash campaign in the past few months involving advertising and promotional publicity, particularly in Britain.  We could have devised attractively priced package holidays to compete with some of the countries I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Although the situation is bad in relation to agriculture, although it is bad in the manufacturing industry, in no part of the economy have the present Government fallen down so badly as in relation to the tourist industry.  At least I expected an increase in the subvention.  Let me qualify what I am saying by pointing out that it would be totally unrealistic of me if I were to say that money is solely the answer. The Minister for Transport and Power publicly committed himself to the restructuring of Bord Fáilte last July.  If the position had been properly re-examined, if the board had been shaken up and if the marketing division in particular had been re-vitalised, the minimum additional subvention that would have been necessary for the current <Col N="1786" /> financial year would have been £2 million.  This extra £2 million should have been made available almost exclusively for the marketing section. That section was to have been given £369,000 last year but the Government were not able to pay one shilling of it. A sum of £200,000 was taken from the development section&mdash;the fund was raided&mdash;and the additional £195,000 is coming out of the current year's Estimate.</P>
    <P>It is diabolical.  We are fast becoming the laughing stock of the tourist industry and the traffic trade in Britain.  Why have we come to the stage where the Government are talking about purchasing an interest in Cooks Travel?  What about all the British travel agents who were brought over here during the past two years and dined and wined?  What happened when they went back?  Why have they not tried to sell Ireland?  Why have we to talk about purchasing an interest in Cooks Travel or about the establishment of a national travel agency?  The idea of a national travel agency appeals to me as having certain merits but it is ludicrous to talk about establishing it now because no national travel agency or sales organisation effectively will sell a product which is wrongly priced and which might not be of the right quality.  If we have the right product, attractively packaged and realistically priced, there would be no reason to appoint a travel agent to sell it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has done practically nothing in this Budget to rescue the tourist industry from its present difficult position.  He will suffer for that because when he comes to see the return from tourism for 1971 he will find himself with a serious balance of payments problem.</P>
    <P>The social welfare provisions of the Budget follow the same pattern as in Budgets during the past nine or ten years.  The Minister has been spouting a theory here about social policy, social justice and so on, but nobody can claim in this year of 1971 that the pensions, the allowances, the social welfare benefits, even with the increases provided in this Budget, are anything like what they should be in a country which pays lip service to the idea of <Col N="1787" /> social justice.  The Government pay mere lip service to the problems of the under-privileged sections of our people.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the recent Private Members' motion sponsored by Deputy R. Barry, our spokesman on Social Welfare, and myself, has had some effect in relation to the plight of widows and that some small concessions have been granted to them.  I am pleased also with other minor concessions.  It is a little more than the usual lip service to the veterans, the survivors of the fight for freedom, that their widows are now getting some small concessions.  Even if it is paltry, it is over-due recognition of the fact that many of those veterans died at an early age as a result of the hardships they endured and the undermining of their health during their struggles for Irish freedom.  Because of the early age at which they died, many of them left widows and young families and many of those families have been living in very poor financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>The way in which the families of the men who went out to fight for freedom for us have been treated is an absolute disgrace.  Those veterans are getting fewer and fewer with every year that passes.  Many appeals have been made in the House in recent years, particularly since we had the 50th Anniversary of 1916, and the Government could now in an annual Budget of this size make one final generous gesture to those people by bringing their pensions and allowances up to a realistic figure that would enable them to live out their remaining years in some measure of decent comfort.</P>
    <P>This provision for the widows of those veterans is long overdue.  I am sure every Member of this House can quote examples of the appalling situation which has obtained in families where the father went out and risked everything to secure the freedom of this country.  I am a Member of this House who was not born in those days but I want to record here in our National Parliament our indebtedness to those people and the sense of shame we feel for the disgraceful way we have <Col N="1788" /> treated those who won freedom and independence for this country.</P>
    <P>I hope the allowance now being provided for the widows of the veterans of the struggle for independence will be increased further at the earliest opportunity.  I sincerely hope that the usual type of red tape which has been characteristic of the departmental examination of applicants for various types of allowances will be cut in this case and that there will be no long drawn out vetting of applicants. I see no reason why there should be. If the applicant's late husband was in receipt of an IRA pension she should automatically qualify.</P>
    <P>I believe the major defect in our whole social welfare set up is our failure to formulate and implement a national pensions policy.  There is no doubt that there are many categories of pensioners in this country who are existing on pensions which are so small that they are living on the verge of starvation.  Most Deputies who have had experience of this, particularly those in large urban areas such as the one I represent in Limerick, can find numerous examples of pensioners trying to eke out an existence on a few pounds a week.  We have the unfortunate situation that not only has the State failed to bring pensions up to an existence level but some of the semi-State companies should hang their heads in shame in regard to the miserable pensions they give to their workers.</P>
    <P>When a man retires from CIE at 65 years of age he receives a pension from that body but when he reaches 70 years of age he qualifies for the old age pension and his CIE pension is cut. Some of the CIE pensioners receive only 25s or 26s a week.  I hope the day is not far distant when the present Government or some other Government will introduce a proper pensions policy which will ensure whether the person is retiring from employment in a State company, from the Civil Service or from private industry that he will receive a pension which will enable him to spend the last years of his life in reasonable comfort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i>
        <Col N="1789" /> The Budget debate gives Deputies an opportunity to review the economy of the country over the past 12 months, look at our situation as we find it today and try to forecast what the coming 12 months has in store for us.  When the Minister for Finance was framing this Budget he had to look back over a very difficult year, a year in which the economy was affected in various ways.  He had to ensure that any additional taxation imposed would not have an adverse effect during the coming year.</P>
      <P>During the past year we have had massive inflation in our economy.  Our costings rose considerably and it was against this background that the Minister had to ensure that increases in taxation which he had to put on would not accelerate inflation further.  He had also to make provision for the weaker section of our community, the particular group of the social welfare recipients whom inflation hits hardest.  It is the duty of any Minister for Finance to ensure that this section are protected against massive inflation and high prices.  The Minister has done a good job in introducing the limited amount of taxation which he has been forced to put on.</P>
      <P>During the coming year if any additional inflation takes place or any increase in prices takes place it cannot be attributed to this Budget to any great extent.  The increase in taxation was limited and therefore should not add to any increase in the cost of living.  The past year, especially in-the economic field, has been very difficult.  Some of this occurred through our own fault and some of it was outside our control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past two years we have had successive strikes and these are having a detrimental effect on our economy.  We had the cement strike which no doubt had an adverse affect on the price of houses.  This strike lost a certain amount of revenue to the economy which normally would accrue to the Exchequer.  When a strike continues over a long period, such as this one did, it usually hurts the weaker section of the community but it damages the economy in general.  Last year we had the bank strike which undoubtedly caused financial disturbance in the business community and <Col N="1790" /> indeed to the private individual as well. Let us hope that such a strike will never happen again because it can undermine our whole financial resources and put many business people, especially those who took people's word and cashed cheques, in a very serious financial situation.</P>
    <P>The rate of growth during the past 12 months has been exceptionally low. We are not satisfied with it and no Government would be.  Just as in any business, you must have growth each year especially with the decline of money values.  We are not satisfied with the present growth in particular when we look back to a few years ago when we had a growth rate of 4 or 5 per cent.  The Government are determined to attain this target again.  We must get our minds down to it and ensure that each one only takes from the economy what he is entitled to.  For the past few years we seem to have been going in a vicious circle.  To a great extent we lack a team spirit in business and in regard to the economy generally. We must instil a better team spirit in society and we must try to improve labour-management relations. In this regard we seem to have failed considerably and we must see how we can improve these relations.  Only yesterday unfortunate people in Dublin had to walk to work again.  It is unfortunate that we should have to have these strikes.  Where the fault lies I do not know but management and the trade unions will have to come to grips with this problem.</P>
    <P>Looking ahead we can see that this problem will be a major obstacle, if we join the Common Market, in regard to competing amongst a Community of many millions.  There will be ample opportunities for us within the Common Market if we avail of them but we are not equipping ourselves properly for the Common Market.  We should be aiming at harmonising our management-labour relations so that we will be able to avail of the advantages within the Common Market.  The Common Market is not a benevolent institution which one can enter with the belief that &ldquo;if I go in the others will help me&rdquo;.  It is a Community which expects each country to <Col N="1791" /> accept its obligations and enhance the Community generally for the betterment of member countries.  This is the type of society at which we should be aiming to ensure that we will get the maximum advantage when we enter.</P>
    <P>We have at present a surplus labour pool which is an attraction and we should be trying to train this labour surplus at present.  As time goes on there will be less room for unskilled workers.  In agriculture as well as in industry there will be, more and more, a demand for skilled workers.  If industrialists come here, and it will be the duty of the Government to ensure that they do, it will be no use saying that we have a labour pool in the west or in the east if that labour pool is not of a skilled or semi-skilled nature.  I was glad to see that the Minister has made £200,000 available to AnCO, which is a small step but one in the right direction. It is something on which we should concentrate our attention so that we can equip our people to tackle jobs which will arise when we enter the Common Market.  There is no doubt that there will be an inflow of capital from America and Europe and European companies will be setting up subsidiaries here.  It is on these people that we will have to focus our attention and cater for and facilitate them.  In that way we will be tackling our unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Over a number of years now the unemployment problem has been exaggerated to quite a degree.  Unfortunately there is a continuing decline in the numbers engaged in agriculture but on the industrial front we are expanding and employing more every year.  However, with the decline in the numbers in agriculture it is difficult to keep ahead in the matter of unemployment. We can see, therefore, how important it is to direct attention to the industrial field and it must be the Government's aim to create new industries and thereby absorb those who are leaving agriculture.  We have a greater number of people employed in agriculture than any other country in Europe as far as percentages go, and the tendency here is that with more automation and a form of grouping <Col N="1792" /> together, more and more people will leave the land and we must therefore diversify our industries to ensure an even spread of the population all over the country.  There is no point in concentrating manpower in Dublin or in the east.  At present Dublin is being practically strangled and an additional strain is being put on housing.  We will have to ensure that factories are fairly evenly spread and that, as I said, some form of training will be made available for the unemployed.  In my opinion this would raise their standards and improve their morale and when the opportunity arises they can be absorbed in a local factory.  When a new business or a new factory opens the owners are not prepared to wait for new staff to be trained and it is important that qualified or semi-trained personnel be made available.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned already, prices rose by some 7 per cent in the past year and we can appreciate what this has meant to the weaker sections, those who are unemployed, those receiving social welfare benefits and widows and orphans, but the Minister has ensured that they will be recouped.  In regard to strikes, to which I have referred, I am glad that we have agreed in principle to a national wage agreement. It is important that everybody should try to uphold this agreement.  It would be a tragedy if this year again we experienced a free-for-all of the type which caused untold damage to our economy previously.</P>
    <P>The responsible trade unions and the Federated Union of Employers will, no doubt, do everything they can to abide by this agreement.  I am sure that no particular union will try to break it.  The consequences of such action could be disastrous.  We could find ourselves in a position where there was no control of either wages or prices.  This, in turn, could militate against our exports.  Our costings have risen faster than the costings in any other country in Europe.  They are 5 per cent higher than the costings in England.  Our costs must remain competitive. Our manufactured goods must be more keenly priced than the goods of Britain or the EEC countries.  We have lost our competitiveness in recent years.  Difficulties have arisen in regard <Col N="1793" /> to our balance of payments and our competitiveness on the export market. The many foreign goods displayed here show how we have lost our price competitiveness. Foreign goods are seen in the windows of the Dublin stores with prices comparable to those manufactured at home.  We must ensure that our Irish products are more attractive than foreign goods.  We must make people take pride in Irish products.  It is right that we should purchase Irish manufactured goods, but no one will do so unless the price is competitive, the design right and the finish of a high standard.  People purchasing today look for the best product at the right price.  It is difficult to persuade them to buy Irish goods if they are not of a high standard.  The design must be right and the finish and presentation of the product must be attractive.</P>
    <P>Many big retail combines have established branches throughout the country.  Many of these firms are English-based.  There is much foreign competition in the distribution trade.  I personally cannot see how foreign capital can benefit the retail sector of the business, but these large combines have channelled their resources and, as they have many branches in England and also manufacture their own lines of branded goods, they could operate to the disadvantage of our manufacturers here.  They might promote the goods manufactured in their own bases to the disadvantage of Irish-manufactured goods.  Our goods must get comparable prominence to that given to the goods manufactured abroad.  If the quality of the goods is right they will sell well.  When we enter the EEC we will enter a large Community and those who are efficient and project the right image will benefit substantially.</P>

      <P>The Minister in his speech referred to the death duty concessions.  A widow with no children can have an estate of £15,300 before being liable for duty, while a widow with six children is allowed £33,000.  If a widow with six children is left an estate of £33,000 one should visualise her position. With property prices as they are at present one cannot purchase much for £33,000 and in my opinion the Revenue Commissioners coming in at that level are unjust.  Let us look at the position of the unfortunate woman. Usually one finds that it was the husband who was running the business. He knew exactly how to run it and was able to get the maximum profit from it. The widow must employ a manager and her profits will be reduced.  Her net income from the property of £33,000 will be 50 per cent of what it was before her husband's death because she must pay her manager and other factors will militate against her also.  If one were to value that business two years later one would find that it was not then worth £33,000.  The Minister should look at this section again.  More concessions should be made on this level.  Such a person is worse off than a widow with no children and £15,300 who may be in a position to take up a job.  A serious look should be taken at that group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Deputy O'Donnell speaking about tourism.  We all realise that tourism is one of our biggest industries.  We should pay considerable attention to it and we should try to see how it can be improved.  Undoubtedly last year was difficult.  Many factors militated against us.  There were the problems in the North of Ireland.  Our costs are increasing and, perhaps, we are losing our competitiveness. We must try to reverse the trend we have seen over the past 12 months.  We must try to do a better job of selling Ireland abroad.  Our food, our scenery and our amenities are equal to those of Continental countries. We may lack some amenities but we <Col N="1795" /> make up for that in other ways.</P>
    <P>We now have sufficient accommodation and Bord Fáilte should direct their attention to filling that accommodation. They should institute a good selling campaign.  There is no good in giving grants to an hotelier if half the beds are empty.  The grants are given to bring business to the country as well as to the hoteliers.  The promotional campaign should be intensified especially in England as the biggest proportion of our tourists come from there. Something is being done to try to improve the service in the hotels.  Here again we find untrained manpower. Many hotels find it difficult to get qualified staff although in the locality there are many people who would be willing to take on hotel work if they had the training.  Quite often Grade B hotels find it difficult to get top-class staff.  It is quite obvious that Grade A hotels can recruit highly qualified staff.  Because of the prices they charge they can afford to pay for top skills. The other hotels find it difficult to get waiters and waitresses who can give proper presentation.  We must try to make staff available for those hotels.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell was very pessimistic when he forecast that there will be a 20 per cent reduction in our tourist trade this year.  I sincerely hope he is wrong.  I hope he will be proved wrong this time 12 months.  We have encountered difficulties but they can be overcome if we can ensure that we are as competitive as other countries and have the same attractions.  We are very proud that we can give a reasonable standard of living to employees in the catering trade.  In Spain and Portugal labour is very cheap.  Waiters and waitresses work long hours for a deplorable rate of pay, in my opinion. This is to the advantage of these countries over us.  When those countries are unionised and when their employees have proper hours and proper wages, we will not be at the same disadvantage as we are today.  They have a supply of cheap labour.  Any Deputy who visited those countries will agree with me.</P>
    <P>I hope the day will come when they <Col N="1796" /> will have to meet the same commitments as we have to meet.  Employees in that part of the world should enjoy the same standards as we offer in this country.  Until that day comes they will have an advantage over us.  There is also the fact that the price of their wines, and various things like that, is competitive.  We must remember that taxation is not high in those countries because there is not a distribution of wealth.  Because there are no social welfare services taxation is not high on wines and cigarettes.  This again is to our disadvantage but, as time goes on, these things will be levelled out and, when they are, it will be to our advantage.</P>
    <P>Another section affected by rising prices, by rising costs of production and by inflation are public service pensioners and persons on fixed incomes. After each round of wage increases, normally followed by price increases, their standard of living is reduced.  I am glad the Minister took that into consideration and tried to cushion them against inflation which has eroded their standard of living.  I was also glad that provision was made for the widow in full-time employment. She will now get an income tax allowance if she employs someone to look after her children.  I am not sure how this will work in the case of a widow in part-time employment.  Will she get a tax allowance?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell spoke about the terrible conditions in the farming community. Coming from an urban district I think the farmers have done exceptionally well under the current Budget.  Out of £9.25 million, agriculture gets £4.35 million.  This is a very generous contribution to the agricultural community.  Naturally the Government would like to give more. However, they must take into consideration the limitations of the resources. While I have much sympathy for the small farmers who are finding it difficult to make ends meet, I am afraid that my sympathy does not extend to those with larger holdings.  I hope that the biggest proportion of the £4.35 million will be directed towards the smallholders.  I often wonder whether this is the case but sometimes I doubt that it is.  Although living in <Col N="1797" /> Dublin, I have a fair knowledge of the conditions of some of our farmers and from the knowledge I have I could not agree with Deputy O'Donnell when he says that agriculture is in a dreadful state.  It is my hope, however, that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will devise ways and means of ensuring that the right people benefit from this money. The Minister for Finance has taken steps also in relation to the Capital Budget which, of course, has been running very high during the past three years.  It is important that we have a good Capital Budget and it is equally important to ensure that such moneys are spent properly because they are moneys that are invested in the State, moneys invested for future generations. There has been criticism in the past regarding our national debt.  I wonder if, 20 years ago, we could have afforded to service a national debt of today's magnitude when we were building hospitals, houses and schools at one quarter of the cost at which we are building them today.</P>
    <P>I know that our national debt is high but we must remember, too, that we have assets such as houses, schools and hospitals and also industries like the ESB and Bord na Móna.  Agriculture has been improved immensely as a result of drainage and the use of fertilisers.  Therefore, while we have the national debt on the one side, we have many assets on the other.  When we consider our Capital Budget, we must consider it in the light that we are spending the money for our people, for our children and on the improvement of the country generally.  If, in their time, our children will have to carry some of the burden of financing this national debt, they will also have the benefits that have resulted from it.</P>
    <P>Would it not have been disastrous if we had taken a negative approach and had been afraid to risk a substantial Capital Budget?  Our Government are progressive and forward looking in ensuring that we invest for the future. There is no point in saying that something will be done in five years time because by then it will probably cost 25 per cent more than it would cost now but, at the same time, we must examine our resources and see how far <Col N="1798" /> we can go in planning new projects. The Government found it necessary to cut back this year but I am sure that as the situation improves everything possible will be done to strengthen further the economy in every way by putting more money back into it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope that during the coming year we can look forward to getting the economy moving again.  I agree that we have been falling back during the past 12 months; from now on it must be the duty of all of us to try and generate more interest in the economy, to encourage people to have more confidence in the country and not to be afraid to look towards other European countries, because we will be able to compete with them.  We must ensure that this confidence is generated. We must not allow ourselves to become despondent.  Rather must we look towards a European Community, confident that we can meet the challenge of the Community.  If the employers and trade unions together consider the economy in a serious manner, both sides can, in the long term, derive benefits from it and we will be able to move ahead without any fears when we join the Common Market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget does nothing whatsoever to solve the problems of our country.  It has failed dismally to face up to the realities of our situation and to take measures to grapple effectively with our problems. It is an insult to the intelligence of the Irish people.  It is the usual hotch-potch of gimmicky, of palliatives and of sops; but it does nothing to get to the root of the problems confronting our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is scant comfort in this Budget for the workers, the homeless, the aged, the sick or the widow.  As has been rightly said, it is a Budget that is merely marking time.  It is indicative of a Government that has ceased to operate as a Government, a Government that has given up all hope of governing.  This has been demonstrated by the sentiments of the last speaker, Deputy Fitzpatrick of Fianna Fáil, when he said that we will get going again and he intimates that the solution to our problems lies in getting into Europe.  That is what Fianna Fáil are hoping for.  Having so mismanaged the <Col N="1799" /> economy during the past 30 or 40 years, they now want to join with their European partners in the hope that there will be some kind of boost to this decaying economy of ours.  I feel sure that the Irish people will see through this Government.  Deputy Fitzpatrick rightly asks us to look at the situation today.  It is a situation of sad disillusionment at the development of this sorry trend in an Irish Government. There is a positive lowering of standards in high places.  Cynicism is widespread. There is lack of credibility and confidence in the Fianna Fáil Government which has destroyed the will of the people and their belief in Government and the institutions of the State. We now have the image of a party berefit of principles and clearly without a policy.  All their economic plans came to naught and we arrive in 1971 after their long term in office with production stagnant and unemployment rising steeply.  The figures are so high that they have become a great embarrassment to Fianna Fáil.  That was the reason for the despicable trick of seeking to manipulate these figures by removing 27,000 unfortunate people from the dole.</P>
    <P>The actual figure issued by the Central Statistics Office is 71,000 unemployed. The real figure is nearer 100,000, if you add those who were so callously denied the dole and removed from the unemployment register&mdash;this was the important thing; it was not the money; it was the device to alter the unemployment figures, to falsify the position in regard to the unemployed&mdash; and if one considers those who opted for early retirement at 65 and who would normally be on the unemployment register up to age 70, and the overall difficulty in getting unemployment assistance.  I believe that on the instructions of the Minister for Social Welfare or his Parliamentary Secretary, who is in the House, everything possible is being done to intimidate people and drive them away from the employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is as bad now as it was in the early '30s.  The cost of living is spiralling steadily upwards.  The change to decimal currency gave an advantage <Col N="1800" /> to the profiteers and it is foolish to suggest that there are no abuses.  We have rigid wage control but no control of prices.  Prices of essential foodstuffs especially butter and meat are becoming more prohibitive.  More and more Irish families are obliged to substitute margarine for butter.  Meat is a luxury which many can afford only on Sundays.  If the Government want us to maintain the reputation we did enjoy, I believe, of being one of the best-fed peoples in the world, I advise them to bring back the free beef scheme because meat prices have now gone beyond the reach of the ordinary working-class family.</P>
    <P>A small roast of beef costs approximately £1 and meat is disappearing from ordinary people's tables.  An increase of 10s in social welfare benefit is totally inadequate, therefore, to compensate these people for the steep increase in the cost of living when one has regard to the cost of food, clothing, fuel, rent and so on.  I believe there is widespread deprivation and poverty in the country.  Were it not for the excellent work being done by many voluntary charitable organisations the situation would be much more serious. By deliberate act of the Government in recent weeks the situation in respect of the poverty situation was accentuated by the withdrawal of the dole which, from any standpoint was a despicable act, probably the most despicable and callous act since Marie Antoinette said &ldquo;Let them eat cake&rdquo; when told the people had no bread. The Minister for Social Welfare did not even offer them the alternative of cake. He stripped them completely of their means of livelihood.  As far as he was concerned they could eat dirt.</P>
    <P>Much political play has been made of the reduction of one shilling a week in the old age pensions by a Cumann na nGaedheal Government but Deputy Brennan in Fianna Fáil out-blythed Ernest Blythe by the withdrawal of the dole.  No condemnation of the Government which I could make here today would outclass the vehement repudiation of that Government by their own ardent supporters, by a Fianna Fáil Deputy who in conscience <Col N="1801" /> crossed the floor on this fundamental humane issue and voted against them and by others who abstained.  The party has lost its principles, its image as a Republican party is in shreds and its image as a poorman's party is very tattered indeed.  It is no wonder that the supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party are so utterly demoralised now.  They have no confidence in the régime they supported for so long and many are actively engaged in the creation of another political party comprised of the dissidents of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>In respect of the withdrawal of the dole I want to ask what precisely the Government intend to do to compensate the many thousands of unfortunate people for the loss of this their only means of sustenance?  I understand some form of assistance is going to be provided for men over 50 years of age. I want to ask what form of assistance, how much and when?  I want to impress upon the Government that this is a matter of compelling urgency.  Many thousands of people are bereft of any means whatsoever by the Government's deliberate act.  It is no use talking about alternative work and it is no good saying home assistance is available, because to my knowledge many of those unfortunates have been denied home assistance and are clearly destitute.  This is a particularly disgraceful thing to happen in a so-called civilised society.  It is a negation of Christianity; it is a blot on our people, on our country and on our institutions.</P>
    <P>Will the alternative assistance be provided to those over 50 years of age? What about the many thousands under 50 years of age?  Are we going to sweep those people under the carpet, pretend they do not exist, purport that there is work available at a time when the unemployment figure is in reality nearer 100,000?  Are we going to direct local authorities to come to their aid by way of home assistance or are we simply going to stand idly by and let them starve?</P>
    <P>The proposal to provide work and the money suggested for this purpose is in the main going to the West of Ireland.  The amount of money being provided for the rest of the country is totally inadequate.  The Taoiseach and the Government should come into the <Col N="1802" /> House and tell us precisely what is going to be done for this large army of poverty-stricken which they have, of set purpose, created in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>I asked some questions here last week and I intimated to the Minister for Social Welfare that there was dire hardship and urgent need to come once again to the rescue of those people to whom I refer.  I alleged that home assistance was not being provided for them in many instances.  The Minister refused to accept the implication of that question.  It is fair to say it is very difficult to secure home assistance.  It is also true to say it is a very degrading system.  It humiliates, it drags down, it makes beggars of decent men and women.  It is a system which I abhor and I look forward to the day when it is abolished and a more humane system is devised whereby those in need are assisted with due regard to their dignity as human beings, without the odious means test, the humiliation of queueing up, of making a confession of one's domestic sorrows in public, and very largely, of being dealt with in a hostile and abusive manner, of being given the run around from the employment exchange back to the home assistance office, up and down, all over the town.  Local authorities ought not to be asked to bear the cost of the many thousands of pounds which should be provided to deal with the people who have been denied the dole.  Pending a clear pronouncement as to what is being done by way of alternative allowance, by way of the positive provision of work, the Government have a bounden obligation to instruct all county managers to provide generous home assistance for all those people who have been denied the dole.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that our economy is probably at its lowest ebb, our production is static, plans and programmes have come to naught and our Government are divided, bungling along from one crisis to another.  They are looking to Europe, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said but in the meantime they have torn down the barriers of protection from around Irish industry. They have exposed Irish manufacturers to free trade in every sense.  The <Col N="1803" /> result has been serious dislocation of industry and the loss of many thousands of jobs.  In recent months there have been more closures of Irish industries than openings and more and more we witness the stores in our cities and towns stocked up with foreign goods.</P>
    <P>Our appeals to the Government to stem the tidal wave of foreign competition have been of no avail.  Apparently we must go through this excruciating torment in preparation for joining Europe.  The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, no matter what gloss the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Transport and Power and others may try to put on it, has been a disaster for our country.  We entered into free trade with Britain before having the advantages of free trade with Europe.  We always enjoyed free trade with Britain and it was quite unnecessary to throw down the barriers of domestic protection and expose us to the icy blast of competition from Britain, this great industrial power.  If the Minister and the Government do not act quickly irreparable damage will be done and our important industries will go to the wall, never to recover.  The volume of imports of all sorts is truly appalling. It is difficult to understand why the Government stand idly by in face of the devastation all over the country. It is difficult to understand the complacency in that situation.  The Buy Irish campaign has been made a mockery of.</P>
    <P>Once more I appeal to the Government to face up to realities.  It may take some considerable time before we are admitted as members to the European Economic Community and it is a very foolish exercise, indeed, to commit us to a continuation of free trade with Britain in the interim.  I do not want to deal at length with the Common Market, but the posturing of our Minister for Foreign Affairs in Brussels is laughable, especially when he purports to convince the Community that Ireland is prepared to accept all that is contained in the Rome Treaty.  His nonsensical posturing <Col N="1804" /> is most humiliating.  He purports to convince the Community that this undeveloped economy of ours is capable of competing with the might of Europe.  The British negotiators challenge every issue, seeking, and rightly so, to get the best possible bargain for themselves.  If we have to go into Europe let us at least ensure that the best possible bargain is secured for us and that every section of our community&mdash;farmers, workers, fishermen, housewives&mdash;are all adequately protected.</P>
    <P>We are in an inflationary situation. The cost of living is exceptionally high. It is a sobering thought that, if we go into Europe, the cost of living will increase by upwards of 20 per cent. This is not my calculation.  This is the assessment of the economists, neutral people, who have carried out a detailed survey and analysis of what is likely to happen.  In a situation in which we have a pretty rigid wage and salary control what will be the result, in those circumstances, of our entry into the Common Market?  Does it not mean that our standard of living will be dragged down to a new low?  For many it will, perhaps, descend to a bare subsistence level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick <i>(Dublin Central)</i> was, I am sure, reflecting the mind of Fianna Fáil when he said that what we have to offer Europe was a pool of unemployed. Apparently, for Fianna Fáil, this should be the big attraction.  We ought to be thoroughly ashamed of ourselves at such a statement being made in an Irish Parliament: all we have to offer Europe is cheap labour in super-abundance and hope that this will attract industries here.  I would be ashamed to be a member of a party which had to admit that this was all we had to rely on and that we had nothing to offer except large numbers of unemployed, allegedly available as cheap labour for the capitalists of Europe.</P>
    <P>The three things of most concern to our people at the moment are the cost of living, the income tax code and the differential renting system.  The cost of living makes life miserable for a great many.  Our only hope is that, if the agreement with the Congress of Irish <Col N="1805" /> Trade Unions is honoured, a serious effort will be made to stabilise prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If that effort is not made we cannot expect the trade unions and their members to stand idly by while inroads are made into the standard of living of their people.  Instead of being granted some relief in income tax, their situation has been worsened in the Budget.  Since the introduction of PAYE there has been no attempt whatsoever to relate the personal allowances, the dependant relative allowances or any other allowances to the steep increase in the cost of living.  This is patently unjust.  Many of us support the idea of PAYE.  We believed it would make for the easy payment of tax and obviate the necessity for demands being made annually for large amounts of money especially on working-class people who could not afford these amounts.</P>
      <P>PAYE is no longer the painless extraction of money from the pockets of working-class people.  It is hurting and hurting grievously, and it is time some genuine reliefs were granted.  An unfair share of the hard-earned money of working-class people is being extracted from them systematically, highly efficiently, every week, caught up as they are in this mesh which does not include everyone; it contains in the main, working-class people; it does not include professional people, business people or farmers.  This is the inequity of the system, that workers are being asked to pay more than their fair share of income tax.  If all the others paid their rightful share, the burden would be much lighter on all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel it my duty to ask for a realistic assessment of the position.  I am asking that urgent steps be taken to increase the personal allowances of single and married people in conformity with the cost of living.  There has been very little change in these allowances since PAYE was introduced nearly ten years ago.  The allowance of £7 a week for a single person and about £12 for a married person is ridiculous.  Moreover, the Government should face up to the fact that this extortion that is going on under PAYE is a great disincentive. <Col N="1806" /> It militates against production, and goodness knows there is need for greater production: an increase of only 1¼ per cent this year.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and his Government genuinely desire a boost in morale, a boost in production, and seek to get the very best out of our people, there is no better way than giving them a better deal in respect of income tax.  It is too much to expect human beings to work rigorous, arduous incentive schemes, overtime and the like, with the aim of greater production and efficiency if, as they know at the end of the week, quite a large percentage of what they earn is taken away by the taxman.  I can appreciate the necessity for income tax and taxation generally, but I am saying that PAYE is in bad odour with workers.  Coming from them and being close to them, I know this to be true, and the Government who fail to recognise the stink do so at their peril.</P>
    <P>At a time when there is talk of women's liberation is it not despicable that the tax free allowance granted to married women is only about £2.50 per week?  Is that not a disincentive?  Is that not discrimination?  Is that not nonsensical in the extreme?</P>
    <P>There is widespread indignation concerning this iniquitous tax system. There is no allowance for a motor car required for travelling to and from work.  There is an allowance for a limousine for the executives but not for the working class.  That is an anomaly, I submit to the Minister, which should be remedied without delay.  As has been pointed out here so many times, this is an anti-working class bias.  Cars are essential to many people nowadays for getting to and from work.  They are not the luxury they were thought to be.  A forestry worker, a road worker, an industrial worker or a tradesman who is obliged to use a car&mdash;and very costly items they are in respect of purchase and maintenance, fuel and repairs&mdash;is denied any allowance under our income tax code.  This is wrong.</P>
    <P>There is no allowance for a housekeeper unless the person concerned has the care of children.  Many people, widowers and the like, are obliged to <Col N="1807" /> provide domestic help for themselves, but unless there are children in the family no allowance is granted.  I could list many anomalies; it might be slightly out of order and I do not intend to do so, except to indicate the deep-seated disquiet and indignation felt by many people and the effect this is having on our economy.  There is a lack of interest, a lack of initiative, a lack of effort or concern by the mass of our working people on account of the disregard which the Government have for fair allowances in respect of income tax.</P>
    <P>From any standpoint this Budget has not helped our economy.  It has not helped in the matter of health, housing, industry or social welfare.  There is no solace, no real hope or benefit in this Budget for any of our people in these categories.  The abolition or at least the easement of the means test in respect of the provision of medical cards, the stipulation that family income other than the income of the bread winner would be disregarded, the choice of doctor and the abolition of the dispensary service contained in the White Paper issued by the late, revered Deputy Donogh O'Malley, are as far away from implementation now as they were five years ago.  There is now a complete about turn and we hear talk of health services on an insured basis.</P>
    <P>In the sphere of housing we have the worst record in Europe, building less houses per 1,000 of the population than most other countries of Europe. We have widespread indignation and an uprise of tenants in respect of the system of differential or graded rents. The Minister for Local Government and I clashed recently on this issue. Perhaps I had better leave it until his Estimate comes in, very soon I understand, except to say that if the differential rents system is all that the Minister and the Government crack it up to be one wonders why half a million tenants are up in arms, one wonders why there are rent strikes, one wonders why there is such widespread protestation about the system.  The Minister sought to misrepresent my views in this House because I believed in the principle of differential rents but was <Col N="1808" /> opposed to the manner in which that principle was being administered by his Department.  The manner in which it is being administered has made it an odious system, a rack-renting system, a system which makes inroads into the privacy of family life in a very vicious form.  On another occasion I propose to deal at length with the pros and cons of that issue.</P>
    <P>I said earlier in respect of social welfare that the meagre 10s, on average, granted to recipients&mdash;the old aged, sick, unemployed, widowed&mdash; does nothing, in reality, to compensate them for the steep increase in the cost of living.  One would imagine that with the growing numbers of people who are entitled to contributory pensions, insured contributors, and having regard to the dwindling numbers who are claiming non-contributory pensions, the State and the Government could afford to be more generous with the non-contributory element but the old, rigid means test still applies.  Nothing is being done to ameliorate the lot of those who had no stamps and were obliged to seek non-contributory pensions. The test is odious, rigid, conservative in the extreme.  If one's income exceeds £4 a week approximately one simply does not get a widow's or old age pension.  The application of the means test has given rise to privation and to deep-seated resentment. When a husband gets an increase in his pension, perhaps, from a State body, his wife's old age pension is reduced and in many instances taken away altogether.  Even when recipients of British pensions receive an increase, there is an immediate reinvestigation of means and a corresponding reduction, in many instances greater than the amount received by way of increase from Britain.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the time is very close when we can abolish this means test altogether, when we shall devise a fairer, more equitable, more humane method of dealing with those people who feel that they need old age pensions as such.  It is wrong that we should discriminate against those people who through no fault of their own did not have the required number of stamps provided during their working life.  As a member of an old age <Col N="1809" /> pensions committee I san say, at first hand, what an effete and utterly sterile body that is, how utterly ineffective it is, how unjust the claims are that are brought before us, where the large farmer who purports to hand over his holding to his son or daughter is granted the full pension and another unfortunate person, because she has a pension from Britain or from some other source of approximately £4 a week, gets nothing at all.  I would hope, therefore, that soon we will get around to a fairer and more equitable system.</P>
    <P>They are the points I wanted to make on the Budget which has been proved to be so unimaginative, lacking in reality, utterly puny, doing nothing whatsoever to deal effectively with the shocking economic malaise which has set in in the country.  There is the plight of the unemployed, the loss of jobs through the closure of industries, the bad social welfare code.  I think it was the late Mr. Seán Lemass, the former Taoiseach, who on one occasion said that the acid test of an effective Government in so far as he personally was concerned was their success or failure in regard to the provision of jobs, employment for our people.  This is fundamental to our way of life, but on that principle Fianna Fáil have failed miserably and stand condemned not only by their opponents but by an ever growing number of those who were once their friends and supporters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very pedestrian type Budget.  It does not do anything radical to correct our economic difficulties and it does not do too much to make the Government unpopular.  I suppose one could say it is a Budget through which the Government have kept their options open in the event of their own party difficulties forcing them into the arena of a general election.  It is in that respect non-committal.  In this Budget the Minister for Finance reminds me of the little snippet about the timid spinster: &ldquo;She would not say `stop', she would not say `go', she would not say `yes', she would not say `no', she wanted to rise but was afraid she would fall, so she bided her time and she clung to the wall.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the poor Minister for <Col N="1810" /> Finance is doing in this Budget&mdash;clinging to the wall.  Deputy Treacy mentioned in his concluding words that one of the tests of Government lies in the field of employment.  It does, of course. It lies in the field of job opportunity, and in this age of adolescent unrest affecting every country in the world this question of job opportunity is an important matter socially.</P>
    <P>I had a Parliamentary question which was answered here today.  I inquired as to the number of people at work as between April, 1956 and April, 1971.  The period covers a time during which Fianna Fáil have been in office continuously.  It was not possible to get the figures to April, 1971, but the figures were given to April, 1970.  When the last inter-Party Government left office in 1956, the number of people at work here was 1,125,000. At the present time that figure has declined to 1,066,000.  In other words, there are 59,000 fewer jobs since Fianna Fáil came back to power in 1956.  This is in excess of the figure so often quoted in this House by Deputy L'Estrange, his favourite figure, of 56,000, so he will have to adjust his figure upwards.</P>
    <P>The flight from the land, which is ruling in other countries as well as here, has not been compensated for by the provision of job opportunities in other spheres.  Our figure for unemployment, as every Deputy has mentioned, is now inordinately high, higher than it has been for many years, ranging around 70,000.  If we are to judge a Government, and without using any other criteria than of providing opportunities for our people as they grow up, by this test, and without going further, this Government have failed. Without the safety valve of emigration we would have the nucleus of a revolution on our hands.  The safety valve is the emigrant ship to England and to America.</P>
    <P>It has always been so.  It is one of the great difficulties of our particular society, but it is sad to see the situation becoming worse rather than improving. It is pointless to talk about our small increase in population in the last census.  That only aggravates the position when we are unable to provide <Col N="1811" /> from our own resources gainful employment for our people as they come on the market.</P>
    <P>One of the other points of failure&mdash; and this failure can be particularly emphasised in the past year&mdash;is in the provision of housing.  I appreciate that the excuse that will be given is that last year there was a cement strike.  I accept there may be some force in that but there were many other years when we did not have cement strikes.  I will briefly mention what has happened here and how the pattern of Government activity in this respect has presented itself during the past number of years.</P>
    <P>Twenty years ago a White Paper was issued in which it was stated that at that time the country needed 100,000 new houses.  About that time there was a change of Government.  The first inter-Party Government came in and within three years, under the Minister for Local Government in those days, a revolutionary change had taken place &mdash;so much so that our total house production had increased seven-fold within the three-year period and local authority housing had increased tenfold. We are at present passing through a severe housing crisis.  A number of our people are very badly housed all over the country, particularly in Dublin.  Would that we could have some kind of crash housing programme such as we had then.  In the subsequent 11 years, entirely under Fianna Fáil, 98,000 houses were built.  In the first ten-year period 100,000 houses were built.  There was a fundamental difference in the two periods.  In the first period 50 per cent of the houses were local authority houses, in other words, houses available for letting and suitable to the less well off people in our society.  In the second 11-year period only 30 per cent of the houses were local authority houses and available for letting.  It is easier for the Exchequer to lay emphasis on private house building and give some aid in the form of loans and grants than to build local authority houses.  That is the answer to the fundamental difference between those two periods.  The Fianna Fáil Party, who pretend to <Col N="1812" /> always have a sensitive social conscience, have deliberately altered the pattern here away from local authority housing to the detriment of the people who have not the money to go to a bank or a building society.</P>
    <P>Many of our people are being forced by this policy to practically mortgage their future at an early age in order to get a roof over their heads.  I may say in this regard that we in Ireland occupy a position inferior to the position in Scotland, Northern Ireland and England, where the percentage of housing over the last decade available for letting purposes, and, therefore, available to the less well off people, is considerably higher than here.  In fact, Northern Ireland during the past decade with half our population have built the same number of houses and of the number they have built 60 per cent have been available for letting in the form of local authority houses while here the percentage has only been 30.  We all recognise that the allocation of houses in Northern Ireland may leave a lot to be desired. We are <i>ad idem</i> on that point.  Let me say, however, that they built the houses and they were sufficiently alert to the needs of the less well off sections because they provided 60 per cent of the houses built as local authority houses.</P>
    <P>The number of houses we have provided here over the years has been the lowest of the 22 countries of the OECD. For a number of years we occupied the fourth lowest position.  We were better than Spain, Portugal, Greece and Turkey but now we have gone down a little further.  The last figures available to me show that we are now the second lowest.  We are still higher than Turkey and they can live in tents.  This is not a record to be proud of.  I may add that we are devoting a lower percentage of our national wealth towards the provision of housing than any other country in Europe.  This is not accidental. It is deliberate.  In the first Programme for Economic Expansion it was specifically stated in respect of housing that it was regarded not as a commercial investment but a social welfare investment.  The first Programme for Economic Expansion is regarded <Col N="1813" /> as Fianna Fáil policy but they never wrote a policy document in their lives. Mr. Whitaker wrote that one but they have claimed it.  You will find them outside church gates talking about gross national product, even though they might not know what it was, whether it was animal, vegetable or mineral.  It was stated in that First Programme that housing had a lower priority than industrial or commercial investment.  In cross-examination directly they may like to back out of that statement but that is incorporated in the First Programme for Economic Expansion.  If we are to accept that as the gospel of the Fianna Fáil Party, then it would seem they have lived up to that doctrine very well because their record in this regard over the years has not been particularly good.  It is not a good achievement that we built a greater number of houses over a ten-year period in the past than we are building now, when we are supposed to be 50 per cent better off.</P>
    <P>We are now beginning to feel the full impact of our free trade agreement. I suppose the real crunch will come over the next couple of years when the full impact of free trade will be felt.  We have felt it to a considerable degree already.  We are now exporting two-thirds of our products to the United Kingdom while some time ago we exported three-fourths.  At the same time, the United Kingdom exports to us have increased and there has been a consequential worsening of our trade gap.  That is what a Fianna Fáil negotiating team got for us in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement. I would not wish to be too censorious about that because I think in many respects we will have to face up to this position some day in a world moving towards free trade and in the event of our joining the Common Market it may be that the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement brought us to our senses in that we have had a preliminary taste of open competition. It is possible that we cannot meet anything worse in the Common Market in the terms of industrial competition than we are already meeting from the United Kingdom with her powerful industrial machine on our doorstep.</P>
    <P>Our percentage increase on export <Col N="1814" /> prices over the last couple of years was higher than in the United Kingdom or in the EEC while our percentage volume increase in respect of exports was one of the lowest in the world.  At the same time, prices and incomes rose faster in Ireland than in the United Kingdom, Europe or many other parts of the world.  Our consumer prices kept parallel with the United Kingdom for the first half of the last decade from 1960 to 1965 but after that we began to go down hill.  We had an 8 per cent increase in prices during 1969 and something similar during 1970.</P>
    <P>Ours is a very fragile economy.  We are more dependent on exports than most countries.  We are much more dependent on exports than Great Britain and Great Britain is much more dependent on exports than the United States of America which is in a very strong position in that regard.  Our <i>per capita</i> income is one of the lowest in Europe &mdash;and I am not speaking now about countries in the Eastern bloc&mdash;and with the exception of four countries with low incomes, Portugal, Spain, Greece and Turkey, we have the lowest income.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the number of diminished job opportunities. The figure has fallen by 59,000 over the past 14 or 15 years.  Over half the people born between 1926 and 1966 have had to emigrate and that position is continuing.  Our trading position over the past three years has assumed dangerous proportions.  In 1967 we had a trade gap of £100 million; in 1968 it was £150 million; in 1969 it was over £200 million and 1970 it was also over £200 million, substantially over £200 million in both of those years. Last year it was a couple of million pounds more than it was the year before.  In the early stages we were able to balance our books in so far as we did not have a balance of payment deficit on current account but that situation changed and in 1969 we had a balance of payments deficit of £69 million.  A widening trade gap of that nature is something for which we cannot compensate.  Our invisible earnings, such as we get from investments <Col N="1815" /> abroad, tourism, emigrants' remittances and capital inflow, have been ranging over the last decade from about £100 million to about £160 million now.  In any year if your trade gap gets too much above that level you are going to be that corresponding amount in the red.</P>
    <P>At present we are vitally concerned with our exports.  If our ordinary merchandise exports are not stepped up, certainly if the ordinary trade gap is not narrowed, we will face in the coming year, and in the year after that, a balance of payments deficit.  It is estimated that for 1970 it will be £63 million or £64 million.  We may hope that the International Monetary Fund or some other outside agency will come, like Father Christmas, to our help but I do not think that is a long term solution or even a short term solution to our problems.</P>
    <P>Our average growth in the past three years has been about 4 per cent but an unpleasant feature is that it has not been a steady 4 per cent.  In 1968 it was 8 per cent and then in 1969 it fell to 4 per cent and in 1970 it was down to 1½ per cent.  Our inflationary position is one of the worst in Europe.  We are being gripped by a degree of inflation which we never witnessed before.  I do not do much shopping but from what little I do I can say that I have been appalled sometimes not so much at the increase in prices but at the extraordinary variation in prices between one shop and another, sometimes only 100 yards from each other, for specific, branded commodities.  Sometimes there is a difference of 100 per cent.  I could name the commodities and I could name the shops.  One wonders what is happening in regard to the co-called prices control commission, or whatever body we have to try to regulate prices. There seems to be very little effort made to try to control the prices of very many commodities.  As a reflection of our inflation, in 1969 our consumer price index went up by 7½ per cent, which was higher than in Britain or in Europe.  Home consumption shows ominous features also.  Retail sales showed a considerable increase in 1970, something which is easily and accurately calculated from turnover <Col N="1816" /> tax figures.  There was an expansion in consumer spending.  At the same time industrial output slowed down, particularly in the second half of 1970. There was a combination of increasing consumption and decreasing production at home.  The result of these two events occurring simultaneously was that an increasing amount of the home market fell into the hands of manufacturers outside this country.  That is reflected specifically in our trade figures.  There is an increasing gap between our imports and exports.  It has been calculated statistically that this rise in competing imports has now become progressive.  In 1967 the import figures increased by 6 per cent; in 1968 they increased by 24 per cent, while in 1969 the increase was 28 per cent.  I have not got the figures for 1970.  They may be even more formidable and depressing. An economy placed in such a position cannot continue to provide a proper standard of living or sufficient job opportunities for the people.</P>
    <P>We are in an open trade position and are now facing free trade.  There will be further emigration and increasing unemployment.  The unit wage cost has been mentioned.  The Review of 1970 and Outlook for 1971 has been referred to.  Statistics have been produced about the unit wage costs.  In 1967, our position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the United Kingdom, which is the country with which we do most trade, was good.  We improved our competitiveness in 1967. In 1968, our position was also good but, in 1969, it began to deteriorate and continued to do so into 1970.  Our unemployment figure is rising.  Last year it reached a level of 7 per cent. Between April, 1969, and April, 1970, employment in agriculture fell by 12,000.  That is becoming practically an average annual figure now.  That is approximately the number of persons who leave the land each year.  The increase in non-agricultural employment was not able to keep pace with that figure.  Non-agricultural employment increased by 5,000.  There was a net drop of 7,000 in the jobs available to our people.  Last year more than 8,000 people more than in 1969 lost their jobs.  We must concede that wages, salaries and incomes generally have increased above our level of production. <Col N="1817" /> Money values are falling. Since the last inter-Party Government went out of Office there has been a drop in money values.  I suppose it is safe to say that 12s at that time would be as good as £1 now.  The £1 in 1956 was worth about 13s a year ago.  In another year or two at our present rate of progress it will be worth 10s <i>vis-à-vis</i> the 1956 purchasing power.</P>
    <P>This vexed question of inflation and of incomes of all sorts outpacing productivity is an old one.  It has been in existence since the First World War. Up to the time of the First World War there was considerable stability in the value of money.  Since then there has been progressive inflation.  Many individuals, many concerns, and most Governments have an interest in inflation. It suits banks, it suits insurance companies. It suits Governments to borrow money when it has good purchasing power and give it back when it is less valuable, having used it in the meantime. At almost every street corner in our modern cities all over the world you can see large banks and large insurance companies.</P>
    <P>It is also the duty of a Government to try to preserve the purchasing power of money.  It is not good enough for us to say we can inflate away provided that we do not outpace Britain.  That is exactly what we have been doing. If the time arrives when, on her own initiative or because of economic stresses from the Continent when she joins the EEC, Britain decides to try and stabilise the value of money in some fashion, and control inflation, we will have to do likewise.  We have outpaced Britain with regard to inflation and it is because of that outpacing of Britain that our trade <i>vis-à-vis</i> Britain is working to our disadvantage. Mistakes were made in that respect back in 1963.  At that time the late Mr. Lemass came before this House and read a paper called &ldquo;Closing the Gap&rdquo;&mdash;and that paper contained all the economic jargon which we have seen in the speeches of every Minister for Finance who has appeared on the far side of the House since then. &ldquo;Closing the Gap&rdquo; proposed a reasonable economic approach but unfortunately the gap was not closed.  &ldquo;Opening <Col N="1818" /> the Gap&rdquo; would be a more likely description of what occurred subsequently.</P>
    <P>A Budget was introduced by Deputy Haughey as Minister for Finance which doubled the turnover tax.  Turnover tax which was introduced a few years ago, and was calculated to bring in £12 million a year, was doubled.  That has been criticised as being bad economics at the time.  I believe it was the worst possible economics.  If you have an inflationary position, a position in which you have too much money chasing too few goods and services, theoretically you can say to yourself: &ldquo;The way to stop this is to take the money from them&rdquo; and you tax them. That is a perfectly sensible, reasonable and logical argument, but the difficulty is that there is a hole in the bucket. The hole in the bucket is that you cannot control society afterwards.</P>
    <P>If you increase taxation and mop up the money which is available for spending, and the next day there is strike action, or trade union pressure, or pressure from traders or shopkeepers by putting up their prices, and from professional people by increasing their fees, and you are unable to control these pressures, you worsen the economy rather than improve it.  This is precisely what happened in the case of Deputy Haughey's Budget.  Increased taxation will only worsen the situation unless you have some kind of prior agreement or prior arrangement that the public will accept and you must convince them that they must not make undue demands the following morning which will completely negative what you have done and make your inflationary situation worse than it was before.  We have seen the fruits of the Budget which increased the turnover tax from 2½ per cent to 5 per cent.  On the other hand, it seems that the lesson has not been learned entirely.  I recognise the difficulties of a Government. They commit themselves to certain expenditure and they cannot easily turn off the tap.  That may be part of the explanation for what happened here.</P>
    <P>Last autumn the Minister came before us with his mini-Budget.  It was supposed to be a package deal.  There was supposed to be a prices and incomes <Col N="1819" /> policy in the offing and some curtailment on the second leg of the tote, the 10 per cent wage increase. The second leg was to be amputated but the leg was too strong for the Minister and was not amputated in fact.  In his speech on 28th October, 1970, the Minister produced all the old economic shibboleths.  Speaking about our competitiveness he said:</P>
    <P>In 1969 unit wage costs in Irish industry increased by over 10 per cent, a rate which was more than double that in British industry.  No firm figures for 1970 are available as yet but it is possible that these costs will show a further increase of 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>He went on:</P>
    <P>Increases in incomes in excess of the growth of national productivity cause prices to rise by roughly the amount of the excess.</P>
    <P>He said:</P>
    <P>... the fall in industrial production in the second quarter of 1970 is a matter of serious concern; excluding seasonal adjustments, this was the first fall since the second quarter of 1966.  Unemployment has increased. Consumer imports are mounting and the external deficit is at an unacceptably high level.  Tourism is in danger of losing its momentum.</P>
    <P>He also said:</P>
    <P>No responsible Government could have delayed action any longer or have refrained from the measure which we propose to adopt.</P>
    <P>What did he adopt?  He increased company taxation and corporation profits tax from 50 per cent to 58 per cent, thereby taking £6 million in a full year out of the pockets of the productive units, the manufacturers, and this at a time when, as shown by the figures I have given, we had a declining position <i>vis-à-vis</i> our competitors on the far side of the water.  He also increased wholesale tax from 15 per cent to 20 per cent on selected luxury items. I do not know what determines a luxury item.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance would look on these matters with a more frugal eye than I.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1820" /> At the same time, tax on motor vehicles was increased by 25 per cent but the extra revenue that will be derived from that 25 per cent is not earmarked for the purpose of helping local county councils in relation to the rates or to the roads.  It was earmarked to be dispensed at the judgment of the Minister for Finance.  This is his solution to the situation that he described in his Budget speech.  He was increasing taxation which, in itself, is inflationary in the circumstance in which we find ourselves and, at the same time, he was going to leave our manufacturing firms, which at that time were beginning to close down and which have been closing down since, less competitive because of this corporation profits tax.  To my mind, both expediences are questionable from an economic point of view.  It is merely a question of the Minister wanting money and of his saying: &ldquo;Where the devil shall I get it from without making myself too unpopular?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In this context let us not forget that when turnover tax was introduced&mdash; since then, we have had our greatest degree of industrial unrest&mdash;it was proposed to bring in £12 million per year but since then we have seen the quiet introduction of wholesale turnover tax which the people do not seem to notice very much.  There also was an increase in August last in the wholesale tax on luxury items from 15 to 20 per cent so that the £12 million which was expected originally to accrue from turnover and wholesale taxes is now netting £70 million a year.  That is a big jump.  It is a big injection into the inflationary atmosphere of our economic situation. Of course, the money was necessary because we had already committed ourselves and our Government expenditure had increased to the peak level of 20 per cent of our total expenditure.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about our external reserves.  Many people seem not to be particularly concerned in so far as our trade gap is concerned or about our imports getting out of hand.  They say we have external reserves of £300 million so why bother; but even that figure cannot be taken in isolation because we must relate external reserves to imports and to the trade gap if it is <Col N="1821" /> to be a meaningful term.  If, ten years ago, we had external reserves of £300 million, that figure would be viewed in a much different light today.  The ratio of our external reserves to our imports is declining.  That is rather ominous. The ratio of our external reserves to our imports was 60 per cent in 1966. It is now down to 40 per cent.  Furthermore, the ratio of our external reserves to our trade gap is declining.  It has decreased from a 2 to 1 figure to a figure of 1.3 to 1.</P>
    <P>The question of Government borrowing has been adverted to more than once in annual bank reports.  They have been mentioning it now for some time. During the past few years the Government have been borrowing a considerable amount of money and, particularly, borrowing from abroad.  I think most people will concede that foreign borrowing is the most precarious form of borrowing because when one borrows from abroad he becomes dependent on rates of exchange, on devaluations and on altering rates of interest.  Our foreign currency indebtedness rose, on foot of borrowing by the Government, by £100 million between March, 1966, and March, 1971.  We have also had considerable credit expansion here from our non-associated banks during the bank strike when everybody who had a cheque book could put a quantity of money into circulation by simply signing cheques.  I do not know if anybody has yet assessed the amount of extra money that was put into circulation during that strike&mdash;a matter that the Government did nothing to rectify.  To quote the now famous phrase, they stood idly by.</P>
    <P>I am not aware whether any credit guidelines have yet been given by our Central Bank to our commercial banks in relation to the position for the coming year.  Usually at about this time every year, they give some guideline. If they have already done so, I would be interested in knowing what the guidelines are, whether they mention a credit squeeze and, if so, the extent of such credit squeeze.</P>
    <P>Another ominous feature of our present economic position, whether or not it is very much appreciated, is the peculiar association now arising of low <Col N="1822" /> growth and balance of payments difficulties. If there is economic stagnation our experience has been not to have balance of payment difficulties or in layman's language if you are living on a low level, with a tightened belt, not on top of the world, you will not be &ldquo;in the red&rdquo; in the bank.  In the past when we had sluggish economic growth we had not balance of payment difficulties but now for the first time, so far as I know, with the projected growth rate of 1½ per cent for this year, we are passing through a period of substantial balance of payments deficits on current account&mdash;£69 million, £65 million and so on.  I should like the Minister, when replying, to deal particularly with that aspect of the situation.  Can he reconcile the fact that with economic stagnation we have at the same time balance of payment difficulties?  There may be a simple explanation but on the surface it appears decidedly suspicious.</P>
    <P>Essentially, we are an agricultural community.  I come from a farming constituency and it is disappointing to find that in the past year our agricultural production has been stagnant. There has been a slight increase in output and stock figures are good but I understand when that situation is balanced against input and agricultural expenses that, in effect, our agricultural production is stagnant.  There still exists the differential between farm income and incomes of people in non-agricultural pursuits.  That gap may be £6, £7 or £8&mdash;the economists will not agree on it but they agree the gap is there and the Budget has done nothing to bridge the gap or reduce it.  I do not pretend it can be reduced in a day. We have lived in an economy since the State was established in which the farming community have been bearing the price of political freedom.  They, and practically almost alone they have carried that burden since the State was founded while most other members of society have been securing incomes comparable to corresponding occupational incomes in Britain.  The farming community, in that they had to export their goods to a world food dump, have had to pay the economic difference between their income and the income of the Northern Ireland and <Col N="1823" /> British farmer.  Our farmers have paid that price for political freedom since the State was founded and they have never been thanked by anybody for it. It is as well to say it now.</P>
    <P>A small matter, which may be a little specialised for a Budget debate, is the failure of the Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries particularly to pursue the warble fly eradication scheme.  This pest is costing £1 million or £2 million a year.  It would pay for the dole that may be throwing the Government out of office, if they looked after it.  It is only a matter of organisation to ensure that all our cattle are dressed with the very simple dressing now available.  The loss in hides and in cattle weight, the loss to farmers in their stock represents a very substantial figure and it is sheer neglect on the Government's part not to look after cattle hides.  I suppose they were too busy looking after their own hides so that they could not look after the cows and sheep throughout the country.  I want to draw attention to our sheep population.  In June, 1969&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No.  I am just mentioning that our sheep population has fallen from four million in 1969 to 2.8 million in January 1971.  This has particular importance.  Mutton is not a product of the Continent and this is important in view of our entering the EEC.  This is a field of tremendous potential and economists and agriculturalists who have studied the matter agree that in this field we have not much competition, nor are we likely to have it, on the Continent.  If we join the EEC it is deplorable that we should have so neglected our sheep industry that our sheep population is falling.  The Minister for Finance should discuss this matter with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, if they are still on talking terms.  The Minister for Transport and Power, who is present, is happily in a neutral position and, as we said about the Budget, he is keeping his options open.

      <P>I conclude by putting on record the second paragraph in the 1971 Central Bank Quarterly Bulletin which reads:</P>
      <P>To look back on developments in 1970 is disagreeable&mdash;</P>
      <P>This is dealing purely with economic aspects of the position, nothing to do with the political adventures of the past year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>To look back on developments in 1970 is disagreeable.  It is obvious that the health of the economy would be gravely threatened by continuance of a deterioration which has left Ireland with one of the highest inflation rates in the Western world, with the growth of national production cut to less than half its potential by excessive cost increases and prolonged industrial disputes, with unemployment raised and the balance-of-payments deficit running into a third year at too high a level.</P>

      <P>In a Budget debate the temptation often is to survey the whole scene without getting down to the essentials in the Budget as they relate to the national economy both in the present and in the future.  Viewed in this context certain basic essentials needed to be tackled by the Government and were tackled in this Budget. Indeed, by way of pre-Budget Government policy the original Departmental estimates as submitted to the Government were substantially reduced by £76 million before presentation in the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first fundamental essential which had to be tackled was the inflation of last year.  It is agreed by all sides in the House and by all observers both <Col N="1825" /> inside and outside the country that last year we had an inflationary position&mdash; prices chasing incomes and incomes chasing prices.  The fundamental policy decision to deal with this matter was the introduction of the Prices and Incomes Bill.  The introduction of that Bill and the statements made in conjunction with it in this House had the very salutary and important effect of bringing employers and trade unions around the table to discussions with the Government on how best this particular problem, which was the main contributing problem to inflation, could be tackled.  The problem was to ensure reasonable stability in income demands for 1971 so that prices would be held down to a reasonable level and we would not have a prices/incomes spiral in 1971.</P>
    <P>In a glib way it has become a type of cheap political comment to say that the Government in regard to their handling of the prices and incomes problem reversed their attitude.  In fact, the very reverse is the case.  By bringing in the Prices and Incomes Bill and then securing voluntary agreement on the part of all sides concerned in industry, the services and employment generally, we had the process of development under Government guidance day in and day out during that period and that process of development resulted in a voluntary agreement.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in these <Col N="1826" /> benches in the unlikely event of their being an alternative Government.  In facing up to the responsibilities of government it was the right thing on the one hand to tackle the problem of deflation and on the other to secure agreement on wages and salaries by a voluntary method.  It is an example of good government and effective government that by reason of the introduction of legislation we eventually secured a far more desirable objective. Instead of imposing legislation which in this particular field could have uncertain and undesirable effects in regard to future employer/employee relations, people were propelled into sitting down at a table and under Government guidance and advice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;worked out voluntarily, without any statutory impositions, certain wage and salary increases for 1971 and the first six months of 1972.  I am not going to pretend that everything in the garden is rosy.  The whole field of industrial relations is the most difficult field of human relations not alone in Ireland but in the world. We have, however, for the first time in the history of this State&mdash;indeed for the first time in the history of industrial relations in these islands&mdash;secured agreement between employers and trade union interests which should ensure reasonable stability during the coming 18 months.</P>
      <P>This agreement represents the greatest hope of achieving stability that is required in the field of incomes in the coming year and on that basis we can climb ahead to the anticipated 3 per cent growth rate for this year, which will be double the growth rate of last year and provided we preserve stability on the incomes side we can climb ahead to the type of growth rate we had three years ago of 8 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to emphasise some figures to show the importance of preventing cost inflation, cost inflation directly related to labour costs, which can only harm exports and it is on exports we place our main hope for sustained economic growth.  Labour <Col N="1827" /> costs represent 60 per cent of the total value of goods produced and sold.  Our labour costs increased by 24 per cent in the period 1968-70 whereas they increased by 15 per cent in the same period in Britain.  That fact alone indicates the importance of tackling the problem which has now been tackled for the first time in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>The reason for tackling the problem immediately is that the overall context in regard to industrial production and industrial exports is very good and very heartening.  In the context of much of the criticism which has emanated from Labour Party speakers in regard to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement I want to quote some figures: the volume of industrial exports increased by 53 per cent in the period 1960-65; in the following period 1965-70, the first five years of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, the volume of industrial exports increased by over 80 per cent.  This rise of 80 per cent in industrial exports in hard currency represents an increase of £175 million in the value of industrial exports during the first five years of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  Deputy FitzGerald brought out this fact in an economic report in the <i>Irish Times.</i> In the period 1965-70, when we had an increase of £175 million in the value of industrial exports, we had an increase of only £93 million in the imports of competitive goods.  It is very significant that during that five year period our exports of industrial goods remained well ahead of our imports of goods competing here on the home market, well ahead to the extent of £175 million, which represents the value of industrial exports in the period 1965-70, and £93 million representing the value of imports of industrial goods competing on the home market.  I mention that to show that the overall situation is fundamentally right.  These industrial exports represent exports in many fields which are, at the moment, experiencing difficulty, fields in which troubles such as redundancies have occurred.  This expansion has taken place in such fields as textiles and light engineering goods, to quote just two <Col N="1828" /> examples of highly competitive industries which have over the past five years had increased competition under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and yet have contributed substantially to this overall expansion of industrial exports.</P>
    <P>This highlights the essential soundness of the industrial sector.  It also emphasises the importance of preserving it.  If that sector, which is highly competitive and which must continue to be even more competitive under Common Market conditions, is to provide the growth on which our future prosperity will depend, then cost competitiveness is all important.  Where cost competitiveness is concerned we are down on labour costs, which represent 60 per cent of the total value of goods produced and sold.  This emphasises the importance of having a rational growth in money incomes and a rational settlement through the medium of industrial relations of wage and salary increases.  I mention this because it is all-important and, in my view, it has been the single most important development in our economy in the past 12 months: (a) the introduction of the Prices and Incomes Bill and (b) through the introduction of it the achievement of a peaceful, voluntary agreement on wages operative throughout the country.</P>

There was an expansion in credit facilities. Market output has doubled in the ten years 1960-70.  Agricultural output generally was up by 25 per cent in the same period in actual terms and 66 per cent in value terms.  Cattle and beef output in value terms during the same period was up by 75 per cent; prices in the cattle and beef sector practically doubled in the period 1960-70. This is due to the policy of the Government over the past ten years, a policy designed to ensure that agriculture is in a reasonably healthy state to participate in the very positive benefits which will obtain within the Common Market.</P>

      <P>Yes, milk.  The Fine Gael Party are quite well aware of this, and if the Labour Party want to oppose it, that is their point of view. I might add that membership of the Common Market will relieve the Irish taxpayer of a sum in the region of £40 million at the moment contributed by him to sustain development in the agricultural sector.  That money will no longer be required because of the benefits which will accrue to the agricultural sector within the Common Market.</P>
      <P>Tackling the inflation problem, securing reasonable stability on the wages and salaries front through the national pay agreement, pruning Government administration expenditure, ensuring that agricultural output, both in real and value terms, is maintained and expanded, all of these Government policy decisions taken before the Budget and emphasised in the Budget as presented by the Minister for Finance, fit into the overall policy of securing entry into the EEC which will be negotiated this year and which will be achieved by 1st January, 1973.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make a bet at any time with the Deputy, but he is well aware that these are the facts of life and that Government policy, as I have examined it, represents a coherent mosaic designed to ensure the growth of industrial production and exports, a growing level of employment, that agriculture is maintained in a healthy state so that it can participate in Common Market benefits, and that we will not suffer any dislocation on entering the EEC.</P>
      <P>The explosion in industrial exports during the first five years since the signing of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement indicates how wise the Government were to make that agreement. It has enabled our industries to participate in free trade conditions, to gear themselves for an export market that was made available to them as a preliminary to entering into the wider Common Market for industrial exports.</P>
      <P>The Budget must be seen as part of a plan to double the growth rate in the present year, a plan that recognises that the economy is healthy.  One of the indicators I would take in this connection is that of our external reserves which, in March, 1970, stood at £303.7 million and in March, 1971 have increased to £333.8 million.  The figures I have mentioned in regard to external reserves, in regard to the growth of industrial exports, cattle numbers, milk output, show that the economy is fundamentally sound, that there is no need whatever for pessimism.</P>

We have a chance this year to emerge with stability on the incomes front, a stability that will be reflected in stability on the prices front.  The combination of these various <Col N="1834" /> policies will ensure a resumption of the advance in gross national product, in industrial growth, and therefore in employment figures.</P>

      <P>I must say, in fairness, that Deputy Dr. O'Donovan, in his professional capacity, has never been an obscure commentator on economics.  I believe economic and financial thought can be expressed in terms that make sense to people.  The one big danger last year was inflation, prices chasing incomes.  As I have said, this problem has been tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall objective is to ensure an expanding population based on a growing volume of employment.  Over the past four years we have, for the first time since the Famine, broken through the barrier of diminishing population.  In the 1966 Census the population stood at 2,884,000; in April, 1970, the figure was 2,944,000, an increase of 60,000 people in that four-year period, and an increase of 23,000 in population between April, 1969 and April, 1970.  We want to go into Europe as an expanding country, as a country with its population rising; as a country dealing with the inevitable surplus from the land by giving more jobs to people who have to leave the land; as a country whose agricultural structure is sufficiently well geared to make immediate use of the benefits of the Common Market agricultural policy; as a country which can make use of the additional markets in Europe for industrial exports by maintaining its costs here at home at a level which will enable us to compete effectively in the Common Market; as a country which will be able to participate in the essential decision-making which will benefit us positively in the future by primarily, in my view, evolving a regional policy within the EEC that will mean real benefit to Ireland and other <Col N="1835" /> European countries that require regional development through not being associated with a central axis based on the Ruhr and the Low Countries of Europe.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1837" /> Budget day in recent years is taking on the appearance of all the big events of the year in the sporting world.  It is heralded on television, radio and the Press with the fanfare of a Derby Day, an all-Ireland final or a cup final.</P>
    <P>For days before, experts weigh up the possibilities and put forward likely happenings, likely concessions and likely tax proposals.  On Budget day, time is given on television to present a blow-by-blow account of the Minister's statement and, of course, pictures of the Minister carrying his briefcase must appear on the early editions of the newspapers.</P>
    <P>Anybody expecting something original, something exciting, in this Budget must have been very disappointed. We are now talking about an event that took place on 28th April and as a news item it is rather stale.  We who come in at this stage of the debate must feel that what we are saying has all been said before but at least we try to say something a little different or original.  That is our job here at this stage.</P>
    <P>It is no secret that we on these benches are opposing this Budget. When the debate concludes, the Labour Party will be voting against the Budget. We will do this not because, viewing the Budget in isolation, there is anything very bad about it, there certainly is not a whole lot good about it, but because we believe you just cannot take the Budget itself and say you will make a decision on it.  We must remember what the Taoiseach said the day before the Budget&mdash;that the most important vote of the year is the Budget vote.  Perhaps he said this more to the members of his own party than to the Opposition.  The Minister for Finance described this as a tough Budget. I agree with him on that.  It is a tough Budget because taking into account the events of the last year, the fact that we had a Budget some months ago, we expected a little more particularly for those people who were and are suffering as a result of the policies of Fianna Fáil not only over the last year but over preceding years.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power tried to give the impression that the Budget had put us on the <Col N="1838" /> right road and that everything would be better as a result of it.  The Minister said that his party was tackling inflation as one of our major difficulties. He inferred that workers looking for wage increases and prices going up was the root cause of inflation.  The root cause of inflation is what made prices go up, what makes workers look for increases?</P>
    <P>Surely the 1970 Budget was the root cause of the rapid and rabid inflation which we had in the last year.  The increase in turnover tax opened the floodgates of price increases which went on rapidly in the succeeding months.  Then, last February, in order in some way to put a better look on things, we had the changeover to decimalisation.  This confused people for a short time.  They were confused as to what was happening.  The change in coinage confused ordinary people with regard to the rapid inflation that was taking place.  They were confused because they paid for things in new pence one of which is equivalent to 2.4 old pence.  The confusion will not last long because the £ remains the same and the £ today is not buying what it did 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>It was that Budget which started the spiral of inflation.  Workers want to be back in the position they were 12 months ago and it cannot be laid at their door that they look for wage increases in circumstances other than to compensate them for price increases and, as well, to make allowance for anticipated price increases in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power seemed to give the impression that it was because the Prices and Incomes Bill was introduced that the trade union delegates meeting in Liberty Hall had accepted the national pay agreement.  He said, in effect: &ldquo;If that Bill had not been brought in no agreement would have been reached.&rdquo; He said that the Bill had been held up to them and that, therefore, they accepted the agreement as the best of a bad lot.  I should like to point out to him that the members of trade unions are individually as responsible as any other section of the community&mdash;indeed more responsible.  In <Col N="1839" /> their own way, they are more responsible than the Government have been proved to be in the last year.</P>
    <P>Trade unionists accepted the damage that was done to wage agreements as a result of inflation.  They saw the difficulties that would arise after the twelfth round had run out.  Therefore, it is wrong to think that the introduction of the Prices and Incomes Bill would have deterred trade unionists from proceeding, if they felt it was necessary.  The blundering of the Minister for Finance in trying to get away from the last phase of the twelfth round indicated to trade unionists once again the lack of direction of the Government. The trade union movement were incensed by that and it was their reaction that brought some sense of responsibility to a Government who at one stage appeared to have lost all sense of responsibility.  The trade union movement made the Government sit up and take notice.  Had the Bill been proceeded with it would have caused the greatest outburst of indignation among workers that ever was seen.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that it is the same Government who introduced restrictive legislation against trade unionists during the ESB strike.  On that occasion they had to give way and one would have expected they would have learned their lesson.  However, they tried the same trick again and it certainly would not have worked had they attempted to go on with it.</P>
    <P>An attempt to blame the workers for the problems of the past year is still uppermost in the minds of the Government. Today, at Question Time, the Taoiseach referred to a statement in the <i>Irish Times</i> by Deputy FitzGerald and he used the figures in the <i>Irish Times</i> to prove that it was the workers who were the cause of inflation and not the Government.  As I have said, this cannot be acceptable when one looks at the doubling of the turnover tax and other recent decisions.  The long litany of the problems of the past year include the arms trial, the introduction of the Prices and Incomes Bill, the internment scare, the exposures before the Committee of Public Accounts, the cement strike, the bank <Col N="1840" /> lockout, the dole bungling, soaring prices.</P>
    <P>One would have expected that all these problems would have been tackled in some way by the Minister for Finance in this year's Budget.  On the contrary, there is not a phrase in the Minister's speech which would deal with any of them.  As is apparent from the figures, the Budget almost balanced itself because all that had to be done was to make some allowance for the people who had suffered through no fault of their own&mdash;the people who could not look for increases by strike action, those on social welfare benefits and on fixed incomes. Something had to be done for them and the only question facing the Minister was how to find £8 million or £9 million from somewhere.  We know how he solved that problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance dealt rather briefly with EEC membership, although it is one of the most momentous decisions ever to be taken by us.  We have had debates on it already but it still must be spoken of in any debate on finance.  Therefore, I think I should make a passing reference to it.  If we accept that the British are doing our negotiations for us, then the possibility of our joining the EEC is becoming increasingly greater, particularly in the past week.  The British appear to be completing their negotiations and to be solving the outstanding problems they have had which are in no way common to this country, such as those affecting New Zealand, and West Indies sugar.  They are the only things keeping Britain out of the EEC and they are being finalised at the moment.</P>
    <P>There is one problem we have which is common to Britain.  It is fisheries. The Minister speaking before me mentioned agriculture and I asked him to say something on fisheries.  I invited him to make a comment and he appeared not to hear me.  I thought I was speaking loudly enough but he ignored me.  Any arrangement to turn over our fisheries to the EEC so that we will get concessions in agriculture is to be deplored.  He told us about a 66 per cent increase in various prices of agricultureal produce but surely this is not borne out by the words of Mr. T.J. <Col N="1841" /> Maher in tonight's newspapers: &ldquo;Is Ireland too timid in its approach to the Common Market?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Maher believes that we are not getting the best deal because our negotiators are not creating enough fuss about regional policies and the problems of the small farmers.  If we are talking about agriculture and the improvements that will accrue from EEC membership, we should at least look at all the problems in agriculture as well as the problems in the fishing industry.  If there are to be gains on one side then undoubtedly there are losses.  We are dealing with people who are ruthless in their negotiations.  We are dealing with them very timidly, to judge from reports in the papers.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry is of great importance to this country.  It is an expanding industry and is one with great potential.  It is one that will be completely disrupted should we join the EEC under their present fishery policy. I hope the EEC debate will be resumed shortly and I hope, when speaking in this debate, to touch on fisheries and our agriculture policy.  The Minister said that we in this party are against going into the EEC but we are not against it because of the fact that we are the Labour Party.  We are against it because we cannot see the benefits to the Irish people.  We want to know where the benefits are.  It is not enough to say that agricultural prices will go up by 60 per cent and to ignore where the problems are.  We want to know where the gains and the losses are and we want to know what the results will be to Irish industry and to workers in Ireland.  We are sceptical about the effect of EEC membership on our Irish workers.  Deputy Dr. O'Donovan said that a case has been made for the EEC with Government money.  No money is being given to put up a case against it, but nevertheless we will endeavour to put that case with the meagre resources we have.</P>
    <P>The Minister, at column 693 of the Official Report of 28th April, dealt with programme budgeting.  I do not know a great deal about programme budgeting but the Minister suggested that various Departments are now <Col N="1842" /> budgeting over longer periods, for a four or five year period.  In the Department of Education and in the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands this has already been put into effect. If this is so then the idea of annual budgets will be of less importance.  If moneys are budgeted for that long in advance it should be reasonably easy to know what each Department intends to spend over a much longer period.</P>
    <P>I believe this budgetary programme in the Department of Education is already having some effect in certain sectors of that Department, particularly that of school transport.  CIE are at present covering the routes of the buses and rechecking the distances between schools and collecting points for children.  I was approached by a parent in my constituency who was told that her child could no longer travel on the school bus because the mileage had been checked.  As a matter of fact the original mileage was wrong and instead of being three miles from the collection point the child lives 2.9 miles from that point and therefore the child's ticket is being taken up at the end of the school year.  If this is how the Government intend to make their proposed saving of £70 million odd it is not too wholesome a prospect. Undoubtedly the cost of school transport is increasing rapidly because the number of children attending schools is increasing.  This must form a very large part of the Department's Estimate. Nevertheless it is difficult for people to understand why children within 180 yards of a pick-up point are not being carried while children living a short distance up the road are being carried, particularly when those children were transported before.</P>
    <P>We know of a further tightening up in the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands.  We know that forestry workers are being laid off.  We were told, in reply to a question by my colleague Deputy Tully recently, that the number being let go in the Forestry Division at the moment is increasing. I believe that nine people in my own county have gone since the beginning of this year.  This is not a large number when one considers that there are over 350 people working in forestry <Col N="1843" /> in County Wicklow but it is an indication of the tightening up in the Forestry Division under this new budgetary control.</P>
    <P>There was also in the Minister's Financial Statement a suggestion, under the heading of multi-annual budgeting, that until programme budgeting takes place in all Departments an interim measure of programme budgeting will be operational in the different Departments.  In the case of the Departments not covered by the programme budgeting the period covered for budgeting is two to three years.  I had an indication of what this means when I was in the Department of Transport and Power recently.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the Wicklow Harbour Commissioners I was asked to go on a deputation to seek a loan from the Department of Transport and Power for a quay wall in Wicklow Harbour.  It was estimated by our engineer that this would cost about £5,000 and as we are a small authority with full commitments under various headings we found we could not provide this money from our own resources. We approached the Department of Transport and Power for a loan and we were told that as a result of this multi-annual budgeting no further loans could be granted for up to three years to any harbour authority who had not put in for a loan or for expenditure at least three years beforehand; that only those harbour boards who had sought loans or asked for expenditure to be made on their harbours could be considered under this new control.  We were advised to look at our problems, estimate the costs of repairs, send in the estimate and the estimate would be there to be considered by the Department at a future date in three years time.  If this is what is meant by multi-annual budgeting I do not like it.  A situation in which problems which are immediate to an area are put on the long finger for three years cannot be tolerated.  As a harbour authority we know that if we have to wait three years for this work to be done the cost will have increased to £5,000, £6,000 or £7,000.  More important than that, it is likely that because <Col N="1844" /> of the motions of the tides and the currents the area will be eroded and the problem will be three or four times as great by the time we get around to raising the money.  Therefore if this multi-annual budgeting is supposed to be a saving it can only be an immediate or temporary saving and the problems will become even greater if they are left uncared for as they are in Wicklow harbour at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister when introducing his Budget said that the Government fully accepted the principle of conciliation and arbitration.  I know that this has been a fact for some time and that four major boards cater for the Civil Service and under recent legislation a board is to be set up for local government officials.  There is also a board for the teachers and for the gardaí.  The unhappy problems which have arisen over the past few years in regard to the three teaching organisations will be helped by the setting up of a conciliation and arbitration board.  I hope these facilities will be availed of to the fullest extent by the teaching organisations so that the education of children will not be interrupted or hampered as it has been in recent times.  Even the threat of strike action by a teaching organisation has a very unsettling effect on children.  When we were at school we all looked forward to getting a day off and I am sure we would have looked forward much more to getting a week or two weeks off.  This has an upsetting effect on children and while this attitude prevails neither the teachers nor the children can work at their best.  I am glad therefore that conciliation and arbitration will be available to the teachers.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Garda Síochána worthwhile improvements have taken place as a result of continued negotiations. Their working hours have been reduced from 48 to 40 hours in line with other sectors in the Civil Service. As a result of this reduction in working hours there is a great shortage of gardaí throughout the country, and there has been only a small effort made to increase the numbers to offset the reduction in hours.  The overtime facilities have not been granted to gardaí in the past&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will leave that point but I do feel that the protection afforded by gardaí to citizens will have to be improved by the recruiting of more gardaí.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, the good news in the Budget was the increase given under the heading of social welfare, to old age pensioners, to widows and their dependants.  In days gone by an increase of 10s, or 50 new pence, would have been sizeable but today it is not acceptable because of the increases in prices which have taken place over the past year.  The increase in the cost of living ranged at about 9 per cent and the 50 new pence increase only slightly exceeds the increase in the cost of living.  In the case of old age and widows non-contributory pensions the increase is only 40 new pence.  Looking at the items which are taken into account in arriving at a figure for the increase in the cost of living one sees a number of items which old age pensioners and widows would never be able to afford.  In the case of foodstuffs, rents and rates and so on, the increases were much greater in many cases than the 9 per cent increase in the cost of living last year.  Therefore the increase which they are receiving will easily be used up.  It will be October before they receive the increase and there will be further increases in the cost of living in the interim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If old age pensioners are to receive real and lasting increases the system of giving the increases will have to be changed.  There will have to be something like an automatic increase given to pensioners under the social welfare scheme as increases in the cost of living occur.  Some better system than just depending on the generosity of Ministers at a particular time will have to <Col N="1846" /> be devised so that pensioners will be looked after in the same way as other sections of the community.  While, as I said, the increase appeared to be reasonably substantial for pensioners, persons in receipt of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefits, the actual increase was in the region of 5p or 10p when the increase in the cost of living was taken into account. In order to pay for the increased benefits to social welfare recipients, taxes had to be increased by £9.35 million. The Minister at least resisted the temptation of the previous Minister for Finance; he did not increase the turnover tax.  The Minister could not have contemplated doubling the turnover tax because of the lessons learned from the inflation which followed the action one year ago.</P>
    <P>The prices of beer and spirits were increased.  The people who regularly consumed these commodities have probably something to complain about. The increases of 1p on the pint of beer and 2p on a glass of whiskey were modest.  If this money had gone to the social welfare recipients no one will complain for too long.  I would not complain about the Minister's decision to increase the price of spirits.  I see young people drinking spirits now.  At a number of functions lately I saw young people consuming spirits rather than beer and it is no harm to put a brake on that type of activity by increasing the duty.  The extra money will help the needy sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The concession fixing a two-third rate of income tax on the first £100 payable was the only good concession of the 1970 Budget.  The removal of this concession this year was a bad blunder.  This concession assisted people in the lower income group.  The Minister put an extra £1 per month on these people.  This will do great damage to the poorest sections of our people.  Many such people are pensioners who receive about £9 a week. Perhaps the Minister did this without adverting to the plight of these people. It was a blunder to remove this concession and this is one of the reasons why I intend to vote against this Budget.  The Minister is raising £6 million from income tax.  Of this sum <Col N="1847" /> £2 million is coming from interest on unpaid tax.  The period of grace of three months for paying income tax is being reduced to two months and the rate of interest on unpaid income tax is being increased from 6 per cent to 9 per cent.  The people who have income tax problems and who are in dispute with the Revenue Commissioners will pay at the rate of 9 per cent.  This is a very severe blow to them.  Many people have legitimate problems over income tax and delays occur which are not always the fault of those who pay the income tax.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Under existing law, tax which remains unpaid for more than three months attracts interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum.  Having regard to the prevailing level of interest rates, the 6 per cent is no longer adequate.  I propose therefore to raise it to 9 per cent and to reduce the period of grace from three months to two months.</P>
    <P>Under existing arrangements, interest is not chargeable on tax which is in arrear if the assessment is under appeal.  In such cases, interest does not ordinarily become chargeable until the amount of tax in dispute has been finally determined.  There is evidence of some abuse of this deferment of the interest liability and so I propose that tax in an assessment under appeal will become due on the same date as would have applied if there had been no appeal.</P>
    <P>In many cases the date of appeals and the waiting time is purely at the discretion of the Commissioners.  This is a particularly vicious form of increase for people with tax problems.  These people are now loaded with 9 per cent rate of interest on top of their outstanding commitments.</P>
    <P>The business sector of the community are being asked to face further problems in their book-keeping and their accounts by having to tackle the addition of the VAT.  It has been decided that unless unforeseen circumstances arise there will be a changeover to the VAT system on 1st January, 1972.  This is seven months away. The people in this country have not the slightest notion of what VAT is. <Col N="1848" /> Little or no effort is being made to educate the business sector of the community on what is involved.  A booklet has been circulated recently called &ldquo;Proposals for Value Added Tax&rdquo;. Details are given and examples shown of how this tax works.  In this booklet, to illustrate the workings of this new tax, the tax is shown at a rate of 5 per cent which makes the calculations very simple.  In the booklet we are told that the rate will be 5.26 per cent on goods and services now liable to turnover tax only, and 16.37 per cent on goods liable to turnover tax and also to the lower rate of wholesale tax, and 30.26 per cent on goods liable to turnover tax and the higher rate of wholesale tax.  It is proposed to apply these rates of tax in the new system.</P>
    <P>Quite honestly I was not too bad at mathematics in school but I should not like to be faced with the problem of working out 5.26 per cent and 16.37 per cent and 30.26 per cent on several different goods or services.  The business community, having had to tackle turnover tax and wholesale tax and decimalisation in recent years, and various problems under the income tax code, such as PAYE, company taxation and corporation profits tax, must be scratching their heads and wondering what will they have to face next. The amount of money spent on collecting tax for the Government by each division of industry and by shopkeepers and businessmen is colossal. Their overheads in this regard are increasing every year as the Government change one taxation system for another.  The introduction of this latest tax on 1st January, 1972, as the Minister suggested, will add to the confusion of people who have been trying to gear themselves to the changeover to decimal currency.  Just as business people get used to one system of taxation they are told to change over to another. Whether rightly or wrongly, the Minister seems to consider Irish businessmen as more intelligent than their counterparts in England where they are getting an extra year to get used to this type of taxation.</P>
    <P>Some action should have been taken in this Budget to solve many of our problems.  The fact that most of them were ignored in the Budget proposals <Col N="1849" /> is to be deplored.  The people on the housing lists of the local authorities cannot expect any help from the figures in the Budget and in the Minister's statement.  Some extra money is being allotted to housing but it will not go far enough to make up the difference in the increased costs as a result of inflation in the past year. Everyone accepts that there is a grave need for a crash housing programme particularly in our towns, but there is no suggestion that we will have this in the next year.  This is to be greatly deplored.  No incentive is given to the Department of Local Government to get on with the building of local authority houses for the ever increasing number of people who have no home of their own.</P>
    <P>Another very important industry which is suffering at the moment is the tourist industry.  Many of the problems in this industry arise outside the country. Many of them are a result of the changing attitude of people in neighbouring countries to holidays abroad. More could be done and more should have been done to provide money under this Budget to put energy back into the tourist industry.  The phenomenal growth in tourism in the past ten years or so can be attributed in large measure to Bord Fáilte and the dynamic personnel in that organisation.</P>
    <P>It can be said, too, that this country was ripe for tourist development and, with the right people pushing the industry, an explosion in tourism could and should take place.  We are now reaching the point where it will become even more difficult, even in the most favourable circumstances, to increase the number of tourists coming here. Those difficulties are being maximised by the fact that our cost of living is increasing rapidly.  We suffer greatly from the fact that we have a rather undependable climate.  Whether or not we like to admit it, many people like to get the sun and good weather while they are on holidays.  We cannot guarantee this.  Perhaps no country can guarantee it but figures speak for themselves in the case of places like the South of France, Spain, and the Canary Islands.  The likelihood of good weather <Col N="1850" /> and a warm climate in those places is good.</P>
    <P>In this country we depended on the cost of hotels and guest houses being reasonable and the cost of foodstuffs, drink and cigarettes being reasonable too.  Unfortunately in the past few years those costs have risen so rapidly that they now exceed costs in countries where for many years costs were higher than they were here.  We are faced with great problems in the tourist industry. Deputy O'Donnell said he was talking to people from my constituency and to hotel owners in Bray.  I can assure the House that there are real fears and real problems in the Bray and the Arklow areas on the part of hotel owners and guest house owners about the dismal prospects for tourism in the coming year.  Enough money has not been forthcoming to undo some of the damage that has been done by the happenings during the past year here and in the North of Ireland.  As a result the hoteliers in my constituency, which is probably one of the most tourist-minded constituencies in Ireland, are facing real problems.  Rates and taxes are increasing at an alarming rate.  The prospects at the moment are that the season will be a very bad one. I hope it will not be, but advance bookings in the Bray and Arklow areas indicate that things are not good.  Even at this late stage some advertising programme should be initiated to bring tourists to Ireland.  If another Supplementary Budget has to be introduced for this purpose I think everyone on this side of the House would welcome it and agree to whatever expenditure is necessary.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the points I wanted to cover in this debate.  The Minister for Transport and Power said that the two great problems the Government were shaping up to and facing and so forthrightly, and so on, were our joining the EEC and inflation. He asked Members on this side of the House to say what their solution would be and to say how they would tackle these problems.  I am reminded of something that was said by the late Seán Lemass on a previous occasion while he was in opposition and when taunts were being made about a particular <Col N="1851" /> difficulty that the Government of the day faced.  What Mr. Lemass said was that it is not the duty of the Opposition to provide solutions for the difficulties that are created by the Government but that it is the duty of the Opposition to criticise and oppose.  When this debate concludes, we, in this party, will be opposing the Government on the Budget because they have created more difficulties during the past year than have been created in this State since its foundation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker pointed out that as the debate on the Budget drags on, the more likelihood there is of having repetition and of being able, at the very best, only to emphasise some particular point.  It is the latter that I should hope to do in my contribution to this debate.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, I represent a constituency that is essentially an agricultural one.  Therefore, it was with the greatest disappointment that I listened to the meagre incentives the Minister was providing in his Budget, for agriculture.  Not alone are the provisions inadequate but they are not even good enough to raise any hope whatsoever of arresting the decline in agricultural output.  As my colleague, Deputy O'Higgins, remarked, agricultural output, instead of being up by 4¼ per cent as was envisaged in the Third Programme for Economic Expansion, is down by 3 per cent. Certainly, the incentives will be ineffective in halting the exodus from the land of agricultural employees and will force them into the ranks of the unemployed.</P>
      <P>The Budget was introduced at a time when we are pursuing actively our application for membership of the EEC but it fails totally to give to agriculture the necessary incentives that will enable our farmers to equip themselves to compete on an equal footing with their European rivals.  On this account alone, the Minister's Budget fails.  It indicates a lack of foresight and must have the most serious consequences for agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Estimate for Agriculture was going through the House, I requested <Col N="1852" /> the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to have a word with his colleague in Finance regarding the appalling situation in which many farmers and, indeed many businessmen, find themselves because of the colossal burden of death duties&mdash;a burden that most people must bear at some time or other.  A complete ignorance of the real dangers facing agriculture is reflected in the Minister's proposals to change the law in relation to death duties.  As can be found at column 779 of the Official Report of the debate on Financial Resolution No. 7 on 28th April, the Minister proposed to change the law in relation to the transfer of properties in consideration of marriage.  The Minister's proposal is unacceptable and would have the most drastic effects on the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>The Minister's failure in dealing with death duties in his Budget speech, to mention this most important change in legislation relating to liability to death duty leads me to believe that the Budget was drafted by civil servants and was not given proper consideration, if any at all, by either the Minister or the Government before its introduction.  If I am not correct in this contention, then the only other explanation for the Minister's failure to mention this alarming and, if I might say so, detrimental change, is that it was a deliberate omission for the purpose of keeping details of this change from the people.</P>
    <P>This particular Financial Resolution was mentioned by both Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Cooney.  It is my opinion that in the long term the Financial Resolution will have such a disastrous effect on the evolution of farms as to affect dramatically the structure of our rural community.</P>
    <P>The House is aware that the law has always, and wisely so, considered marriage as a valuable consideration so that if a farmer, on the occasion of his son's marriage, were to transfer his farm to his son, such property would not be liable to death duties for six years if the transferer were to die within that time.  The reason for this was apparent.  Irish farmers are not the best known in the world for handing <Col N="1853" /> over the reins of ownership and this is to encourage them to pass their farms to their sons so that the farms and the community might benefit from the younger man's energy and ability. The system has operated to the benefit of the country.  If the Minister is prepared to go ahead with this Financial Resolution, the result will be a loss of earnings to the country because there would be no incentive whatsoever for farmers to transfer their property and this would result in the younger people being frustrated in their efforts to pursue modern techniques and methods of farming which the older men tend to put to one side, adopting the attitude &ldquo;what was good enough for my father ought to be good enough for you&rdquo;. For a number of years past farmers have tended to equip their sons by means of education in a way that was better than they were equipped in the past.</P>
    <P>It has become quite apparent that farming nowadays requires great knowledge and expertise.  The sons were sent to agriculture colleges and were afterwards able to avail of lectures and to attend courses in the evenings.  Every facility was there to bring about the situation where the return from the farm&mdash;it is very small for the capital involved in most cases&mdash; would be all the greater.  This benefit was used very successfully and even at this late hour I hope the Minister will revert to the previous situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to stopping loopholes.  I suppose it is essential that if there are loopholes they should be stopped if it will improve the position. In this case I fear the Minister is just following what has already been done in England where this loophole was discovered.  It is now being stopped here.  The Minister referred to what he called &ldquo;evasion&rdquo; of death duties and &ldquo;artificial values&rdquo;.  I think this tends to create the impression among city people that here again the featherbedded farmers have been caught out, that they were evading death duties and in order to do so were using artificial values.  They are neither evading death duties nor using artificial values.  There is provision in the legislation already whereby the value of a <Col N="1854" /> farm for death duty purposes can be realistically assessed thus avoiding the appalling consequences of a huge burden of death duties which can and will arise if this proposal goes through.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given concessions to widows and children.  This is very laudable but what happens when the children reach 16?  How many farming families have we at present where two or three sons may remain on the farm hoping that some time they will be able to purchase their own farms and branch out on their own?  Now, should the father die, death duties will be so crippling that in all probability the farm will have to be sold and perhaps sold at a time when foreign speculators will be able to come in from EEC countries and buy the land.  If it is sold the small balance remaining will be hardly sufficient to maintain the widow in reasonable comfort for the remainder of her life.  Only too often we have seen property having to be sold after the owner's death in order to meet death duties.</P>
    <P>There is the other side of the coin where a heavy mortgage is placed on the farm to meet these obligations.  To repay that takes so long that the young men become too old and disillusioned to bother about further expansion of production or to hope to own their own farms.  I cannot stress too strongly how appalling the position will be if this proposal goes through.  It must be obvious that in many cases farmers will be unable to compete with their foreign counterparts.  The Minister may frame legislation to collect £1 million in one year but that money will be as nothing compared to the damage the legislation will do.  One million pounds spread over any number of farmers, if it is collected, as apparently intended, will result in the greatest disaster, the country will have encountered for a long time because of the reduction in the farmers' earning power as a result.  In a year or two, if we are in the EEC and land goes on the market the chances are some foreigner will buy it.  What will be left after paying the penal tax wil be too little to enable the family to buy another farm or even support the widow adequately in her lifetime, The sons may go to the labour exchange <Col N="1855" /> or wherever they like in search of employment when they could be working happily for the benefit of themselves and the country.</P>
    <P>The more I think about this the more angry I become and I ask the Minister to give it very serious consideration between now and the Finance Bill.  I have waited through this debate to emphasise this point.  Other items in the Budget merit detailed study and deep consideration and comment but other speakers have contributed very ably to the debate and I do not intend to continue except to mention one other item also relating to agriculture.  This is the appalling delay in the Departments of Finance and Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash;both are involved&mdash;in paying their debts to the farmers when they buy reactor cattle which fail the TB test.  Perhaps that is more appropriate to another debate or an Estimate but, in my opinion, it is also appropriate in the Budget debate because there are quite a number of people who have been waiting a long time for money from the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget, like every other Budget, has its immediate and also its long-term aspects.  I for one do not intend to try to follow either aspect in detail but in its immediate impact everybody must admit it is a useful and skilful Budget and it effects some useful provisions which everyone will welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to criticisms particularly from some Labour speakers about this Budget.  Any Budget will be open to criticism for some of the things it does and some of the things it does not.  I want at the outset to comment on the approach of some Opposition speakers to the matter. They seem to approach it on a free-gift philosophy basis.  Surely we should be able to get away from that in the present day?  One can do no more pleasant thing than give gifts and bonuses to everybody but the realities of the situation dictate otherwise, When people talk about giving benefits to any or every section of the community, when people talk, as some Labour speakers do, about the interests of workers and when people talk in <Col N="1856" /> terms of the free-gift philosophy they may very well be losing sight of the real interests of the people for whom they profess to speak.  I should like to put the matter in perspective by pointing out that we have as our targets getting the best standard of living that we can and also the securing of stability in the sense of security in employment and way of life.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the fundamental issues of securing adequate standards of living and employment there are features of the present economic situation which give us all cause for thought and some anxiety.  Over the past few years there has been a remarkable improvement in living standards.  That was a very excellent thing to achieve and something we want to maintain. We want to achieve security for all in the enjoyment of these standards and this Budget does something further in that direction for some sections.  We should not be blind to the fact that there are very serious threats in our present economic situation, not only to standards of living but also to the security of employment.  We have a definite inflationary situation.  The word &ldquo;inflation&rdquo; has become a very convenient label and when people use it they do not pause to reflect exactly what it means.  Uncontrolled inflation can only mean an ultimate attack on standards of living and an attack on security.  Why is inflation the menace it undoubtedly is?  It is a menace because in the long run it means a lowering of living standards in real terms and it also means a threat to the security of just the people whose interests we all&mdash;and particularly the Labour Party&mdash;profess to represent and to have at heart.</P>
    <P>There is at the moment serious monetary inflation evidenced by development over the past two years which shows a certain industrial stagnation and a trend towards unemployment which is something we do not want to see.  In our particular context here that has to be related to something which is happening all over the world particularly in the part of the world with which we are associated, the move from agricultural employment to industrial employment.  While one may deplore or argue about such <Col N="1857" /> trends they are factual realities.  I am not in any way decrying those who want to put their best energies into supporting agriculture and supporting people on the land but I have to admit in such a situation industrial development is a vital factor and something which must be encouraged, looked to and developed in the current situation.</P>
    <P>The day has long since passed when the individual craftsman did his job by himself and sold his wares.  In modern industrial society we have industrial associations, which we call companies, most of them incorporated under law.</P>
    <P>It is through these organisations that industrial employment is provided and those who are dependent on industrial activity live.  The economic health of the individual worker, his standard of living and his security depends on the viability, the efficiency and the economic health of the industrial organisation to which he belongs. These are inescapable facts and I should apologise to the House for stating such truisms, but I do so because one sometimes hears irresponsible and unthoughtout criticisms of such industrial organisations and the management of them.  It is for that reason only I emphasise the importance of these industrial organisations in the community.  A disservice is often done by people who try to develop a class warfare here because the interest of the organisation is the interest of the individual and <i>vice versa.</i> If we accept that premise and when it is put that way I think everyone will accept it, we have to look at the current situation in relation to industrial organisations in this country which are providing&mdash; that is not the way to put it really: if one puts it that way the impression created is that they are doing so gratuitously&mdash;which are the organisations through which the worker lives and functions in the community; are the organisations through which the economic life of the community as a whole functions.  They are very much facts of our economic situation.</P>
    <P>In approaching this Budget then, with these considerations in mind, I must say I have a feeling of apprehension for the future.  The Budget is skilful. <Col N="1858" /> It is good.  It is to be commended as far as it goes.  But are we all of us sufficiently conscious of the future? Are we sufficiently conscious of what the requirements will be?  Are we sufficiently conscious in the current inflationary situation of what are likely to be the problems of the future?</P>
    <P>I have referred to inflation.  To make my point and pass on&mdash;it is not my major point&mdash;there is on the question of inflation the question of costs generally, including labour costs; it is in the interests of the worker that labour costs are relating to earnings.  That is vital for security.  It is even vital for standards of living.  That has been argued time and again and I do not need to make the point now except for the purpose of building my argument and getting everything into perspective. When I go on to talk about other aspects of inflation I want to emphasise that very little can be done unless costs inflation on the earnings end of industry is controlled.</P>
    <P>Having made that point, I now want to pass on to another, and this is something which aggravates the problem of wage and salary increases, salaries and wages which undoubtedly are a very heavy burden on industry; but there are other aspects of the matter now repercussing on them which would, perhaps, be more our direct responsibility here and these are the things to which I want to address myself now.</P>
    <P>This goes very much to government policy.  When I say &ldquo;government policy&rdquo; I am not referring to the particular government here.  I am making a statement which would be valid whatever government is here and whatever administration is behind that government. The fact is that our State institutions, the government of this country in general terms, are largely contributing to the inflationary situation. This is happening in two ways. The people on the other side who talk about wanting more benefits and so forth, should realise that, in putting on these pressures, they are themselves contributing to inflation and to the kind of problems I have mentioned. The problems are two-fold.  One is the difficulties facing these companies, <Col N="1859" /> these essential organisations in our society on which the individual worker depends directly, the health of which will be his economic health, the difficulties of which will be reflected back on him in one way or another, notably in the security which may ultimately degenerate into the horrible spectre of unemployment.  The difficulties facing these companies and these organisations stem from two sources.  One source is State borrowing.  There has been and there is, no matter how admirable the results, and there have been admirable results, and this Government for the past 12 years have a very fine record to show with an improved standard of living and improved employment opportunities&mdash;let us not befog the real issues by trying to controvert these undoubted achievements &mdash;State borrowing and State demands on credit, the results of which are now showing.  State borrowing and State demands on credit are imposing burdens on us which I feel&mdash;perhaps I am old fashioned in my economic thinking&mdash;are becoming threatening burdens. That has inflationary repercussions. More important still is the fact that by absorbing the credit available we are now very near the stage at which insufficient credit is available to industry for development and even for continued operation.</P>
    <P>Since the First World War it became popular to blame the boss, so to speak, and to attack the boss.  The fact is that over the past 50 years Irish Governments within the framework in which they were cast did a very fine job in making credit available.  However, if my information is right, we are now at the point at which there is so much credit demanded by the State there is insufficient credit available in the private sector.  This is something which is disturbing.</P>

      <P>This is something which needs thought from the point of view of the future.  Combine that then with the burden of borrowing&mdash;that is interest and sinking fund&mdash;we could reach the stage at which one would have to consider the whole economic structure if the hogging of credit by the <Col N="1860" /> State were to proceed much further than it has already done.  It is time we all stopped trying to make small points or to exploit the politically attractive approach of what I call the &ldquo;free gift&rdquo; philosophy and faced the problem we actually have to deal with here.  Credit is needed by expanding industry.  Industry depends on the credit available to it.  It is all right to try to attract foreign investment and all that kind of thing, but for the successful operation of the genuine Irish firm a certain volume of credit availability is a necessity and there are indications in the present economic situation that credit availability in the future may not be sufficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not pointing at the Deputy personally; I pointed across.  I am unashamedly arguing for Irish companies, for Irish industrial organisations here, on the social grounds that the employment and the standard of living of a large number of people are depending on them, and with the present trends, particularly the movements from the land, the dependence is likely to grow in the future rather than decrease.  In that connection, there is one passage in the Minister's speech which I think, to put it mildly, needs a little amplification.  At column 714, volume 253, of the Official Report of the 28th April, 1971, the Minister says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern has been expressed in many quarters at the present burden of taxation on company profits.  But when our present combined income tax and corporation profits tax rates of 58 per cent are compared with the rates prevailing in other countries, it is often overlooked that under our system the shareholder is not taxed again to income tax on the dividends he receives out of <Col N="1861" /> the company profits.  The result is that, effectively, company tax is paid, in many cases, at a rate much lower than 58 per cent.  In the United Kingdom, for example, in addition to the tax paid by the company on its profits, the individual shareholder must pay tax on his dividends out of those profits.  But in this country, if the company distributes 40 per cent of its pre-tax profits to its shareholders the rate effectively borne by the Irish company on its profits is not 58 per cent but 44 per cent.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider that paragraph on this basis: is this not an incentive to distribute profits where, in the present situation, an incentive is needed to make people put profits back into the industry?  I would strongly recommend to the Minister to review company tax from that point of view.  I have tried to make a few calculations here on this matter, and I tried to do it in a number of different ways.  No matter what way I make them, at the present moment retained earnings by a company will be less; in other words, in regard to retained earnings a company is at a disadvantage in Ireland as compared with a company in the United Kingdom. There is an incentive here not to plough back but to pay out, even on the Minister's own argument.</P>
    <P>Take a company that makes a gross profit before taxation of £100,000.  In this country income tax would come to £35,000.  The amount left after paying income tax would be £65,000. After paying corporation profits tax the company would have £42,000. Therefore straight away, out of £100,000, there would be £42,000 in profits for distribution.  There are different ways in which the dividend can be taken, but take a dividend of 10 per cent after income tax is paid, leaving the corporation tax to be paid completely by the company.  That would give a dividend of £6,500 and the retained earnings for that company would then be £35,500.  Another calculation might make that £2,000 more; it does not matter for the purposes of my argument.</P>
    <P>That would be the position here in <Col N="1862" /> Ireland.  The comparable position in an English company, again with a tolerance of a couple of thousand pounds, would be earnings of the order of £50,000; CPT would be £40,000 to £42,500; profits after tax would be of the order of £60,000.  With the same dividend of 10 per cent there would be, on that showing, approximately £15,000 more per £100,000 to be ploughed back in an English company.  Frankly I cannot see the force of the paragraph I have just quoted in relation to the alleviation of taxation on Irish companies.</P>
    <P>I am moved to make these points in some deail here because, if I have read the Minister's speech correctly, he has promised a review of the general question of company taxation. The central point I am making is that here in Ireland the incentive is to distribute profits.  I do not know if I am right in this, but this is my impression anyway.  Even if the figure is lower than the 58 per cent, it is still a good deal higher than the percentage across the water.  In view of the inflationary situation, with the restriction of credit resulting from the availability of credit for State borrowing, it is high time to revise radically our approach to company taxation.</P>
    <P>The added value tax system is to be introduced.  If this is merely to be a graft on the existing situation, it might well be a heavier burden still on industrial organisation than the current turnover tax and wholesale tax.  The whole matter needs careful analysis. The <i>Irish Banking Review</i> for March, 1971, has some interesting facts from which I quote.  Referring to the last Budget, that is, the October Budget, it says:</P>
    <P>Extra taxation has been imposed on companies and the maximum combined rate of income tax and corporation tax has been raised from approximately 50 to 58 per cent.</P>
    <P>A sum of just under £1 million will be obtained by raising the wholesale tax from 15 per cent to 20 per cent on a stated range of luxury items.  A similar sum will be gained by increasing road taxation on private motor vehicles.</P>
    <P>Again:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1863" /> Even when allowance is made for the unavoidable impact of cost increases and inflationary pressures on Government spending, public expenditure has been increasing so rapidly in recent years that it is itself a potent force in making for increased inflation.  The rate of increase in Government current expenditure has accelerated rapidly to an annual rate not far short of 20 per cent in the current year.  A rate of increase of this magnitude has made necessary the imposition of heavier taxes which, in turn, put pressure on costs and prices and created an environment favourable to further claims for higher incomes.</P>
    <P>The doubling of turnover tax in the 1970 Budget was the major reason for the heavy rise in prices of over 4 per cent between the first and second quarters of that year. The heavier taxes imposed on companies in the Supplementary Budget have added to the difficulties of industry by squeezing profits at a time of heavily rising costs in industry and thereby helping to impede investment.</P>
    <P>The sharp rise in the Government capital programme has also been reflected in a greatly increased volume of borrowing both at home and abroad.  Foreign borrowing has increased substantially and must be reckoned as adding to the pressures of domestic inflation while the heavy resort to domestic borrowing has affected the flow of savings for private industrial development.</P>
    <P>I could develop these arguments in detail but I do not think it is a very helpful exercise to go into fine figures and to make the necessary distinctions between points of 1 per cent which can arise in doing a tax computation or any of these kinds of computation.  I shall content myself with making the point that, even if one accepts that statement in the Budget speech which I mentioned, the fact is that the incentive is to distribution, not to re-investment, and that on any showing the Irish company is at a disadvantage.  In saying that, I am not for a moment ignoring the initial allowances.  It is <Col N="1864" /> only fair to the Minister to refer also to column 715 of the Official Report where he points out the tax reliefs for investment in machinery <i>et cetera.</i> These are very welcome, very helpful and very commendable indeed, but they do not cover the whole aspect.  On many companies the burden of taxation now exceeds the net profit that the company can show, that is when you take into account turnover tax and wholesale tax which many concerns have to carry in one form or another. Taxes like income tax, corporation profits tax and wholesale tax were all thought up in terms of small percentages. They are all justified as small percentages of the sum from which they are deducted but it is alarming to find companies in this State where not only the total deduction of tax exceeds the difference between outlay and income, in other words the net profit available, but I think there are cases where the sum of corporation profits tax plus income tax alone, without the other taxes, can achieve the same result.</P>
    <P>That, in itself, is a warning.  I have adverted to it here not as a criticism of the present Budget, which is excellent in its many provisions and in fact a very skilful Budget indeed, but we are still in the inflationary situation to which I referred.  Companies are still facing acute problems arising from that inflation.  They themselves as entities are perhaps socially unimportant but their employees, the people who are depending on them for a livelihood and for their standard of living, are not socially unimportant and it is these who are threatened by the present situation.  It is because of these and their future security that, in my view, some relief must ultimately accrue to the organisations on which these individuals depend at whatever level they are&mdash;clerical, manual, skilled, unskilled, managerial, operative or whatever it is.  There is a whole social structure depending on these organisations and their economic health is vital for the security and the employment of the rest.  It is in that sense I make the case and particularly from the point of view of the availability of profits for development, for expansion, for replacement.  There are <Col N="1865" /> companies even in this town at the moment which are in difficulty and have been for some years even for normal replacement and normal development quite apart from the industrial expansion we all want to see here.</P>
    <P>All these things I would strongly recommend to the Minister particularly referring to the last paragraph of his speech, the paragraph on tax reform at column 718.  It is something for which a mere administrative or revenue approach will not be sufficient and in the last analysis the health of the State's revenue itself will depend on this because if taxation is the golden egg that nourishes the State the State should be very careful to see that the hen is kept alive.</P>

      <P>If the former Deputy James Dillon reads this speech he will find it hard to believe that such a speech was made in the year 1971 in Dáil Éireann by Deputy de Valera. Deputy Dillon was not alone in making those statements.  Many others made similar statements but I think none made them with such great emphasis as Deputy Dillon.  He used all the adjectives one could think of.  I can go back now and read some of these speeches by Deputy Dillon and I am convinced that when I do I will read a lot in them on the lines of what has been said here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unfortunate thing is that Deputy de Valera did not make that speech some years ago.  I recall that when Deputy Dillon and others made like speeches in this House they were laughed at and jeered at from the <Col N="1866" /> benches opposite.  It was unbelievable to me tonight that Deputy de Valera had the courage, and I admire him for it, to come in and say what he did.  He is lucky if he does not find himself, like Deputy Joe Lenehan, thrown out of the party because his thinking does not seem to be in line with many Members of his party who have spoken here since the debate began.  As far as they are concerned everything is rosy in the garden: there is no split in the party.</P>
    <P>We were treated tonight to a speech by the Minister for Transport and Power who painted a very rosy picture of the past 12 months and of how his party had got on.  He had to admit to some little difficulties, as he called them, but he tried to create the impression that none of those difficulties existed today.  He said they did not exist in relation to health, tourism or industry in general.  I do not claim to have the political experience of Deputy de Valera but I am able to speak about the things with which I am conversant.</P>
    <P>Particularly when one comes from an area such as East Mayo, or any part of Mayo, and sees the conditions which exist and have existed since Fianna Fáil took office, one does not find it a pleasure to come here and state the position.  I recall one occasion when I was making one of my speeches in the House, relating to problems of the West of Ireland in general with particular reference to those of my constituency, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, called me a banshee &mdash;that I was coming into the House wailing and crying about all the poverty, the hardship, the emigration and the many other difficulties, of all of which I was too well aware.  I retorted that I was not a banshee, that I was giving the facts as I knew them to exist.</P>
    <P>I was pointing out on that occasion that ESB poles were deposited in my yard a few miles from Foxford, something between 1,000 and 1,500 poles that some time previously had carried ESB power to schools and homes.  The Minister said he doubted it and I asked him to go and telephone the ESB office to confirm that they very day the poles were there which had at one time <Col N="1867" /> served schools and rural homes from which the people had fled to England or somewhere else.</P>
    <P>It is not any pleasure for me to relate those things.  On more than one occasion I have said that so serious was the problem in the west that a number of distinguished churchmen of varying denominations &mdash; Catholics being predominant&mdash;including bishops, had got together in Foxford and formed an organisation known as the Defence of the West Committee.  They issued a statement pointing out all those things.  I remember a former Taoiseach, God rest his soul, expressing surprise in the House and going as far as saying that he was not aware this was so.  I assured him it was&mdash;that another meeting was held in Charlestown, that the hall was packed with distinguished churchmen and lay people determined to do something about the problem.  The Bishop of Achonry stated in the public press that the problem was so serious that one began to wonder if one met a human being anywhere in the West.  I forget the bishop's exact utterance.  It was serious and the Government of the <Col N="1868" /> day were made aware that those problems existed and that something should be done about them.</P>
    <P>On 12th November, 1970, speaking on the Estimate for the Department of Lands&mdash;the present Minister for Lands is from my constituency&mdash;I repeated those points as forcibly as I could.  I pointed out that the Minister, Deputy Seán Flanagan, must be as conversant with them as I was, being a native of the county and a Deputy for that constituency. I said it was necessary and urgent that the earliest possible time small farmers in the West and members of their families should be provided with employment, at least one person in each household to be employed, so that their meagre incomes would be supplemented.  I suggested that the dole should be continued so that it would be possible for them to live at home until such time as gainful employment could be provided for them.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 19th May, 1971.</P>

      <P>The estimated number of persons insured under the Social Welfare Acts is not broken down into county areas and I am not in a position, therefore, to give the precise information sought by the Deputy.  However, the estimated number of insured workers in each county and county borough as at 31st March, 1970 is given in the following tabular statement.  This estimate is based on the number of insurance cards exchanged at local offices of the Department of Labour and represents the number of workers insured for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>The total number of persons effectively insured under the Social Welfare Acts as at 31st March, 1970, the latest date for which figures are available, is approximately 796,000.  This figure takes into account not only the number of insured workers who surrender cards, but also insured persons continuously on benefit either through unemployment or sickness and do not, therefore, surrender cards.  In addition, the figure includes soldiers and contributors for widows' pension and occupational injuries benefit only, who do not surrender cards, as well as voluntary contributors, who while they surrender cards, would not be included in the tabular statement.</P>
