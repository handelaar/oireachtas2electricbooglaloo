      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The following are particulars of registered unemployment, as required:</P>
      <P>In Waterford County Borough there were 727 unemployed persons on the 2nd January, 1970 and 703 on the 1st January, 1971; a decrease of 24.</P>
      <P>In Waterford County (excluding the County Borough), there were 592 unemployed persons on the 2nd January, 1970 and 638 on the 1st January, 1971; an increase of 46.</P>
      <P>As the changes are relatively small and are spread over a number of local offices, they cannot be assigned to any particular cause.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to a report (details supplied) to the effect that enzyme detergents constitute a possible health hazard; and if he will take steps to inform the public accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the report referred to by the Deputy.  I indicated in reply to previous Parliamentary Questions that I am keeping the situation about enzyme detergents under <Col N="505" /> review.  The evidence available from various sources would not warrant taking action as suggested by the Deputy.  I would again suggest, however, to those people who are sensitive to these products that they should take ordinary common-sense precautions in handling them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the British authorities are advertising such dangers?  Will he consider having the Department of Health advertise the dangers in order to put people, who might not be aware that they are allergic to these enzyme detergents, on their guard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have inquired from the health departments of Great Britain, the USA and Canada and we can find no evidence of the kind suggested by the Deputy&mdash;none whatever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously there must be some conflicting evidence on this. Some months ago I sent the Minister a report, which he acknowledged, outlining the dangers of these detergents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy referring to the use of detergents by the public or to the manufacture of detergents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The use and the manufacture.  The danger to the users and to those involved and employed in the manufacture of them is roughly the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had no evidence whatever of the danger of the use of these detergents.  As far as the manufactures are concerned they have taken the greatest precaution possible. In regard to the use of these detergents I have asked the manufacturers what evidence they have had of damage to health occasioned to people who use them.  I have no evidence whatever which suggests I need to take action in the matter.  I am naturally taking account of all the statements that have been made and am keeping the matter under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that we should not wait until damage has occurred.  It would be <Col N="506" /> worthwhile asking the manufacturers to have this investigated by independent people here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>To date grants paid in respect of the 1969 and 1970 revenue deficits of the participating voluntary hospitals have reached levels of 88 per cent and 77 per cent respectively, leaving £0.5 million and £1.4 million of estimated figures still to be met.</P>
      <P>Further grants in respect of both periods will continue to be paid up to the close of the present financial year. These will be made on receipt of final accounts and more up-to-date estimates from the hospitals concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950 special provisions have been made to require that all reasonable measures are taken to prevent contamination of food or drink by foreign matter.  The enforcement of these provisions is the primary responsibility of the local health authorities. I am satisfied that health authorities are alive to their responsibilities in this matter as they affect hygiene requirements for licensed premises and that the necessity does not arise at the moment for the institution of special steps to ensure that the regulations are enforced in the respect mentioned by the Deputy.  I am, however, keeping the matter under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The transfer of the entire cost of health services to the Exchequer, if that is what the Deputy has in mind, is not being considered.

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree to that and the Deputy will be aware&mdash;he comes from a rural constituency&mdash;that about 75 per cent of the cost of health services in respect of purely rural constituencies is already paid from central funds arising from the rate remission for those engaged in agriculture.  In regard to the constituency which he represents there would be no case for that whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am asking a question but I want to nail the point <Col N="508" /> the Minister is trying to make.  Is the Minister really serious in suggesting that rural constituencies would not benefit from a different type of financial structure in relation to the health schemes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is interested in the administrative machinery for the prevention of excessive exposure to radiation of persons in contact with radioactive materials or the general public.</P>
      <P>The controls which are at present exercised over radioactive materials are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health has power to control the use of radioactive materials in the interests of health and safety.  He has proceeded so far by way of voluntary controls operated on his behalf by the National Radiation Monitoring Service.  This service has organised a film badge service for continuously measuring the radiation dose received by those working with irradiating apparatus.  This service is availed of by all hospitals and many commercial firms.  The service also advises hospitals, dentists and commercial enterprises on the use of such apparatus and the safeguards necessary for the protection of workers and of the public from radiation spillage.  The service undertakes the monitoring of radioactivity in the Irish sea through the monitoring of samples of sea-water, fish and seaweed from selected sites off the Irish coast.  The Meteorological Service of my Department carries out regular measurements of the radioactivity of precipitation, settled dust and airborne particles in a number of selected locations throughout the country.  In addition, measurements of Strontium-90 activity are made by the Meteorological Service on milk samples supplied by the Department of Health and the results are conveyed to that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Labour under the Factories Act, 1955, may seek a court order prohibiting the dangerous storage and use of radioactive materials in any factory, construction site, <i>et cetera</i> where they may be stored or in use without adequate safety and health <Col N="510" /> precautions.  In addition, draft regulations to control exposure of industrial workers to radiation have been prepared by the Minister for Labour and will be made in the near future.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in the Nuclear Energy Bill, 1971 to set up a Nuclear Energy Board which will have the function of advising the Government and Minister on nuclear matters generally including appropriate protective measures and the need for any further controls over radioactive substances.  The Bill when enacted will also give power to introduce any regulatory measures considered necessary.</P>

It is expected that the programme will be completed by 1975; in the meantime, a further opportunity of accepting supply will be offered to unconnected householders in the Dromulton locality, but on the present basis of working, the ESB do not envisage that this can be done before 1974.</P>

It did I understand in fact happen.  What I am concerned about is the circumstances which brought this extraordinary situation about.  Did the Minister inquire into this when he was in New York?</P>

      <P>I accepted an invitation from the Irish Travel Agents <Col N="512" /> Association Inc. of the United States to be guest of honour at their annual dinner in New York and one from Aerlínte to perform the official opening of the New York link to Astral, the company's computerised reservation system.</P>
      <P>I met the chief executives of American tourist agencies and travel interests, the editors of influential American journals and magazines and members of Irish associations in New York as well as the local representatives of the Irish agencies concerned and discussed with them the progress to date and future prospects for tourism from the US.</P>
      <P>The general view in North America for tourist travel to Ireland in 1971 is optimistic.  The special additional promotional campaign, which is now in full swing, seems to be achieving its objective and I am very satisfied with the efforts of Bord Fáilte, Aerlínte, CIE and SFADCO to attract more traffic.  I am confident that the final outcome for 1971 will show a reasonable increase on this year's figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently issued an explanatory statement to the airlines and to the agencies organising transatlantic &ldquo;affinity&rdquo; charter flights which sets out very fully our policy and the procedures involved in implementing it.  This policy is designed to give the non-scheduled carriers the maximum opportunity of participating in <Col N="516" /> transatlantic operations consistent with maintaining the viability of the scheduled services.  Authorisations for charter flights off the scheduled routes are granted freely but the first option to operate such flights on the scheduled routes must be given to the scheduled carriers.  If the scheduled carriers are unable to accept a charter group or if they delay beyond a reasonable period in accepting it, a non-scheduled carrier is authorised to operate a flight.  Four weeks are regarded as a reasonable period for reply by the scheduled carrier for flights commencing six months after the date of application.  For flights commencing earlier or later than six months the time for reply would vary more or less proportionately.</P>
      <P>All parties concerned are now fully aware of the position and I am satisfied that this policy operated in the manner indicated provides reasonable opportunities to all carriers and ensures that there should be no loss of tourist business.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say whether or not it is a fact that all previous applications by charter airlines to operate in here have come from Boston, New York and Chicago?  The vast majority of applications have come from those three centres from which scheduled air services are operated.  In view of this, how can the Minister say that his new change of policy will have any appreciable effect on the amount of charter traffic in here?  It is reasonable to assume that future applications will come from the same areas.</P>

      <P>Irish Airlines operating in the North Atlantic propose to increase their business in the coming season by 78 per cent as against last year's figure.  They propose to go actively into the charter business.  I have mentioned the target in so far as Irish Airlines are concerned.  The new procedures will mean that in the coming season there will be a definite situation. A promoter of a tour must get a reply, one way or the other, from the scheduled carriers within four weeks, if <Col N="517" /> it is a charter operation six months ahead, or two weeks if it is an operation three months ahead, and one week if the charter operation is one month ahead.  In this way there will be an element of certainty brought into the whole promotion business from the North Atlantic market, which was not there heretofore.</P>

      <P>Moneys are provided annually for the Major Resort Development Scheme under a separate grant-in-aid subhead of my Department's Vote.  The allocation of the grant-in-aid funds for the scheme is a matter for Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early stages of the scheme, attention was concentrated on land acquisition, preparation of development plans, consultations with local authorities, <i>et cetera</i>.  Accordingly, the rate of expenditure and the progress of <Col N="518" /> development work was on a comparatively modest scale.  Within recent years, Bord Fáilte have reached the stage where plans have been agreed for development schemes at a number of resorts and a considerable amount of development work could now be undertaken. The cost of implementing all the proposed work within a short period would, however, be prohibitive and, in the circumstances, the schemes must be carried out in a planned orderly sequence.</P>
    <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that it is hoped to complete the first stage of the east end scheme at Kilkee in May, 1971.  The board do not expect to be able to provide funds for the second stage of the scheme in 1971 because of other commitments under the Major Resort Development Scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Major Resort Development Scheme is administered by Bord Fáilte, who designate the areas to be developed under it and allocate the funds provided for this purpose under a separate grant-in-aid subhead of my Department's Vote.  There is no specific provision in my Department's Vote for minor resort works and out of the general grant-in-aid which is made available to Bord Fáilte to cover operational expenses, including all marketing and many miscellaneous developmental activities, the board endeavour to set aside an allocation for improvement and amenity works at <Col N="519" /> resorts and other locations which are not designated under the Major Resort Development Scheme.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that the minor resort development works carried out in the period from March, 1966 to January, 1971 are many and varied and a list of them and the amount spent by the board in each case is not readily available.  The board, however, have provided a list of the amounts spent on minor resort works in the period from 1st April, 1966 to 31st December, 1970 in each county and with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate it and a list of the amounts spent in the same period on major resort works in each major resort, in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the board that they have received a large volume of requests for financial assistance for resorts and that discussions have taken place with the interests concerned on the merits of the scheme proposed. Because of Bord Fáilte's commitments in relation to resort development works, which have been in the pipeline for a number of years, the high costs of such works and the fact that it has not been possible to provide the funds necessary to implement all of them at the same time or within a short period, the board's discussions on the financing of resort development proposals were based on the likely availability of the requisite funds.  In the circumstances, the board found that it was not possible to process applications to the stage where they could give firm promises as to when they could provide the financial assistance sought.  It is clear that the board's expenditure on resort development works for the next few years will have to be directed in the main towards the implementation on a phased basis of development works already drawn up.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the money available for resort development work in the next three years has been ear-marked by Bord Fáilte, that, in fact, there is no money at all available for new work to be done, that Bord Fáilte seem to have got bogged down completely in the process of attempting to develop <Col N="521" /> the major resorts, that very little money is being spent in minor resorts and that, in many minor resorts, no money at all has been available for many years?  Would the Minister consider asking Bord Fáilte to review the whole set-up, and asking his colleague the Minister for Finance to make enough money available in the Budget to finance a decent scheme for minor resorts?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the allocation of Bord Fáilte funds it is a question of getting our priorities right. As far as I am concerned the main priority at this point of time is to ensure that the existing accommodation is filled, hotel accommodation, guesthouse accommodation, and so on. This is why we allocated increased funds early this year for market promotion abroad to encourage more visitors to come here.  In my view, that is the priority at the moment.  One must cut one's cloth according to one's measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there are many smaller resorts that could do very well and are getting a very big number of visitors but, because of the fact that they are getting absolutely no co-operation from Bord Fáilte, they are unable to cater for them, and never will be able to cater for them?  Does the Minister not agree that it is stupid to be spending £1 million on resorts that are already over-catered for while nothing at all can be found for other resorts that could cater for many thousands of visitors if they were treated properly?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he has yet received a report on a legal action in the name of and on behalf of employees of a firm (details supplied) in respect of benefits lost through stamps not being affixed <Col N="522" /> to insurance cards, notwithstanding deductions from wages for such stamps; whether any prosecution has been taken against the firm on the findings; and if he will state the progress to-date in the examination by his Department of ways to recover benefit for employees who at present suffer loss owing to failure of employers to stamp cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers (for the Minister for Social Welfare) Mr. Childers (for the Minister for Social Welfare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers (for the Minister for Social Welfare)</NameTxt>
      <P>Legal action was not taken against the firm in question in respect of benefits lost by employees through failure by the firm to pay insurance contributions.  The firm went into voluntary liquidation on 1st September, 1969, and a subsequent scheme of arrangement in the matter of creditors was approved by a High Court order.  This precluded action for the recovery of benefits lost by the employees.</P>
      <P>On the question of providing against loss of benefit by insured persons where employers fail to pay insurance contributions due I indicated in my reply to a question in this matter by Deputy Keating on 27th January, 1971, that I propose to amend the legislation at the earliest opportunity to ensure that no insured person, who is himself blameless in the matter, will lose benefit solely by reason of an employer's failure or neglect to pay insurance contributions due and that I am, in the meantime, amending existing statutory regulations governing the payment and crediting of contributions which will have the effect of greatly reducing the number of cases in which loss of benefit can arise due to employers failure to stamp insurance cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that of the 29 employees involved in this firm which failed to stamp their employees' cards, some were deprived of disability benefit and some of unemployment benefit for a period of about seven weeks and that no compensation has been offered to them? Could the Minister tell us if it is the intention of the Department to compensate them or in what way they will be compensated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will have to ask the Minister for Social Welfare whether the regulations which <Col N="523" /> are being prepared by virtue of the provisions of section 7 of the 1952 Act will apply in this case.  As I have indicated already, the Minister is making regulations which will cover most of the difficulties that will arise in this sort of case where firms failed to pay the contribution.  Consequent upon that there will be amending legislation which will clear up the whole position. I am sure the Minister for Social Welfare would be saying in my place that this matter must be cleared up but whether what he is doing in relation to section 7 of the 1952 Act would apply to these employees, I am not certain. Would the Deputy address a question to the Minister in regard to these employees or else ask him about them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Existing regulations provide for the inspection of his insurance card by an insured person and, accordingly, amendment is not necessary.</P>
      <P>Under these regulations an employer is required to give to an employed contributor who desires to inspect his insurance card while it is in the custody of the employer, a reasonable opportunity of so doing, either within or immediately before or after working hours.  The only restrictions on an insured person's right to inspect his card are that he may do so not more than once in any calendar month and then only at such time as may be fixed by his employer for the purpose.</P>
      <P>This has been the position since the Social Welfare Acts came into operation on 5th January, 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that on numerous occasions recently when employees have asked to see their cards they have been given their cards and told that their employment had been terminated?  This is happening mainly in non-union jobs.  Would not the introduction of specific legislation protect this type of employee?</P>

      <P>I suggest that the Deputy should communicate with the Minister and give him specific examples of what is happening, or of what he says, in regard to this matter. I am sure the Minister would examine them.  The regulations are perfectly clear.  A person has the right to examine his insurance card but not more often than once in any calendar month.  If employers are dismissing people because they ask to see their insurance cards, this is a most serious <Col N="525" /> matter.  I hope the Deputy will draw the attention of the Minister to the specific cases which he has in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The free travel facilities are not available during peak periods in Dublin, Cork and Limerick or on long distance bus and rail services from noon on Friday to midnight on Sunday of each August bank holiday week-end, and from 23rd to 27th December, inclusive.  A note to this effect is included in the pension books of qualified old age, blind and widow pensioners, and in the notification of approval of the allowance which is issued from my Department to all qualified British and Northern Ireland retirement pensioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree with the Deputy at all.  Social welfare payments have been increased by twice, <Col N="526" /> 2½ and 3 times in the last ten years as a consequence of the increase in the cost of living of 60 per cent and the facilities given for free travel are reasonably adequate.  While I can understand the Deputy's attitude towards what may be regarded as a sympathetic consideration of these sorts of claims, it was quite clear from the very beginning that free travel allowances should be made in the non-peak periods.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 24, 25 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Ceann Comhairle that during the week which began on 25th January, 1971, two reporters from England were engaged to supplement the normal reporting establishment attached to the Houses of the Oireachtas and that during the present week it is proposed to employ three such reporters.  These steps have become necessary because of the temporary additional demands on the reporting staff caused by the current proceedings of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
      <P>The reporters from England were engaged by the Ceann Comhairle on a contract basis with an agency in London.  Neither the Ceann Comhairle nor I is aware what the agency pays to the individuals whom it supplies.</P>
      <P>In addition, a former Editor of Debates who is now on pension has been employed at the maximum of the rate appropriate to a Reporter.  The scales for Reporter are from £1,595 to £2,300 for a man and from £1,295 to £1,845 for a woman.  Furthermore, a former lady member of the reporting staff is engaged at the rate appropriate to casually-employed reporters, viz £2 5s a day attendance fee plus £1 8s per 10-minute take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 8 of the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act, 1959, the number of reporting staff is determined, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, by the Chairman of Dáil Éireann, after consultation with the Chairman of Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the present authorised establishment for the reporting staff would be sufficient in normal circumstances if all vacancies could be filled.  At present, however, circumstances are not normal in that the current investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts into the grant for Northern Ireland Relief, 1969-70, means an extra burden on the reporting staff when the Dáil and Seanad are sitting simultaneously.  In addition, there are two vacancies for Reporter and three for Reporter Grade II.</P>
      <P>My Department are in touch with the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas with a view to the filling of these vacancies as soon as possible.  In the meantime, recourse is being had to the temporary employment of outside reporters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approve the following Order in draft&mdash;</P>
      <P>Redundancy Contributions (Variation of Rates) Order, 1971</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 12th January, 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This resolution proposes approval of a draft order to provide for variations in the rates of weekly redundancy contributions. Subsections (1) and (2) of section 28 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967 provide that the rates <Col N="544" /> of the weekly contributions should amount to 1s in respect of each male employee, of which the employer contributes 8d and the employee 4d and 9d for each female employee, made up of an employer's portion of 6d and a contribution of 3d from the employee. Subsection (3) of section 28 provides that these rates might be varied by an order of the Minister for Labour but under section 5 (1) of the Act such an order must be approved in draft form by an affirmatory resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The need for the draft order now before the House arises from the proposed introduction of decimalisation on 15th February next.  The components of the rates of weekly redundancy contributions are not convertible to precise decimal currency equivalents so that the decimalised rates proposed and mentioned in the draft order of necessity represent departures from the existing rates.  The proposed decimalised rates are, in fact, the precise conversion rates specified in the whole new penny conversion table contained in the Decimal Currency Act, 1970.</P>
    <P>As compared with the existing rates male employees and employers of women will have to pay very slightly more by way of redundancy contributions, whereas women workers and employers of men will be required to pay slightly less.  The effect of the new rates on the annual income to the redundancy fund will be slight.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputies will accept that the rates proposed in the draft order represent an equitable conversion of the existing contribution rates to decimal.  Any Deputy who wishes to raise any points or ask any questions about the redundancy payments scheme generally will have an opportunity of doing so in the debate on Second Stage of the Redundancy Payments Bill, 1970, which I hope will be taken later today.  In the meantime, I recommend the resolution approving the proposed order to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that with the change to the decimal system there is no unit that will hit dead on with what was paid before but I should like the Minister to tell us the number of males <Col N="545" /> employed as against the number of females employed.  Under the old system the employer paid 8d for a male employee and now it is only 7.2d.  I think that is correct.  For females it was 6d.  I am taking the money as the old money rather than the new money. Where the old rate for men was 8d the new one will be 3p, or 7.2d in old money.  For female employees it was 6d and now it is 3p, which is 7.2d. The total amount paid, therefore, was 1s 2d and in the new amount, if you add the two, it will be 1s 2.4d, which seems to be more.  I know that there are fewer female employees than male employees but could the Minister not tell us how much the redundancy fund is going to gain on this?  If he works out the number of males employed and the number of females employed he can tell us the amount the fund is going to gain.  The employer paid 4d for a male worker before this but now it is 4.8d and the female is now 2.4d as against 3d before.  Could the Minister not have told us how much the fund would gain or lose by these alterations?  Has he got that information?</P>

      <P>I thought that, perhaps, the halfpenny might come into it somewhere but if this were used you would still get above or below it.  Is it correct that the Minister is trying to keep to the old repayments as nearly as possible?  I do not suppose there is any other way of dealing with this. The only thing is that in one case the men have to pay .8p more and for that the employer pays .8p less.  For the female it is .6p and the employer has to pay 1.2p extra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We must admit that it was necessary to change in view of decimalisation and nobody will quarrel with that.  However, I would quarrel with the system used by the Minister. We were told in this House that no matter what happened when decimalisation was introduced there would not be any increase in prices.  All over this country at the present time the sharks are using the change to decimalisation <Col N="546" /> to increase prices.  Because of the fact that very many people do not understand decimalisation they frequently find that a penny is added to the bill with the result that prices are soaring. There is a town 30 miles from here and every time a persons pays a bill it is converted to decimals and the customer is told &ldquo;Well, of course you forgot to add the penny&rdquo; and this sum is added.  In this instance I thought the Minister would make an effort to set a good example and reduce the amount.  He could have done that because the Redundancy Fund is running at a surplus of £500,000 per year.  The amount by which the redundancy payment is being improved is only £360,000 per year so the Minister could have rounded the amounts down in all cases without adversely affecting the fund.  I think the Minister made a mistake in not setting an example in this case.  The temptation to get that little bit extra by rounding up prices is bad enough but to do it by catching the employee is wrong.  I admit the Minister had to decimalise but I think he made a mistake in rounding up the figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  What I thought the most equitable system to apply was the conversion table which sets out the whole new penny conversion table in decimal currency.  That is what we have applied.  It results in the employers, in the case of men, getting off with a little less and the workers paying a little more.  For women the employers pay more than they did in the past and the female contributors pay a little less.  I do not want to go into any detail on this because I shall probably cover it again.  The employers' portion, so far as men are concerned, is estimated to be £58,000 less; the workers' portion will be £58,000 more, which leaves no change on the male side.  For women the employers' portion will be £46,000 more, the workers' portion £23,000 less, which gives an overall change in the fund of £23,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to hear the Minister for Justice asking me to read Article 43 of the Constitution when I told him that Article 41 recognises the family as the natural, primary and fundamental unit group of society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.  I shall quote Article 43 for the Minister:</P>
      <P>1.  1º The State acknowledges that man, in virtue of his rational being has the natural right, antecedent to positive law, to the private ownership of external goods.</P>
      <P>2º The State accordingly guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish the right of private ownership or the general right to transfer, bequeath, and inherit property.</P>
      <P>2.  1º The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice.</P>
      <P>2º The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> I should like to know what the Minister meant when he told me to read Article 43 of the Constitution.  I think it was St. Ambrose who said that only unjust usurpation has created the right of private property.  I am wondering where we stand in regard to private property.  What I am saying is that the family unit is more important than anything else.  I fail to see the purpose of this Bill when, under the 1970 Housing Act, there is adequate provision against squatting in corporation tenant houses.  Squatting is not a problem in Dublin city at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>One hundred squatters in Dublin.  Those are the official figures I have.  Some of them are needy cases and cannot be moved yet.  I know of a few cases where the husbands are in prison and it is impossible to throw the wives and children out on the street.  The officials of the housing department have rightly adopted a sympathetic approach.  They have agreed to withhold action until the husbands in these cases are released from prison.  The attitude of the officials would not be called weak-kneed; it would be called Christian and sympathetic in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>The decision of Dublin Corporation to allow applicants on the waiting list into houses as soon as they became vacant was the answer to the problem. The main trouble about squatting in Dublin was that houses were left unoccupied for months.  People were constantly frustrated in inquiring about their cases.  They were told there were no houses.  They went around the areas, saw these houses vacant for months and because it seemed to them, in their ignorance, that Dublin Corporation were doing nothing about it, they sought to take the law into their own hands and they brought their wives and children with them into these houses and flats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an understandable situation when it is considered that people were <Col N="550" /> not getting satisfactory answers from the Dublin Corporation housing allocation department.  If the authorities concerned were a little more communicative and gave details as to what was happening people would be satisfied. On many occasions I asked the previous Minister for Local Government if Dublin Corporation would appoint a PRO to inform people of the numbers on the list, what their chances were and who exactly were being accommodated.  If that were done people would understand and be patient, and they would certainly not resort to illegal means to secure possession of houses.  This would solve the problem of squatting.</P>
    <P>I would not exonerate the Dublin County Council from criticism, because their communications are equally vague and non-committal as the Dublin Corporation allocation department's letters to representatives regarding individual applications for housing.  The usual letter is: &ldquo;... is listed and will be considered with others on the list.&rdquo;  I applied to the county council in respect of a person out at Shankhill who has four children and is living in a very small caravan.  The reply came back: &ldquo;He will be considered with others on the list&rdquo;.  This is no answer to such a person.  There is nothing more frustrating to public representatives or to the applicants themselves.  I have no doubt Deputy Joe Dowling will agree with me that this kind of answer is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation and other housing authorities throughout the country should take time on the radio, perhaps once a month, to give a true outline of the housing situation, who are being housed, what projects are coming up, how many houses or flats will be built in different areas.  This kind of information would be very helpful to applicants on housing lists and would prevent any abuse of the normal system such as squatting.</P>
    <P>With the existence of the relevant clause in the Housing Act, 1970 and if the housing authorities are more communicative, I cannot see any need for such a repressive measure as that which is before the House now.  If it is not <Col N="551" /> intended for those I have mentioned, I am wondering for whom it is intended. Is it intended for the tenants in private houses or in furnished flats?  It would appear that it is.  I am wondering what the tenant will do if he has no rights, if the landlord should change the lock on his door.  I remember a case up in Terenure where the landlord did not want to be bothered with the cost of a court order.  His men moved in and pulled down the outside wall of the tenant's flat and left him exposed to the weather, because he would not move out.  He also had the toilet removed.  Still the man held on.  His wife ended up in a mental hospital for four months, but the case went to court and luckily enough, there was some justice in so far as the court awarded the tenant damages against the landlord.</P>
    <P>If this is the intention of this Bill, to act against tenants who do not get out when their landlord thinks they should, then it certainly is not enlightened legislation. I hope the Minister will realise this and will ensure that this measure is not used repressively against the unfortunate tenants who occupy furnished flats in Dublin city, because they have few enough rights as it is.</P>
    <P>Then against whom is it intended&mdash; squatters in private houses?  Squatting has been going on for a very long time.  Christ's mother and father were squatters.  They were squatters in a stable because they could find no place to go.  Is this Bill intended against a woman with a baby who finds an empty room somewhere?  Are we giving powers to landlords and property developers who leave disused houses empty while awaiting planning permission, whereby a person who uses one of these rooms or a basement may be put in jail?</P>
    <P>Could we not alter or reform our civil law to facilitate the developers in some way?  Lewisham Council in London have come to an arrangement whereby squatters are tolerated provided they move out immediately the room or the house is required.  An arrangement like that would be a much more constructive approach to the problem.  I fail to see why this Bill <Col N="552" /> should be brought in to deal with unfortunate people like those I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Is this Bill directed against the student element in our society? Students who decide to have a sit-in in a lecture hall have no right to the property they are occupying.  Are they to be arrested if they have a sit-in? Sit-ins are a common form of protest and there is nothing wrong with that. They are a sign of our free society. They are taking place in Britain and on the Continent at the present time but I have not heard of repressive legislation being brought in to deal with these student elements there.</P>

      <P>I raised it because, to me anyway, this is a very badly drafted Bill and it certainly does not clarify the situation for us.</P>
      <P>Another group against which this Bill is directed is what the Minister calls &ldquo;quasi-political groups&rdquo;.  I made my view clear on these groups last night. I said the Housing Action Committee was a very good group because by their agitation they exposed the housing problem in Dublin City.  I was associated with them originally and I am proud to have been associated with them.  We had this <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude in Dublin: everything was all right; everyone was complacent but the homeless suffered in silence for too long.  The Housing Action Committee felt genuine concern for these people and they tried to highlight this problem. If it were not for them, very little would have been done because the housing construction programme had reached a state of stagnation.  Developers and speculators had grabbed the land.  Even when the Government did act they acted too late.  Groups like the Housing Action Committee should not be condemned too readily.</P>
      <P>I have had experience of student groups who demonstrated by squatting. I had Dr. Barnard over here as a guest and they squatted in a particular place in protest against him, and rightly so. He was very impressed by this and it was because of what they did that he made very profound statements condemning apartheid in South Africa.  He told me he was much enlightened by the opinion of these student groups.  It was very interesting that this happened. He condemned in no uncertain manner apartheid in South Africa.</P>

But the evicting party, under the command of the sheriff, will wear green uniform and the Harp without the Crown and the warrant turning you out on the roadside will be stamped with the arms of the Irish Republic.

      <P>I wonder if Deputy de Valera spoke on this.  If not, I certainly look forward to what he has to say.  Sometimes one can become so far removed from the stratum of society that is victimised that one forgets anything is wrong.  They say of some Deputies that they need a guide through their constituencies.  Perhaps if they were a little more familiar with some of the tragic cases that exist they might not be so complacent.  There are many wrongs in this country.  I would like to see constructive legislation introduced here, enlightened legislation, to remedy the social injustices.  This is not the first piece of repressive legislation we have had introduced.  I have explained that there is no purpose in this Bill and no justification for it.  I have even explained this to Deputy Dowling who was concerned about squatting by Dublin Corporation tenants.  I feel sure now he is convinced that there is no justification for action against Dublin Corporation squatters because it is no more a problem.  The squatting stopped when Dublin Corporation took effective measures by giving over the <Col N="558" /> tenancy of vacant houses more rapidly. It is not directed against those at all.  I am a little worried about the fact that it may be directed against the tenants of furnished flats.  The Minister assures us it is not.  I am speaking then about student groups and others.  I see no reason why we should have repressive measures against them.  I find nothing wrong in what they do.  I would defend their actions.</P>
      <P>We were perhaps a little too timid in our day in that we tolerated the existing order.  Had we had, in the 1930s, the student groups which exist today we would not have had the 1939-45 war.  Unfortunately, there was not enough protest.  There was not enough squatting.  We saw dictatorship take over the whole of Europe.  Do we want that again?  Would we rather condone repressive, dictatorial measures such as Hitler introduced?  Hitler introduced measures saying that there was fear all the time.  He got away with it on that score.  There were elements in society resisting law and order.  Little by little Hitler introduced more and more repressive legislation.  We saw the holocaust in Europe.  If Deputy de Valera feels worried about law and order in this country he should think of that point.  I am all in favour of all forms of protest.  They are not wrong.  I always stand up for the student groups and hippies.  They have stopped wars and they made President Nixon in America think twice about the situation in Vietnam.  President Nixon was certainly influenced by public opinion in America.  The vocal groups, such as the hippies and others who protested against war, influenced him.  In my discussions with many Americans I have convinced them of this fact.  We need more convincing.  All these people are concerned for others and do not wish to see wars.  They do not want to see people take advantage of others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incidents at Hume Street were caused by an unjust law which we had here.  There were appeals to the Minister. It was unjust to leave such a matter to the Minister when someone could appeal to him.  People felt genuinely concerned about this city and that is why they were squatting.  They brought pressure to bear on the Minister.  The <Col N="559" /> Minister who attacked the squatters was later to be seen at meetings calling for the preservation of Dublin Bay and other places.  I hope he was enlightened by the events at Hume Street.  The Minister begrudgingly admits here that there was justification for protest.  Protest in the form of squatting, sit-ins or fish-ins is very good.  I certainly condone it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde certainly moved me last night when he spoke about the Duke of Devonshire who was discommoded by a group.  I would like to meet the Duke of Devonshire and to tell him what I think of him.  He has large tracts of land.  I thought that when we won our freedom we were getting the land of this country for the people of this country. It appears that when the English left in 1921 they came back and bought up the land.  There are many large estates like the Carton estate.  This estate stretches for miles and miles.  It is terrible to see small farmers trying to eke out an existence on small farms, and to know that there are people with large estates like Carton who live in England.  When people protest against such a situation we want to put them in jail.  This is very unjust.  I would not condone it.  I would not condone this kind of repressive measure.  I am ashamed to think that we have a Government who would introduce this measure.  They have introduced such measures before.  They do not care about the family unit at all.  The Constitution means nothing to them.  The State recognises that the exercise of rights must be regulated by the principles of social justice.  This is important. This is what we should be talking about.  We should not be talking about bringing in repressive legislation.  We should be talking more and more about social justice for the weaker sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The Government did not bring in legislation when the company which I mentioned last week took over an entire road in Inchicore and demolished the houses.  The Government did not bring in legislation when the people were thrown out on the street.  The weaker sections of the community suffer if they dare to step out of line. <Col N="560" /> I hope each of you has a social conscience. Over there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Last week I did not see any measures being taken against the people who moved with the bulldozer and destroyed a little shack occupied by itinerants.  The Minister says that the Bill is not designed to deal with problems such as itinerants or homeless families who seek temporary shelter and that an exception is being made for them.  Last week a husband, wife and two children moved in on a piece of land and built themselves a little shack to protect them from the cold.  They were not given notice that their shack was to be destroyed by the bulldozer.  The bulldozer demolished the shack.  This happened in Ballyfermot.

      <P>A statement was made, and it was repeated in this House in an interruption, that that family was offered accommodation.  A statement was also made by an official of the county council that they have done everything, but this was denied by Mr. Bewley of the Itinerants' Settlement Committee.  He said they had not done enough and that, as a matter of fact, they were one of the worst councils in the country, the wealthiest but the worst.  It would be very wrong if that statement made by an official were to go unchallenged.  I do not believe the statement he made.  I am not prepared to believe it especially when two councillors on that same council deplored the incident and deplored the fact that the family were not being accommodated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said they refused a caravan.  They <Col N="562" /> were squatting in an ordinary old van when the child died, from exposure definitely.  When I spoke to them they were afraid they would be locked up for taking possession of an old disused van.  It is inhuman.  It is certainly un-Christian that this should happen. What happens to the like of these people if they build a little shack on a piece of land?  Has a person the right to come in with a bulldozer and demolish it?  Is there any protection against that?  Is there any protection against this monster the speculator, the land-developer who will not give them time or anything else?  Dare trespass on his property!</P>
    <P>We should be ashamed of ourselves that people are living in such inhuman conditions and that a life should have been lost due to the fact that a developer felt he had the right and the power and the might to demolish a little shack.  It is terrible that this should happen.  It amazes me that an official can make a statement to try to twist the truth.  It is a shame that there was not a greater outcry from the public.</P>
    <P>We must oppose every section of this Bill.  There is to be arrest without warrant.  We have not got anything like that here.  We had nothing like this before except in the Criminal Justice Bill which the Government tried to bring in.  In cases like this there is to be arrest without warrant.  If the Minister nods his head and says we do not know that there is arrest without warrant in normal simple cases, we must be living in a police State.  The only case I know of in which there is arrest without warrant is the case of political prisoners. They can go in and smash down the door on them, as I saw happening, and take out a man at 3 o'clock in the morning without warrant.  The Special Branch have that power.  It is wrong to have something like that included here.</P>
    <P>I see no purpose whatever in it.  It is not intended to be used against the Dublin Corporation squatter because that problem is non-existent today.  The Minister says it is not directed at tenants of furnished flats.  That is a simple civil matter between landlord and tenant.  Therefore, the only people against whom it is directed are these <Col N="563" /> student groups and quasi-political groups, whatever he means by that.  He has not named them.  I have named one and I say they served a useful purpose. I condemn this Bill and I will oppose it all the way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Lenehan Mr. J. Lenehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. I listened to the previous speaker.  I was a member of a county council before he was born, and that was not today or yesterday.  A great deal of blame has been placed on the Government but this is nonsensical because, in my opinion, the Government are not responsible for it at all.  It is up to the local authorities to provide houses.  Are we to go back to the type of law that existed in 1922 when the people on our side of the House could say: &ldquo;Thanks be to God the day has come when we can go up to So-and-So's house and take down his pig and have a good feed.&rdquo;  These were the very people who condemned that type of thing at that time.  Now they are back in Queer Street again, in the opposite direction.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker talked about the housing position in Dublin.  I remember Dublin in 1956-57.  In one small area there were 400 empty houses because everybody in this city at that time had to get out as fast as possible.  Would anybody here suggest for one moment that down in the country somebody could walk into a man's farm and take it over?  What is the difference?  Is there any difference between the two?  There must be some law.  Nobody has fought more for housing than I have.  While the last Deputy maintained that Dublin was the worst county in the world in relation to housing, I am afraid he has not gone very far west.  I am afraid my own county is even worse, but there are reasons for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it will be fired at the Government that the question of money arises but in Mayo the question of money did not arise.  The main problem there is that we cannot get contractors to take these houses.  I do not want to see anybody out in the cold. What goes on today is so stupid that it is incredible.  I see the itinerants along the road and it is very hard to <Col N="564" /> blame them for breaking into some house.</P>

      <P>If there are no houses then people have to try to find some type of shelter.  This is the problem. It is up to local authorities to build houses and if they do not take advantage of the facilities offered to them by the Government, then it is they who are to blame.  Those who come in here and rant and rail against this Bill are people who themselves have never been members of local authorities and they will not be Members of this House ever again if there is an election within the next 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never known any problem in Mayo about money for building houses. <Col N="565" /> I admit that if there were enough houses there would be no squatters. Deputies must have seen the questions I have put down here over the past 12 months.  It is hard to believe that a man, his wife and several children are living in what is nothing better than a drain alongside a road with an old piece of canvas for a roof.  I asked the Mayo authorities to provide tents, or something like that, for such people. They refused and the reason they gave for refusing was so brilliant that even I, daft as I am, could not fall for it; they said that tents would create a tremendous fire hazard.  The tents would be made of plastic, or something like that.  The existing structures are made of tar and canvas and they would go up in smoke inside two minutes.</P>
    <P>People come in here and blame the Government.  This is entirely due to the fact that they do not do their own homework and those who are members of local authorities do not do their duty as members of local authorities.  That is why the problem exists.  The Government are not responsible.  Mayo County Council has never been refused money by the Government.  I know that.  We have no problem with regard to people squatting in houses.  Our major problem is that we cannot get contractors; they are so well-off now they do not have to work any more.  It is very easy to come in here and make statements like some of the ones I make myself; the more outrageous the statements the more publicity one will get.  It is not easy to get one's name into the papers every day.</P>
    <P>Over the past 18 months we have wasted a lot of time here doing nothing, talking like Deputy O'Connell talked before he cleared out just now.  That is not fair to the public.  It is only wasting time.  It should not be allowed.  If local authorities are prepared to make the effort to build houses the Government do not frustrate them and I honestly believe that if we had officials who did their jobs properly, there would be no necessity for this Bill.  I agree with some of those who said there should be no necessity for this Bill.  If we continue to allow people to walk into houses and take them over, then the day is not far distant when, in the West of Ireland <Col N="566" /> and other places, people will walk in and take over farms.</P>
    <P>I do not think any Dublin man or Labour man would worry very much about that.  The Labour people know the answer they got in the West.  Certainly, the number of people in labour in the West of Ireland are only a few lassies that were in hospital, wives, and when they came out they were out of labour, of course, but it is just as simple as that.  I doubt if the people on the opposite benches would in any way disagree with this Bill because they are the most conservative people in the world.  At the time when they said the Sinn Féin fellows were pulling down the boyos' pigs in the west of Ireland and whipping them out of the houses, they were the boys who tried to enforce and tighten the law, no question about it.</P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong with this Bill.  I do not want to see my property taken over by anybody nor do I think there is any Deputy here who wants to see his property taken over without making a bargain over it.  I do not think there is anybody on any side who would want that except the pseudo-socialists of the Labour Party who are prepared to take over anything and to pay for nothing. I support the Bill.</P>

Neither would I condone the situation that brought this about&mdash;the Government's failure to provide houses.  That is the root cause of all this.  It is a sad situation that we find ourselves with the affluent society &mdash;I would be more inclined to say the effluent society.

I have seen the dreadful conditions under which people live and to cause trouble of this kind is the last thing they would do, but if you create a climate in which these unfortunates can be used to highlight the position, they may jump the queue.  It would be unfair if queue-jumpers were left in possession but we should rather remove the root cause of the trouble.  I should like to see the position in which we had 400 houses to spare, as other speakers said we had at one time.  I should like to see the position again in which people would have houses and would not have to break in, in which the doors would be open for them.  If a Minister can build a £22,000 dream house at Castleknock, with the Phoenix Park in the foreground, this is the whole cause&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall not make any reference to the characteristic remarks of Deputy Lenehan except to say that if he thinks Deputies on the Labour benches had designs on his extensive interests in the licensed trade he would be guilty of an even greater degree of <Col N="568" /> stupidity than is usually ascribed to him.</P>
      <P>The nub of this Bill concerns the use of force.  Section 1 says: &ldquo;Forcibly means using or threatening to use force in relation to person or property, and for this purpose participation in action or conduct with others in numbers or circumstances calculated to prevent by intimidation the exercise by any person of his rights in relation to any property...&rdquo; This would constitute a threat to use force.</P>
      <P>If I may be philosophical for a moment the two concepts in that opening statement are that of force and that of right.  What precisely is force?  This is supposed to be a free and democratic society but I should have thought that the political system which separated husband and wife would be held to be guilty of an act of force.  I should have thought that a political system which condemned over one million of our people to leave the country because they had no alternative over the last 40 years or so was a system resting on force rather than on right.  I should have thought that a system which compelled people to live marginally above, and in some cases, substantially below the bread line was a system of force.  It behoves this system very ill that it should rise in its dignity here, in the person of the Minister for Justice, and bring forward the entire spectacle of the forcible working of the law to prevent the physical expression of a particular form of poverty, to wit, squatting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often it is stated, particularly at election times, that ours is a free society in which force does not occur and a comparison is made with communistic societies where force allegedly does occur.  I remember listening some years ago to a leading politician, who for many years was one of the most prominent statesmen in this House, delivering a most moving peroration about circumstances in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.  He was quoting an ex-prisoner of a concentration camp.  He said&mdash;I speak from memory&mdash;she had declared that of all the deprivations she felt in Russia one stood out above the rest, not the deprivation of movement, political expression, <Col N="569" /> party politics or the deprivation attendant on censorship, not all these forcible actions, but the deprivation, as she put it, of the right to cry alone.</P>
    <P>I wonder in this free society of ours how many of the people who live in the overcrowded conditions, to which so many speakers have referred, possess that most fundamental right&mdash;to cry alone.  Many of my constituents certainly do not possess it.  Many of my constituents, young couples occupying the parlour room of two-bedroomed houses in Cabra have to wait until the television set is turned off before they can go to bed together, if the House will permit so precise a crudity.  Do they possess the right to cry alone?  I do not think so.  Therefore, my contention at the outset is that these people are victims&mdash;whether they are organised by professional agitators or not, is, at this point irrelevant&mdash;of a society which rests upon force and deprivation. In response to this deprivation some of them go outside the law.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the circumstances under which people may be provoked to go outside the law.  It is as dangerous for themselves as for the society which they challenge.  It is not something which anyone of us does lightly. Of course, for us who are in comfort to go outside the law is to drink after hours or park next to a double yellow line.  If you are homeless and destitute, and, perhaps, with one or two children, it is much more terrifying to go outside the law.  Is it then ever permissible to go outside the law?  It was permissible in this country one time to go outside the law.  There was a rule of law which was enshrined in many Acts passed on by successive English Parliaments some of which, as Deputy O'Connell pointed out, still weigh upon our under-privileged people.  Yet, even though that law existed there were people in 1916 and later who felt that it was within the bounds of moral justification to exceed that law and to take the consequences&mdash;not, as I say, an easy decision.</P>
    <P>I am not being so dramatic as to suggest that the plight of the homeless family in Dublin is an exact parallel with the plight of an exploited nation in 1916, but it is an approximate <Col N="570" /> parallel and it brings out the point I want to make.  One of the oldest points in the whole history of the development of free politics, one of the oldest points in the history of the development of the medieval Catholic ideas to which so many of us are supposed to subscribe is that the law should have behind it not merely the force of the State but also something of value, something which can be recognised to be true and be accepted.  Where the law does not possess such value countless generations of men&mdash;men in many cases sanctified now by history&mdash;have urged that the law can then be broken. Let us then examine our consciences upon the exercise in which we are engaged, the bringing down of the sledgehammer of this Bill to try to destroy what is an outcrop of an unjust and, for that reason, forcible system. Deputy Gallagher said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>To say that a person without a home is legally entitled to steal possession of a home and that he is not guilty and is not amenable is like saying that a hungry man can walk into a shop any day of the week and steal because he is hungry.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Noel Browne, who is very often right, pointed out that this precise principle that the hungry man can steal is enshrined in the teachings of Saint Thomas Aquinas, who is still regarded as the dominant doctor of the Catholic Church.  It is quite clear that however closely Deputy Gallagher may have studied the planning Act he has not studied the <i>Summa Theologica.</i></P>
    <P>This Bill seems, as so many other Bills brought before the House seem to me, to be an attempt to provide a legal remedy for an effect without examining its cause.  In this way it seems to me essentially Victorian&mdash;let us outlaw vice, let us outlaw crime, but let us not seek its causes.  One after another these repressive Bills come before the House.  Even during my brief career here I have seen this Bill, the re-introduction of the second Part of the Offences against the State Act and now the promise of the re-introduction in some form of a Criminal Justice Bill. Would it not be better to look to the <Col N="571" /> root causes which bring about these situations?  The unnecessary force of this Bill is tantamount in moral terms to hanging a man for stealing sheep instead of inquiring why he is hungry in the first place.  I am afraid that an awful lot of legislation emanating from this Government bears the mark of a hasty and oppressive determination to remedy the consequences of a system without seeking in any way to change or improve it.</P>
    <P>We have heard much, not surprisingly, and specifically from the Minister and from Deputy Gallagher, about the respective rights of public and private ownership.  It is not necessary to be a Marxist revolutionary socialist to believe that there are many circumstances in which the right of private ownership must give way to the rights of public ownership.  On this point the Constitution has been quoted correctly several times and may I quote a section which I think has not been quoted before, a section about the directive principles of social policy?  Article 45, paragraph 2 states:</P>
    <P>The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing</P>
    <P>(i)  That the citizens (all of whom, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood) may through their occupations find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs.</P>
    <P>(ii)  That the ownership and control of the material resources of the community may be so distributed among private individuals and the various classes as best to subserve the common good.</P>
    <P>The common good may not be thought much of here but, of course, these directive principles of social policy were wisely made the only portions of the Constitution which were not enforcible in law.  If they were, very few of us would be sitting in these benches today. I could cite the democratic programme in support of the view that this individual property which this Bill cherishes so much may at times be set aside by the needs of the people, needs such as we see today.  Let me, above all, quote <Col N="572" /> Patrick Pearse in his last great writing &ldquo;The Sovereign People&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>The right to the control of the material resources of a nation does not reside in any individual or in any class of individuals it resides in the whole people.  It is for the nation to determine to what extent private property may be held by its members, and in what items of the nation's material resources private property shall be allowed.</P>
    <P>I wonder what Deputy Gallagher would make of that in the party of republicanism. Again:</P>
    <P>A nation may, for instance, determine as the free Irish nation determined and enforced for many centuries, that private ownership shall not exist in land, that the whole of a nation's soil is the public property of the nation.</P>
    <P>Pearse concludes that passage by saying:</P>
    <P>I do not disallow the right to private property but I insist that all property is held subject to the national sanction.</P>
    <P>Let us compare that stirring language, language of the supreme founder more than anyone else of this State, with the language of the Bill.  It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;owner&rdquo;, in relation to land, includes the lawful occupier, every person lawfully entitled to the immediate use and enjoyment of unoccupied land...</P>
    <P>It goes on:</P>
    <P>The doing of an act, which, if done by the owner of an incorporeal hereditament, would be an exercise of a right that is the subject of or attached to the hereditament shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed, in relation to the hereditament, to constitute an entry and an occupation of land.</P>
    <P>I know that these are legal figments and do not mean precisely what they are set out to be but I wonder what Pearse, the <i>quondam</i> lawyer who abandoned the practice of law because he found that kind of terminology uncongenial, would make of this great defence of private property. <Col N="573" /> To turn specifically to squatting.  I know of no family, and I have known many families of squatters, who have entered into the act of squatting lightly.  It is a desperate remedy for a desperate tragedy.  If any Deputy thinks that an impoverished family lightly or cheerfully takes the bits and pieces of furniture it has accumulated over the early years of marriage, breaks into a house and sets the pots and pans and the few little things that it owns around that house&mdash;that decaying tenement in many cases, or that mausoleum about to be offered up as an image of the new society in which we live&mdash;just as one of us would move from Ballsbridge to Foxrock or <i>vice versa</i>&mdash;he knows little about life.  I make little defence here of squatting in corporation houses.  I think given the strictures imposed upon the corporation system of allocation the corporation on the whole do the best job they can.  I do not defend the system of allocation but within it the corporation do the best job they can.  In my opinion a prospective tenant who jumps the queue is acting indefensibly even though he is driven by an intense urgent need.  On the other hand, I have considerable sympathy for those people who see property lying idle while speculators buy up the rest of the terrace.  I have sympathy for those homeless people who see this happening and who, consequently, squat; we should recognise their plight and not seek to persecute them for it.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill that touches particularly on the experience of urban Deputies&mdash;I am not saying exclusively, but it affects them to a considerable extent.  Many cases have come to my attention in my brief career as a Deputy which fully bear out the horrific picture of our mid-Victorian system of house allocation painted by Deputy O'Connell last night.  I am sick and tired and depressed, more than anything else in my career as a Deputy, by the housing situation.  People come to me night after night looking for houses and all I can say to them is: &ldquo;There is no hope for you.  You have only got one child, you will not be considered by the corporation.&rdquo;  Sometimes I tell them: &ldquo;You have only two children. You are extremely unlikely to be considered by the corporation.&rdquo;  There are <Col N="574" /> so many of these cases that it is pointless to go into them at length.</P>
    <P>I will give one example.  A two-bedroomed house at Cabra is occupied by a husband and wife, two children, the wife's three brothers and the wife's mother.  They are spread out in the house in the following way: the young woman, the two children, her mother and her brother of 14 are in one room and her two brothers, aged 21 and 28 years, are in the back room.  The husband left ultimately because he could not stand it any longer.  The response I got to a request to rehouse this family was as follows:</P>
    <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>With reference to your letter of 14th January, 1971, regarding the application for housing accommodation for Mr. X., I desire to inform you that he is registered as a family of four persons living in overcrowded conditions.  His name is on the housing list for a flat in any area and he will be notified when his turn is reached.</P>
    <P>I have to take this letter to him and tell him I am sorry but I do not make the rules.  Could anyone blame that husband and wife and their two children if they squat?  How can we blame them and put down their motivation for squatting to the Dublin Housing Action Committee, Sinn Féin, the Labour Party, communism, Maoism or anything else?  Put it down to naked hunger, squalor and exploitation and place it on your consciences where it belongs.</P>
    <P>I have here another case of a family in my area.  It is a family with two children and they are expecting a third child.  They occupy one room.  In another bedroom the wife's two sisters, aged 15 and 21 years, live and in the third are her mother, father and 24 year old brother.  I wonder if those people have the right to cry alone which allegedly is denied to people in Soviet Russia about which we hear so much.  I do not blame these people if they squat and, with Deputy O'Connell, I stand with them, rather than against them.  I consider that the law and the process of parliamentary legislation could better be promoted <Col N="575" /> towards ameliorating their appalling lot rather than providing the end punishments, comparable to the transportation of 150 years ago, for their crime of wanting a house in which to live.</P>
    <P>In this debate much has been made, and correctly so, of the Constitution and more particularly of those articles in the Constitution which provide for the primacy of the family.  This is something we hear very much about in this country and in particular is often thrown at members of these benches. At election times we are barracked at every dyke and ditch throughout the country about our alleged addiction to contraception, abortion, divorce, and so on.  This alleged addiction is supposed to fly in the teeth of the pristine virtues of the Irish Catholic people which rest so secure in the hands of our present Government.  There is much hypocrisy in this country but I do not think there has been a more blinding piece of hypocrisy than our alleged view of marriage and the family.</P>
    <P>Article 41.3 states:</P>
    <P>1º The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the family is founded, and to protect it against attack.</P>
    <P>2º No law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage.</P>
    <P>Article 41.1.1º recognises the family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of society.  No law should be enacted to provide for the dissolution of a marriage or the disruption of a family but it is obvious that a system is permitted to do this.  I have many cases of families where the husbands and wives are separated because they cannot find accommodation and the corporation, with their present priorities, cannot entertain applications for families with one or two children.</P>
    <P>I have a case here of a family with one child who live in one room.  The mother and father and their five children, of mixed sexes aged from 21 to 14 years, live in the other room. In addition to all this the young child suffers from hydrocephalus.  The reply <Col N="576" /> received to their application for accommodation is that Mr. X is listed as a family of four persons and his application will be duly considered when accommodation becomes available any place on the north side.  It is not surprising that the husband has left that house.</P>
    <P>I have another case which is supported by a letter from the parish priest of the Church of the Precious Blood in Cabra.  The husband and wife are separated because of lack of accommodation.  The wife lives with her one child with her parents and the husband lives with his parents.  The history of understandable bickering and fighting culminated in the departure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to do so.  I think my point has been made and I will conclude with a case of a similar family.  In this case the wife suffers from poliomyelitis in one leg.  The family have one child and have been refused accommodation.  This brings me to the hypocrisy of the set-up that leads to this Bill.  The reply that was received from the Dublin Corporation in this case was that the application was being recorded and the wife was told she should advise the office of any change in her family size.  In other words, if this family have more children, thereby rendering their circumstances more miserable than they are at the moment, the corporation may then consider that family for rehousing.  The message of the Scripture to increase and multiply is certainly the argument put forward by the corporation.  It is useless for a family to go to them if they have only <Col N="577" /> one child; however bad their housing conditions they must produce more children and eventually the corporation may listen to them.</P>
      <P>Is it any wonder we have the large number of deserted wives, in addition to the quite considerable amount of squatting?  Is it any wonder that we have, as Deputy Dr. Browne once described it, the simplest divorce system in the world&mdash;the price of a single ticket to England?  This is the social cancer that will be cured by this piece of paper here which empowers the Executive to take steps outside the ordinary process of law to coerce the victims of their system, the victims who have rebelled against it by the act of squatting.  I think I have made my point: see the evil and root it out&mdash; and I used biblical terms&mdash;rather than produce patchwork efforts to try to cure it.  You will never cure the problem of squatting by imprisoning the squatters.</P>
      <P>Let me turn to a spot of exegesis on the Bill itself.  I should like to take up a point which has been made by others. Reference was made here to the fact that requests to leave the land or a vehicle, for example, in section (2) (b) should be made by a member of the Garda Síochána in uniform.  Then section (6) (a) says an offence is committed by a person who, upon being requested, either by the owner of the land or vehicle to which the offence relates or by a member of the Garda Síochána in uniform, to leave the land or vehicle, fails to do so.  Dare we hope, from the fact that the garda must be in uniform&mdash;and I address this question directly to the Minister&mdash; that we are leaving the day when licensed private armies in plain clothes can be let loose upon people who, for better or for worse decisions, squat?</P>
      <P>Much has been said about section 4 of the Bill.  A novel principle seems to be introduced, the principle of collective guilt.  Subsection 2 reads:</P>
      <P>Where a statement in contravention of subsection (1) of this section is made by or on behalf of a group of persons, each member of the group shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does this mean that if Deputy O'Connell incited someone to squat in <Col N="578" /> a house in Inchicore I must immediately place an advertisement in the newspapers dissociating myself from his action?  It is a rather strange suggestion. I do not understand it and I should like the Minister to address his attention to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening speech, made reference to quasi-political groups.  I think some of these political groups may occasionally have participated in acts in defiance of the law, but I wonder if the Minister really understands precisely how the dictatorships come about in other countries through quasi-political groups?  It is most often because they have been provoked by legislation of this kind.  Every time a free democracy steps outside the normal frame of reference of law, which I discussed at the outset of my remarks, and proposes coercive legislation of this kind it fans the flames of ultimate social discontent.</P>
    <P>If I were a communist bent upon the destruction of this whole society I would view measures like this with intense gratification.  I would view the re-introduction of section 2 of the Offences against the State Act with great gratification.  I would view the prospect of a Criminal Justice Bill with great gratification, knowing that each of these provocative pieces of legislation would bring more and more people to my side.  This sort of Bill, by going outside what is normal in a free system, encourages those who wish not to amend society but to destroy it.  Let us not fall into that pit here.</P>
    <P>Let me reiterate one point.  The injustices in our society, the sorrows in our society, will not be altered by legislation of this kind.  Even if this Bill goes through it will remain true that landlords and landladies in the city of Dublin will not take any families with even one child into private lettings. This will remain true in our Christian State.  As the Minister's late uncle remarked on a famous occasion: &ldquo;Christian charity how are you.&rdquo; There is devil a bit of Christian charity in the Irish landlord, where a young married couple with one or two children are concerned.  They will not be taken in by private landlords.  They cannot be housed by the corporation. <Col N="579" /> Where are they to go?  Let us beware that some of them do not walk in and sit down on that carpet in front of us and show us up for what we are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Thornley, I as a Deputy representing Dublin city can see the cause of squatting. It is here that the Minister or if not this Minister another Minister should have taken some action, other than to put people in jail for something for which the Government were responsible.  In the city of Dublin, as long as I know it, there have been bad housing conditions.  Dublin Corporation are building the lowest number of houses in the city of Dublin they have ever built to cure this ill.  Any houses being built at the moment are being built by private enterprise.  In other words, the Department of Local Government, through the Corporation, are doing nothing to help the situation.  We still bring in laws to make sure that any person who protests is imprisoned.</P>
      <P>In 1965 or 1966 a Bill was introduced in this House whereby a person could demolish a house without permission. Many speculators bought property and knocked it down before they applied to the corporation at all.  Many of these houses were habitable, and for two years the then Deputy Dillon continually asked Deputy Boland, the then Minister for Local Government, to change the legislation.  He refused and refused until a certain section of the developers who were Fianna Fáil supporters had the work done, and then he brought in a Bill.  As I say, many of these houses were habitable but they were blocked up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also the situation of houses falling down in Dublin.  Two people were killed and from that date on even habitable houses were demolished in the centre of the city.  I know many cases where husbands and wives with two children living in one room cannot get a house.  They must produce a birth certificate for a third child before they will be considered. As Deputy Thornley said, they must be poverty-stricken and be living in dire straits before they can get accommodation. If a person tries to rent accommodation he will pay up to £7 <Col N="580" /> per week for a room.  On a wage of £17 or £18 a week it is impossible to pay that, particularly if bus fares are added.  These are the reasons why people go on the streets.</P>
    <P>Everybody is for law and order.  I see nothing wrong with a peaceful march or protest.  Fianna Fáil have often said here: &ldquo;We will do as we like.  The people elected us.&rdquo;  They do as they like, but there are many things which they do that the people do not like. How are these people to protest? Fianna Fáil will not listen unless they protest on the streets.  In the case of the Hume Street affair nothing was done until the protestors created ructions at the door.  It was only then that we got something from the Government.  I am against people who protest just for the sake of it, who join in a protest for the sport of it, like those the Minister mentioned in his speech.  These quasi-political groups should have been arrested at many functions by his predecessor. They were on guard in O'Connell Street in Dublin and nothing was done about it.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to undertake an immediate examination of the system of differential rents, particularly in relation to the hardship and injustices caused by the implementation of the B scale in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was endeavouring to explain that as well-intentioned as those who conceived the system of differential rents may have been much of the good intent has been defeated by the fact that the operation of the system is trimmed to suit bureaucratic convenience and accordingly it quite frequently creates as many family problems as it was intended to solve.  It is often the cause of family rows.  It sets off misunderstandings between husbands and wives.  It causes <Col N="581" /> grave disputes between parents and their children.  It is possible, with a little good will on the part of the public authority, to devise a fairer system.</P>
      <P>Nobody here is suggesting, certainly the tenants are not suggesting, that they should get housing accommodation without payment of a fair charge for it. I think it is possible to amend the schemes so that there is no loss of revenue to the local authorities concerned or to the State, but there is a more equitable distribution of the load. I suggest the Minister set up a committee, commission, council or some other body to inquire into the whole operation of the system of differential rents.  Without speaking disrespectfully of other councils and commissions of inquiry, I believe many of them have sat on problems of far less importance than the issue of differential rents which affects over 100,000 families, many of them in a grievous way, to the great detriment of the family welfare.</P>
      <P>On that inquiry I suggest there should be a representative of the tenants, a qualified social worker acquainted with the many problems created by the system of differential rents, a representative of the Minister for Local Government, a representative from at least one local authority&mdash;possibly Dublin Corporation as it is the largest local authority landlord&mdash;and, as the system of differential rents is, in effect, a tax, there should also be a representative of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of the trouble arises because the differential rents system which is supposed to be a system of charging and collecting rents which would be a direct reflection on people's income, is not operated that way.  The PAYE system of income tax was brought in because the Revenue Commissioners acknowledged that a system whereby income tax was levied twice a year caused many problems and created great difficulties in collection, not only for the individual, who had the burden imposed on him, but also for the public authority.  Similarly, as I said last night much of the trouble arises here because people are required to pay a higher rent based upon a <Col N="582" /> higher income which they were receiving at an earlier date.  If a scheme could be devised whereby a person could be assessed at the time he is being paid a higher salary and be charged and have the money collected at that time, then the immense arrears which are so often imposed would not arise.</P>
    <P>One of the great difficulties, and I am sure the Minister must be aware of this, is that people sometimes receive bills from local authorities running into two or even three figures without any explanation as to the manner in which the bill has been assessed.  It is no answer to say that a tenant when he goes into the house will receive a detailed statement as to how the differential rent is to be calculated.  I, with respect, suggest that every local authority should be under statutory obligation, when assessing the rent, to furnish a statement showing precisely the manner in which it has been assessed, what allowances have been given, and what proportion of the income is being made taxable.  This is something the Revenue Commissioners must do when they are assessing income tax.</P>
    <P>It must also be done by private landlords, who under the Rent Restrictions Act, cannot charge an increased rent to tenants without spelling out in a statutory form precisely what the basic rent is, the percentage increase for rates, the percentage increase for repairs, improvements and so forth.  Any tenant who receives a notice from a private landlord without these detailed particulars is entitled to refuse to pay.  It is extraordinary that legislators and their advisers are unable to devise an easy system for the calculation of rents.  The rent restrictions code is supposed to operate so that tenants of private landlords cannot have exorbitant rents imposed on them.  It is also supposed to operate in such a way that tenants may know what rent they have to pay. The truth is that the rent restrictions code is so intricate that neither tenant nor landlord know what the proper rent is without consulting a solicitor. Even solicitors have found it beyond them and have had to consult accountants.</P>
    <P>The differential rents system is not much better.  The only difference is that it is not calculated in percentages <Col N="583" /> except for the assessment of one-sixth of certain figures.  This is particularly difficult for people, who do not have an advanced educational standard, such as unskilled labourers, who left school at 14 years of age.  I would urge the Minister to have a word with local authorities to ensure that there is a much better system of communication so that when rents are charged tenants are given a clear and detailed statement of how the rent has been charged.</P>
    <P>We cannot leave this issue of differential rents without considering what is the main cause for the fantastically high rents which now operate on the higher scale of differential rents.  The fact is that the ceiling of differential rents has jumped by leaps and bounds far beyond the cost of building the houses or the interest rates or the load of taxation.  The principal jump of all costings has been in the ceiling of differential rents.</P>
    <P>This has arisen because under the Fianna Fáil Government we are paying a much smaller contribution from the national Exchequer to local authorities to subsidise the cost and the interest charged on housing loans.  In fact, at the present time we have the smallest contribution from the national Exchequer towards housing of any European country.  That is a deplorable situation when one considers that this country has more decrepit old houses than any other comparable country in Europe.  Our present system is so devised that it acts as a disincentive to local authorities to build houses because every new house that they build imposes an additional charge on the local revenue, a charge which the differential rents system itself acknowledges is beyond the capacity of the majority of tenants to pay.  If the Minister is not disposed to amend the system in the reasonable way that many of us have suggested, if he is not disposed to have an inquiry or to set up some committee to look into the matter, I would urge upon him then at least to do what he is in duty bound to do and that is to ensure that his colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Government give a much larger contribution from national revenue towards the cost <Col N="584" /> of housing so that our people, in our time, and without having to marry early and breed like rabbits and contract a contagious disease, may be housed in decent housing befitting their dignity and their rights as human beings.</P>

      <P>Our motion simply requests the Minister to examine this whole question to see whether we are right in our claim that the differential rents system is causing immense dissatisfaction or whether, in fact.  the Minister is right in his assertion that there is no dissatisfaction and that people, by and large, are quite happy and satisfied with the way things are.</P>
      <P>We would be reminded in many quarters of the Government Party that Jim Larkin was the person who first lent his weight behind the idea of differential rents and its essential equity as a fair and simple means of ensuring that justice is done in the matter of paying rents, but like many things which may be perfect in theory in actual practice contention arises.  Anybody who has any local authority tenants in his constituency is aware, if he is to believe his ears, of a great deal of hardship, worry and anxiety caused by the method of levying rent in the various local authorities.  In the past year we have had enough inquiries into this and that.  There is, in fact, one going ahead at the moment in the Dáil itself.  Surely in regards to a problem of which there is so much evidence with so many people talking about the worry it causes them, a request for an inquiry is a request worthy of serious consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Department of Local Government is one which has registered defeat on several fronts over the last few years.  The previous incumbent of the office of Minister for Local Government admitted his total failure to control the price of building land.  He and his predecessor, Deputy Blaney, showed evidence that they were both under the impression that people in local authority houses were somehow not paying economic rents.  They both expressed this view at various times and left no doubt in anybody's mind that they were exponents of a new rent policy for local authority housing. <Col N="585" /> a rent policy which they described as making it more economic, a rent policy which in practice increased the amount of rent of local authority houses.  This was the actual result of their belief in more economic rents. When one took away the wrapping of their various proposals in this area what was left was a move for increased rents based on their supposition that local authority tenants were not paying economic rents.  This, of course, is the <i>raison d'etre</i> for the present differential rents system.  It is an attempt to continue putting up these rents.  The maximum is moving ever upwards, and it is the obscurity of the manner of assessing the rent and the manifest unfairness of its working out in practice, which is causing most concern.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have mentioned the problem of overtime being included in the assessment of rent.  This has the effect that one may be paying one's rent at what one thinks is the weekly rate but some months later one gets a note from the corporation saying that one is in arrears.  One is in arrears because on calculation they find that one's bonus over a particular period means that one's rent has gone up.  One may, at the end of a few months, find oneself saddled with a bill for £20 or £30 to be paid as soon as possible. These amounts may appear small and derisory perhaps to many professional people but how a bill for £20 or £30 coming out the clouds is to be paid is a real problem for many families.</P>
    <P>I recall the NATO speaking especially about the large flat schemes in Ballymun and so on where people, in fact, as a result of the mysterious manner of working out the rent and unforeseen debts arising were being caused grave anxiety and that it was not any exaggeration to say that suicide attempts were made in several cases. This is not an exaggeration.  There have been such attempts and NATO themselves if the Minister will meet them could give him actual case histories. Deputy Dowling is smiling but if he has authentic files on the rent problems of people he will know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that, in fact, it has brought about this attitude on the part of tenants, extreme anxiety leading in certain cases of severe financial trouble to suicide attempts.  It certainly has led&mdash;and this may cause Deputy Dowling to smile again&mdash;to the breakup of many families.  He probably is aware of that also from his files.  It has caused husbands to depart to England or abroad without any notice, to go away because they no longer have the courage to face a mound of financial problems.  Where human beings are involved in such grave hardship, where debts appear to come at intervals of every three months or so based on the bonus earnings of the husband, where such a scheme in its operation, while in theory it might appear to be just, causes such hardship, there is surely a strong case to be made for an inquiry into it.</P>
      <P>Most industrial workers will admit their incomprehension of the manner in which their wages are made up each week.  There are three or four different criteria used in the assessment of any man's wage packet in any one week. If he is baffled by the assessment of his weekly salary the bafflement is equally great in regard to the manner in which rent is assessed on his income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic departmental feeling on the whole thing is that local authority tenants are getting away with murder. There is an illusion in the official mind that there are people who are being subsidised and should not be in that category of housing.  This is obviously the root of the Department's approach to differential rents.  This is the motivation which makes the Department unreceptive to the idea of having an inquiry into this area.  The Department's mind is already closed on this, already made up that in fact the present rent system must be stiffened.  Though this differential rent system will apply to all new tenancies there is a popular illusion that these rents do not amount to much.  In fact they can at present amount to one-third of a man's average weekly earnings.  Such amounts <Col N="587" /> of rents are being paid in respect of flats which do not approximate to standards which we would all desire in housing in 1971.  This applies to all new tenancies occurring in any part of the city area.  It means that in many cases people are paying rents which compared with the amounts being paid for other forms of housing&mdash;and this for a standard of flat which is by no means up to that available in 1971&mdash; for other categories of persons are very high.</P>
    <P>We ask that the Minister should consult with NATO, see from the tenants' organisation what would be the appropriate way of getting ahead with this inquiry, consult with the local authorities. Dublin Corporation itself is well aware, the Rents Section especially, of the kind of cases coming to them week in week out.  We had an inquiry last year into the Seven Days programme on money lending.  Evidence was given to that tribunal that much of the quest for loans arose out of the demand to meet rent commitments.</P>
    <P>This is a social problem, where a piece of legislation may have to be reviewed.  We did it in the case of the Constitution two years ago.  I would say that there is a case for an examination of the differential rents method and that we should go ahead and set up this inquiry.  If it merely serves to inform the Minister and his officials of the true state of affairs among local authority tenants it will have served its purpose.  We do not suggest that the whole idea of the differential system of payment should be scrapped but we certainly question certain features of the present system of levying rent, the idea that the earnings of all members of the family be involved in the assessment of rent, how exactly this affects the family structure itself, the whole philosophy, in fact, of a means test.  While in theory the ability to pay should perhaps be the criterion the fact is that ability to pay and the criterion of a means test appear to operate only at one end of the incomes scale.  It appears that the bureaucracy flourishes chiefly at the expense of the lower income groups.  It appears that those people with least money need the <Col N="588" /> most examination to see what they do with the little they have; those with the most money are most free of surveillance by the society in which they operate.  Those who have the cash to speculate in land and housing go without the attention of inspectors or any recognition by the Department of Local Government.  The Department, in the last incumbent's words, declares itself powerless to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>We have a study group now set up by the present Minister.  Of course I do not subscribe to the view that the present Minister is an energetic go-getter. The present Minister, in my view, has shown his chief talent in geting his image on our national press, radio and television.  This does not mean the same thing to me as actually getting down to the job.  However, that may be an old-fashioned view of what Ministers should do.  Perhaps the Minister understands the power of public relations to be a more important asset in holding on to his job than doing any work.  He may be right in that.  I do not know.</P>

      <P>It does not bother me in the least.  I do not know whether it bothers the Minister's colleagues in the Cabinet but it does not bother me.  There is plenty of space for both of us.</P>
      <P>I am making the point that here is an area where real work lies in store for a Minister who is serious about it. It is not an area where one can get one's PRO to put out a puff image for a few weeks and then, as in the case of cars being withdrawn from the centre of Dublin, the plan evaporates.  Here is a real case of hardship.  Here are people who are not interested in seeing the Minister's photograph.  They are far more interested in seeing the Minister set up an inquiry.  They are far more interested in meeting the Minister with his officials to tell him exactly what the facts of their problems are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is in need of such information, coming as he does from a wide expansive rural constituency, and possibly not being so well aware of the intensity of feeling on this matter, and <Col N="589" /> probably not being so well aware of the urban context of this problem and the way it presents itself in large blocks of flats.  Here is ample scope for the Minister to reverse the dismal record of his predecessor by setting up an inquiry to see if there is a problem.</P>
    <P>If one is young in a job one does not have to take the advice of veteran officials in one's Department that things are best left the way they are. If he is anxious about carving out a career which would seem to express his commitment to social justice, I would commend the Minister to this area right away.  Here is an issue which calls for attention and which calls for an inquiry.  It need not be a very expensive inquiry.  We are making no demands for High Court judges or for any commitment as to the personnel needed.  We merely say the matter should be investigated and then the result should lead either to action on the part of the Department or leaving things as they are at present.</P>
    <P>We say that things are bad at present and here we disagree with the official viewpoint.  Things are bad. This is not like a Minister for Agriculture talking about the feelings of the farmers and blowing away the problems as if they did not exist. From our own contact with tenants, we know there is real dissatisfaction about the way rents are levied in local authority housing at present.  Tenants are not ideal material for agitation. They are not people who are ready to form picket lines at the drop of a hat.  They are ordinary hard-working people.  They have more problems on their minds than marching up and down the streets, or putting placards on buildings, or anything like that. That they were driven into some of the disputes we have seen over the past year is ample testimony of their feeling of frustration because of the way things are going under this differential rent scheme.</P>
    <P>If we do nothing I cannot see the dissatisfaction disappearing; I cannot see the frustrations disappearing; I cannot see the hardships disappearing. None of us would like to see a whole category of people having to take steps which will break the law according to the legislation we are now being <Col N="590" /> asked to pass.  As I understand it, such is the temper amongst the tenants at present that, if nothing is done about it, and if there is not evidence of official concern this will happen.  So far there has been no evidence of any official concern.  The official side is adamant in its belief that nothing is wrong and certain in the belief that the system of levying rents is fair.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the view of the people at the other end, the lower income groups, is different.  Their view is that something is very gravely wrong.  We do not deny that rents must bear a certain relationship to the cost of living. Whether this means that the method by which rent was paid 20 years ago is appropriate to how it should be paid in 1971 and that the method of levying it should be the same is an interesting question and one that merits examination.  It has been said to me that we have a higher incidence of married women being forced to work as a result of the differential rent system.  This may or may not be substantiated by this inquiry.  I have been told that people have been forced to take two jobs.  The chief feeling I have from the differential rent system is that of being watched.  There is a caged-in feeling.  There is a contradiction in our society where it is felt that the lower-income groups need supervisors, inspectors and means test operators.  How much does this bureaucratic system cost us?  How much does it cost administratively to collect the rent under the present system?  If we are talking about making the rents economic, there seems to be some contradiction between the costs of the bureaucratic system needed for the work, the cost of servicing rent collecting, and the claim that the rent is not sufficiently high.</P>
    <P>There are a number of issues which we believe could be examined by the inquiry we suggested.  If this inquiry should hold the view, which the Minister has, that there is no dissatisfaction and that the local authority tenants in the country are satisfied, the Minister could then say that there is no problem or that the only problem is being caused by the agitators or people who are distressed for one reason or another. <Col N="591" /> The Minister could then say that there is not anything inequitable in the system.  We suggest there is a place for an inquiry when the discrepancy between the official verdict and our verdict after contact with the tenants is so great.</P>
    <P>I would commend the Minister to the suggestion made in our motion that the inquiry be set up; the Minister should not be afraid to set up such an inquiry.  The Minister will find thoughtful people of all parties agreeing with the wisdom of setting it up.  If he is serious about social justice the Minister should find this a profitable area to engage in.  The Minister has suggested that this is an area in which he is interested.  This is more important than a ban on motor car traffic in Dublin. The setting up of this inquiry would do much to reconcile local authority tenants to the manner in which rent is levied at present.  The difference between the local authority view and that of the tenants is great at present.  We presumably will have a local authority in Dublin again some time.  A local authority should be an example of local democracy in action.  There cannot be proper local democracy where the levying of rents is ordained by the central authority and the method of such collection declared to be unchangeable.</P>
    <P>The Minister may find that only small changes are needed.  He may find a category of people in regard to whom a new method of levying rent would be more applicable.  We have put down the motion asking the official side at least to subject the opinion that there are no grounds for dissatisfaction and no problem to an independent tribunal.  We seek the facts and not opinions or pronouncements by the Minister about the situation as he sees it.  I do not know the number of tenants in the bailiwick of Galway. Perhaps the people in Galway are of the same cheery disposition as the Minister.  While speaking on television and radio some of them said bitter things about the Minister.  They may have changed their minds by now.</P>

      <P>I am quoting from memory what I heard on television. The position is that there may be no problem in Galway.  The Minister may be correct in thinking that. There may be no need for an inquiry there.  From our experience in other parts of the country, and especially Dublin&mdash;and the Minister will note that the motion is down in the names of Dublin Deputies&mdash;we are aware of the intensity of feeling on this matter. This applies to the new flats at Ballymun. Dublin has one-third of its population in local authority housing, the highest proportion in such housing in any capital in Europe.  We can at least look for an inquiry into the problem about which so many people have complained.  We have asked the Minister and his officials to set up the inquiry; we should have consultation with the representative organisations such as NATO.  We should see what they have to say.  The Minister has had his differences in the past with the personnel of NATO.  The setting up of an inquiry could be a significant bridge to better relations with that organisation. It would demonstrate that the official side are in no way against the idea of improving the system of levying rent.  The official side could say that they have no intention of abolishing rents or that rents should relate to costs, but they should be mature enough to abandon any position which, in the view of the members of the inquiry, should be discarded.  If these methods of payment which are seen to be unsatisfactory are discarded this <Col N="593" /> would not, in my opinion, damage their interests ultimately.  It would mean changing where change was necessary and would improve the situation immensely.  This is why we ask for the inquiry.</P>

      <P>I was very interested when I saw the terms of this motion tabled in the name of the Labour Party.  I am asked in this motion to undertake an immediate examination of the differential renting system, particularly in relation to the hardships and injustices caused by the implementation of the B scale in Dublin.  I listened with great interest to the debate since I expected Deputies to highlight the alleged hardships and injustices occurring under the operation of the B scale, the hardships and injustices about which they were personally aware, but so far I have not heard them cite either hardships or injustices.</P>
      <P>When one talks about the differential renting system one must keep in mind the fact that the system is devised in order to ensure that the tenant will pay a certain sum in relation to his income for his accommodation.  There are 8,258 tenants on the B scale in Dublin.  That is the latest figure I have got.  There are 30,849 on differential renting system, including the B scale. If the rent paid is to relate to income then there must be an individual assessment in each case.  The corporation are, therefore, involved in assessing 30,849 different incomes.  If there are hardships and injustices they must affect tenants individually in the paying of their rents under the differential renting system.  If it could be shown to me that there was genuine hardship, I would be very anxious to take steps&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister used the word &ldquo;tenant&rdquo;.  Does he mean &ldquo;family&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the family.  The earnings of the family are taken into consideration when the tenant is being assessed, but there are certain concessions. I am concerned to seek out cases of genuine hardship under the differential rent system.  I have made <Col N="594" /> certain statements in public.  I have had discussions with the National Association of Tenants' Organisations and I have written to them and I have mentioned my desire to be made aware of genuine cases of hardship.  So far I have not been made aware of any such cases.  I have not been told of any family suffering genuine hardship because of the B scale of rents, or because of any of the other scales that operate under the differential rent system.</P>
      <P>When the system was originally introduced many of the tenants did not fully understand how it operated.  One of the things the tenant must bear in mind is the fact that the corporation have to relate rent to income.  That is stated very clearly on the form the tenant signs; he must inform the corporation whenever his income changes.  A situation did exist in which tenants forgot to inform the corporation that their incomes had gone up and, when the six-monthly review took place, the increase came to light and the tenants were charged arrears of rent.  They found themselves faced with rather large sums.  I do not know whether it is unfair, unjust or whether it constitutes a hardship to oblige a tenant to inform the corporation of changes in income because I can see no way in which it can be done successfully.  I think that obligation is now understood.  It is up to the tenant to notify the corporation of any change in income without delay because the corporation are quite willing to adjust the rent if they are so notified.  Lack of understanding initially was the cause of tenants receiving demands for large sums of rent in arrears, sums they could not meet. They were all circularised about this and I believe that the system is now fully understood and we do not have the same problems as we had some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask Deputies opposite to consider the fact that I have an obligation and a responsibility to those occupying local authority houses.  I have a somewhat greater responsibility and obligation to those who are not yet housed.  Many of the claims made in relation to the differential rent system are, in fact, seeking further reductions <Col N="595" /> in the rents that have to be paid.  I have examined the whole position very thoroughly and I have satisfied myself that there is no great financial burden on any family as a result of the differential rent system provided the corporation are kept informed as to changes in income.  The system is fair to the tenants at all times.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the concessions. I dealt with them before on the Adjournment Debate.  They are very generous.  Under the 1970 scale a man with four children&mdash;the average sized family&mdash;would want an income of £47 10s per week to pay the maximum rent.  One never hears this when people talk about the differential rent system. If I grant more and more concessions the only result will be to reduce the number of houses being constructed in any one year.  Local authority houses are financed in three ways: (1) by State subsidy; (2) by the contribution from the rent the tenant pays and (3) by a contribution from the rates.  The subsidy and the rate contribution totalled £9.7 million last year.  Approximately £5 million of that was borne by the rates and £4.7 million by the State.  It is our primary objective to provide houses for every family at a rent the family can afford.  We can do this only if we manage the finances that are available to us in an equitable fashion.  If the money used for subsidy is increased there will be a big reduction in the actual number of houses built.</P>
    <P>For instance, that £9.7 million, applied to subsidies for local authority houses could have enabled us in any one year to build 3,000 houses, approximately, if used for house construction. To put that further, since 1960-61 a total of £59 million has been paid out in subsidies.  That would have enabled 20,000 additional houses to be built.  I do not say it should all have been spent on building houses but the subsidies are being spent to enable those who go to live in local authority houses to pay a rent they can afford.  In all my studies of the differential renting system I am personally satisfied that tenants are only being asked to pay a rent <Col N="596" /> they can afford.  I was anxious that if I were wrong in that, it should be pointed out to me by some member of the Labour Party or of NATO because I invited NATO to point out individual cases of genuine hardship to me, This has not been the case.  Information of that nature has not been made available to me.  Therefore, I must assume that my own conclusions are correct in regard to this point.</P>
    <P>If there were no subsidies and if everybody had to pay the full economic rent you would have an average rent of approximately £7 per week.  That would cover only a fairly modest house. The average rent in Dublin is only £2 per week and the average for the whole country, including Dublin, is only £1 per week.  By international standards that contribution is very low.  One must ask oneself if those who have been lucky enough, if you like, to be in occupation of local authority houses already, are paying a fair amount for the accommodation they are getting. Are they making a fair contribution towards the cost of providing the house in which they live and towards financing housing generally?  If one makes international comparisons one could not say the burden is bearing too heavily on the average tenant here.</P>
    <P>I think I have shown that our rents are not generally excessive at an average of £1.  We have often been criticised for not raising our rents to a much more realistic level.  As there is not an overall burden on tenants and no individual cases of genuine hardship, I wonder why the motion, in relation to hardship and injustices being caused by the implementation in particular of these B scale rents in Dublin was put down.  I had hoped for enlightenment from Labour Deputies.  It would be great if the Minister and the Government could provide all the local authority houses free to everybody but I do not think anybody would support or expect that.</P>
    <P>There is no financial hardship now but there was some difficulty in the operation of the system because many of the tenants did not understand their obligation to make changes in their income known to the corporation when <Col N="597" /> the change came about instead of leaving it until the six months review has taken place and then be charged with arrears.  Legally, the corporation had to collect the arrears.  The tenant had in fact been in receipt of a greater income than that notified to the corporation and he had failed to inform them when his income had substantially changed.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Local Government I have spent a good deal of time examining the differential rent system.  It was the first problem on which I put my finger.  I received the NATO representation at a very early stage, about the beginning of July. There are many local authority tenants under the differential rent system in my own city of Galway.  Many are personally known to me and I am available to all of them&mdash;only at weekends now because of my duties in Dublin&mdash;and I am not personally aware of any burning hardship.</P>
    <P>I know there are fears among some of the tenants in Galway that their rents will be jacked up to some enormous figure but that is a false fear based on rumour.  There is no genuine hardship with the differential rent system that operates in Galway.  I am happy to assure members of the Labour Party who thought this situation serious enough to warrant this motion and the use of Private Members' Time to discuss it, of my own personal concern and desire to be made aware of where the snags exist.</P>
    <P>To deal very quickly with some of the points made: Deputy O'Connell made a statement that houses and flats built since 1970 in Dublin have maximum rents of £7 and £8 a week and that under Cork Corporation rents go up to £8 per week.  That is a rather misleading statement and Deputy O'Connell knows much more about the differential rent system than to claim that such a statement is correct.  The maximum rent in the Dublin Corporation's 1970 scheme varies from £4 5s a week for a one-room dwelling to £7 5s per week for a 5-room-or-more dwelling.  These rents are based on the cost of providing and maintaining the houses built in 1970 and the cost of flats, which is more than <Col N="598" /> twice these amounts.  A 5-room flat in Dublin now costs £8,000.</P>

I have been very impressed; I have visited these places and the families and they are quite happy and very contented and I should like to see many more of this type of flat built. I should like to see this type of flat erected in my own city of Galway as many tenants there would be very happy, I am sure, to get this type of accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> I want to stress that it is individual tenants who are involved, over 30,000 of them, and a separate assessment must be made in each case.  That throws quite a burden on the corporation.  I do not deny that in dealing with this number of people every week of the year difficulties could arise and that mistakes could be made.  We are all quite capable of making mistakes from time to time.  I would excuse the corporation on that score, if there were certain mistakes or if certain difficulties arose for certain types of tenants, but I would be concerned if some special difficulty was being experienced by all tenants and I have no evidence that that exists.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan said that some of the unrest to which he referred arises because people are required under the differential rent scheme to pay different rents for the same accommodation. That is rather a strange argument for Deputy Ryan to make.  It is difficult to know what exactly he wants.  The only alternative to the differential renting system is a fixed rent scheme.  If Deputy Ryan was advocating fixed rents, and I doubt it, then with all the hardship that this could bring on a person of a very low income, such as an old age pensioner or a widow, I just wonder what kind of just society he is seeking.  The injustices of a fixed rent system are so obvious that I did not think I would find anybody advocating it at this stage and there is, I think, general acceptance on the part of all parties to agree in principle with the differential rent scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with some of the points which were made as being causes of dissatisfaction, injustice and hardship.  Deputy Ryan said that the differential rent scheme does not take account of normal family outgoings such as medical expenses. We must accept that medical expenses are normal household expenses.  We cannot expect to go through life with a completely clean bill of health all the time and in practice medical expenses do arise from time to time especially in families where there are young children.  Where a tenant becomes liable to meet these expenses himself, if his income is such that he is liable to pay medical expenses, well, then hardship should not normally apply as his income is of that size.  However, if there are exceptional expenses involved and if he reported this to the local authority his case would be dealt with sympathetically and considered under the hardship clause which is generally incorporated in all differenial rent schemes.  Deputy <Col N="601" /> Dr. O'Connell made the point that tenants should not have to pay for central heating but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I said for all the year round, for central heating over which they have no control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, this is a normal weekly expense in households that they have to heat the house and it is not really relevant to the house rent.  The charge of 17/3 a week for central heating in a flat in Ballymun is about half the average weekly running cost of central heating in private dwellings of comparable size.  If the flats were not centrally heated then the tenant would be obliged to provide some other form of heating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Over which he would have some control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The charge is an element in the total payment and should not really be termed rent because it would arise if they had an ordinary house or flat without central heating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>But they could adjust it to their own economic resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>But they are getting hot water and so on from central heating. There are many benefits to be derived from central heating.  However, I do not think it is a big point and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I do not think the Deputy was using it to justify the motion.  I am very anxious to hear what the justification is.  I think I dealt with the question of the 13 weekly intervals. Actually it is every six months that the corporation review the income of the tenant.  They will do so quarterly if the tenant requests it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think this is harsh?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy arguing that they should review the rents more often or only once a year?  I do not think the Deputy was here when I said that if there is a substantial change in the tenants income he is obliged under <Col N="602" /> the terms of the agreement to inform the corporation and so ensure, by doing it immediately, that his rent continues to relate to his income.  There is, anyway, a review of his income every six months and, if he requests it, a review every three months.  In between those periods he can inform them of any substantial change in his income and have his rent adjusted.  This is the whole trouble and this is where the dissatisfaction arose in the past, because tenants let it go and did not realise how important it was to inform the corporation of a change in income.  Then they got a big bill and many of them found it difficult to pay it.  I think it will be accepted that most tenants are now fully aware of this and they inform the corporation immediately.</P>
      <P>I will agree that that was a real cause of dissatisfaction, frustration and heartache in many homes where they forgot to inform the corporation of the change.  There has been a vast improvement and we do not have as many cases now as before.  The Deputy mentioned about the tenant or his wife having to attend at Jervis Street to discuss differential rent.  It is only in exceptional circumstances that the corporation insist that the tenant attend at Jervis Street.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, the Deputy will be able to make his reply.  These exceptional cases will be, first of all, where the tenant claims he is unemployed, so therefore he would not be taken away from work and so there would be no problem.  Secondly, if he is self-employed and his wife claims she does not know his earnings then it is reasonable that he should attend and explain the details of his income. That would require taking time off from his business but it would be in his own interests.  Another case is where a husband has been giving his wife money to pay the rent but she has spent the money on something else.  This can happen.  In such cases there is a reasonable stand taken by the corporation. It is in the interests of the people in such cases to attend.</P>

I do not want to set myself up as a kind of bureau for receiving complaints about the differential renting system but I would know from the first half-dozen cases that I got whether there was a genuine cause for some kind of inquiry, of investigation or direction from the Minister to the local authorities.  I have not received any cases and for that reason I must come to the conclusion that there is no genuine hardship and no great injustice being done to any tenant because of the operation of the differential renting system.</P>

      <P>This differential renting scheme is in operation for a long time.  It is a scheme which has grown in complexity since it was introduced 25 or 30 years ago.  It seems to us to be utterly reasonable to suggest that a scheme of this kind, with all its ramifications throughout the whole population of local authority housing schemes, should at least be examined by a committee especially established to find out its workings.  The Minister need not accept it, but in our view there are genuine cases of hardship and injustice. He can ignore that part of the motion if he wants to, but he will have to accept that this scheme has been in operation for a long time and that he is sitting in a Government Department from which he may not be able to examine the problem in an objective way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a basic objection to the differential renting system as a broad principle because it seems to me that the system is a clever device&mdash;effectively a device of benevolent capitalism.  It is designed to impose a selective system of taxation on a small group in order to see that they are taxed in a special way so that subsidies made payable from the Central Fund or from the rates can be reduced or eased.  If our taxation system were equitable, then the wealthier people in the community would be the people making the greatest contributions towards Central Fund taxation.  It is these wealthy people who I believe should be paying the <Col N="605" /> subsidies to the maximum, they should be paying the subsidy needed to provide working-class families with a reasonably priced rented house or flat:</P>
    <P>One of the sources of injustice and hardship, which the Minister must know inevitably arises, is in the application of the means test idea implicit in the differential renting system.  Many years ago the attitude of the Labour Party People&mdash;the Nye Bevan type&mdash; to means test medicine was twofold. They stated &ldquo;We do not agree with the means test medicine on ideological grounds but much more important, we do not agree with it because it means the establishment of such a complex administrative superstructure to administer the test.  We consider it is completely illogical, unnecessary, and undesirable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having listened to the Minister tonight explaining the many possible variations in payments made, the periodicity of the returns to be made, the six-monthly surveys, the necessity imposed on the average unfortunate householder of making returns as soon as there is a variation in family income, I completely appreciate the significance of this remark.  This kind of means test inevitably leads to the creation of an enormous, bureaucratic morass which is inseparable from the operation of the differential renting system with all the elaborations that have become necessary because of the difficulty of trying to ensure that the person is paying the percentage required.</P>
    <P>The Minister kept referring to the fact that the tenant must accept the responsibility of paying rent related to his income.  On correction by me the Minister accepted that it is the family income that must be accepted.  I am sure that Deputy Dowling, with his intimate knowledge of these matters in Dublin, could help the Minister in this matter.  It is here the injustice and hardship arises, because of this necessity to give a global figure for the family income with all its variations. This leads to inter-family and personal stresses because of the demands which will arise from time to time.</P>
    <P>I have always been fascinated here in this House listening to the Government <Col N="606" /> and to the main Opposition party who believe in the idea of private enterprise capitalism consistently saying that the great dynamic for the success of private capitalism in any society is the right to make profit; that the greater the profit, the greater the dividend, the greater the return on invested income, the more likely is the private enterprise capitalist system to be successful, to expand and to create more wealth.</P>
    <P>The curious thing is that this carrot of greater income which is going to mobilise our industrialists and make them create the millenium because of their own industry in factories, businesses and so on&mdash;which incidentally has never occurred at all&mdash;has been this right to create as much wealth as possible.  You will get leaders in the three main newspapers telling you what a wonderful manager you are, what a wonderful industrialist or businessman you are because your profit this year is 17 per cent or 30 per cent more than it was last year and you hope it will be 60 per cent more next year.</P>
    <P>The dynamic is permitted to apply to the wealthy industrial minority group within our society, but when it comes to the working class father of a family or to the boy or girl worker who belongs to a working class family, the reverse applies.  If the working class family increases its income from £20 to £25, from £25 to £30 and so on, part of that money is inevitably and immediately taken away from it.</P>
    <P>We are told we cannot afford to increase the level of direct taxation on company profits, or excess profits tax or corporation profits tax.  If we take any more from these people we are told the business will fold up or these managers, executives or industrialists will not work as hard as they used to work.  It is not, however, considered a disincentive to tax the average worker if he works overtime, if he gets some sort of bonus payment. If an industrious family increase their total income because they all work particularly hard, the Department of Local Government insists on getting its cut at once.</P>

I was trying to make the point that the money should come from central funds and I was trying to turn back on the people who believe in private enterprise capitalism, this point they consistently make to me that the virtue of private enterprise capitalism is that if you let people make enough money everything will be all right.  Of course, that has not proved to be true, but even if it were true I do not understand why the people who believe in private enterprise capitalism, who believe in the dynamic of the carrot for the donkey&mdash;in Connolly's famous adage: the biggest pig gets the most swill&mdash;do not believe it applies to the ordinary worker and his family.  Why can they not be encouraged to work as much as possible on the factory floor, in industry, business or whatever it may be, so that the whole economy can be expanded?</P>

      <P>Anyway these unfortunate boys and girls find that if they work hard in order to save money to try to leave the house&mdash;they should not be there anyway because they are growing older and should be forming their own families&mdash;they are discouraged and penalised by the provisions of this differential rents system and by the present method of its operation. Hardship arises there because there is a conflict of interest.  If I make more money it will go simply to pay the rent.  Why make more money?  Why not take it easy and lie in bed all day? Why not let the tenant, as the Minister first said, do all the work?  Rather than go out to work in order to earn money to buy a house and furniture for themselves and in turn get married and create their own families they stay at home and become layabouts.  This is the kind of hardship which is being imposed on the average working class family by the operation of this differential renting system.  No one knows that better than Deputy Sherwin who represents an area where he must deal with this problem practically every night he holds a clinic in his constituency.</P>
      <P>Under the differential renting system there is an incentive, which is very difficult to resist, when anyone gets an increase in salary, whether it be the husband, wife or one of the children, to conceal that fact because if they disclose the increase, it will be taken off them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reported progress I had been dealing with the political groups which the Minister mentioned in his speech who took part in these parades and protests.  The Minister's predecessor did not arrest any of the people who took part in protests and parades even though he could have done so despite the fact that the stringent measures now being brought in did not exist.</P>
      <P>The number of squatters in Dublin has fallen from 400 to 100, yet this Bill is being brought in to deal with them.  Property developers are buying up buildings in the city which they intend to demolish and replace with office blocks, flats or shopping centres. I am against the number of offices being built but flats and shopping centres are essential.  The Government take over many of the office blocks. As the law stands if these property developers were to allow people to live in these buildings they would not be able to get them out when eventually they decided to pull the building down and develop the site.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell mentioned that in Lewisham near London squatters are allowed to move into a room or a flat in an empty building provided they leave immediately the developers want to commence work there.  They pay only a nominal rent because the building would otherwise be standing empty.  If people were allowed to live in such places whether it be for six months or two years it would help to solve their immediate housing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corporation have bought a tremendous amount of property, which is boarded up and left empty until they are ready to knock it down.  The corporation have bought, under compulsory <Col N="611" /> purchase orders, dwellinghouses in the suburbs in order that they may widen the roads.  They cannot let these places because when the time comes for work to commence they would be unable to get the tenants out.  Even if the corporation have a five-or a six-year plan it may be another ten or 20 years before they get the money from the Department of Local Government to enable them to carry out their road widening programme.  The main Belfast road from Larkhill to Swords was going to be widened when I was six years of age, but the money has still not been made available for that purpose.  These houses could be lived in instead of just being boarded up or knocked down.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the trouble in regard to marches arises from the fact that there is not sufficient Garda supervision. Many of the people who join parades are vandals or thugs.  We on this side of the House are all for law and order.  We will support the Bill in name but we will not support certain sections of it.  We are opposed to section 4 completely.  The definition of the word &ldquo;owner&rdquo; goes too far.  It is a ridiculous situation when a ground landlord, whose interest might be only £1 or £10, has the right to get a person arrested.  We are also opposed to section 9 because we do not think it is necessary.  We are getting into a terrible state when the same Minister who brought in the threat of internment without trial now brings in arrest without warrant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Various speakers have made clear exactly in what sense this party opposes this particular Bill.  We have made clear that we consider that the evil which leads to the unhappy situation where people are forced to move, have in fact moved in certain cases, into premises to which they had no right in strict ownership, that the compulsion which drives them in so many instances to take this course is the need of shelter for families who, under any of our codes, have no possibility of getting houses either in the open market or from the corporation.</P>
      <P>Our criticism of this Bill is that it seeks to introduce a new penalty for this infringement.  We do not deny that the person who is driven to squat is, in fact, breaking the law but we would point out that under the Constitution and indeed according to the broad religious traditions of our people the rights of the family are very much on politicians' lips and very much things that we are supposed to subscribe to without difference of party.  Other speakers, more eloquent than I, have indicated the problem posed for families who at present have no hope of acquiring shelter by legitimate means.  Such families are faced with terrible alternatives.  I know of one family at present where the wife is in Griffith Barracks with one child and the husband&mdash;under the dispensation of Griffith Barracks he cannot live there&mdash;is living apart from the wife. When I last met her she told me she could not afford, nor could he afford, the amount needed to stay in the Iveagh Hostel.  She had not seen her husband at that stage for ten days. That was one marriage on the rocks as a result of our failure to provide sufficient houses in this city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are at the moment 4,500 families looking for accommodation in Dublin.  Therefore, whatever the drafting errors of such a Bill, the sincerity of its supporters in seeing in this Bill a manifestation of their concern for law and order could be perhaps accepted in a situation where the housing need was not as great as it is at present but their motives must be suspect when, in fact, without any change <Col N="613" /> in law, simply by a change in priorities, in Government spending, in the way the Government run the country, they could direct more of our resources to building more houses and getting rid of this problem in its present dimensions. I do not deny that we will have housing problems for some years but not of the dimensions that we have at present.  Where the problem is so extensive as it is, the administration which brings in a Bill which invokes new powers and seems to go out to attack, to outlaw, the whole idea of a man seeking shelter for his family, at the very least can be accused of very bad faith indeed.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have remarked on section 4, the offence of encouragement or advocacy of offences under sections 2 or 3, which may in fact mean that people who speak critically or who seem to advocate the idea of a man seeking shelter for his family first and worrying about the law afterwards, would themselves be included under the penalties of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is the overall question of why exactly the existing law is not sufficient to deal with this problem.  I am one of those who believe that on a political level squatting does not seem to change housing policy.  Housing policy can be changed in this House. Only the Deputies in this House can change the whole dismal picture.  The elected Government are the people with the cash and the power to do something about housing.  The Opposition and the people outside can only speak out against the injustice and the failure of the housing policies.  We can attempt to get the public to give us the power to do something.</P>
    <P>We have attacked rent and the whole mess of the housing situation in this country at the moment.  I make distinctions between people.  We must give the benefit of the doubt to people who, having no other refuge, and no possibility of accommodation, find themselves forced into a position of taking over property where their need has been proven and where a family have no choice between the open skies and shelter.  No one, understanding the place which the family is supposed to hold in our society, could <Col N="614" /> blame such a family for taking that accommodation.  We might not condone such action.  Property owners might throw up their hands in horror. Which is the more admirable husband &mdash;the man with a wife and children who leaves them on the side of the road or the man who takes over vacant property and shelters them?  St. Thomas Aquinas would give a short answer to that question.  Who was carrying out the imperatives of justice? Obviously, it was the man who sought shelter for his family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gallagher has more extensive accommodation than the sort I am talking about.  This Bill is vindictive in that the Minister who introduced it is a member of a Cabinet that has failed to provide sufficient houses.  The Government show no indication of changing their sorry record on housing.  If the Minister and the Government think that a neat little piece of legislation like this will stop the agitation for better housing they are mistaken.  We are well aware of the fall from grace of the Tory Government, but even a Tory Government under Mr. Heath had not considered it necessary to bring in the kind of dynamite included in this Bill.  We question whether the existing law is not sufficient to deal with the excesses occurring in the matter of take-over of property.</P>
      <P>Legislation has been passed which gives ample powers to the forces of law and order to ensure that anarchy does not take place in our society.  No one need feel alarmed about being able to sleep safely in bed at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill faces us with a delicate moral choice.  Where the democratically elected authority fails to carry out certain policies and fails to do its duty leaving people without elementary shelter and without the possibility of getting accommodation from the local authority or in the open market, we are faced with a real problem.  A family with one child needs shelter as badly as a family with four children.  The unhappy position at present is that Dublin Corporation must reject all applications <Col N="615" /> for housing from families with one child.  To Dublin Corporation such a family just does not exist officially. There are various advocates of birth control but it seems to us that Dublin Corporation do not acknowledge that a family exists until they have two children.  The logical conclusion of the present housing situation would seem to suggest that two children should be provided practically on the wedding day.  Certainly virtue is ill-rewarded under the present priority scheme of Dublin Corporation.  The family with one child do not exist in the official mind.  It is a hideous situation to find ourselves in where a child's birth must be considered as a matter for application forms and an essential element in the matter of the parents gaining a house.  This is a hideous concept.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not guarantee that one extra house will be built or one extra flat provided.  It does not say that the vast number of families in need of accommodation will be reduced.  It suggests penalties for anyone who for whatever reason finds himself taking shelter in property which is not his own. I can understand that it is not the forces of law and order who are annoyed by people taking over corporation property.  We are all aware of subtenants in a multiple dwelling who are on a waiting list and who are enraged when they find people going into accommodation &ldquo;out of the queue&rdquo;, as they say.  Their annoyance is probably understandable.  Under existing legislation it is possible to deal with such people.  Many couples have been forced against their will to take over such flats and accommodation.  There has been an element of agitation about these grievances.  If the grievances did not exist there could be no agitation. Agitators account for only a tiny fraction of our people.  The thing that propels ordinary couples into an impossible situation is the grievous housing shortage.  Young couples have no possibility of obtaining suitable accommodation.</P>
    <P>This Minister who has been in office for a short period, is becoming more and more identified with taking legislative sledge-hammers to smash small nuts.  This Bill is a monument to that <Col N="616" /> kind of thing.  Legislative sledge-hammers are taken out in an attempt to settle a housing problem.  This Bill, under the Department of Justice, is an attempt to solve a problem which the Department of Justice know nothing about.  The social problem concerned is elsewhere.  The Minister responsible for housing is not in a position to provide extra houses.  If the priorities of the Government are peace, silence and quiet, and not new houses, this Bill appears to spell that out. It diverts attention from the principal problem, which is the lack of housing. That is why this Bill is necessary and that is why it is inappropriate.  The Bill seeks to get rid of protests and agitation and to drive underground expressions of discontent which have become a feature of our lives in recent years. We really need more houses; there is a chronic shortage of housing.  There is no solution in squatting in available rooms.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the position of those who have their backs against the wall, their families separated and their marriages breaking up and who are without any prospect of accommodation or of flats on a rented basis and who feel forced to take over property which is not their own.  I appreciate their predicament.  It is doubtful if the Government do so.  I am not convinced of the sincerity of the Minister's arguments.</P>
    <P>The question of fish-ins has been mentioned.  They are seen as forcible entry.  There has been agitation in recent years and fish-ins have commanded considerable public support. They are an imaginative form of agitation and have pointed out the contradiction of ownership based on antiquated fishing rights in many parts of the country.  Surely they are worthy of our public thanks?  The Government may feel aggrieved about agitation which does not seem to be conceived with constructive good in mind but this is one such agitation which certainly has brought to the attention of the public the glaring anomalies in the matter of fishing rights in this country. Do we take it that the Government take a pretty closed view of the question of fishing rights?  In any democracy agitation can only take place and <Col N="617" /> subsist over a period where the grievance is well-founded in the people's dissatisfaction.  The agitation must have its origin in the real problems among the people.  A democracy in which agitation has disappeared as a feature of political life is in trouble. Agitation should not be outlawed in any democracy.  The aspect of this Bill which most concerns us is that it presumes to come down heavily, with imprisonment, in fact, on the father of a family who has no political convictions of one kind or another, but who is simply seeking shelter for his family. Where the fate of such a man is imprisonment under this Bill, we think that Bill is wrong.  We believe that a Government which can produce such a Bill do not understand the situation we are faced with.</P>
    <P>The Bill which we are opposing in every respect does not attempt to add any fresh thinking to the problem of the housing shortage.  The penalties at law for dealing with squatting where it does take place, and where it is not legitimate but is seen to be done for a prior and preconceived purpose, exist at present.  They are on the Statute Book and can be invoked and have been invoked. We see no fresh reason&mdash;nor has the Minister given us any fresh reason&mdash;for any new law.  It has not been needed elsewhere and we do not see that it is needed here.  Local bodies have ample authority to deal with squatters and to get them out of corporation dwellings.  As far as we can see, whether we are simple or otherwise, there is no need for this vindictive Bill and we ask the Minister to withdraw these sections and, in fact, to withdraw the Bill as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>When a person commits an offence or breaks the law, there are two courses of action that may be taken against him.  He may have committed an offence which was in breach of the civil law and the person who was wronged or who suffered an injury can get a decree for damages in the courts.  This right will be enforced and carried out, and the person who is wronged can get redress in a civil court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who commits a different <Col N="618" /> offence may be liable for criminal prosecution. In a criminal prosecution the case is brought by the State and the accused is tried.  He may be fined or, because he is in breach of the criminal law, he may be sent to prison.  In this country when a person is sent to jail he pays his debt to society and that should be the end of it.  Let there be no doubt about the fact that once a person is sentenced and does his term in jail, there is a slur on his character. A person's character and good name are as important to him as any part of him, be it his sight, his hearing or anything else.  A person's good name is very precious to him.  His character is very important to him whether he is walking the streets or is a millionaire. Once you lose your good reputation or your good name, you can never regain it while you are on this earth. The stigma of having committed an offence and having been in jail remains until you pass into the next world.</P>
    <P>This Bill will put yet another criminal offence on the Statute Book.  Is that necessary or desirable in relation to the offences mentioned in this Bill? In his opening speech the Minister gave some reasons for bringing in this Bill.  He said it was to prevent squatting and fish-ins.  He said that these offences are being committed &ldquo;mainly at the instigation of quasi-political groups&rdquo;.  I believe this is the kernel of the matter.  The Minister was referring to people who were involved in breaches of the law but, apparently for political reasons, no action was taken against them.</P>
    <P>One of the cases of squatting that springs to mind is the case of Hume Street.  I wonder does the House agree with the action that was taken in Hume Street?  They tried every peaceful and orderly means at their disposal to direct the attention of the Government to what was happening.  Yet another Georgian building was to be torn down in the name of progress and improvement. I believe that many of the students and people who helped to save that building did a service to the country.  They were not successful until they went in and squatted in the building.</P>
    <P>In regard to much of the illegal <Col N="619" /> squatting that has taken place I wonder why it happened.  One of the reasons was mentioned by the previous speaker, that is, the housing situation.  We should be very saddened by that housing situation.  There have been blase reports and propaganda about the number of houses that were being built but the glaring truth is that the housing situation is catastrophic at the moment.  The number of people waiting for houses is deplorable.  It is one of the fundamental rights of any family to ask the Government to provide them with a house and to be provided with a house.</P>
    <P>You do not have to travel very far to see how grave the housing situation is.  In Clondalkin people are forced to live in caravans.  Along the airport road and in Shankill and around the city of Dublin, families have to suffer the humiliation of living in caravans. These people are not living in these caravans by choice; they are living in them because they have to.  Not so long ago I was in Dublin south-west during the by-election and I was saddened by the housing situation there. The Minister may say that his party won the by-election.  They did, but the situation there was enough to sadden the heart of anybody.  All over the country people are living in houses in which farmers would not house their livestock.</P>
    <P>We are debating here the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill, 1970.  One of the reasons why people have tried to bring the attention of the Government to bear on their particular situation is the fact that they have not been able to obtain houses for themselves.  We have the ludicrous situation in Dublin where houses are allocated by lottery.  The Minister, in his introductory speech, said that, if there is to be elementary justice, houses must continue to be allocated in an orderly manner.  How orderly is it when houses are allocated by lottery?  Elementary justice is non-existent in that situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to fish-ins. The Minister is well aware that there is a commission inquiring into inland fisheries at the moment and it would <Col N="620" /> have been wiser for the Minister to have waited until the findings of that commission had been published.  He would then be in a better position to know whether or not this Bill is necessary. I question the right of syndicates and groups to purchase fishing rights. I doubt if any man has the right to prevent a citizen of this country fishing with a rod and line in any river. Local people have rights and no one man and no one group has any right to these fish over and above the rights of those born and reared in the locality.  The Minister should have awaited the commission's findings.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to prohibit people airing lawful grievances.  It makes no effort to remedy the situation which gives rise to these grievances.  Where squatting is concerned this is a landlord's Bill.  The Bill is ruthless since the penalties are jail for the offences the Bill seeks to create.  The Bill is also too vague.  Its timing is open to question.  On 4th December last the Government gave notice that they might bring into operation Part II of the Offences Against the State Act, 1940, including internment without trial.  This was no idle threat. The Secretary-General of the Council of Europe was informed of the Government's decision.  The threat is still there. Any Minister of State would have power of arrest and internment without trial.  On top of that we have this measure and only yesterday the Minister said he was going to resurrect the Criminal Justice Bill.  I do not know what provisions it contains but I am sure it will limit legitimate protest. There are people, particularly the homeless, who have much to protest about.  The Bill will probably prohibit marches and demonstrations.  I do not think such powers are necessary.  Last night the Minister voted against prohibiting people carrying flick-knives and other weapons in dance halls and elsewhere.  No one should be allowed to carry flick-knives or offensive weapons of any kind anywhere.  The Minister voted against that measure but here most undemocratic powers are being sought by the Government.</P>
    <P>When one looks at all the powers being sought in these three Bills one asks oneself: What is behind all these <Col N="621" /> powers?  These powers should not be given to any Government, except in time of war or in time of emergency. The Government demand these powers in time of peace.  I do not believe this Bill is necessary.  The civil law is sufficient to cope with the matters which this Bill seeks to cover.  The civil law may need to be made more efficient.  I believe the Department of Justice should make time to arrange to speed up the work of the civil courts.  Waiting lists at present are much too long. An effort should be made to improve the civil law so as to enable it to cope with the few offences mentioned here.</P>
    <P>In the Garda Síochána we have one of the best police forces in the world. Everybody respects them and this is as it should be.  Nobody can make any reflection on them.  The Force has discharged its duties honourably and efficiently but if this Bill is enacted and the gardaí are forced to carry out its provisions it will certainly bring the gardaí into disrespect and make them very unpopular.  Much of the work they will be doing will be unnecessary because remedies should be provided in the civil law and not in the criminal courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a good deal of discussion and argument on this Bill.  Some Deputies have gone through the legal aspects of it with a fine comb to such an extent that one would imagine one was listening to a speech on the Committee Stage rather than on the broad principles of the Bill. I am not casting any aspersions on the Chair in that respect but the Bill has been very widely discussed in its general aspects and as regards the legal position if it becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like many other Deputies I have spent much time listening to lawyers and they have one thing in common with the medical profession, another great profession, in that they never by any chance agree, so that the ordinary layman has to pick his way between the various legal opinions and, of course, legal opinion can sometimes be tinged with the political view of the person giving it and this can happen in here.  I am not afraid of the legal aspects of the Bill or the legal position that will ensure from it except <Col N="622" /> in regard to section 4, about which I am not entirely happy.  One must however, take a stand on the Bill and I believe it is largely necessary.  We have had the position in Dublin of people illegally forcing their way into various houses and barricading themselves in and indeed, sometimes receiving comfort and aid from Members of this House.</P>
    <P>I yield to nobody in my love and admiration for the beautiful Georgian architecture of this city but, in fact, successive Irish Governments have never shown any particular interest in our beautiful heritage of buildings and while I have felt that it was little short of a tragedy that those houses at the corner of Stephen's Green and Hume Street should be bought for the purpose of pulling them down and great as is my love for that aspect of Dublin life, I have a greater love for law and order.  As long as it was legal to purchase these houses through the normal channels and the ordinary process of law and town planning involved, no matter how much I would feel it was a pity they could not be preserved, I would not condone the breaking of the law in order to preserve them because we have seen not only in Ireland but in every country in the world the terrible results which have flowed from the breakdown of law and order.  So, I feel that people who value the rule of law must stand behind the Government when they do this.  No party has any prouder record in the maintenance of law and order in this country than Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>We have heard arguments about landlords and landlordism.  These are nonsense.  Those are emotive words. They are being used deliberately to rouse the feelings of certain people to invoke their pity.  They are what the Americans would call &ldquo;tear-jerkers&rdquo;. They are being used to frighten us.</P>
    <P>Statutes, going back 500 or 600 years and right up to the last century have been quoted.  The position is very different today.  Those people who have gone into these various houses have not gone in seeking shelter from the cold, they have gone in in order to call attention to the housing situation in Dublin.  I have been connected for <Col N="623" /> a great many years with Dublin Corporation and in no capital city in the world is there a local authority with a prouder record of building houses than Dublin Corporation.  At present something like 50 per cent, if not fully 50 per cent, of the population of Dublin is housed through Dublin Corporation.  This means that every time you walk down a street or every time you travel in a bus in the city half the people you meet have been housed by Dublin Corporation.  I do not suppose any other capital city in the world has that record.  That does not mean that anybody can rest on his oars.  I do not think the Government have done all that they could or should have done in relation to housing.  There is a great deal more to be done.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the question of pulling down houses, vacant sites and so on, this again is an emotive thing. Dublin being largely an 18th century city has now, in the case of many of its houses&mdash;and unfortunately in the case of many of its most beautiful houses&mdash;come to the point at which it is appallingly difficult and expensive to maintain those houses.  I am aware that in some cases if more attention had been paid to the by-laws in the past the houses would not be in the position in which they are today.  However, those who have to plan for the city of Dublin, the City Manager and his staff, have to deal with facts as they find them in the 1970s.  Of course sometimes houses could have been kept going if money had been spent on them.  Nowadays, however, in many cases the cost will not pay and they have to come down.  This is a great pity and I do not put the houses in Hume Street or in Merrion Square in that category but I will just cite this instance for the House.</P>
    <P>We live in an imperfect world.  In a perfect world every man would be prepared to act for the common good, even to his great financial detriment. Unfortunately that is not possible and there are houses and sites in Dublin today, and in every city in Western Europe, which are so valuable when they are used in the most modern <Col N="624" /> fashion that the individual who owns them if he can sell them for redevelopment will get many times the value of the premises because modern offices may be put up on those sites. It is easy to say to somebody else, &ldquo;Oh, Mr. So-and-So&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mrs. So-and-So&rdquo;, as it may well be&mdash;&ldquo;you cannot sell this house to the redevelopers because we will not allow it.  You must live there&rdquo; and if he or she says, &ldquo;But a great deal of money has to be spent on it and I have not got the money&rdquo; we then, in this democratic age, even although it may be an imperfect world in which we live, rightly say that that owner must be compensated.  However, we are not prepared to compensate the owner. That is one of the dilemmas.  I heard of a man who owned a house in one of the areas about which there was a great deal of discussion.  He owned the premises, in which he did not live but in which he worked, and he was offered something like £17,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not, with due respect.  I am trying to prove that these changes which are taking place in Dublin and which are leading the people to make forcible entries into buildings are the result of economic forces which in many cases are pressing the owners of those buildings into taking steps which are not popular with certain sections of the community. How are we going to compensate people since to do so would put such a vast burden on the community that the powers, whether they be the corporation or the Government, would be faced with either appropriating the house in the name of the people or letting economic forces operate to a certain extent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the dilemma in which Dublin has been placed but very many of the houses, the pulling down of which we deplore, have to come down because they have reached the end of their life. In many cases it is completely uneconomic to keep them in proper repair. I remember talking to a man who lived and spent a great deal of his time working in one of the houses in the Fitzwilliam <Col N="625" /> Square&mdash;Fitzwilliam Place area and I said &ldquo;Oh, what an exquisite house that is&rdquo;.  In fact, this is a relative of my own.  I said &ldquo;That is a beautiful house.  I hope nothing will ever happen that these house will be pulled down&rdquo;. He said to me &ldquo;You would not say they were so nice if you had to live in them.  They require an endless amount of money to keep them in repair because the roofs, chimneys and other items need constant attention.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is not an easy matter to maintain these very beautiful houses in a reasonable state of repair.  One has only to look at the old mansions down in the country.  Many years ago their owners gave up the struggle and now many of them are in a state of total disrepair. I am sure even a millionaire would be aghast at the amount of money needed to make those houses up-to-date and comfortable by 20th century standards.</P>
    <P>This is some of the background behind this Bill.  It is the first time in my life that I had found myself making a case from the Opposition benches for a Government Bill but my party share the view I have on this matter. One has to take one's stand on a matter such as this.  We live in a strange age in which law has broken down.  We see many instances where people make forcible entry.  There was one house on Merrion Road into which some people moved.  All kinds of views were expressed on placards made by the young people who occupied the house.  After several months the Garda moved in and the house was demolished.</P>
    <P>I am told that the law is defective. I do not know if it is as defective in relation to ejectment of people as a result of forcible entry as the Government would make out.  I think we have suffered from a degree of timidity, not to say cowardice, on the part of the Government for not enforcing the law or permitting the Garda to take steps. However, when the Bill is passed the Government cannot say that they have not been armed sufficiently to deal with the problems which are arising in the 1970's and which are being made use of by ill-disposed persons.</P>
    <P>We have heard much emotive language <Col N="626" /> about landlords, fishing rights and so on, and how forcible entry was justified.  Such views were expressed by some speakers in this House both yesterday and today.  Having an historical mind on occasions, I can remember a famous forcible entry made at the beginning of the Russian Revolution.  There was a forcible entry on behalf of the Bolsheviks into the Smolny Institute.  They sat there for many months and planned and brought about the downfall of the Kerenski Government who had not the courage to put them out.  That was one case of forcible entry that led to extraordinary and tragic events for that country and which brought profound changes to the world.  One could put forward many arguments for gentle, but firm, enforcement of law and order.</P>
    <P>Fish-ins were mentioned by the Minister and taken up by various speakers. I might say that I do not fish; neither do I shoot and I do not own any land. I have not a vested interest as such in the maintenance of fish or game and so on, but unless there is some degree of preservation there will not be a trout or a salmon left in Irish rivers.  We all have a kind of sneaking regard for the poacher.  I even heard a Deputy on these benches speaking sympathetically about poachers when one would not expect him to have any great love for them.  However, if the rivers in Ireland were made free for everybody it would not be just the man with the rod and line who would use them.  People would arrive in motor cars and would dynamite a stretch of river or they would net the river at night, or during the day, when there was a run of fish which could gravely affect fishing prospects for future years.  Exactly the same situation would result as has happened on the oceans of the world where the whales have been hunted practically out of existence because of the greed of men.  Therefore, unless there is a degree of preservation of our rivers there will not be a minnow left.  Dynamite would be used on our rivers, and indeed this has happened not only on our rivers but on rivers in other countries, and this could stun and kill all the fish. That is the other side of the emotive words &ldquo;landlords&rdquo;, &ldquo;fishing rights&rdquo; and &ldquo;fish-in&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> Then there is the question of squatting of itinerants or tinkers.  &ldquo;Tinkers&rdquo; has apparently become an insulting word.  I do not want to insult people but there is a great deal of false sympathy for some of these people. Itinerants have come around Dublin and parked their caravans on the side of the road.  I am speaking from knowledge. I do not know what some of the men do.  They seem to collect rags and scrap iron, but one can see the women catching the bus into town in the morning and making for Stephen's Green and areas around there.  I am sure they can be seen on the north side of the city as well.  Anyone can see them sitting with tiny children and begging from passers-by.  What happens to the children they leave behind, those who are big enough to walk?  They are left to roam around.  The Garda have told me they have no powers to move these people, who know their rights very well and will not move.  We are not helping the problem with that sort of false pity and false sympathy in leaving them there.  This problem must be faced by the Government.</P>
    <P>The people who are doing the real work in connection with the itinerants are the settlement committees who are slowly educating them.  Many of these people are not poor.  I was speaking about the children they leave behind. Some of these children are wild and have got into mischief; they have broken in and entered and stolen.  I am not saying this is done by the majority of them but naturally these children are lacking in supervision.  Many of these itinerants are around where I live and I know what happens.  I know the feeling of hatred that is worked up in people around them.  That is one of the tragedies, because these unfortunate people should not be disliked.  They should be very much pitied and it should be a very early priority of the Government to accommodate them.  It is a question of finding proper sites, then moving them on to the sites and educating them.</P>
    <P>A young girl, a member of my own family, goes at the week-ends to the itinerants in Walkinstown to teach some of them to read.  There is a girl of <Col N="628" /> fifteen who is very anxious to learn. This young woman who is teaching the itinerants cannot give them all the time she would like.  This youngster I have mentioned had never seen a map before. She did not know where Dublin was in relation to Ireland and I am sure she did not know where Ireland was in relation to the rest of the world, or the concept of north, south, east and west.  All sorts of things like that have to be contended with as well as housing. You cannot just move people into houses.</P>
    <P>The powers in this Bill should help to bring about a situation in which we in Ireland can grapple firmly with this problem.  As I say, it is a problem of education and money.  Many of these people are anxious to get out of the rut in which they are caught by their poverty and their lack of education. For these reasons I think this Bill should be supported.  It is not a perfect Bill but we are a democratic country. I do not think hardship will be solved by this Bill.  I have heard so many cries down through the years I have been in this Chamber, you would think the skies were going to fall.  The skies have not yet fallen as a result of various pieces of legislation that have been introduced over the years.  Things never work out as badly as predicted because there is always the saving grace, I would like to think, of the Irish character which tends to soften things, and also because there is an Opposition that watches and a Government that are in touch with people in the country, on occasions.  Sometimes they get out of touch but other times they have the same ways of knowing that they have been harsh as we have.</P>
    <P>Another safeguard we have is the decisions which are taken in our courts. All those forces tend to mould our legislation here in a way which is in conformity roughly with the will of the people.  In my opinion and the opinion of this party we cannot permit law and order to be smashed down under the guise of a democratic process. These people who squat will tell you that they are democratic and are only doing it for the most democratic reasons.  One only has to look at the placards they put up outside to see that <Col N="629" /> it is anything but democratic.  It is down with anybody who does not agree with them.  I have seen people walking up and down outside Leinster House carrying placards which state: &ldquo;Hang the landlords&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hang the tyrants&rdquo;.  That is all very well but a person cannot take part in a sit-in for a democratic reason and then hang placards outside urging the populous to hang the people who happen to disagree with their way of thinking. This is what is happening in this extraordinary world in which we live.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Government have at last had some degree of sense about this.  I hope they will have the guts to enforce the measures in this Bill with justice, mercy and kindness.  Let it be clearly understood that Ireland is a country which respects the forces of law and order, whose Government stand up for them and protect people from mob violence and mob rule.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Dockrell I am not a lawyer and consequently I have not the competence to dissect the legal niceties of this Bill any more than he has.  Deputy Dockrell said something which I think he may not really have intended to say and I should like to deal with that point now.  I understood him to say we were supporting this Bill but that is not really correct.  We have decided not to vote against this Bill on its Second Reading.  There is a very big difference between the two things and I am sure that is what Deputy Dockrell meant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The views of this party were very clearly put by our spokesman when he said that we were not voting against this Bill on its Second Reading but we were hoping, with the co-operation of the Minister and those on the Government benches, that it might be possible so to amend this Bill as to make it acceptable to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody in the House, it is fair to say, is concerned about law and order. Certainly I am concerned with law and order.  I do not believe anybody should be allowed to commit lawless acts <Col N="630" /> which will seriously disturb the lives of ordinary decent people, Deputy Fitzpatrick was quite right when he said that the fact the Government thought it was necessary to introduce penal legislation of this kind is a serious reflection on the Government itself.  It is a reflection of the Government's failure during many long years.</P>
    <P>It was this party which laid the foundations of the State and laid them fairly well.  It was this party who set up the Garda Síochána and did not arm them.  The Government have not armed them and the Garda themselves do not want to be armed because they know that force meets force.  The more criminal an offence is made the more dangerous the people will be who attempt to commit that offence.</P>
    <P>I have already said I am not able to make my way through the legal niceties of this legislation and decide what the civil law can deal with and what it is necessary to bring in the criminal court to handle, but it is all wrong to give the Garda Síochána the power of arrest without warrant.  This is a serious situation.  The greatest complaint which can be made about the law is that it is too slow, too tedious and too expensive as it stands, but surely it is possible to amend the law and make it more effective?</P>
    <P>What is wrong with this country at the present time is that there are not enough houses and not enough jobs. The Government are not giving us a good example.  We are not getting enough encouragement to make a real effort to do the right thing.</P>
    <P>There should be a distinction between the different reasons for squatting but this Bill does not make any such distinction; it deals with all squatters.  Why is all this lawlessness appearing now?  Why has it not happened in the past?  There are good reasons why it has not happened in the past.  Let us take, for instance, fishins. How long have people been agitating because most of the valuable inland fisheries are owned by alien landlords?  What have the Government done to bring about a situation whereby ordinary people are able to obtain access to these fisheries instead of just the rich, who are able to pay heavily <Col N="631" /> for them?  If the Government were sincere about this they would acknowledge that the people who are protesting have a grievance.  They would tell them that it was the Government's intention over a period of years to buy out these fishing rights and they would include a certain amount in the Budget annually for this purpose. There has been no recognition of this fact and no attempt has been made to change the situation.  The people are denied access to these amenities because there is no programme on the part of the Government to ensure that these rights are not in the hands of an exclusive few.</P>
    <P>I would hate to see us arrive back at the situation which existed in the landlord days when it was treason even to tread on a farm and anyone who crossed a fence found himself in jail and arrested without warrant.  I cannot understand the mentality behind this Bill.  If a person misbehaves himself in a public house and starts a row, if the person who owns or runs the public house is not able to deal with him, he can call in the guards and the guards will throw the man out.  I cannot understand why the same thing cannot apply to squatters.  I have great sympathy with people, some of whom have been on the housing list for 15 years and are still waiting for a house. Deputy Dockrell did not make it any easier for me to make this case when he said that Dublin Corporation had a proud record in the provision of houses. It may be a fact that they built many houses in Dublin but no regard is being had to the fact that the people of the country are flocking into the cities and towns because there is nothing left for them in rural Ireland, because this Government have no policy for rural Ireland and have never had a policy to keep the people in rural Ireland and they are creating an enormous problem in the Dublin region.  When a family in extreme conditions due to the fact that they are homeless move into an empty house&mdash;they do not want to break into the house, they do not want to commit an unlawful act but they have no place to go; through no fault of their own they have not been <Col N="632" /> housed&mdash;it has the undesirable effect that the most deserving, if one were to house people on that basis, would not get a house first.  One must have order and one must have a way to deal with it but I do not think it should be dealt with or could possibly be dealt with, and I do not think the people will stand for it anyway, with the severity that is proposed in this measure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell referred to the unfortunate itinerants.  I have seen attempts to remove itinerants from certain areas.  I have seen them brought to court by the local authority and I have heard the justice ask the people: &ldquo;Where are you going to put them?&rdquo; When they tried to get an order to shift them they were just told to come back when they had some place to put these people.  These people forcibly entered these grounds but the people sitting on the bench at present do not consider that they committed an unlawful act in the circumstances because of the background that is there.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this Bill seems to be all-embracing and to be able to hit everybody with equal severity.  I have not got anything like the same sympathy for the people who occupy houses for other reasons of protest.  Like Deputy Dockrell I have a fair amount of appreciation of buildings of architectural merit and up to a point I defend those who protest very strongly when such buildings are knocked down but we must be reasonable about all this and we must be balanced in our outlook.  Again the Government have not shown the concern that is necessary to meet the reasonable protests of people of this kind and they have driven them to worse protests.  If they are really concerned and anxious to preserve certain buildings and certain streets and facades why do they not pinpoint them?  Why do they not list them and say: &ldquo;This is it and there can be no change from this&rdquo; and then carry out the law?  This has not been done.  This bad example of lawlessness has started at the top.  The decisions of the planning authority, who have the right and the responsibility to give planning decisions, have been thwarted on numerous occasions.  Their decisions have been thwarted to suit the tacateers <Col N="633" /> and the racketeers in this city, and to facilitate them.  There is no doubt about that.  People have seen themselves being evicted from houses and driven here and there simply because certain developers decided to buy up the property where they lived and surround them and tell them to get out.  Talk about fixety of tenure.  One has very little rights when this sort of thing is happening and allowed by the laws of the land.</P>
    <P>Again, if one looks at the trouble that started on lands owned by foreigners the same thing applied.  There was this forcible entry, burnings and everything else brought about again by the failure of the Government to introduce effective legislation in time to prevent foreigners from coming in here and getting possession of these farms. Even the law introduced after many years of agitation from the Opposition is still not effective and can be side-stepped and is being side-stepped.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances and with that sort of background it may be necessary to introduce some form of more effective legislation but let it be known to everybody that it is because of the failure of the Government in so many departments and because of the hopeless example they have given that this type of legislation is necessary.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out already in this debate that in England where there is quite an amount of forcible entry and squatting they did not introduce this sort of legislation and they apparently are able to deal with it and it has not been necessary for the best part of 50 years in this country.  If we had more indication from the Government that they are making the best possible effort to meet the situation of the homeless people and to meet the reasonable protests of people who are trying to correct wrongs this sort of legislation would not be necessary.  There will always be the few who will have to be dealt with and dealt with fairly harshly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell mentioned the unfortunate fact that we have lawyers on both sides of the House disagreeing on the type of legislation that is necessary to deal with a particular situation.  It does not make it any easier for those who have not got legal training to decide who is right in this regard. <Col N="634" /> There is a considerable amount of disagreement. The belief of the people in this party is that it may be possible on Committee Stage so to amend this Bill as to make it acceptable but they condemn the Government and the Minister that this type of legislation should be considered necessary and they blame them for the reasons that have brought it about.  The discontent that exists in this city is largely due to the failure of the Government to provide sufficient houses for the people, due also to the fact that speculators and racketeers have been allowed to buy up property and demolish it before the eyes of people who have not got a roof over their heads and also because we have not got sufficient gardaí to control things when they start to go out of hand.  All of us have protested against this from time to time.  This is an age when everybody works a shorter day and where every employment requires more people to do the same amount of work.  In the Garda Síochána there are far fewer people to do the same amount of work or a greater amount of work and it is a greater amount of work mainly because of the great aggregation of the population because of the flight from the land and the fact that nobody wants to stay in rural Ireland because there has been no policy for rural Ireland and the people refuse to accept the situation any longer.</P>
    <P>Our policy on this Bill is quite clear. We will not vote against it on the Second Stage in the hope that we will find the Minister to be reasonable.  We are accepting his assurance in the last paragraph of his statement where he himself does not try to pretend that this is a measure that cannot be drastically improved in the course of the Committee Stage.  I hope that attitude will be obvious when we get into the part of the Bill where it can be tested but we have unfortunately come up against attitudes on the part of individual Ministers where they reject everything that is put forward simply because it is put forward by the Opposition feeling it cannot be right.  Any Minister who comes into this House with that sort of attitude can expect to be opposed every inch of the way.  If this Bill goes through the House in the form in which it has been presented we will have more <Col N="635" /> trouble in this country than ever we had before.  One might as well arm the police.  This is the sort of opposition which the Minister will get to the Bill. I hope that the Minister will see, on reflection, that section 4 is unacceptable to the people.</P>
    <P>Another thing struck me as rather peculiar about section 2.  Section 2 deals with the offence of forcible entry on land or a vehicle.  It reads:</P>
    <P>A person who forcibly enters land or a vehicle shall be guilty of an offence unless&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  he is the owner of the land or vehicle, or</P>
    <P>(b)  if he is not the owner, he does not interfere with the use and enjoyment of the land or vehicle by the owner and, if requested to leave the land or vehicle by the owner or by a member of the Garda Síochána in uniform, he does so with all reasonable speed and in a peaceable manner.</P>
    <P>What will happen to the inspector who goes down from the Land Commission and forcibly enters a man's farm and from that day forward the man cannot sell his farm or offer it for sale, nor can he raise money on it?  The inspector sterilises that holding from the day he puts his foot on it.  How will he be affected by this section?  There is no mention here of lawful entry.  As the law stands, he is entitled to enter under the 1965 Act. He will now obviously become a criminal, if this piece of legislation goes through the House, because he is certainly going in without the owner's consent and he is certainly interfering with the use of the land and property by the legitimate owner. Section 2 also requires a re-examination by somebody capable of doing it.  I am satisfied with the various points put forward by our spokesman, Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick.  This is a piece of legislation with which we disagree completely.  We do not propose to vote against it.  We hope to be able to amend it at the Committee Stage in order to make it acceptable in the circumstances in which this country now finds itself, as a result of the Government failure and neglect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to the very long and varied debate.  It is one in which many conflicting views were presented. It is difficult to stand up immediately after the speeches and deal with them all in chronological order or in the order of the various topics which were referred to.  To some extent, therefore, I must ask the indulgence of the House when dealing with certain individual topics although they may not necessarily be in the order in which they were raised by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>The debate has a number of different divisions.  One of the distinguishing marks of the first of the three days of debate was that there was very little discussion about the Bill but tremendous analysis of the speech I made in moving the Second Reading.  On the second day the Deputies did not refer to the speech but began to question motives and personalities with regard to the Bill.  One of the factors which struck me most about the debate here today was that almost every speaker seemed to pick on one point, and that is the power that would be given to the Garda Síochána under section 9 of the Bill to arrest without warrant. Virtually every speaker expressed the most profound horror at this unusual and very drastic proposal, and spoke of its savouring of a police state and being something which was foreign to Irish law, of being something unnecessary, unusual and an unwanted power for the Garda.  Some speakers possibly believe that, in fact, the power of arrest without warrant is in some way unusual.  Other speakers on the benches opposite know there is nothing unusual in this.  For the sake of scoring political points they led other members of the House, who are not as familiar with the law as they are, to believe that there is something sinister and drastic in a power of arrest without warrant.  I will, therefore, point out the significance of the limitations on the power proposed.  We might discuss first of all in a more general way the existing powers, under both common law and statutes, of arrest without warrant in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A member of the Garda Síochána has a common law power to arrest <Col N="637" /> without warrant, firstly, on reasonable suspicion that the person concerned has committed a felony.  The person does not have to have committed a felony.  The garda has only to have a reasonable suspicion.  He may be wrong, but if his suspicion was reasonable that is sufficient.  Deputies may ask what is a felony.  Therefore, how many sorts of crimes does this apply to?  A felony is the more serious of the two historical divisions into which the indictable crimes are divided.  It includes all forms of larceny and various other forms of damage to property or assault of varying kinds on a person.  In effect, it includes many hundreds of different and fairly common-place crimes. Secondly, a garda has power to arrest without warrant if he sees a breach of the peace being committed.  Breaches of the peace are not uncommon in our country, unfortunately.  The power of the garda to arrest without warrant is, therefore, exercisable on that heading frequently.  Thirdly, the garda has a power to arrest without warrant if he is assaulted or obstructed in the execution of his duties.  He has a statutory power of arrest if he finds a person committing a indictable offence at night.  That is a very wide power. It is wider than the common law power, inasmuch as it extends to any indictable offence whatever provided it is being committed at night.  A garda has a statutory power of arrest without warrant if he finds a person loitering at night with an intent to commit any one of various specified felonies.  The power of arrest without warrant in these cases is conferred by a large variety of statutes which are connected with these felonies.  The third main group of statutory powers of arrest without warrant which a garda has is in relevant statutes where he is specifically given that power.  Deputies who express such horror, and surprise, and so on, at the limited powers proposed in this Bill would do well to remember that, in legislation as recent as the Road Traffic Act, there are several instances of specific power of arrest without warrant for a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>Great horror was expressed with regard to section 9 of this Bill as if what is proposed there &mdash;and it is a very limited power; I will explain its limitations very shortly&mdash; were something completely new and completely alien to Irish law.  The fact of the matter is, as I think I have demonstrated, that a member of the Garda Síochána has power to arrest without warrant in literally hundreds of different cases.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Belton would leave the argument on this type of point to some of the lawyers in his party, they might be a bit more successful on it than he is.  The surprising thing&mdash;and I am sure it will surprise Deputies who are so horrified at the rigours of section 9&mdash;is that not alone have the Garda Síochána got the power at present to arrest without warrant in hundreds of different crimes to which I referred, but civilians have almost equal powers at present to arrest without warrant.</P>
      <P>The power of a civilian to arrest without warrant is only slightly more limited than the power of a member of the Garda Síochána.  One instance is that in the first of the examples I gave of the common law power where a garda can arrest a person on reasonable suspicion that he has committed a felony, a civilian on the other hand must have that reasonable suspicion but also must show that the felony was actually committed.  It is, therefore, a somewhat more limited power than the power of the garda, but it is only fractionally more limited. Civilians, members of the public, have these powers, with the slight limitation that I have described, which are held also by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those powers, if I may say so, are fairly drastic.  They are not abused by <Col N="639" /> the Garda Síochána nor are they abused by civilians.  They are far wider than the powers in section 9.  There are only the limitations of the general common law on most of those powers, but when we turn to section 9 here we find that not alone are there all the usual limitations on the power of arrest without warrant, but in addition there are four very specific limitations on the power of arrest without warrant proposed in this Bill also.</P>
    <P>There are four conditions set out in section 9 and even a cursory glance at the section will show Deputies that it is not a question of one of the conditions being complied with, but of all four of them being complied with together. I think I can safely say that the circumstances in which all four of those conditions could be complied with would be very limited indeed.  If I can find my note with regard to what Deputy Fitzpatrick said on this very point, I think we will find that in fact it bears out what I said, because he agreed with my statement that all these four special conditions must be complied with and commented on it as follows at column 89, Volume 251 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I believe that in the present state of the law and the number of people who are entitled to issue warrants, it should always be reasonably practicable to obtain a warrant.</P>
    <P>If instead of the word &ldquo;always&rdquo; Deputy Fitzpatrick had said &ldquo;in over 99 per cent of cases&rdquo; I would agree with him.  We will not quarrel about the one per cent.  Having correctly, or substantially correctly, assessed the position Deputy Fitzpatrick failed to draw the obvious conclusion.  If, in fact, it is reasonably practicable to apply for a warrant, then the powers conferred by the section cannot be operated.  In other words, on Deputy Fitzpatrick's own analysis, this section can be operated only in quite exceptional circumstances. Indeed, if I were to take the Deputy literally his analysis would mean that it could almost never be operated.  Therefore, for Deputies opposite, whether through ignorance or otherwise, to feign such horror at this seems to me to be very remarkable.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the best way to get across <Col N="640" /> the significance of how limited the power in section 9 is, is to compare it with the power under section 49, or whatever it is, of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, which gives the gardai power to arrest without warrant where they suspect that somebody is guilty of driving under the influence of drink. That is what the section says.  It sets it out.  They are subject only to the usual conditions and if a member of the Garda Síochána believes that a person has consumed a certain amount of drink that impairs his driving, he is entitled to arrest him without any hindrance, statutory or otherwise.  Under section 9 of this Bill a member of the Garda Síochána may arrest a person without warrant where&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the member knows or has reasonable cause for suspecting that the person is committing an offence under section 3.</P>
    <P>It only applies to a section 3 offence, not to any other.  That is the offence of forcible occupation and not any of the other offences.  He must have reasonable cause for believing that the person is committing an offence.  It is not enough for the garda to say: &ldquo;I thought I had reasonable cause&rdquo; or &ldquo;I believed I had reasonable cause.&rdquo;  He must show objective grounds on which a court can assess whether he had reasonable cause.  Having established that, the second condition which must be fulfilled in addition is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the owner of the land or vehicle to which the offence relates represents to any member of the Garda Síochána, and the member proposing to make the arrest reasonably believes that, as a result of the continuance of the offence, serious damage to the land or vehicle or serious interference with the lawful rights of the owner in relation thereto, or serious inconvenience to the public or a section thereof, is being or will be caused.</P>
    <P>Again, it is not enough for a member of the Garda Síochána honestly to believe that all these conditions are complied with; he must show that he had grounds on which to base that belief and, if he is unable to show these objective grounds, he has no power of arrest without warrant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> The third condition, if he satisfies both of the foregoing, and I think Deputies who look at the matter fairly will agree that these conditions are both onerous and difficult, is that the member proposing to make the arrest reasonably believes that the arrest is necessary to prevent the damage, interference or inconvenience.  Again, he must have reasonable, objective grounds on which to base his belief and on which to prove his belief; it is not enough for him to say: &ldquo;I reasonably believe this&rdquo; because the court can and will require him to show on what objective grounds he reasonably believes.</P>
    <P>The fourth condition, which is probably the most important, and the most constraining of all, is that in the particular circumstances it is not reasonably practicable to apply for a warrant. As Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, and I agree with him, the number of occasions on which it would not be reasonably practicable to apply for a warrant are very, very limited indeed.  I would almost go so far as to say that in one out of a hundred times, when it is indicated that an offence is being committed under this measure, then, and only then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would it not be reasonably practicable to apply for a warrant.  The reason I have dealt with this so fully is that Deputies opposite &mdash;not all by any means, but some&mdash; have in some cases deliberately, I believe, misrepresented a very limited and, indeed, almost weak power provided in the Bill.  I know it does not suit those Deputies to have this explained to them in detail because, having heard the explanation, if they are reasonably honest even with themselves, they cannot say that, under this Bill, every squatter can be arrested without warrant.  If 1 per cent were to fall into that category that would be about the height of it.  These are the facts as far as section 9 are concerned. I hope we have now heard the end of it.</P>

      <P>I want now to deal with some of the points made by Deputy O'Higgins last night.  While I do not subscribe to some of the conclusions he felt himself forced to come to, possibly for political reasons, his speech was a valuable contribution inasmuch as it attempted to analyse accurately and fairly objectively many of the central points in the Bill.  Others tried to do that, too, but without wishing to insult anyone, Deputy O'Higgins was the only speaker capable of doing it.  His speech was interesting and useful; it would, perhaps, have been more useful had his fairly objective analysis not been subjected, when he came to drawing conclusions, to certain rather petty political pressures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>He posed two valid questions, one an important question of substance and the other a technical, but nevertheless important, legal point. On the question of substance, according to Deputy O'Higgins the provisions of this Bill relating to forcible entry are already part of the law.  If I correctly understand his proposition, it is that it is already part of the law both because it is part of the common law and, as well, it is already enshrined in a long series of enactments.  In putting forward this proposition, Deputy O'Higgins is, of course, drawing on his professional knowledge.  I have no intention of challenging the general tenor of his arguments as to what the existing law is.  The Deputy himself drew attention to certain qualifications to what he was saying.  He argued, for example, that in relation to the common law offence of forcible entry it is necessary that there should be something in the nature of a public breach of the peace.  I would add another quite important qualification, namely, that these provisions relate to premises and have no application to such matters <Col N="643" /> as fish-ins, which, as I explained in my introductory speech, this Bill is also intended to cover.  However, despite the reservations and qualifications, Deputy O'Higgins's speech raises in broad general terms the question as to why we should need this Bill in relation to premises when it does no more than re-enact the law as he, an eminent senior counsel, knows it to be.  The simple answer is that the Attorney General has advised that this law cannot be relied on and it would, therefore, not be appropriate to seek to bring a prosecution under it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the Attorney General accepts what Deputy O'Higgins says as a theoretically correct statement of the law, but a distinction must be drawn between the criminal law and the civil law.  In the criminal law the courts very properly have shown themselves very reluctant to accept the very old statutes or, for that matter, rules of common law which have not been invoked for a very long time but which are still part, a useful part perhaps, of the law of the land.  In concrete terms it would be extremely difficult to prove that an Act of the 14th century was still part of the law of the land.  I make no bones about saying that Deputies can very easily imagine the propaganda certain groups would make if prosecutions were brought under Acts passed in the 14th century in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy O'Higgins had to say as to what the law is is very important and very significant because it is the belief of the Attorney General, and my advice, that what he said is perfectly correct theoretically.  Because of antiquity there may be slight errors here and there.  In effect, what he said was that forcible entry on land, more or less the same as set out in this Bill, was <Col N="644" /> first prevented by a statute passed in the fifth year of Richard II&mdash;the first statute, Chapter VII&mdash;now known as the Forcible Entry Act of 1381.  That Act was amended in the fifteenth year of Richard II by the Forcible Entry Act of 1391.  That, in turn, was further amended, and extended somewhat, by the Forcible Entry Act of 1429, the Eighth of Henry VI.</P>

      <P>We come then to three Irish statutes which are still technically on the Statute Book.  One was not referred to by Deputy O'Higgins, that was, the Forcible Entry Act of 1634, which extended specifically some parts of the earlier English statute.  This is apart from the general extension of Poynings Law to this country, and an Act which Deputy O'Higgins did refer to, the 26th of George III, the Forcible Entry Act of 1786.  The main effect of the Forcible Entry Act, 1786 was to convert what since 1381 had been a misdemeanour &mdash;forcible entry&mdash;into a felony and to make the penalty for it seven years penal servitude or seven years transportation. It is interesting and worthwhile that we should know that this has been the history of the law as applied in this country on this topic for the last seven centuries.</P>

He has been criticised for prosecuting people under an Act 100 years old.  If that is the case and if he can be criticised for that&mdash;and a very great deal of our current law is at least 100 years old&mdash; can he not very legitimately be criticised for prosecuting people under an Act 600 or 700 years old?

That only applies to certain Deputies opposite and I must congratulate Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde and Deputy Dockrell for the courage which they had in standing up here today and the last day to say that they agreed with the Bill.

    <P>I now come to what, so far as I am concerned, is a purely technical legal point and what I am quite certain Deputy O'Higgins knows quite well is a technical legal point&mdash;whether or not the Bill catches an overholding tenant or somebody in a similar position.  The point is a technical one so far as I am concerned because I have already made it clear in my introductory statement that the Bill was drafted on the basis that it would not apply to incidents that arise in the course of private disputes between persons having different <Col N="647" /> estates or interests in the same land, for example, between landlord and tenant or between mortgagor and mortgagee.</P>

      <P>If, in fact, the Bill does not give effect to that intention, it means that there would be need for a drafting amendment.  Deputy O'Higgins made the point that what the soldier said is not evidence but if the Deputy or anybody else will re-read with an open mind what I said in my introductory speech he will accept that what I said did not mean that I expected the House or anybody else to rely on an undertaking from me that the Act would not be used in that way.  What I said in effect was that the Bill was drafted with the intention of excluding such disputes and I am perfectly willing to amend the Bill if it is defective in that regard or even if the matter is only open to some doubt.  I am by no means sure that there is need for such an amendment. The offences created by the Bill do not <Col N="648" /> apply to the owner as that word is defined in the Bill.  The word is, in fact, very widely defined and includes any person having an &ldquo;interest&rdquo; in the land&mdash;the word &ldquo;land&rdquo;, of course, by definition includes buildings.  It seems to me, then, that the net question is whether an overholding tenant has an interest, within the meaning of section 1, in the premises.  I venture to suggest that if Deputy O'Higgins would only look at the matter for a moment from the non-political stance he would be prepared to concede that there is at least a very strong case for the proposition that such a person has an interest and that the argument for that proposition is strengthened by the fact that the Bill would be part of the criminal law, not the civil law, and that in any question of doubt, if there was a doubt, the doubt must be construed by the court against the prosecution.</P>

      <P>It is the only one I recall offhand.  I accept it if the Deputy says he gave two more.  A tenant in that situation would technically be an overholding tenant and it was not my intention in drafting the Bill that such a tenant could be or would be subject to the provisions of the Bill and I am prepared to put in whatever amendment is necessary.  I believe no amendment is necessary but if I am advised that there can be any doubt about the matter I am prepared to put in the necessary subsection to make that perfectly clear.</P>

When I was introducing the Bill, as I already reminded the House, I expressed my willingness to consider amendments. Deputy Clinton who spoke last tonight reminded me of that fact and hoped that I would act reasonably in considering all reasonable amendments that were put to me.  Naturally I assured him I would, as I meant what I said and I still mean it, but I want to refer to what Deputy O'Higgins said.  He having raised what I have already conceded to be a perfectly valid question of a technical, legal character&mdash;and I emphasise that it is of a technical legal character because my <Col N="650" /> intentions were already spelt out in my opening speech&mdash;when I expressed my willingness to deal with this point he proceeded to put it to me that I should withdraw the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I propose to make my speech notwithstanding any comments from the pink gallery.  This, however, does not end the matter.  Much as I dislike relying on hearsay evidence I feel justified in mentioning to the House that I have it on reliable authority that on a television programme last night the leading Fine Gael spokesman, Deputy Fitzpatrick, referred to my announced willingness to introduce this clarifying amendment in a way which suggested that I had admitted that the Bill needed major surgery.  I would like to put it to Deputies opposite who think that it is all right to engage in this kind of tactic that it <Col N="651" /> would be in all our interests if they would stop for a moment and reflect. Time and again Deputies opposite, including Deputy Clinton in his concluding sentences tonight, have pretended to be offended at what they have described as the intransigent attitude of Ministers when promoting legislation. They have complained that Ministers act as if it would be a blow to their prestige to change a line or a comma in a Bill as introduced and that Opposition Deputies are wasting their time in subjecting any Bill to analysis.</P>

      <P>I know quite well that there are Deputies who like to have it both ways.  I suppose they are not to be blamed for that if they can get away with it, but they cannot seriously expect to get away with it to the extent that we are now witnessing.  Deputies know that on very many occasions the question of whether or not an amendment need or need not be made is a matter of opinion and sometimes it is little more than a matter of tossing a coin.  I should like to see a situation in which it is open to me to consider an honestly held view or an honestly made criticism, or a reasoned suggestion for an amendment, without its then being thrown in my face, either by the Deputy concerned or one of his colleagues, that by considering such an amendment I am admitting that I blundered by introducing the Bill in the form in which I did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We on this side of the House have had to listen to lectures about the role of Dáil Éireann as a deliberative assembly for long enough.  I would invite those Deputies who engage in this sort of practice to ask themselves whether the role of Dáil Éireann, as such an assembly, in the examination of Bills brought before it is likely to be enhanced if the acceptance of an amendment is dealt with in the manner in which I have described.  Despite what I have said it is my intention to continue the policy, which I stated at the beginning, of listening to and giving the fullest consideration to criticisms made in good faith and on reasoned grounds.  I will continue this policy unless <Col N="652" /> I am forced to change it by Deputies opposite.  Should such a change be forced on me I would regard it as regrettable and I believe that the legislation going through this House, indeed all legislation, not just this Bill, would suffer.  There should be no need for such a situation.</P>

The fact is that in the last year of the second Coalition, in 1957, the number of houses built was 6,000 and there was no housing problem.  Indeed, on the contrary, there was a sort of housing problem inasmuch as there were so many empty houses that Dublin Corporation were a bit apprehensive about their ability to protect them.

At about 7.30 p.m. a number of men came to the flat.  They said they were members of the Dublin Housing Action Committee and they demanded entry. Naturally the two corporation officials refused to allow them in, whereupon the men simply broke down the door, in accordance with what I understand is the usual practice on the part of these people, and they entered the flat.  They moved the furniture in, they ejected the officials and brought back a person who apparently was the squatter and reinstated him in the flat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The next point I wish to deal with is the suggestion that has been made here and repeated by a number of speakers&mdash;I accept in good faith&mdash; that there is no need for this Bill because the rights of occupiers or of owners of property could be adequately protected by what some speakers described as a streamlining of the procedures of civil law.  I should like to make it quite clear that I would readily accept that this would be so if the problem with which we were faced were what it has been represented by Opposition speakers as being, namely, that we have individual homeless families out on the street and going into abandoned houses for shelter from the elements.  That is not the problem, and I have to say quite plainly that the speakers on the other side know perfectly well that it is not the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my introductory speech I referred to quasi-political groups and one Deputy interrupted and said: &ldquo;Why put a tooth in it?  Why not name Sinn Féin?&rdquo;  That I suppose is fair comment <Col N="658" /> but it is incomplete and inadequate. It is not the Sinn Féin organisation as such or its various divisions but the various front organisations that are the people really involved here.  If we are to go behind the various fronts put up and consider who is backing them, it is not enough to stop at Sinn Féin. This is the heart of the problem.  We are not dealing with the problem of squatting by individuals or of trespass on fisheries by individuals.  We are dealing with an organised and publicly proclaimed campaign by people against whom private individuals are afraid to invoke the processes of the civil law even if these processes were in themselves adequate.</P>
    <P>In this situation it is pointless to talk of streamlining the civil law.  We are dealing with a situation in which people are subject to intimidation of the crudest sort.  There are these groups who have quite openly decided to test how far they can go in the way of setting themselves up as judges of what other people are to be allowed to do. This, in its own way is a well thought out scheme.  If we are not to accept that situation, if we are to meet the challenge as this Bill meets it then these people can depend on it they will find Members of this House who will try to be all things to all men and to talk about what they call repressive legislation. They certainly, through what they say, give excellent propaganda to all these groups to which I have referred.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good idea. I was looking for my note on section 4. I cannot find it but I shall deal with the section as it stands.  Section 4 arises directly out of what I have just been saying about organised intimidation, about the groups behind the people who are put out in front.  As Deputies will have observed, where there is a scene to be made about the ejectment of a squatter, the squatter is usually a pregnant woman or a woman with young children or somebody for whom any normal human being would have immense sympathy.  However, that <Col N="659" /> person who is squatting is not doing so voluntarily.  The tragedy is that these people are squatting because they are put in there.  I would be foolish if I thought I would solve many problems by dealing in this Bill solely with those who actually squat.  I am more than well aware that those who actually squat are very often the least guilty of all.  In many cases, I suppose, there is genuine hardship.  In other cases there is genuine hardship but notwithstanding their hardship these people would still not squat were they not encouraged or forced to do so by certain shadowy groups in the background.  The real villains in this situation are not the unfortunate and pathetic people who have run into hardship and misfortune but the quasi-political, quasi-subversive groups who operate all the time in the background, who make sure they will get other people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised this matter on the Adjournment because of serious acts of violence, particularly the most recent one which occurred at Lifford last week.  I had this question down to the Minister before the Christmas <Col N="662" /> recess and because of the large number of questions on the Order Paper it was not reached today.  I therefore asked the Chair's permission to raise it on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>I can see a serious situation arising around the Border areas, due to the fact that the Government have accepted the Conroy Report which has reduced the working hours of the gardaí from 48 to 42.  The minimum number of hours a garda was required to work before the introduction of the Conroy report was 48, but we all know from personal experience that the gardaí were working anything from 60 to 70 hours, yet the Government have not increased the number of personnel needed to make up the deficit because of the hours now being worked by the gardaí.  The Conroy Report also recommended off-time of seven days per 28 days or a four-week month whereas the old regulations allowed two off-days in every calendar month.</P>
      <P>We have heard a great deal of talk from the Government about standing idly by on matters that do not affect the everyday life of this country but the Minister for Justice is denying that there is any need to increase the Garda force because he believes that the up-to-date radio communication which the Department of Justice have made available to all gardaí is adequate to deal with the everyday disturbances which occur.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's written reply he stated:</P>
      <P>I make no secret of the fact that, like every other Minister for Justice before me, I would like to see more gardaí available but, as a member of a Government, I recognise that the resources of the community are limited and that there are many competing demands on the Exchequer.  I believe that, in general, the present position in rural areas is not bad but it is my hope that I can improve it.</P>
      <P>The Minister is here admitting that because of financial resources he is not prepared to increase the number of gardaí for the maintenance of law and order.  The Government are standing idly by while people in Border areas are living on their nerves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> Last Tuesday morning in Lifford the customs post was blown up by, if we are to use our own logic, most likely the UVF.  These people came across the Border, blew up the customs post, but they did not go back across the Border because it is too well guarded in the North.  Instead they made their way into Donegal and escaped through another route.  The Minister has told us that the up-to-date communications are adequate to meet any demands made on the gardaí at this particular time.  The last 12 months has been an exciting time for this country.  The Minister has told this House that the modern radio communications which he has provided for gardaí are adequate and that it is unnecessary for him to increase the number of personnel in the force.  I claim that the present communications equipment is most inadequate and in many cases obsolete and in some cases it is not even in working order.</P>
    <P>I should like to relate to the House a story which is common gossip in Donegal which relates to an incident in Derry on 26th August last year when the Munster and Leinster Bank was raided and robbed at 2.50 p.m. The Donegal gardaí from Buncrana were at the Border post at 3 o'clock but the raiders escaped by some other route.  The garda had to use a public telephone coin box because of the substandard radio communication equipment he had.  The raiders are known to the members of Saor Éire.  The car they used was stolen from York Street car park, Dublin that day and it was later found abandoned in a bog outside Buncrana on the same day.  Three men walked into a public house in Buncrana at 8 o'clock that evening and one of them was later identified by the publican as being one of the wanted men.  Another was known by the gardaí and was wanted in connection with Garda Fallon's murder.  His name is O'Donnell.</P>

      <P>The three men stole a car in Buncrana that night and abandoned it in Raphoe.  They stole a third car and abandoned it in Donegal town, where they stole a fourth car which they abandoned in Mullingar.  It appears that they then made their way back to Dublin by public transport or some other method.  The position is then that three men stole a car in Dublin, robbed a bank in Derry, jumped the Border in Donegal, abandoned the car and spent a couple of hours in a public house singing Irish ballads, stole three cars in County Donegal and were back in the city of Dublin within 24 hours.  There is only one exit from County Donegal to the rest of the Republic unless one goes across the Border and I do not imagine if they were as shrewd as I think they are that they would have taken that route.</P>
      <P>The man wanted in connection with Garda Fallon's murder was in the custody of the Dublin gardaí at an earlier date, not long after Garda Fallon's death, but was released.  On whose instruction was this man let go? What effort has since been made to re-arrest him?  The point I am making is that if the Donegal police force had had a sufficient number of men available on the day of the Derry bank robbery they could have combed the Innishowen area and prevented these three robbers from escaping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tells us that because of the up-to-date radio communication it is completely unnecessary for him to spend money because he says the resources of the community are limited. He will stand idly by and will not increase the number of gardaí despite the fact, and it is an open secret, that every officer in the police force in the Republic of Ireland is telling the Minister through his Department that while the force at the moment are going <Col N="665" /> through what could be described as a honeymoon period after the introduction of the Conroy Report sooner or later these men will rebel again unless the Minister increases the strength.</P>
    <P>My information is that at least one bank in County Donegal has installed an alarm system which sounds in the local Garda barracks if the bank is raided but the local Garda barracks closes at six o'clock and does not open until nine o'clock the following morning. I could name that barracks but for reasons which are obvious to Members of the Dáil I do not wish to name it. This is the type of thing that alarms me and makes people uneasy in County Donegal and in the border areas generally but I am speaking generally on County Donegal having been elected to represent that county and my remarks deal exclusively with Donegal.</P>
    <P>We had another incident in the autumn of the year.  In the town of Lifford the Rehabilitation Institute had the official opening of their centre and many gardaí were called in to the town to help with traffic arrangements.  Six hours later there was a bus robbery within three miles of the town of Lifford and we could not get a garda. This is not any reflection on the members of the Force who serve there, it is a reflection on the Department of Justice and on the Government who have failed to implement the contents of the Conroy Report in full by increasing the numbers required.  The sooner this is done the better.</P>
    <P>The radio system that is available to the gardaí in Donegal can only be described as ludicrous.  It has been described to me by a member of the Garda Síochána as being ridiculous. He pointed out that the ESB can communicate quite clearly with Sligo but the radio used by the Garda cannot contact a patrol car even two or three miles outside a town.  This is the type of radio communication which the Minister says is adequate to meet the recommendations of the Conroy Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not admit what I am claiming is in his written reply?  In July, 1969, an incident took place in the peninsula of Fanad in the Northern part of Donegal. A caravan was taken out by what could be described as the super-republican section of our community. I hope the Minister recognises who I am taking about, without naming them.  They pulled this caravan out of its parking plot and pushed it down to the shore where it was taken out by the tide and then they courageously fired a few bullets into it. The owner of the vehicle, who comes from Northern Ireland, came back to recover it and while it was being towed from Ramelton to Letterkenny it was blown up and we had another heroic blow for Ireland by our super-Republican heroes.  The people responsible have not been brought to justice despite the fact that they are commonly known to people in the Fanad area. It is high time the Minister who has just finished speaking at length on the squatting Bill instructed someone at senior level to bring these people to justice.  That was last year.  This year, a fortnight or three weeks ago, a reverend gentleman's home was almost destroyed by a stick of gelignite.  Nobody has yet been arrested for that and if <Col N="667" /> the Minister tells me that the radio communications are adequate to meet the need for increased personnel in our Garda Force it does not appear to be the case.</P>
      <P>In the last few months we have had acts of violence on both sides of the Border.  On one occasion a British newspaper reporter telephoned me to ask me, because of my close connection with the Lifford and Strabane area, what I thought of the Strabane bank robbery.  The Belfast bank was robbed on the 28th September at 11 a.m. and £4,000 was stolen.  Those thieves were across the Border within two minutes.  Immediately they got across the Border they were free, again because of lack of communication. Token chase was offered by a customs patrol car which went in pursuit but just could not catch up with the criminals.  When I was asked for my comments I said that if the police on the Northern side of the Border had been allowed&mdash;if this Government would enter into reciprocal arrangements or rather recognise that irrespective of whether one is Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, Nationalist or Unionist, every person born of Irish parents in this 32 County island is an Irishman&mdash; if we could recognise that despite the fact that one group of Irishmen wear a different police uniform from what we would like them to wear, if we were big enough to say: &ldquo;If you in the course of your duty find it necessary to cross into our territory in giving chase to bank robbers or other criminals and stay with them until they are arrested by the local gardaí you are free and welcome to do so&rdquo; then we might attempt to restore law and order to some degree.  In return if our police force could follow the same type of criminals into the Six Counties we would be achieving something. Perhaps it might not be a bad thing if we could come to some agreement with the Northern Government so that the police forces on both sides of the Border could wear similar types of uniform.  In that case it might not be as repulsive to people this side of the Border to look at an RUC uniform or for some people North of the Border to look at a Garda uniform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="668" /> Other things have happened.  The Ballyshannon transformer was attacked. We had the incident in Rossnowlagh. We had the RTE aerial at Raphoe attacked.  We have dance halls closing down all over the county because the Garda personnel cannot maintain law and order.  My local parish priest had to close down the local dance hall which has been going since I went to dances as a boy.  This is because law and order cannot be maintained.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice will be doing less than his duty if he does not take a serious view of what I am saying and immediately increase the Garda Force.  It is no secret that every Garda officer is telling the Minister through his Department that more men are needed.  The Letterkenny division, the one with which I am directly concerned, would need at least 12 extra men and we have I think, five divisions in Donegal.  Therefore between 50 and 60 Gardaí are needed to police the County of Donegal properly and if the Minister for Justice is still not satisfied &mdash;and I will not be satisfied with less &mdash;he should speak to the Minister for Defence and call on the Defence Forces to protect public buildings along the Border areas.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that is scarcely accurate. Border counties such as Donegal are in a somewhat more special position that other rural counties.  For that reason I am afraid that I am not as prepared as I would like to be to deal with a great deal of what the Deputy has been saying.  In particular, I find it difficult to reply adequately to the type of speech which the Deputy made&mdash;I am not blaming him for this because presumably this is what he wanted to say&mdash;but it is difficult to reply adequately to a speech about a <Col N="669" /> considerable number of cases of specific crimes at specific places on specific dates.

      <P>Deputy Harte referred in particular to some crimes in which he said it was well-known by the people in the locality who had committed the crimes, but that the Government and the gardaí were not prepared to arrest and prosecute these people.  The gardaí will arrest and prosecute the perpetrator of any crime where they have sufficient evidence and a <i>prima facie</i> case.  I am glad to hear from Deputy Harte, in relation to these particular crimes to which he referred especially, that he and many people in the locality know who committed them.  I assume, therefore, that they are in a position to afford to the gardaí sufficient legal proof to enable them to arrest and prosecute these people.  I would say to Deputy Harte and to those other people in the locality, with whom he had discussed the matter, that it is their duty as citizens to go to the gardaí and to volunteer statements. I hope that Deputy Harte and his friends will do that.  The gardaí will be only too happy to act on such statements.</P>

They are working on the replanning and establishment of a proper, up-to-date and effective radio network to cover the entire Twenty-six Counties.

I am absolutely satisfied that as a result of this operation, which I have initiated, much of the work will, I hope, be carried out in the coming financial year.
