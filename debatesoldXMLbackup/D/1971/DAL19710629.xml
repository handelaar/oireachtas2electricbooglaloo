      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he will make a statement on the speech made by Mr. Brian Faulkner to the Parliament of Northern Ireland on 22nd June, 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the speech of Mr. Faulkner and the debate which took place in Stormont last week.  Both sides expressed their views on fundamental issues.  Both sides also expressed their views on the administration of the north and it is essential that this, for the future, should be in conformity with the Downing Street Declaration.</P>
      <P>In this respect it would be in accordance with the spirit of the Downing Street Declaration and would be a gauge of sincerity on the part of the Unionist Government if it were made clear that sectarian parades will no longer be permitted in areas where they are not wanted by the local people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this speech of Mr. Faulkner may represent a small step forward towards normal administration of that area, leading to some greater degree of participation by opposition elements, would the Taoiseach agree that the time is now opportune for a meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister to decide on the broad, forward, advance programme for complete normalisation in the politics of the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think one need necessarily associate the suggestions made by Mr. Faulkner and the meeting between Mr. Heath and me. Mr. Faulkner's proposals came in the course of a speech and were directed at the representatives of the minority in Stormont.  It would be for the minority representatives to react and to show their reactions to Mr. Faulkner's proposals in the first instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, following the recent Dublin visit of the Northern Ireland Economic Development Committee for general discussions on trade and industry, a reciprocal meeting will take place in Belfast; and whether as yet any schedule of ministerial meetings has been arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to comment on the details of meetings of this nature as to do so would not be conducive to the development of conversations which must remain confidential in their initial stages.  I understand that the Northern Ireland Economic Development Committee were not seeking any publicity for the visit of their representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down this question following a report which appeared in the <i>Financial Times</i> on the 23rd June.  This report referred to this meeting and to a subsequent Belfast meeting.  I am merely interested in something that has been referred to on many occasions by representatives here, namely, the areas of broad economic co-operation which the Taoiseach may now see opening up.  Can the Taoiseach give the House some information about whether any advance has been made in these broad areas of co-operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the specific visit to which the Deputy referred was more in the nature of a study mission rather than a visit concerned with economic co-operation as such.  Certain of our agencies, including the Sugar Company, were anxious and willing to help this study group in giving them information which they were seeking about economic development in the north.  These agencies, including Córas Tráchtála, were very glad to be of assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Was any attention given to the suggestion about certain Border areas having common authorities to forward economic planning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy has in mind refers to a previous visit by representatives of the Stormont administration, as such, who visited their <Col N="4" /> counterparts here some weeks ago.  The outcome of that visit, which apparently is based on an agreed report, will be pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the various State agencies on this side of the Border are to be given the green light in regard to further talks with their counterparts in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question whatever of permission.  The State agencies which were visited by this recent study group never sought, nor were given, permission.  It was always implied that they would get it in matters of co-operation like this.  There is no necessity to give any green light because it is there all the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the or any other member of the Government conferred with the Stormont Minister for Community Relations during his recent visit to Dublin; and, if so, the nature of the discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Stormont Minister for Community Relations did not meet a member of the Government during his recent visit to Dublin nor did he seek a meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the creation of a Ministry of Marine is under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the allocation of functions and responsibilities to Government Departments has been the subject of a detailed examination and report by the public services organisation review group. The recommendations include a proposal that the marine works, harbours and inland waterways functions of the Office of Public Works should be transferred to a new Department of Transport and Communications and linked up in that Department with the present marine functions of the Department of Transport and Power.  Apart from these recommendations, the creation of a Ministry of Marine as such is not under consideration by the Government. The recommendations of the review group are at present under examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the recent negotiations appear to give a new importance to the whole area that would come under a Ministry of Marine?  Would the Taoiseach agree that in any rationalisation of Government functions at Cabinet level there is a stronger case to be made now than there was a year ago for the establishment of a separate Ministry of Marine, with the latest announcements of possible mineral developments on the continental shelf and the new importance of our fisheries? Would the Taoiseach agree that, quite apart from the Devlin Report, there is a strong case to be made for the creation of a Ministry of Marine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy in the first part of the supplementary question asked did I agree that there was a stronger case now than there was a year ago for the creation of a separate Ministry of Marine.  I would agree with that but I would not like to comment on how much stronger it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In the present Cabinet there is at least one Ministry that before the end of this year or next year may not have as important a function as it now has.  The Land Commission have decreased in importance.  I am not referring to change of personnel, but I am asking whether a Ministry of Marine would not seem to be called for in any disappearance of any particular ministerial function?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going again as far as I can with the Deputy in saying there is a stronger case now for more attention being paid to marine matters because of the circumstances referred to by the Deputy, but I would not like to say that a Minister of Marine as such would be necessary in order to perform the functions that would be involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in reply to a question of the 1st June, an informal committee was set up by the Government to plan and organise the national commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Truce, and its first meeting took place on the 18th January last.  No cost arose in relation to the meetings of the committee.  In view of the nature of the committee's work, the necessity for a formal report does not arise.</P>

    <P>The EEC prices are taken from the latest report on prices issued by the statistical office of the European Community. They were derived from an inquiry into retail prices in larger specialised shops and departmental <Col N="10" /> stores in April, 1970.

    <P>The price data available for Ireland are the national average retail prices used in the compilation of the consumer price index.  They differ in scope from the special purpose prices available for the EEC countries and may not be directly comparable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The estimated value, excluding livestock changes, at Irish ex-farm prices of the output of livestock&mdash;excluding horses&mdash;and dairy products&mdash;including eggs&mdash;is about £259 million in respect of 1970.  Of this total the estimated value of products consumed on farms without process of sale is about £12 million and the estimated value of sales for home consumption is about £83 million.  These figures which are preliminary estimates are subject to revision.  The exports of these commodities (including live cattle) at f.o.b. prices amounted to £146.9 million in 1970.  The aggregates of output and exports are derived from detailed returns covering a large number of items.  It is not possible from the information available to re-value these aggregates in the way requested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We have a case for seeking these incentives on their own merit because of the position of our economy in transition from agriculture to industry.  From the point of view of regional development there certainly is a very strong case for having them.</P>

These were done at the last meeting.  We also did the transitional period for the reduction of tariff barriers and for our accession to the common agricultural policy.

In the circumstances I propose to limit my reply to the question to a brief summary of the present position.  At my meeting with the Communities on 7th June, agreement was reached on a number of matters of major importance for us.  These are the financing of our agricultural exports by the Community from the date of accession, the preservation of Anglo-Irish free trade, and control of dumping.  Deputies were informed of the outcome of that meeting in a note circulated on 8th June. There have also been important developments in regard to fisheries.  As I informed Deputies last week, the Community has agreed to discussions with all the applicant countries next month.</P>
      <P>Other matters of major importance to us are in an advanced stage of examination by the Communities, including the questions of the motor assembly industry, export tax reliefs and animal and plant health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before considering the board's proposals for increased charges, I considered it necessary to have as clear information as possible on the out-turn for the board's profit and loss account for the year ended 31st March, 1971.  The months January to March cover the board's most critical revenue period and final information on revenue in this period did not become available until billings for the March-April accounting period were prepared last month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the ESB press announcement of 21st June, 1971, concerning electricity tariff increases which stated that while it was envisaged that a further increase in tariffs would be necessary within 12 months, the extent of any such increase would depend on the trend of costs, especially fuel costs, during the intervening period and on the degree of success attending the efforts being made at national level to control wage and salary inflation.</P>

      <Col N="33" /> I am not, therefore, in a position at this juncture to forecast what further increase in charges may be necessary over the next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed the Minister and the Government take a very close interest in this whole matter.  I said in my reply last week that were it not for a Government decision this increase would have been substantially higher but the ESB were limited to 7 per cent to cover their deficit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was.  The ESB had a deficit of 2½ million and that was covered by a 7 per cent increase all round.  There were variations, of course, but the average of 7 per cent covered the deficit.  There is a statutory obligation on the ESB to discharge this.</P>

The question of oil supplies, which form a 50 per cent part of the ESB supply situation, will be re-negotiated before the end of this year.  These negotiations will be coming up shortly and I would ask the House not to jeopardise those negotiations in any way.</P>

A comprehensive hydrographic survey of Irish coastal waters must await the establishment of an Irish hydrographic service.  As I have already said in reply to similar questions on 29th October, 1970, the question of the establishment of an Irish hydrographic service is one for the Minister for Defence, who I understand has the matter under consideration.</P>

Does it also come under his Department, or does this consideration merely mean that the Department of Defence will have further discussions with the British Ministry of Defence to see whether we can borrow one or two ships from them in order that we might continue the survey which was so unfortunately terminated in Bantry recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reciprocal arrangements on unemployment benefit between this country and Great Britain so restrict the transfer of insurance contributions as to limit any resulting entitlement to 26 days duration. These arrangements are based on the existing agreement between the two Governments and were the best it proved possible to conclude.  My Department, however, has recently been engaged in fresh discussions with the British authorities on this and other matters of reciprocity.  While the outcome of the new negotiations must, of course, depend on mutual agreement, it is hoped that they will result in more favourable arrangements for unemployment benefit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank keeps its policy in regard to the management of the external reserves under constant review.  Any changes in relevant circumstances arising consequent on accession to the EEC will be taken into account in the normal way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not directly but, as the Deputy knows, the question of the reserve role of sterling was raised and the British Government have indicated their agreement in principle to the alteration in the status of sterling as a reserve currency and also the programme for economic and monetary <Col N="50" /> union in the EEC has a considerable bearing on this question.  It is quite clear from what has happened that there will be a great deal of negotiation within the EEC on these matters but these negotiations are unlikely to take place before our entry into the EEC; in fact, they will not, so, therefore, we will be taking an active part in these negotiations but they are a long way ahead and I could not forecast what is likely to happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask whether the amount we have in Britain more than compensates for what we borrow abroad and whether the interest we are receiving on the amounts in Britain are in excess of the interest we pay on borrowings from abroad?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I could not answer that question offhand but the principle which I think the Deputy has in mind is not correct because logically, if one follows up what I think he has in mind, we would then have no external assets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware of the dispute between the managers of branch creameries and the Dairy Disposal Board; and that the managers propose to strike from Thursday next with consequent hardship to milk suppliers; and what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the Dairy Disposal Company Limited of this dispute and threatened strike in the case of a group of assistant managers and branch managers employed at some of the Company's creameries.  This group, through their union, have, I understand, rejected a substantial salary increase recommended by the Labour Court.  The increase which has been offered has already been accepted through the Irish Creamery Managers' Association by all assistant and branch managers at co-operative creameries and at the remainder of the Dairy Disposal Company's creameries.</P>
      <P>I would very much regret if the proposed strike took place in the circumstances, with the serious hardship which it would inevitably involve for milk suppliers in the areas concerned. Should however the strike eventuate I will of course consider whatever action it may be open to me to take in the situation that will obtain.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> When a method of producing self-sustaining nuclear fission was first achieved during the course of the Second World War its first application was to produce a devastating weapon of war.  Since then, progress in nuclear science and technology has made possible some revolutionary contributions to the material and humanitarian advancement of the world.  The most obvious example of this progress is in the development of nuclear power plants which are now in many countries providing a safe and reliable method of producing electric power in competition with traditional methods. Research into nuclear power continues at a very intensive rate throughout the world with the present emphasis on fission reactors fueled with natural fissile material generally in an enriched form.  The next development will be the production of commercial breeder reactors utilising as fuel virtually inexhaustible supplies of fertile material such as uranium 238 or thorium. Further ahead is a prospect of controlled fusion which could give access to the potential energy in the heavy hydrogen in the oceans of the world.</P>
    <P>Apart from the production of power, nuclear science has made progress in a multitude of beneficial applications based on radioisotopes.  These have been of great value in research, in medical diagnosis and treatment, in food preservation, in various agricultural uses, in quality control in industry and in the development of new products generally.  It can be said that nuclear science has contributed and will continue to contribute materially to the alleviation of suffering and hardship and in improving the lot of mankind generally.  Nuclear science has, therefore, a tremendous potential for good as well as for evil and the efforts of various international bodies have been directed more and more in recent years towards increasing the peaceful uses of atomic energy while ensuring the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.  I am glad to say that different Ministers for Foreign Affairs of this country have taken an active part in these international activities. The bringing into force in the past year of the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was a successful <Col N="58" /> outcome to a resolution pioneered by Ireland at the United Nations Assembly in 1961.</P>
    <P>The development of nuclear power reactors is continually improving.  In recent times the more advanced countries have been able to commission nuclear reactors competitive in price with power stations based on the traditional fossil fuels&mdash;coal and fuel oil. Nuclear power stations have very high capital costs with relatively low fuel costs.  The capital cost per unit of output decreases with overall size and hence the larger sized units offer the best competitive performance as compared with oil fired units.</P>
    <P>Experience in the electricity industry shows, however, that it is wiser not to have too much generating capacity, say not more than about 10 per cent of the peak load, concentrated in a single generating unit because of the effect of a breakdown in a large unit.  Normally an electricity supply company increase their generating unit size in steps as their load develops taking advantage of the experience already gained by larger supply companies in the size ranges chosen.  Thus the ESB at present operate with 60 megawatt units as the largest size in a system with total capacity of about 1,400 megawatts. The demand for electricity has been growing for some years at the rate of 10 per cent to 11 per cent a year so that it is necessary to double generating capacity every seven or eight years bringing the probable capacity at the end of this decade to about 3,000 megawatts.  With this expansion, the capacity of the board's system to accommodate larger units than the present maximum of 60 megawatts will increase.  The board will commission the first 120 megawatt unit this year and the first 250 megawatt unit in 1975.  The most economical nuclear generating stations being planned at present are in the range of 1,000 to 1,200 megawatts and upwards and, of course, there can be no question of commissioning any individual unit of this size in Ireland for many years to come.  Technical progress in recent years, however, is succeeding in reducing the size of a nuclear plant which <Col N="59" /> can compete with traditional generating methods.  I am aware that some smaller countries are now commissioning nuclear plants in the 350-500 megawatt region and they claim that these smaller plants are both economic and competitive.</P>
    <P>With such small nuclear plants in operation and with the board's growing capability to accommodate larger units in their generating system the time has now come for us in Ireland to plan the commissioning of a medium-size nuclear generating station which, on the one hand, will not be unduly large in relation to total generating capacity and, on the other hand, will be sufficiently efficient to compete with oil-fired plants.</P>
    <P>From a broad security aspect also it is desirable that the ESB should diversify their fuel sources, since at present just over 50 per cent of total electricity production in Ireland is based on fuel oil and, without diversification, this proportion could grow to 80 per cent or so before the end of this decade.  Of course, the fuel for a nuclear station will have to be procured from abroad but we can claim that diversification by way of nuclear power stations will add to the security of the electricity supply.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that there is an inter-connection between our ESB system and the Northern Ireland system. This connection allows a saving in installed capacity on both systems while maintaining the same standard of security.  As far as a nuclear plant is concerned the existence of this inter-connection will allow the individual size of a generating unit to be increased, since the risk of losing one of the units can be covered by the insurance provided by inter-connection.</P>
    <P>On a power system the spinning reserve, that is, the spare generating capacity available immediately it is required, must at all times be capable of compensating for the loss of the largest unit on load.  The size of the nuclear station we can build in relation to our total capacity would, therefore, require that running cover would have to be spread over the two systems both north <Col N="60" /> and south as a precaution against a breakdown in the station.  This presupposes the existence of detailed planning of running schedules by both authorities on a complementary basis. It would be impossible for either north or south to proceed with the establishment of such a station without an understanding with its neighbour.  This type of understanding has already evolved arising from the existence of the interconnection.  Each party is now fully aware of the plans of the other in the matter of generation programmes.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear to the House that no decision has been taken to build a nuclear station.  The ESB have for some years past been training engineers in nuclear work and they are at present engaged in a detailed examination of the technical, economic, social and financial problems connected with the installation and operation of a nuclear station.  All aspects of the project will require most careful consideration by the board; and the advice of the new Nuclear Energy Board will be required before the Government can take a decision.  In particular, the provision of capital funds to finance the station may present difficulties.</P>
    <P>If in due course, a decision is taken to build a station, the siting of such a station will be a matter to be determined primarily by technical criteria such as the availability at the site of very large amounts of cooling water and its proximity to the electrical system load centres.  The site should also have suitable foundations and geological characteristics and should be located where the station will cause a minimum disturbance to local amenities and ecology.  When the suitability of the various sites has been assessed, a decision on the site to be chosen will be reached in the light of the expert advice of the Electricity Supply Board and the new Nuclear Energy Board.</P>
    <P>The establishment of an Irish Nuclear Energy Board has been under consideration at different times.  The Atomic Energy Committee report published in May, 1958, and presented to the Oireachtas, suggested that an atomic <Col N="61" /> energy board should be established with responsibility for the operation of a research reactor and for other matters pertaining to the development of nuclear energy.  In the circumstances of the time, however the Government felt that there were very few advantages to be gained by setting up the suggested board and acquiring a training reactor.  A further committee, the members of which were drawn from the universities, the Electricity Supply Board, the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, An Foras Forbartha and various interested Government Departments reported in 1966 in regard to the setting up of a nuclear energy board and, in particular, in relation to the composition and functions of such a board.  The recommendations of this committee are incorporated in the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the primary functions of the board should be that of keeping themselves informed of developments in nuclear energy and associated matters with particular reference to the implications for the State of such developments, and to act as a competent source of advice for the Government and Ministers of State. Particular functions being given to the board, as set out in section 5 (1) of the Bill, include advising the Government or any scientific body interested in nuclear science on the acquisition of nuclear reactors or other radioactive devices for training or research purposes and, if such reactors or devices are acquired, on all aspects of their location, installation, operation and supervision.  The board will also offer similar advice on proposals for the construction of nuclear power stations. In addition, they may prepare draft safety codes and regulations dealing with fissile fuel, radioactive substances and devices and irradiating apparatus taking into account relevant standards recommended by international bodies dealing with nuclear energy and they can, if requested by me, ensure compliance with any such safety codes or regulations.  The board may offer advice regarding representation of the State on international bodies dealing with nuclear energy and may maintain <Col N="62" /> such direct relations with such bodies as may be agreed.  A particular function of the board will be to promote knowledge, proficiency and research in nuclear science and technology and to act as an agency for the collection and dissemination of information on matters relating to nuclear science.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is not proposed to assign regulatory functions directly to the board but provision is being made for the assignment from time to time of specific functions agreed with the particular Minister concerned.  During the debate in the Seanad, fears were expressed that in practice this would mean that Ministers with statutory powers of control over radioactive materials would continue to exercise such powers to the detriment of the status of the board.  A number of Senators felt very strongly on this point and contended that the opportunity provided by the enactment of this Bill should be taken to centralise all such controls in the board.  My following remarks are intended to reassure the House on this point.</P>
    <P>At present control over radioactive substances, irradiating apparatus and the safe disposal of radioactive waste products is vested in the Minister for Health under the Health Act, 1953. The Minister for Labour has also, under the Factories Act, 1955, powers of control over radioactive substances and apparatus in so far as these constitute a risk to factory workers.  There is a duality of functions here between the two Ministers which will be further complicated by the fact that wide powers of control over radioactive materials and apparatus are being vested in me under section 6 of the Bill for eventual assignment to the Board. The intention of the Bill as introduced in the Seanad was to leave the position open so that the board, when set up, would assist in rationalising the situation. However, in view of the opinions expressed in the Seanad I have amended the Bill to enhance the independent position of the board and to facilitate the eventual transfer to them of the control of radioactive substances and irradiating apparatus.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill as amended the board will not be confined to offering their <Col N="63" /> advice on nuclear matters in response to requests by the Government or Ministers of State for such advice, as was originally envisaged.  They will instead be able to offer advice irrespective of such requests and not alone to the Government or Ministers of State but also to interested scientific groups. They can also prepare safety codes on their own initiative.  Of more significance, however, is the fact that section 5 (2) of the Bill, which is the section under which I can assign functions to the board, has been revised to enable me to require the board to ensure compliance with any safety regulations under the Health Act, 1953 or the Factories Act, 1955 dealing with the use of such radioactive substances or devices.  Moreover, these Acts are being amended by this Bill to enable the enforcement of such regulations to be effected by officers of the Nuclear Energy Board.  The assumption by the board of such responsibilities must, however, be gradual.  The Minister for Labour has, I understand, prepared regulations, which are likely to be made shortly, to protect factory workers from excessive radiation and he has had personnel trained in the use of equipment for enforcing these regulations. The Minister for Labour will, therefore, be able shortly to exercise a fair measure of control over dangerous emissions of radiation in factories.  The board, on the other hand, even with the best will in the world, would obviously take some time before they would be in a position to operate controls of this kind.  Briefly, the situation is that we are not yet able to centralise control of nuclear matters in the board but the mechanism whereby this can be done as required, is being provided by this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the board shall consist of not more than seven part-time members to be appointed for periods of office not exceeding five years.  The board will appoint their own staff.  I envisage that the initial staff will be fairly limited in number but as developments take place and additional functions are assigned to the board from time to time that the staff will be expanded to keep pace with requirements.  It is proposed that the <Col N="64" /> board will be given an annual grant towards their expenses.  The board will be required to submit an annual report which will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>What it is sought to achieve in this Bill, therefore, is to establish a board which will be a source of competent advice particularly for the Government and Ministers of State on all matters arising out of nuclear sciences and which will be given additional executive functions as required from time to time within the limits set by the Bill.</P>
    <P>It has been the experience in many other countries in dealing with nuclear control that the passage of time makes necessary the introduction of amending legislation and I have little doubt but that when the board have had some years of experience they also will be recommending the introduction of new control measures.  At some future stage then it will be necessary for us to amend and expand the provisions set out in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been carefully scrutinised in the Seanad and a number of suggestions were made to improve it in its legal and technical aspects.  I was happy to introduce the necessary amendments to meet these suggestions. The Seanad has expressed itself as quite pleased with the Bill as it now stands and I can confidently recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess I have been surprised by the Minister's introductory speech for a number of reasons.  The tone of the speech today differs from the tone of recent statements he has made in relation to the development of nuclear energy and the establishment of a nuclear power plant.  His recent statements indicated that the intention was to proceed with the erection of a nuclear power plant which would be operational in 1978. Perhaps the Minister is more honest than some of his colleagues because now he admits to financial difficulties. During the course of his speech today the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>I wish to make it clear to the House that no decision has been taken to build a nuclear station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> Later in the speech he stated:</P>
    <P>All aspects of the project will require most careful consideration by the board;</P>
    <P>That is fair enough but he then mentions something which has not been stated in any previous speech either in the other House or outside, namely, that the provision of capital funds to finance the station may present difficulty. This seems an extraordinary situation because in addition to reading the debates in the Seanad I have been making inquiries into the matter from people who are directly involved in the project and it appears that the green light was given to go ahead and to plan for a nuclear power station in 1978.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the brevity of the Minister's speech.  This legislation deals with what could be described as the most complex scientific and technological subject in the world today. The Minister has left unanswered a considerable number of questions.  This brings me to the comment I have made here in relation to other technical measures and the difficulties of Deputies, particularly Opposition spokesmen, in dealing with such matters. We have not access to the departmental experts or other sources of advice available to the Minister and to a large extent, we must rely on the Minister's opening statement.  I admit the fact that this Bill originated in the Seanad has been a help but if Bills dealing with such technical subjects continue to be introduced, a system must be devised which will enable members of the Opposition parties particularly to carry out research and to have access to information that will enable them to inform themselves adequately.</P>
    <P>We are asked to pronounce judgment on the desirability or otherwise of proceeding with the establishment of a nuclear energy board.  I do not know if any Deputy is technically qualified to speak on nuclear energy&mdash;certainly I am not&mdash;but all of us are capable of reading material and of doing a certain amount of research.  Having regard to the information available in the Minister's statement today, it is impossible to engage in a detailed discussion of <Col N="66" /> the matter or to give this complex subject the attention it deserves.  I hope in the not too distant future we will have in operation a parliamentary committee system which will enable technical legislation to be considered and studied in a detailed manner.  This is the third Bill the Minister for Transport and Power has introduced in the past fortnight; first, we had a shipping Bill, last week we dealt with the Bill in connection with transport and now we have the Nuclear Energy Bill.  It is a compliment to the Minister that he is bringing so much legislation before the House but I do not regard the method adopted as satisfactory.  I do not like expressing a judgement in this House on any subject unless I have studied it and am satisfied with the validity of the viewpoints I express.</P>
    <P>Although we are now considering the question of nuclear energy, from what the Minister has said today I am somewhat sceptical about our having a nuclear power station by 1978.  There is no doubt that the development of nuclear science and technology has been dramatic.  It has been the result of years of painstakingly brilliant research by the world's leading scientists and technologists.  Unfortunately, in most people's minds the subject of nuclear energy is associated with the horrors of war, particularly with the devastation caused by the atomic bomb.  When we are embarking on a programme of nuclear development for power purposes, it is vital that the public should be informed on all its implications.</P>
    <P>There is a massive public relations job confronting the Minister, the Government and, in particular, the nuclear energy board when it is established.  It is important that the fears of the people should be allayed and they must be informed that nuclear science and power is not only the dreadful instrument of destruction we have read about.  It must be brought home to them that nuclear science has also made a tremendous contribution in many fields of human endeavour.  I would mention in particular the contribution to medicine, to industry and to agriculture.  Nuclear science has been of tremendous value in research, <Col N="67" /> in medical diagnosis and treatment, in food preservation, in various agricultural uses, in quality control in industry and in the development of new products.</P>
    <P>Perhaps its greatest contribution has been in the development of power; in this connection it has been so successful that now it is the major source of power and energy in many parts of the world.  It is estimated that in 15 to 20 years time some two-thirds of the total power and energy requirements of the European Economic Community will be met from nuclear science.  Nuclear power stations appear to be the order of the day.  The Minister is proposing in this measure, as an initial step, the establishment of a nuclear energy board to advise on all aspects of this science for the provision of power and energy.  The amount of reading and research I have done from the limited sources available to me have convinced me that the decision to establish a nuclear power station here is a sensible decision.  The establishment of such a station is practicable, feasible and logical.  We have no option but to proceed with this project.  On the arguments for and against I believe the arguments for going ahead far outweigh the arguments against; indeed, the arguments for going ahead are overwhelmingly favourable.</P>
    <P>This will be a major development. There are, of course, serious economic implications.  It would be unwise for us to get bogged down here on purely scientific and technical arguments and, because of that, I prefer to approach the subject from the point of view of the ordinary person.  Certain questions occur to me.  Is this necessary? Is it feasible?  Will it be economic? Most important of all, will it be safe?  The financial implications are a matter for the Government.  If the Government are doing their job properly they will have to make sure that the economy is moving in such a way that the necessary finances for this project will be available.</P>
    <P>A new source of power must be found.  At the moment we have three sources of power&mdash;water, oil and turf. I understand our hydro-electric stations <Col N="68" /> are working to full capacity.  I understand there is no room for further development.  I understand our supplies of peat will be exhausted in another 40 years.  I have seen various figures given in this respect: 20 years, 25 years, 30 years, 35 years and 40 years. It should be possible to be more definite.  I believe 25 to 30 years is as safe a guess as any.</P>
    <P>A Bill was introduced here last February dealing with fuel and oil, a Bill designed to enable the Minister to take emergency action should there be a cut in fuel supplies.  The present situation is a rather alarming one.  Our electricity generating stations are dependent for 50 per cent of supply on oil.  This is a dangerous situation and the danger was highlighted by the Minister's seeking special powers to take emergency action in the event of fuel supplies being cut off.  Our transport is dependent on oil.  A good deal of domestic heating is dependent on oil.  In these circumstances it is vitally important that we should find another source of power supply.  There is urgent need to diversify our power supply resources as much as possible.</P>
    <P>There are very real difficulties, political, military and otherwise, in regard to fuel and oil supplies in the world.  We saw this in the case of the Korean war and again during the Suez crisis and the various crises there have been in the Middle East.  Early this year there was danger of a blockage of fuel supplies because of a row over prices.  I believe we have no option and the decision to proceed towards the erection of a nuclear power station is wise and necessary.</P>
    <P>The second question I have asked myself about this project is: is it feasible? One must here take into account the economic aspects of the project.  I understand there has been a vast rate of growth of nuclear power stations in Britain and in EEC countries and in the United States.  It is estimated that in 15 or 20 years time two-thirds of the total electricity supply in the present EEC countries will be generated by nuclear power stations.  As far as I can gather the problem concerns the size or capacity of the power station. <Col N="69" /> I understand that the intention is to commission a nuclear power station of 500 megawatts at a cost of £50 million. The cost of generating electricity by nuclear power is high; I think it is reckoned as twice as costly as conventional methods.  I also understand that the minimum size unit at present which would be considered economic, would be a 1,000 megawatts unit.  Considerable progress, I understand, has recently been made towards the development of small nuclear stations of the 500 megawatt capacity which the ESB propose eventually to erect here.</P>
    <P>Another point that occurred to me is that this is a very expensive project. The available information indicates that the minimum economic size is 1,000 megawatts.  However, we find ourselves saying that the 500 megawatt station would perhaps be the most suited to our needs but would be less economic than the larger one. Since the matter of a nuclear power station was first mentioned I was very much attracted to the idea of a joint operation between north and south because I felt this kind of project would lend itself admirably to such joint enterprise.  I am aware of the electricity agreement between the Northern Ireland Government and our Government whereby there is a link-up between the two systems but nobody from whom I have inquired has yet been able to give me a valid reason why a 1,000 megawatt power station jointly financed by the two Governments in this island could not be considered.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying I should like him to give us some idea of what discussions have taken place, apart from the agreement for a link-up between the two power systems and joint transmission lines and so on. Many people like myself have been asking this question and are interested in it and think this type of project would be admirably suited to joint enterprise between the two parts of this country for economic and many other reasons.  Such a project in which both Governments participated would have very valuable results apart from economic ones.  It would be a major contribution to the encouragement of <Col N="70" /> better and closer cross-border relationships. I am aware that the Minister's Department, particularly in the field of tourism, has been doing a good deal in this respect and there is also the electricity supply agreement with the Northern Ireland Joint Electricity Authority but I believe the possibility of taking a bigger step in this matter of joint participation should be fully explored.  I have in mind the very successful joint effort culminating in the establishment of the Erne Hydro-Electric Scheme.</P>
    <P>On the question of the feasibility and economics of this type of operation I was very interested to read among the documents I was able to procure and study on this subject a paper entitled: &ldquo;The Initiating of a National Nuclear Power Programme&rdquo; read to the Third International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy held under the United Nations auspices at Geneva in 1964.  With the permission of the Chair, I should like to quote one or two extracts from it.  This paper by two internationally recognised consulting engineers, deals with the question of the feasibility of establishing a nuclear power station in any particular country and with the factors which have to be taken into account and it ties up very much with what I have been saying about the feasibility of this type of operation here and the economics of it.  This paper states that a decision to proceed with the construction of a nuclear power station would probably be made for one or more of the following reasons:</P>
    <P>(1)  because calculations indicate the energy produced would be cheaper than from any other source;</P>
    <P>(2)  because domestic sources of energy are becoming exhausted;</P>
    <P>(3)  to act as a deterrent to an increase in the price of conventional fuel;</P>
    <P>(4)  to obtain operating experience and operator training facilities in anticipation of nuclear power being required in larger quantities in future and</P>
    <P>(5)  To provide manufacturing industry with experience.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> The extraordinary thing is that the authors of this paper go on to conclude that almost no nuclear stations have been built for the first reason above &mdash;that is, because calculations indicate that the energy produced would be cheaper than from any other source. So, there are factors other than the purely economic which can influence the decision.  They go on to point out that while none has been built for the first reason, that is, the purely economic ground that there are cheaper means of generating electricity, most of the stations that have been built were built for a combination of other reasons.  The reason that is of particular significance to us in Ireland is the second one&mdash;because domestic sources of energy are becoming exhausted.  That is the particular element in relation to the peat stations.</P>
    <P>The third reason&mdash;to act as a deterrent to increase in the price of conventional fuel&mdash;is important and significant having regard to the continuous increases in the price of fuel oils over recent years.</P>
    <P>The development of a nuclear station may be important from the point of view of providing training for scientists and technologists and giving practical experience in the use of nuclear power.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board will, of course, <i>inter alia,</i> have the duty of advising the Minister on the feasibility of establishing a nuclear power station. It is a wise decision to establish this board.  From every point of view and particularly from the point of view of the tremendous contribution made by nuclear scientists to developments in medicine, agriculture, industry and so on, and the importance of nuclear energy as a source of electrical power, we must face up to the situation and must push ahead.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that probably the major problem which the board will have to tackle is the reassurance of the public that nuclear energy is not just a destructive force, that it is not as dangerous as many people believe it to be.  Since I become aware <Col N="72" /> that the Bill was to be introduced, I have engaged in the very useful exercise of testing public reaction at branch meetings and so on.  I have tested the reactions of the 30 or 40 persons who visit me at my weekly clinic as to the various types of legislation that come before the Dáil.  Many of these people probably have never heard of the atom and, perhaps, have not studied science even at school level.  One would be amazed at the intelligent opinions one would get.  I am convinced that there is a feeling abroad that nuclear power is a dangerous thing, that it is not safe. The Nuclear Energy Board will have to undertake a massive public relations job with a view to allaying the fears that many people have.  Of course, this fear has been engendered to a large degree by the outpourings of cranks, fanatics and pseudo-scientists and others, some of whom we have had in this country in recent times since the question of nuclear energy came to be debated and papers have been read and public statements have been made in the Press as to the dangers of nuclear energy.  Apart from the Nuclear Energy Board carrying out this public relations job, we as elected public representatives can play an important part in interpreting as correctly as we can the implications of this scientific development for the people of this country.</P>
    <P>Because of my annoyance at some of the articles I had read, I have over the past six or eight months collected cuttings from newspapers and journals in relation to this question and have studied some of the public statements that have been made and some of the views put forward in relation to the question of safety.  I have tried to examine the situation objectively.  It is only right and proper that even at this early stage in legislating in regard to nuclear energy we should put on record our views in relation to the question of safety and I do this fully conscious of my responsibility in the matter.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the minds of many people in this country have been conditioned by the terrible events flowing from the first practical application of atomic energy in the world. They have been conditioned by the cranks and others and the anti-nuclear <Col N="73" /> groups that have appeared in other countries.  The people are not aware of the peaceful uses to which this energy can be put.  There have been unfortunately one or two accidents which have been highlighted in the world Press and which have tended to frighten people.  The destructive possibilities of this science have been highlighted while the peaceful uses have been overlooked.</P>
    <P>We are late in the field in relation to the development of a nuclear power plant.  Nuclear power is making an important contribution to electricity development in Britain and on the Continent and in the United States. A very relevant consideration in relation to the safety factor is the fact that in recent years in the United States power stations have been erected within 15 or 20 miles of major urban centres.  This proves beyond all doubt that the application of nuclear energy to the generation of power is a perfectly safe project.  I want to go on record as saying that I have been tremendously impressed by the colossal amount of research that has been carried out in regard to the safety element in the application of this science. There has been a massive investment in safety research and the most exhaustive research has been carried out. So far as existing nuclear power stations throughout the world are concerned every precaution has been taken to ensure the safety in operation of these particular power plants.  As far as I can gather, and I have been particularly interested in this, there has been no serious incident at any nuclear power station in the world to-date. I understand there have been one or two incidents at military power stations but so far as the nuclear power stations of the type we are proposing to establish here are concerned the safety record is beyond question.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that one of the main reasons why it is possible to ensure absolute safety in the operation of these particular plants is because of the relatively minute quantities of fuel consumption which are required.  I have seen some amazing figures in relation to the fuel consumption of <Col N="74" /> this particular type of power plant.  One pound of uranium&mdash;this reminds me of my days in front of the blackboard; however, this is a serious subject and I believe in putting on record my views, for what they are worth, in relation to every aspect which I was capable of absorbing from my study of it &mdash;is equivalent to 3,000,000 pounds of coal; one cubic foot of uranium has the same energy content as 1.7 million tons of coal, or 7.2 million barrels of oil, or 32 billion cubic feet of natural gas.  The amount of fuel needed to keep a nuclear plant of the type we are proposing to establish going, which when in operation would be equivalent to two-thirds of the power we are generating at the present time, is equivalent to one lorry-load per month.</P>
    <P>Because of the small amount of fuel required to be handled compared with conventional types of fuel like coal, oil and so on, it should be possible to take the most elaborate precautions possible.  The nuclear station is not of itself a danger in the sense of there being explosions or anything like that, but there is an element of danger&mdash; and this is where the safety factor comes in&mdash;with regard to the transporting of the fuel because the fuel will have to be imported.  I understand that the intention in the foreseeable future is to import fabricated elements of enriched uranium; there is no intention of establishing reactors here for the purpose of enriching uranium or any of the other sources.  There will be the problem of transporting the fuel to the plant, the handling of the fuel, the storage of the fuel and so on. There is also the problem of the waste fuel which is radio-active.  People have expressed concern about the danger of radio-active waste adjacent to the site. I understand from my study of the subject that there is no need for one drop of this fuel, whether it is the original fuel or the spent fuel, to be wasted or to fall out.  When the fuel has been used the remaining waste will be transported back in special containers to the original suppliers and the waste fuel can be reprocessed.  The only danger in relation to radio-active waste is in the case of dumping of some of these materials in the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> I am looking forward to the practicalities which will have to be considered before the location of the site is decided.  Some people will not want this particular project to be sited anywhere near their homes while others will want it to be sited near their homes.  I can visualise people advocating the suitability of their particular part of the country for the siting of the station.  I understand the locating of this station does not pose any great problem because one of the major considerations is access to a plentiful supply of water which will be used for cooling purposes and there is no shortage of that particular commodity here.</P>
    <P>I have seen statements suggesting Wexford, the west of Ireland, the Shannon Estuary and other places as suitable locations for the siting of this station.  I suppose the natural reaction of a politician is to say that his locality is the most suitable, and I am no different from any other politician in that respect.  I know that one of the functions of the Nuclear Energy Board which it is proposed to establish will be to advise on the possible location. I sincerely hope the Minister will abide by what he said in his speech today:</P>
    <P>If in due course, a decision is taken to build a station, the siting of such a station will be a matter to be determined primarily by technical criteria such as the availability at the site of very large amounts of cooling water and its proximity to the electrical system load centres.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the ESB have done a great deal of research into this whole project and members of their technical staff have been sent abroad for training and study in this particular field.  In relation to the siting of this plant, which I foresee will have political implications, I do not know whether or not there is enough water at Athlone but I doubt it very much so the Minister can afford to be objective in relation to this.</P>

      <P>Maybe the Tolka or the Dodder.  I sincerely hope that <Col N="76" /> the Minister will accept the findings of whatever feasibility study has been carried out in relation to the sitting of this plant.  This is a project of such magnitude and of such vital importance to the future of this country that political considerations should not enter into the actual siting of the plant.  This may be an extraordinary statement to make but this is my view.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept the findings of the feasibility study and if the Minister and the Government are not prepared to accept the advice that will be offered by the proposed Nuclear Energy Board, which under this Bill the Minister will be empowered to set up, then it is only a waste of time setting up a Nuclear Energy Board.</P>
      <P>I am not qualified but my view is, and it is the feeling of many people, that perhaps a tremendous opportunity is being lost here for practical cross-border co-operation.  I would again urge on the Minister the desirability of exploring every possibility of having a nuclear plant for this island in which the two Governments, north and south, would jointly participate&mdash; one nuclear power plant serving north and south of this country.  This is what appeals to me.  This is, I think, a feasible proposition.  It is also a very desirable proposition from many points of view.  I would refer to the tremendous success of the project that was initiated in this House under the legislation setting up the Erne Hydro Electric Scheme.  Even if I had information which led me to believe that the most suitable site for this project was in the heart of my own constituency I would still advocate a joint operation between north and south.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The function of the actual board which the Minister proposes to set up will be to advise the Minister, as he puts it, on things nuclear.  This is important.  Deputy Dr. O'Connell will be interested in the medical aspects of this particular science and is well qualified to speak on this subject.  It is important to emphasise the fact that this Nuclear Energy Board will have the function of advising the Minister not merely on the application of nuclear science to the generation of <Col N="77" /> power or to the erection of a nuclear power station but it will be concerned with research into all aspects of the application of nuclear science.  Having studied and researched, they will then be in a position to advise the Minister and the Government as to the application of this particular science to the different fields of medicine and industry, agriculture, provision of electric power and so forth which might be feasible in this country.</P>
    <P>I take it that the proposed Nuclear Energy Board will be a board which will consist of people who are expert in this field.  I do not know how many people there are in the country who could be termed experts in the field of nuclear science but I am sure that in our universities and perhaps in industry and maybe in the medical world as well as in the ESB it must be possible to find seven people who are expert enough to advise the Government and the Minister on the applications of this science.  A suggestion has been made regarding the possibility of the Minister going outside the State for one or two members of this board.  I am just throwing this out for what it is worth.  It is a highly involved and highly technical business and this Nuclear Energy Board will have vitally important functions to fulfil.  I would say that it should be possible north and south of the Border to find suitable people.  Again I should like to see the Nuclear Energy Board operating for the whole island.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the fact that this Bill was discussed in the Seanad and that the Minister has introduced amendments to meet suggestions made in the Seanad.  The Minister pointed out that the Seanad was pleased with the Bill. I do not mind saying, despite the various aspects I have gone into, that I consider the Bill reasonably satisfactory from the point of view of taking the first step towards the harnessing of nuclear power and the practical application of nuclear science to different fields.  I hope this board will be established without undue delay.  The board will advise the Minister and the Government on all aspects of the application of nuclear science.  Assuming that advice is given by this board, will <Col N="78" /> the Minister come before the House and will there be further legislation necessary?  In other words, are we to set up a Nuclear Energy Board now which will be empowered to advise the Government and the Minister and will the Minister have a <i>carte blanche</i> in relation to all nuclear developments or will further legislation be introduced?</P>

I am aware, from personal contacts with some of the people who have been assigned to study this development, of the tremendous amount of work that has been done.  I am satisfied that, as a result of their foresight and initiative, the ESB have now acquired a very highly qualified and highly skilled unit among their employees.  I have no doubt that we can have confidence in their ability to bring the proposal in relation to a nuclear power station to a successful conclusion.  I wish the ESB well in their endeavour in this direction, despite the economic situation and the financial implications to which the Minister referred.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donnell complained that the Minister's brief was brief.  He certainly did not treat us to a brief discourse on this relatively limited Bill.  The Seanad like to get first &ldquo;go&rdquo; at a Bill.  I was in the Seanad when the Coinage Bill was introduced in 1950.  This was the first time a Bill was introduced in the Seanad and there was great excitement. I notice that the amount of discussion on this Bill in the Seanad was quite exceptional.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donnell talked about facilities for Deputies for researching this matter.  I went into <Col N="79" /> the Library this morning and the three relevant volumes were missing.  That did not help my researches.  As briefs go, I thought this was one of the very best briefs I have ever listened to in the House and I have listened to a lot of them and written some myself.  The discussion in the Seanad especially by Senator Dooge and Senator West, and on the legal side by Senator Alexis FitzGerald, was comprehensive.  It went on for days.  They spent one day on Second Reading, two days on Committee Stage, and one day on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I will probably have some remarks to make about odd things in the different sections but, subject to that, this Bill is perfect.  I suppose I must say a few words about it.  The Minister accepted many minor amendments during the discussion in the Seanad.  He said that the Seanad were &ldquo;quite pleased with the Bill as it now stands and I can confidently recommend it to the House&rdquo;.  The Minister is justified in making that claim.  Not so long ago we had a Bill in the House which was not unlike this in format, the Higher Education Authority Bill, but it was not as good as this and I had a great number of very adverse criticisms to make on it. The section dealing with pensions in this Bill is superior to what was in the Higher Education Authority Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us the history of the attempts by various Governments to approach this subject.  We were lucky that different Governments showed a great deal of common sense because we could quite easily have run into serious trouble.  There was untold trouble in other countries.  The promises of scientists are not unlike the promises of astrologists, or soothsayers, or forecasters. They see the future as being wonderful.  I am not saying that there is not a wonderful future for nuclear energy in the long run, but it is a long way off.  A great deal of money was wasted, even in the island next door, in connection with nuclear power stations.  They proved to be not at all easy to develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy O'Donnell &mdash;very late in his speech I notice&mdash;say <Col N="80" /> a few words in praise of the ESB.  I was wondering had he forgotten them altogether.  It is true that the ESB have shown a great deal of common sense on this matter.  They looked after the training of people and this was the right way to go about it.  This board will not interfere in any way with them. It will be purely an advisory board. The second inter-Party Government set up a board and the Minister said that when they reported in 1958 the Government decided not to go ahead.  I see nothing wrong with that.  That decision was right.  There was a subsequent board which reported in 1966.  One would not have gathered from Deputy O'Donnell's speech that a specific statement was made by the Minister: &ldquo;I wish to make it clear to the House that no decision has been taken to build a nuclear station.&rdquo;  I am not a bit surprised. I remember being in the north of Scotland and seeing the Dunrea station with Deputy Donegan.  The Dunrea station proved to be infinitely more expensive to build than was anticipated originally.  If some Government here had been foolish enough to barge into this field we would have found ourselves with a millstone around our necks.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to large generators.  This is a most serious matter. In England they started to build these large generators in ordinary conventional power stations&mdash;600 megawatt generators.  Then some technical difficulties arose.  One of them went out of action with the result that a large area in England had to be blacked out for a period.  If we had even a 250 megawatt generator, one-quarter of the country would be blacked out if we had not got adequate power elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We have been developing very nicely.  We have a number of 60 megawatt units.  I think the ESB practically have in hand 120 megawatt units. They are about 10 per cent, I understand, of what we use at present.  That is as much as one should have in one unit.  For a Government who are normally in such a hurry to import ideas from outside, the Government have shown commendable caution in this matter.  We are not in any sense <Col N="81" /> embarking on a programme of nuclear development for power purposes.  The Minister said that the spare generating capacity available immediately it is required, must at all times be capable of compensating for the loss of the largest unit on load.</P>
    <P>I do not hold the same view as others as to the disaster involved in a blackout.  We have not had a blackout here since the war whereas they have been experienced in different parts of England at various times.  However, this has probably cost us a good deal in money terms because our engineers have been extremely careful to pay close attention&mdash;maybe even too close attention&mdash;to the limits to which these generators should be pushed.  These limits are set by the manufacturers and, of course, the manufacturers having regard to their good name set tremendous margins of safety.  I am informed that not the slightest attention is paid to these margins of safety in Germany or Britain and consequently the generators are pushed to a much greater limit than the limit to which ours are pushed.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy O'Donnell as to one being able to forecast the time at which our peat resources will be exhausted.  Although one might have ideas in this regard, there is not much point in going into detail when one is not an expert in this field.  This board is to be an advisory board.  This Bill is a small one and in opening the debate this afternoon the Minister was perfectly right not to have presented us with an extensive brief.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that the development of nuclear power reactors is continually improving.  Of course, this is the most important matter in the Bill.  We have been told also that in recent times the more advanced countries have been able to commission nuclear reactors competitive in price with power stations based on the traditional fossil fuels.  This has happened only recently.  Heretofore the performance was not nearly as good as the original promise but in the long run the performance will probably be better than the promise.  The Minister has told us, too, that nuclear power <Col N="82" /> stations have very high capital costs and relatively low fuel costs.  This aspect, so far as we are concerned, presents us with one of our greatest difficulties because capital is now getting scarce and much capital will be required for the purchase of the new machinery.  The Minister stated that:</P>
    <P>the fuel for a nuclear station will have to be procured from abroad but we can claim that diversification by way of nuclear power stations will add to the security of the electricity supply.</P>
    <P>Of course it will because once the nuclear fuel has been purchased it will last practically for ever.  Finally, I must commend the Minister in that towards the end of his brief he said:</P>
    <P>I envisage that the initial staff will be fairly limited in number but as developments take place and additional functions are assigned to the board from time to time that the staff will be expanded to keep pace with requirements.</P>
    <P>The Minister deserves to be complimented on bringing this Bill before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to mention an incident which Deputy O'Donovan may remember. This happened about ten years ago when the Deputy and his good and beautiful wife, together with my wife and me were holidaying in Scotland. One day during that holiday, while on our way back from John-o-Groats, we observed a nuclear power station and decided to have a look around. However, when we arrived at the front gate we were not received very well. Perhaps my blond hair at the time and the fact that I was driving a Mercedes and wearing sun glasses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;gave the impression that I was a German.  However, we did see the plant.  Undoubtedly, this legislation is necessary.  One has only to consider the trends in the provision of power for industry to realise how things can change because matters are different in another part of the world.  It is only three years since <Col N="83" /> every oil company in the country was begging businessmen to make a contract with them and were competing with each other to have volumes reduced in price by fifths of an old penny per gallon.  Then the sheiks of Araby decided they wanted more money and, inevitably, a compromise followed&mdash;a compromise which, at the flour and bread inquiry at which I was present last week, was stated to be 2p per gallon.  I do not know whether this figure is correct but it indicates how the entire aspect can change.  One has only to reflect on the days of Suez when vast quantities of oil were carried on the canal, from the Gulf of Aqaba to the Mediterranean, into Rotterdam and then to the entire Continent.  Since then we have become familiar with Whiddy Island in which, as the Minister knows, I have some considerable interest.  Incidentally, I am not in complete agreement with his actions in that regard.  Of course the operations at Whiddy Island resulted from the non-usage of the Suez Canal for the shipment of oil.  Many millions of pounds were spent providing super-tankers to take oil to what is the second greatest area of usage in the world, the competitors being the United States and the general Continent of Europe.  As well as these changes there were what could be described as experimental plants, plants which must have cost many millions to construct.</P>
      <P>This source of energy which heretofore might have been regarded as a rarity, perhaps because of its relationship to the splitting of the atom, or to Hiroshima, or to any of these other things of which Senator Dooge, for instance, would have a deeper knowledge than I, is now a reality.  As has been said already this board is merely a first shot in this field of nuclear energy. They are being set up for the purpose of investigating this whole field and from that point it is not necessary that they have arbitrary functions or that they be bound tightly by rules and regulations.  In time another Bill on this subject must emerge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the question also as to whether the population of this country and the degree of industrial usage of fuel warrants what is foreshadowed in <Col N="84" /> the Bill.  That is a matter for investigation by the board but Deputy O'Donnell was right in suggesting that there might be an avenue of co-operation with the North of Ireland in this regard.  The population of one and a half million people there would add considerably to the volume of usage, to an even greater degree than the population figure suggests.  If one leaves out certain rural areas, such as Fermanagh, one finds that on average the degree of industrial development in the north is higher than in the south. That is not to decry ourselves.  It is a fact.  One has but to consider the undeveloped areas in the south, which are called designated areas; obviously the usage of fuel in an area such as Mayo is considerably less than in Dublin or Belfast.  The development of the new city of Craigavon and the work done there&mdash;in advance of our efforts in industrial development&mdash;means that there will be heavy usage of fuel in the North of Ireland.  Politicians must be level-headed in their approach in this matter.  If there is an opportunity for co-operation with the North of Ireland in the production of power from nuclear energy and if that requires a high capital injection, the question of whether it should be the subject for one scheme to cover the entire country will be considered.</P>
    <P>With the exception of certain people &mdash;I would mention Senator Dooge and Deputy de Valera&mdash;on this subject most of us are lay people who have not interested ourselves in a detailed way in this matter.  I am aware that Deputy de Valera has interested himself in this matter; in fact, I was with him when he travelled to Brussels some years ago especially to hear a lecture on this subject.  Similarly, by reason of his profession Senator Dooge has a specialised knowledge of this matter.  However, most of us have not this knowledge and we must generalise but in our generalisation we should be able to look at the problems.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of our supplies of peat.  I remember a phrase used by the then Minister for Finance when the Government had failed so abysmally in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion and were introducing the Third Programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> Deputy Haughey said at the time that the Second Programme had &ldquo;excessive quantification&rdquo;&mdash;a glorious phrase. It was not relevant then because we should plan towards targets and targets mean quantification but in this regard it is difficult to quantify exactly how much peat we will use and how much we have left.  Some of the bogs are not opened yet and it is difficult to decide how practical they will be if they are opened.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the practicality of opening them can change in a period of years.  An example that may be cited is the Arklow mines.  The first difficulty in relation to the Arklow mines was when the price of copper on the international market dropped by half.  People may have been critical of the way the matter was handled but the prime reason for the difficulty was not the fact that there was no copper there or an opportunity to mine it but that it was not a viable proposition. If we consider the closing of the Suez Canal and the demand of the oil sheiks for more royalties we can find over a period of five or ten years a changing situation which might make one proposition viable at a certain time and not viable later or <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>There is also the position regarding hydro-electric schemes.  The greatest example of co-operation between north and south was the Erne Hydro-Electric Scheme.  It is a sad feature of modern life that one of the events of the past two years was an attempt to blow up part of that installation.  In relation to nuclear energy and the high capital cost involved we must examine in detail whether further hydro-electric schemes may be viable propositions. I do not know if there has been a report on this or if there are rivers which might be harnessed for hydro-electric power.  I do not know if there are estuaries where the movement of the tide can be a source of power. We must quantify with the aid of all the information at our disposal our future needs for power.  The development of hydro-electric resources and nuclear energy must be considered side by side.</P>
    <P>May I cite an obvious place where investigation is necessary as to whether <Col N="86" /> the provision of hydro-electric power is viable, namely, in the inlet at Foynes?  It resembles a Norwegian fiord and from Tarbert to the Clare coast there is a colossal outflow and inflow of the tide.  The harnessing of this water has been mentioned many times. Harnessing in itself is no problem; the question is whether the money spent would be a worthwhile expenditure.</P>
    <P>In discussing in a general way what has been done in relation to energy for use in industry to provide hydro-electric power, we might consider the instance of a £10 million plant in Wicklow.  During the time of low usage of electricity pumping is carried out to pump to a reservoir or lake at a higher level a vast quantity of water which is used during periods of heavy consumption.  Here, again, there is the question of harnessing the water.  There has been a rumour that investigations have taken place in a general way on the setting up of a nuclear power station.  There has been some examination of the southern side of Dundalk. Bay, the portion extending from Dunaney to the town of Dundalk. Rumour has it that there is a certain interest in the tide at that particular point and rumour has it that this interest is tied up with the development of a nuclear power station.  I do not know whether or not the strength of the tide would have anything to do with such a station.  I do not know if waste products would have to be taken away by the tide.  I should like some information from the Minister on this.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan and Deputy O'Donnell referred to safety regulations. What will be the position about the disposal of deleterious waste, waste which might affect human life, fish life, animal life or the amenities of a district?  I am sure the Minister has had some information on this as a result of the operation of nuclear power stations like the one Deputy O'Donovan and I arrived at about ten years ago.</P>
    <P>Section 15 deals with the secondment of an employee of the board becoming a member of the Oireachtas and subsection (c) deals with the position of a member of the Oireachtas who becomes a member of the board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> This is something we shall have to deal with on Committee Stage.  We have two Members of the Oireachtas who have a specialised knowledge in hydro-electrics and kindred subjects. Deputy de Valera and Senator Dooge would be excellent members of such a board and this is something we shall have to discuss on Committee Stage; it is a change from the global banning of Members of the Oireachtas being members of any board.  For the last 16 years I have been against this kind of legislation.  If a Member of the Oireachtas has specialised knowledge he should be allowed to give the benefit of that knowledge wherever it will be most advantageous without let or hindrance.  If this ukase were to persist in legislation the only result would be to deprive the whole community of specialised knowledge.</P>
    <P>The investigation committee may be a little late.  I think this committee should have been established years ago. The particular problem became highlighted as a result of the increase in the price of oil from the Arab countries and as a result of the Suez crisis.  The Government, as I said today at Question Time, have had other problems to deal with in the past two years and a good deal of pending legislation is arriving late in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an interesting Bill.  A recommendation was made to the Government in 1966 that a nuclear power station should be set up.  I am wondering why the delay.  There is need for such a station.  We have only to look at the advances in technology, medicine and science to realise the urgent need there is for such a station. Nuclear power has resulted in fantastic strides in medicine from the point of view of both diagnostics and of treatment. <Col N="88" /> All available information gained from similar bodies in more advanced countries should be available to us.</P>
      <P>This body will undertake research into the dangers resulting from radio-active fall-out.  This could be a serious problem.  Even if there is no war there is always the danger of fall-out.  An example of that was the American plane which crashed off the coast of Spain two years ago.  There was consternation at the time.  These planes are in the air every day and it is most important that we should be equipped to deal with the position should a similar accident occur off our own coast.</P>
      <P>We cannot discuss this Bill without thinking of co-operation between north and south in this particular field. Different Deputies have spoken about co-operation.  I should like to see us go one stage further.  There is an opportunity here for the Minister in appointing the seven members to the board to go a stage further and, perhaps, discuss with the Northern Government the possibility of appointing two or three members from the north on this board.  This is a major opportunity that could be taken by the Minister to extend the hand of friendship and say: &ldquo;There are many matters on which we could co-operate and we invite you to do so.&rdquo;  Even if the Northern Government were not co-operative the Minister might consider inviting two or three people from the north to join this board.  Such a step could not but show the Northern people that we are ready to work in harmony with them on many projects.  The Minister should seriously consider this because if progress is to be made in this field it will certainly involve both North and South; we cannot consider setting up this body or the operation of nuclear stations without taking the North of Ireland into account.  We cannot work economically without the North and therefore in this instance we should consider what I have suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a little disturbed about the expansion of the Electricity Supply Board and the fact that in a short time 80 per cent of their fuel to produce electricity will be oil.  This is worrying in <Col N="89" /> that we would then be dependent so much on outside sources.  We know there are great dangers when these countries are concluding agreements with commercial concerns about the supply of oil.  I think we shall shortly see a situation in which there will be greater and greater demands and the stage may be reached when we shall find ourselves without fuel.  We can see what is happening and where countries have no political stability and where there is growing discontent there is an ever-increasing danger to oil supplies for electricity production.</P>
    <P>This places us in a very difficult position and I should like to think we might not have to depend on oil.  Even though the capital cost of a nuclear plant might be phenomenal it would be worth considering in the light of the danger of oil supplies being cut off. We should not be daunted by the capital cost when we remember that Common Market countries are at present operating nuclear plants for industry and we shall have to compete with these countries for so many things.</P>
    <P>We must have an electricity supply available to industry at economic rates. The increasing cost of electricity under the existing system indicates that we may have seriously to consider facing the capital cost of investment in a nuclear plant that would supply electricity at an economic price.  I should like to know if the Minister has investigated which Common Market countries have nuclear plants and could he tell us at what cost electricity can be supplied from a nuclear plant as against the cost of supply from oil.</P>
    <P>I hope that in appointing the board of this body we shall not talk in terms of political appointments.  We should move away from this obnoxious practice. The Minister should give a lead by appointing people of ability, completely disregarding their political affiliations.  This would do much to enhance the Minister's position.  People nowadays are a bit fed up when they see political appointees on boards which are set up.  This is not good. We should like to see people on this board who, perhaps, have particular experience in the scientific aspect of nuclear energy and, possibly, its application <Col N="90" /> in medicine.  There could also be somebody from the Board of the ESB.  We should think in this way rather than in terms of politics.  Unfortunately too often the appointments to new boards are political.  A couple of weeks ago we read that a director of a board set up for a semi-State body was fired when he no longer found favour with the present Cabinet.  The Minister now has an opportunity to adopt a completely different policy and he would gain public respect by doing so.</P>
    <P>I was concerned about one matter the Minister mentioned.  He said the Department of Labour were making regulations protecting factory workers against the dangers of radio-active substances.  This suggests that nuclear energy or radio-active substances are at present being used in industry.  If that is so I should like to know where and what precautions are taken.  If it is used in industry I should like to know if those concerned are fully conversant with the dangers and if there are adequate precautions for the workers.</P>

      <P>I have worked with it in medicine and it is because I know the dangers that I emphasise the fact that in industry adequate precautions may not be taken if the workers and their employers are not aware of the dangers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are setting up this body we must talk seriously about the question of a nuclear generating station.  This will come in the not too distant future even though present circumstances may not permit it.  I should like to think that the ESB would think far enough ahead.  Too often the danger is that they do not. I have a great regard for the ESB who are too frequently criticised.  I have found them, in my dealings with them, a great body, very anxious to help. They realise their social obligations, which is more than can be said of many bodies.  I should like to think that they are sufficiently far-seeing to realise that we will have tremendous economic expansion.  I would hope <Col N="91" /> that we will not have a problem created by power stations not being adequate.  We have problems at the moment of power stations not being adequate to meet the demands of rapidly built-up areas.  This arises, for me, in Ballyfermot, Drimnagh and Crumlin.  The people there cannot view a TV film.  There is not enough power to produce a good picture.  This may seem irrelevant and negligible but it is very important for the people concerned. The board should look far ahead and have regard to the tremendous economic growth which we can expect in the next decade.  Ten years ago we would not have envisaged anything like the growth that we now have.  It is not a percentage; it is a logarithmic increase in economic progress. This should be taken into account.  I do not know if we will have opportunities to discuss this matter if the question of investment in a nuclear plant arises.  They should plan, not for the present or for five or ten years, but far ahead and make an investment which will meet the demand, perhaps, for ten to 20 years.  This is particularly important having regard to the capital cost.</P>
    <P>I see the opportunities that there are in providing a nuclear energy station and I like the idea of a body being set up and of information being collated and disseminated and made available to scientific and medical bodies, from the health point of view and the dangers of fall-out.  We should have set up a board a long time ago.  I cannot see the reason for the delay and I would hope that the board will be established as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for the very constructive debate on this very necessary legislation which is designed to ensure that the Minister for Transport and Power and the Government will be fully advised on all nuclear matters. Naturally enough, a great deal of the debate has concentrated on the nuclear generation aspect but I should like to emphasise that this Bill covers all matters relating to nuclear development. Deputy O'Connell rightly <Col N="92" /> emphasised that aspect with regard to safety in factories, medicine, hygiene, in regard to all aspects affecting the community.  This board will be in a position to advise the Minister and the Government on all of these aspects arising out of radio-active substances.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, on the aspect of research, education and training, again the board will be in a position to advise on developments, to set up the appropriate inquiries and make the necessary arrangements to enhance the developments in Ireland, if necessary, or collect and collate information gathered from abroad on these aspects of research, training and education, and then, of course, on the important aspect of power generation as it will arise in future, again, this expert authority will be established designed to ensure that the most expert advice is available to the Minister and the Government on how to plan development in this field.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the House of one thing that has been raised by Deputy O'Connell and that is that there will be no question of this being in any way a board on which people will be appointed for political reasons, or anything of that kind.  This will be a highly scientific, specialist board that will be recruited with the objective of covering the aspects I have mentioned&mdash;the medical, educational, research and generation aspects, the aspects of nuclear energy development in future that will be covered in the composition of a specialist board who will be associated and acquainted with the problems of nuclear energy in these various fields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell and other Deputies were concerned about the proposed nuclear power station and Deputy O'Donnell mentioned the fact that no decision had yet been made.  This is a fact.  No final decision has yet been made.  The ESB have their experts and engineers working on the feasibility of establishing such a power station.  They have surveyed possible locations around the country and they are preparing proposals at the present time for my consideration and the Government's consideration. These proposals will be considered in the months ahead and I <Col N="93" /> want this board established to advise the Government fully on all aspects relating to this so that a decision can be taken, if it is to be taken, with the fullest and best advice available.</P>
    <P>The importance of such a decision can be emphasised by the best barometer of all, which is money.  I mentioned £50 million in the Seanad but the finances could possibly run into the region of £70 million to £80 million.  It is of that order.  It is certainly money of that magnitude.  Again, there are no hard and fast figures as yet.  These are in course of preparation.  Capital investment of that kind is not to be lightly undertaken and I want to emphasise that we want to keep all our options open in regard to the future power requirements of the community.  The overall picture is that oil is now running ahead of 50 per cent of the resource for power generation in this country.  I emphasised this fact in the House before and it has been referred to in the course of the debate that this is unhealthy.  I agree that it is unhealthy. It is undesirable that this should be the case and it is desirable that we should as far as possible diversify our fuel requirements for power purposes.</P>
    <P>I shall go through the other ones: in regard to hydro-electric resources for actual generation purposes, we have reached, at the present view of it, the feasible limit in regard to generation, not in regard to storage.  Hydro storage, such as we have had at Turlough Hill, County Wicklow, and proposed for the Comeragh Mountains in Waterford, where another site is being investigated, and there is another one in the country being investigated, is separate from hydro generation.  Hydro storage enables you to store water for utilisation at the best possible time so that you can balance the supply of power. It levels off the peaks and the valleys. That is, broadly speaking, the purpose of hydro storage but this does not mean new generation, as it were.</P>
    <P>We are investigating what was mentioned by Deputy Donegan, the question of harnessing the tides.  Again, on the present view, this does not appear to be economic.  It has been <Col N="94" /> done in France already.  We do not, at present view of it, have sufficient tidal force in any of our estuaries to make this proposition economic.  It is being kept under review, particularly in regard to the Shannon Estuary but, again, it is another one of the options the ESB are examining.</P>
    <P>As regards the peat resources, at the best figure, certainly at the end of 40 years the resources will be exhausted but certainly over the next 30 years they will be reduced to a very low level.  Over the next 30 years peat resources, in so far as power generation is concerned, will be diminishing. Coal resources will be another uncertain source of supply.  Coal resources will diminish in time.  Oil supplies are not inexhaustible.  In this situation it is very important for the ESB to survey alternative methods of power generation and, having examined all proposals, to come up with proposals from which the Government can make their selection.  This is the thinking behind the search for natural gas and oil around our coastal waters.  The thinking in regard to a proposed nuclear power station could be changed if we discover oil or natural gas around our coast.  There have been some favourable reports about such finds already.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of the ESB is to examine every possible source of supply and to ensure that the community are protected and that we do not become overdependent on any one source of fuel for power purposes.  We are becoming overdependent on oil.  At the present time we have no oil resources in Ireland.  In that general picture it is very important to plan alternatively.  That is why the ESB are now at an advanced stage of planning in regard to a nuclear energy station for which they could, if given a direction, invite tenders some time next year.  They could have such a station in commission by 1978.  It would be a 500-megawatt station.  At that stage it would be able to supply nearly 20 per cent of our requirements on the basis that we would have in the region of 3,000 megawatts supply requirements by 1980.  The present rate of expansion of 11 to 12 per cent per <Col N="95" /> year on the 1,400 megawatt supply of power that we have now would mean that a 3,000 megawatt supply would be needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the total.  If we proceed at the present rate of expansion in regard to utilisation of electric power the community will need a power supply in the region of 3,000 megawatts by 1980.  At the present time we are supplying 1,400 megawatts.  In that situation a 500-megawatt nuclear energy station would supply between one-fifth and one-sixth of the requirements, assuming such a station is commissioned and is in production by 1978-79.  This is forward thinking to ensure that we have an alternative source of supply by 1980. If we do not have some such alternative supply we will be overdependent on oil by 1980.  The general position in the world in this regard shows that it is obviously undesirable to be overdependent on one source of power. This is a matter of grave concern to countries such as Germany, France, Britain and the west of Europe.  All these countries are concerned about their overdependence on oil as a source of power supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESB are concerned with the technical aspects of power generation.  Their concern is totally separate from what the Nuclear Energy Board or the Government are thinking.  The Nuclear Energy Board will have the task of looking at the overall picture.  The ESB are concerned with power generation.  There are a number of aspects of the problem which have to be considered by the board and the Government&mdash;for instance, the siting of the station.  A number of environmental matters can arise apart from power generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies O'Donnell, Dr. O'Connell, Donegan and Dr. O'Donovan mentioned the question of co-operation with the North of Ireland in this important matter.  I wish to emphasise that there must be co-operation with the North of Ireland.  The inter-connection which now obtains between north and south in regard to electricity supplies makes it imperative that in any such development there must be close co-operation between North and South to ensure maximum utilisation of any nuclear plant erected down here. <Col N="97" /> The same would apply if it were decided to erect a nuclear plant in the north-east of the country.  Such co-operation will take place at all stages. Anything done in regard to the capacity of the plant, or its nature, will be done after consideration of the fact that the power of the inter-connected system will be shared in all parts of this island, including the North.</P>

We wish to secure the best brains in the country for participation in the work of the Nuclear Energy Board.  If, in the course of my inquiries over the next few weeks, it emerges that there is such a person in the North of Ireland I will have that person considered for membership of this board.  It is part and parcel of the whole arrangement in regard to power distribution between North and South that the capacity and the nature of the operation of the proposed nuclear power station should be developed on a basis of co-operation and consultation with the Northern authorities.  This is inevitable.  The proposed station will be feeding into the same transmission grid that brings power to the North and the South.</P>

      <P>There is no decision on that.  Looking ahead at the expansion of power requirements in both parts of the country, it is on the cards that there may be two such power stations.  I do not anticipate this.  I can assure the House that there will be very full consultation on this whole matter. I visualise the Nuclear Energy Board and myself and my officials engaging in such consultation over the next 12 months.  The House can be assured that this sort of consultation will take <Col N="98" /> place and that we will not go ahead with a project of this magnitude without consultation with all the interests concerned north and south of the Border.  One point which was raised by Deputies and which I would like to emphasise is that the great merit of having nuclear generation is that the running costs are low.  The great difficulty is the enormous capital investment involved.</P>

      <P>We share this disadvantage with the EEC, that the vital ingredient for reactor breeding, uranium, does not exist in Western Europe.  Canada and Australia are the principal countries supplying this material.  Of course, as mentioned by Senator Dooge in his very interesting contribution in the Seanad, we are at a very early stage in this whole development of fission and fusion in regard to nuclear power.  Heretofore the problem has been that it has been impossible to get a reasonably-priced nuclear power station at a reasonable level of power production.  It is only in the very recent part that a 500 megawatt power station such as the one now envisaged by the ESB has become economic.  Only very recently 1,000 megawatt power stations were regarded as the minimum size.  It is only now, after 25 or 26 years of investigation in this field, that nuclear power production is becoming economic.  Deputy O'Donovan was right when he said that we and other Governments were wise to hasten slowly in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the gap is being narrowed by reason of the rise in fuel oil costs.  The extension of nuclear fission development is nuclear fusion, which is the most exciting power prospect of all time.  We are very much in the early stages as regards this, as Deputy O'Donnell said in the course of <Col N="99" /> his remarks, but if we can achieve nuclear fusion the hydrogen in the world is at our disposal for continuous power production.  That prospect is at least a generation ahead, but pending its realisation, which we hope will finally solve the world's power problems, we have to live with the various fuels I have mentioned, some of which, like oil, have been causing the world some trouble in the recent past.  In the interim period before we have nuclear fusion as a permanent power source, the sensible thing to do is to ensure that we, as a small country, have as diverse a range of fuels as possible from which to draw for power purposes, and the provision of nuclear energy for power production fits into this overall plan for diversifying our power sources.</P>

      <P>Tháinig an Coláiste Náisiúnta Ealaíne faoi chúram na Roinne Oideachais sa bhliain 1924 faoin teideal &ldquo;Metropolitan School of Art&rdquo;.  Sa bhliain 1936 tugadh an ainm do atá air faoi láthair.  Is é an príomhfhoras ealaíne sa tír é agus leantar cúrsaí ann sna saorealaíne, na h-ealaíne agus na céird ornáideacha agus in oiliúint múinteoirí ealaíne.  hOileadh sa choláiste tromlach ealaíontóirí cáiliúla na tíre agus bhain cuid mhór díobh clú amach dóibh féin thar lear.  Sa bhliain 1967 dubhrathas i dtuairisc an Chomisiún um Ard-Oideachais, ag tagairt don chóláiste, nach raibh modhanna riaracháin na státsheirbhíse feiliúnach do institiúd ard-oideachais.  Tá an ghné seo den choláiste scrúdaithe go mion agam agus sé mo thuairim láidir gur fearr an seans forbartha a bheadh ag an gcoláiste dá mbeadh sé faoi stiúradh bhoird neamhspleách nach mbeadh faoi thionchur rialacha na Státsheirbhíse.</P>
      <P>The National College of Art has a long and honoured history and has produced many distinguished alumni. Most of our outstanding artists received their training there and many of them achieved a high reputation both nationally and internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Commission on Higher Education expressed the view, <Col N="101" /> in relation to the National College of Art, that the administrative patterns of the Civil Service were not suited to an institute of higher education.  This was a view which had been previously expressed by my Department.  What was at issue was the means through which the situation might be altered. Events of the past two years have not helped in that direction.  However, this is no time for recrimination.  The positive approach provided in the Bill now before the House is what we are set to discuss here.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill it is proposed to amend the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, with a view to removing the college from my direct control and to establish an independent governing body whose duty it will be to carry out the management of the college and the organisation and administration of its affairs.  The functions of the board generally are set out in section 5 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>An Bord itself will consist of a chairman and eight to ten ordinary members. This number was considered the most suitable, being large enough to allow for representation of appropriate interests and small enough to ensure that it could carry out its functions with a degree of expedition which a larger and more unwieldy board might not.</P>
    <P>An innovation in the structure of a board such as this is the provision for teacher and student representation.  As the House is no doubt aware I have already introduced the concept of student representation on the governing body of three of the constituent colleges of the National University of Ireland.  In the case of the College of Art it is proposed to enshrine this concept in legislation and give it a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Some members of the college staff are permanent whole-time officers, having been appointed to their present posts as a result of competitions held by the Civil Service Commissioners. One part-time post was also filled on the recommendation of the Commissioners.  Special provision is being made to have these members of the staff retained in the service of An Bord on terms no less favourable than those they enjoy at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" /> Provision is also being made for a number of temporary teachers who have given long and substantial service to the college to ensure their retention on the staff, also on terms no less favourable than those they enjoy at the moment.  These are the only restrictions which are being placed on An Bord in the matter of the persons whom they may wish to appoint on the college staff.</P>
    <P>I am confident that under the aegis of an autonomous board, such as is proposed, working in accordance with the provisions of the Bill, the college will develop more rapidly so as to cater better for the increasing needs, both cultural and economic, of the community.  The new title proposed for the college emphasises the desirability of expanding facilities on the design side.  It also shows that a college such as this has not only a valuable part to play in the cultural life of the country but has also a vital place in the planning for our economic future.  Good quality is enhanced by good design and in a competitive market the good design will attract attention.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>No one on any side of the House could doubt the need for a Bill in order to establish the National College of Art as an autonomous institution under its own governing board or authority of some kind. In fact, I suppose there is no institution in this country which has so long needed a reform of this kind, in respect of which so many reports have been written advocating reforms of this or similar kinds and where the process of gestation has been so prolonged. It is, therefore, with some regret that I have to say that the Bill, as drafted, contains so many objectionable features that on this side of the House we cannot support it.  The principle of having a so-called independent board&mdash; the Minister used the word &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in his speech and I smiled when he used the word&mdash;to run this institution is one of course we accept, but when one reads through the Bill one discovers the dead hand of bureaucracy at every point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill throughout is literally <Col N="103" /> peppered with all kinds of controls &mdash;the Minister having authority to do this and that, nothing can be done unless the Minister agrees, indeed it is extended even to the point where there is a unique clause, to which I shall turn later, under which civil servants, from the Department of Finance and the Department of Education are entitled to march in at any time and demand from anybody, including members of the staff and the director, documents and information and have them fined if they refuse to produce them on the spot.  I have never heard of such a provision in respect of any body in the public sector, never mind an educational institution.</P>
    <P>A Bill with those draconian clauses, showing such extraordinary instincts of bureaucracy and dictatorship, which even though the object for which I suppose it is designed is one with which we sympathise, is a Bill which we cannot in this form support.  It is not merely a question of Committee Stage objections.  There will be many and I am afraid it will be a rather long Committee Stage debate, like the one on the HEA Bill.  It is something more fundamental.  It is the whole spirit of the Bill.  The Bill, grudgingly concedes that there shall be some kind of authority to run this college.  I can see why, because to have any kind of authority as a buffer between the Department on the one hand and the staff and students on the other will be a relief to the Department.  Far from wishing to be rid of this burden, to dispose of it to a genuine autonomous body, and breathe a sigh of relief, the Department want to have it both ways. They seek on the one hand to shed the burden of responsibility to the board and on the other hand to retain the rights of interference and intervention of a kind without parallel, running beyond even the kind of provisions there are in the HEA Bill.  I know the Minister will not accept what I say.  He will feel that what I am saying is exaggerated or unacceptable and that this Bill is a genuine effort to solve a problem.  I know all the phrases that are there.  He will be rather hurt at my approach to the Bill.  I am afraid there is here a gulf of comprehension.</P>

      <P>Even occasional helpful interventions will be very encouraging.  I can see the Minister will not really see what I am getting at.  I think he quite genuinely believes this Bill does what needs to be done but his class of mind and the extent to which he is in close sympathy with the bureaucratic instincts of people within his Department are such that something which to him is acceptable is repugnant to other people actually engaged in education or other people concerned with political liberties and individual freedom.  I will come back to that later.  I merely want to make clear at the beginning where we stand. There is no point in launching into a long historical dissertation, as I have to do, I am afraid, without first of all explaining where one stands.  I want it to be quite clear where I stand and where my party stand on this issue.</P>
      <P>Let us go back to the history behind this.  I smiled again when the Minister spoke of the long and honoured history of the college Of course, it would be surprising if a college of this kind with its long history had not many marks of distinction amongst those who have graduated from it. Indeed, it is honoured by the subsequent work and fame of many of its graduates.  Somehow, anybody following its chequered history over the past decade, if they had to choose one adjective and one only to describe it, would not, I think, immediately have leaped at the word &ldquo;honoured&rdquo; as the one most nearly describing the college as we have known it for the last ten years or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Its present situation goes back for quite a long time, indeed, before I was born, and it is only shortly after I was born that the first of many critical reports came, the first by the French experts in 1967 which suggested that the college should be re-organised in <Col N="105" /> the most thorough way.  They said it was a prime necessity to replace the headmaster and three of the staff.  I am sorry to say that the Government of the day rejected those recommendations. I do not know whether the recommendations were soundly based but they certainly echoed a number of later recommendations.</P>
    <P>The headmaster became a director and the staff were retained.  Perhaps that was the right thing to do.  I cannot judge because I have no knowledge beyond the bare recommendations of that time.  What is disturbing is that as far back as 44 years ago the kind of situation existed which we have now, of complaints and dissatisfaction and that we had reports of outside experts, highly critical, proposing that the staff be changed.</P>
    <P>We had the Scandinavian report of 1961 which stated that as at present constituted the college cannot be a starting point for education of people in the different arts&mdash;for the education of painters, sculptors and designers.  It went on to make many other criticisms of the college and how it was run.  A couple of years later there was the Council of Design report which stated that the premises were totally inadequate and made it difficult to improve the calibre of the students.</P>
    <P>In 1967 the Commission on Higher Education commented that the running of the college was unsatisfactory.  They stated that to have it under the Civil Service was an unsatisfactory arrangement which should be changed.  I understand that shortly after that there was a report of two art inspectors, not, I think, commissioned by the Department, which was highly critical.  I am open to correction about some of these because one hears one side and the other side and I hope that in the interest of the public the Minister will correct me, without, of course, dotting every &ldquo;i&rdquo; and crossing every &ldquo;t&rdquo;, but I have heard it said that the report was not published, that it was suppressed and not made available to the public and that even its authors were subsequently refused admission to the college.</P>
    <P>We then had the investigation by Mr. O'Connor, in August 1968, when <Col N="106" /> he spent two mornings each week investigating to see what should be done about the college.  I have also seen a reference&mdash;I have not been able to track this down any further&mdash;to a report by a second advisory council, but there was certainly a report by a sub-committee of the second advisory council which was not implemented, and this led to three resignations from that committee in protest.</P>
    <P>There is here a long history of investigation and study, a number of them initiated by the popular authority, the Government of the day, none of them leading to action, and when one comes to consider the deplorable events of the past three years one must put a good deal of the blame on the failure of the Government to do anything about the situation revealed by these reports.  One cannot condone some of the activities of some of the people in the college in the past couple of years but one can understand the kind of frustrations that led to the outbreaks that occurred.  Indeed, anybody who has any kind of fire in his belly would find it hard to put up with the conditions that have been there and the failure to take any action, and it is easy to understand people in the heat of the moment taking the sort of action which one ordinarily could not recommend.</P>
    <P>In the past three years, the centre of interest has shifted from the persistent flow of critical reports to the relations between the college&mdash;students and staff&mdash;and the Minister and the Department.  During this period there has been a history of relations which has been uniquely satisfactory.  I think it is fair to say that it was unfortunate that the Minister who had to deal with this problem in 1968 was Deputy Brian Lenihan, now Minister for Transport and Power, because his predilection for promising various solutions to problems, whether these solutions are ones which can be achieved quickly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;had caused problems in many areas where you pass through, but I do not think there is any area where he could have done <Col N="107" /> so much damage as in the College of Art.  I am afraid the students at that time, somewhat naïvely politically, finding themselves faced with a very genial, friendly Minister who seemed very sympathetic with their case, who promised all kinds of reforms and changes, took his promises seriously and I am afraid that a good deal of what followed has been because of the frustration following discovery by the students that none of the promises was worth the paper on which it was written.  The Minister refused to write them down or to sign them although he had promised to do that, too.</P>
      <P>The first meeting of the students with that Minister was in April, 1968. With his customary ebullience, Deputy Lenihan promised them immediate action, new buildings within five years &mdash;this is a long time for a Brian Lenihan promise: they are usually for shorter periods&mdash;a governing body with student participation within one month and another meeting with them within three weeks.  The times get shorter as one goes along.  The next meeting was three months later, in August 1968.  I understand he apologised, as it is customary for him to do on these occasions, and in order to allay their dissatisfaction he shortened the time for the building of the new college from five years to three years.  He also promised a new governing body by Christmas.</P>
      <P>However, when Christmas came this present was not given to the students. Instead, the promise was withdrawn and instead an advisory council was proposed which the students, with the patience they showed at that time, accepted.  I think they were unwise to do so&mdash;they should have stood firm on the previous promise in regard to the governing body.  At that time, however, they were completely naïve and perhaps, too easily conciliated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advisory council was set up and within two months&mdash;again, I admit I may have been misled in some of this information&mdash;the council thus established, consisting of two Government representatives, I think three staff and three students, with Mr. O'Connor from the Department as director, accepted proposals from the students that there <Col N="108" /> should be established an executive committee of art educationalists. Acceptance of this proposal eliminated the reason for the committee's own existence.  This recommendation by the advisory council, which the Minister had himself established, was rejected by Mr. O'Connor at that stage and this led to a point where the students withdrew and there was the first closure of the college.</P>
    <P>In March, 1969, the whole cycle was taken up again.  Again, meetings took place between the students and the civil servants.  There were two more meetings with Deputy Lenihan at which a second interim advisory council was offered and, I think, accepted, again, the students showing exemplary patience, having been codded about the governing body and having been codded about the promised acceptance of the recommendations of the first advisory council. They very patiently accepted the second advisory council, this one to consist of the director, who would be chairman, two students, two teachers, a departmental art inspector and six others from the field of art education and design.</P>
    <P>This second advisory council appointed a sub-committee, to which I have already referred, to look into the question of what should be done about the college.  At the same time, Deputy Lenihan promised consultations with the students at all stages of the drafting of the Bill.  A number of promises were made&mdash;the students listed them at 20, but, of course, they probably split them up into sub-promises and made them seem as numerous as possible&mdash; and the Minister promised to sign them when they were written down.  I recall that particular occasion because I met some of the students and saw their sense of elation and subsequent frustration when that particular promise to sign the promises was not implemented.</P>
    <P>The college was re-opened on 15th April and when Deputy Lenihan refused either to sign the promises or to keep them the first occupation took place, an occupation during which damage was done to these plaster casts, which have intrigued this House for some months past and whose provenance, <Col N="109" /> values and artistic merit have been matters of considerable debate here. Indeed, it is nice to see the House so concerned about matters of such artistic merit because it does not often spend much of its time discussing them. I found it a little difficult to believe the value placed on these heavily overpainted 19th century objects.  We never, of course, managed to discover at question time, as Deputy Thornley will recall, who the expert was who placed this remarkable valuation on them. However, the students in their frustration did do damage to these plaster casts and they are not to be condoned for doing that, although the fact that they occupied the college on that and other occasions is something which is very easy to understand in the circumstances of this extraordinary litany of broken promises and mismanagement.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the sub-committee of the second advisory council appointed by the Minister reported.  Their report favoured the dissolution of the college as it stood and the setting up of a new institution with re-staffing. This was not the first report that emphasised the need to re-staff the college; this has been the recurrent theme through the long period of the college's existence.  It is not easy for this House to assess the validity of these recommendations but any institution which is the subject of so many reports, a number of which do contain this recommendation, raises questions as to whether the present staffing is entirely satisfactory.  This report recommended that all existing posts should at least be technically dissolved so that a fresh start could be made.</P>
    <P>This report was not accepted or implemented and three members of the council, Professor Christopher Ryan, Professor Geoffrey Hewitt, principal of the Cork School of Art, and Mr. Dermot Larkin, resigned in protest against the non-implementation of the report which they had been asked to prepare.  Mr. Dermot Larkin has been reported as saying that all the members of the advisory council, other than the actual members of the staff of the college, agreed with this report.  I can understand the hesitation of the staff of the college to agree with a report <Col N="110" /> which suggested that their contracts should be terminated and not necessarily renewed.  I should like to hear from the Minister if it is true that all the other members agreed with the recommendations and if not, how many of them agreed because that is a very serious and important point for us to know about.</P>
    <P>There followed a period of relative calm, despite the frustrations caused by the non-implementation of this further recommendation, until May, 1970, when the students proposed that an association of members of the College of Art, comprising all the students and all the staff, should run it.  This was accompanied by a further occupation by a group of students, but not all the students, and this was followed by a meeting with the present Minister.  At this stage we start having meetings with a Minister who, although we may have criticisms of the way he has handled this affair and the Bill before us, at least does not promise what he does not intend to do or what he is not capable of performing. If anything I would fault the present Minister with promising too little rather than too much.  The Minister regarded the student group as not representative and rejected all their proposals which was a refreshing change from the approach of Deputy Lenihan.</P>
    <P>In October last year we had the introduction of gardaí into the college to remove an unregistered student.  As I understand it, he had been suspended in May and although he had refused to submit his work, it had been passed by two external assessors; he was never let fail but was later awarded the diploma after a nominal assessment. One feature of the college's history in the last couple of years has been the number of occasions on which disciplinary measures were instituted, very unwisely at times, and subsequently had to be retrieved or modified when commonsense broke in.  That itself is bad for discipline in any educational institution; disciplinary measures should be few and far between and when they are undertaken they should not be undertaken unless it is absolutely clear they are necessary and unless <Col N="111" /> those concerned are going to stand over them.  It is very unwise to discipline people, without adequate reason, in a half-baked way and then have to climb down.  Towards the end of last year also, Miss Lucy Charles was appointed acting director, a decision which evoked protest from the students.  In the current year we have had the dismissal of the model, the appointment of Mr. Michael O'Neill as administrator, a further occupation in April, and the events of the last couple of months of which the House is all too much aware.</P>
    <P>In all that tangled history whoever is to blame it is not the students.  I am not saying they are not to blame for their actions and frustrations and that their actions were not, at times, reprehensible, but it is not they who established the college, it is not they who run the college and it is not they who fail to reform it.  They are the victims and as victims sometimes are, they have been sulky victims, reluctant victims and angry victims.  It is more important that we have regard to their status as victims than to the adjectives one can apply to the kind of victims they were.  Their behaviour was less than perfect at times but the fact that they were faced with the intense frustration of repeated promises of change and reform and the failure to implement these promises, explains a good deal of their behaviour.  In fact, although they have been blamed for causing damage on several occasions, I do not think the position has been helped by the exaggeration of the damage done.</P>
    <P>Throughout most of the period and at many stages during this complex and devious history their actions have been surprisingly moderate.  Their willingness to accept the dropping of the promise of the governing body, their willingness to accept the collapse of the first advisory council and their willingness to accept the second advisory council, the extent to which they accepted being strung along with promises of various kinds, does not suggest a group of wild, revolutionaries looking for every possible occasion to cause trouble.  It suggests a group of students not particularly radical for the <Col N="112" /> most part, rather politically naïve, gradually becoming increasingly frustrated after months and even years of frustration and total mishandling at political and Civil Service level and some, although by no means all, of the staff, reaching a state of frustration when their behaviour continued in its immoderation.  That is the best description one can make of the way this has evolved.</P>
    <P>There have been a great many misunderstandings.  Misunderstandings were, perhaps, inevitable when a Government Department, administrative civil servants, were running not just an educational institution but this particular educational institution because the College of Art is the kind of educational institution which is least likely to be successfully or happily run on simple, bureaucratic lines.  If one had to pick the educational institution in charge of which one would not put civil servants, despite their great merits, it would be an art college. One might possibly put them in charge of a college of public administration but not an art college.</P>
    <P>There is a conviction on the part of the students that they are being victimised in all kinds of ways and often, perhaps these convictions are delusions. The situation they have been in has bred paranoia.  I believe I have evidence, from what I have heard from both sides, of misunderstandings on both the part of the Minister, whose contacts have been necessarily somewhat indirect&mdash;he has met the students on several occasions but on the whole the contacts have been through civil servants&mdash;and misunderstandings on the part of the civil servants concerned. The conviction of the civil servants, which has extended to the Minister, and has been evident in both the reactions of the Minister and the civil servants, that they are faced with a band of dangerous revolutionaries, stems a good deal from a failure to understand the students.  Those of us who are involved in the educational process and who have occasion to deal with students frequently and are very much involved with them become more accustomed to the use of revolutionary language and treat it without too much seriousness.  When students talk to us <Col N="113" /> about the neo-colonialist, imperialist attitude of the college authorities we do not get terribly excited about it. We translate that into saying that they are not satisfied with the cloakroom facilities or something like that.  Of course, there are among young people today individuals who have revolutionary leanings and some of these may be quite effective organisers although the fissiparous tendencies of the extreme left usually undo any work achieved by the vociferous tendencies of the extreme left and very often these groups are much less dangerous than the noise they make would appear to suggest.</P>
    <P>I think some of the difficulties have arisen because the authorities of the college&mdash;perhaps the staff, most certainly the civil servants and the Minister&mdash;have taken much too seriously the language used occasionally and I am not convinced, as they seem to be, that there are people there who are determined to break up our institutions. Perhaps there are some, nobody can prove negatives anyway, but certainly on the record of how this whole business has gone and judging it by the standards of other educational institutions and their experience, I do not detect much revolutionary activity going on there but a surprising moderation in the early periods turning into a very unfortunate radicalism on the part of the minority at a later stage. Above all, I detect a sense of confusion, unhappiness and, at times, despair on the part of students most of whom and conceivably indeed all of whom simply want to get a decent art education and are utterly frustrated about getting it in the present conditions.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will not agree with me.  He will say, with justice, that he is closer to it than I am or at least that he is in direct contact with the civil servants who have to deal with the individual people concerned, that my contacts are only with certain people, that I only see the good side of them, that they put on a good face when they are talking to me and that I do not know the whole truth.  No doubt he can say this, but I am still not convinced and I would on the whole tend to trust my own instinct in these matters, even <Col N="114" /> based on the more limited knowledge I have, than trust to his judgement or that of some of his officers who, I think, are not really in a position perhaps to assess just how seriously meant are some of the things that have been said.</P>
    <P>So much for background and history. It suggests to me the need now to make a very real break.  It suggests to me that the last thing we want is a so-called autonomous authority which must turn to the Minister for approval of many of its actions and the very last thing we want is a college into which at any hour of day or night civil servants can march and demand to see documents and if a member of the staff stops them to say &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; to them and thereby delays them&mdash;I am taking the extreme case of course to show the absurdity of it&mdash;he can be fined £100.  It is inconceivable to me that you can have an educational institution into which civil servants have the right to march, to demand to see documents, and if not handed what they want immediately by staff or students, by the administrative staff, the registrar, the director, anybody, and if not just obstructed but delayed even, can go to the courts and have penalties imposed on the people concerned.  I suppose one runs a labour camp like that.  No doubt there are countries where there are labour camps run like that.  I suppose the punishment is something different to a fine because there would not be much money floating around a labour camp not that there is that much money floating around the College of Art either, I think.</P>
    <P>As a way of running an education establishment it is frankly incredible.  I can only hope that the Minister will have second thoughts and that section 25 of this Bill, which shows him and his advisers in so far as they have any responsibility for it, in a very bad light, will be withdrawn.  I do not believe frankly that when the Minister stands back from it and thinks about it his better self will want to stand over it and I know many members of his party who would not wish to be associated with a measure of this kind involving this draconian provision for constant, continuous civil service interference in the affairs of an educational institution with penalties before the <Col N="115" /> courts for anybody who delays them as they go about their business, business which they should not have at all in such an institution.</P>
    <P>Far from wanting to set up that kind of institution what we want is a College of Art as far removed as possible from the public administration, financed by public funds, suitably controlled to ensure that they are properly expended.  We have a system now through the Higher Education Authority for doing this.  I see no reason why &mdash;at least I see a reason but I do not regard it as a valid reason&mdash;this body should not be financed through the HEA and put at a remove from the Department of Education.  In saying that I am conscious of the fact, although he is not here at the moment, that I am probably by so doing losing Deputy O'Donovan's sympathy and support.  Despite that I still think there is something to be said for the buffering of it especially in this case when there has been so much buffeting that a buffer seems very much to be desired.</P>
    <P>There are many other features of the College of Art and the way it has been and is operating which we need to consider in the context of this Bill. It is only when one considers these that one can really see the Bill in perspective and really see what is wrong with it and why we need a very different kind of Bill.  I shall run through about half a dozen features of the college which seem to require a bit of attention.  One which I am very puzzled by is the system under which students pass their assessments or examinations.  The arrangements is, on the face of it, satisfactory enough.  They present their work for assessment to two outside assessors and their professor. The decision, I suppose, is taken by the majority and it seems to me on the whole an unexceptionable system assuming that the external assessors are well and properly chosen and I have no reason to think they are not.  That would be all right if that having been done students then passed but in this most curious of institutions when they have been passed, when their artistic work has been approved of by the external assessors and their own professor and they are judged to <Col N="116" /> have passed and to have qualified either in the final year for the diploma or in an earlier year to pass on to the next year, at that stage the assessments go to the Department for approval. If I recall correctly the representations made to me last year, they remain there for rather a long time.  I seem to recall being asked by students to find out how much longer it would be before they got their results.  I was rather started to discover that the results were held up in the Department. I believe that last year&mdash;again the Minister will contradict me if I am wrong and he probably will have some corrections to make in some of the things I am saying&mdash;one student passed by the assessors, internal and external, was in fact failed by the Department who have no function it is the matter whatsoever because it is not their job to withdraw the award of a pass to a student who has been assessed in this way.  I believe that subsequently after protest the student was in fact passed.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister what exact function is meant to be performed by the Department.  Why do the marks have to go to the Department? Have the Department at any time in the past three years failed somebody who was passed by the assessors? Why have they done so?  On what grounds do they assert the right to do so?  What is the purpose of this extraordinary mechanism?  I should like to have an assurance from him that in the current year&mdash;because this process is going on at present&mdash;students who have been passed by the assessors will not be deprived of that pass by any administrative action by the Department.</P>
    <P>It is a curious fact&mdash;I believe it to be a fact&mdash;that this year the external assessors have been asked not to say anything to the students about how they got on.  It has been the normal informal practice in the past, as it is very often in the university and other institutions of higher education, to tell the students informally how they have done before the formal results come out.  One is often pressed for this information and one often gives students an indication of how they have done if the position is clearcut.  If they were borderline cases obviously before they <Col N="117" /> would go to the final board you would not, but once they go to the board the marks are published and everybody knows where he is.  This year for some reason external assessors appear to have been asked not to disclose this information to students.  One wonders whethere this new procedure betokens any increased intention on the part of the Department to utilise a power which they appear to claim to overturn a decision of the assessors and, for their own reasons, to fail a student who has passed.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know from the Minister if there is any truth in the statement made to me that on this occasion the external assessors were approached by administrative civil servants in respect of some of the students, not about their work but about their character.  My information is that the external assessors were astonished at this, resentful of it, and regarded it as something they had never come across anywhere in the world.  Is it the case that such contacts took place between administrative civil servants and the external assessors? Were the external assessors approached by administrative civil servants about the characters of the students, about what kind of people they were?  What was the purpose of such intervention? If it took place&mdash;and I should like a clear assurance from the Minister on this matter&mdash;what could the purpose be other than to prejudice the external assessors against the students?</P>
    <P>I doubt if it would work because most academics&mdash;and these people are academics&mdash;have very high standards in these matters and any attempt to prejudice them against a student usually has very little effect indeed.  I should like to know precisely what this mechanism is, why the Department retain this right, and have they in the past failed people the assessors had passed? Can the Minister assure me that it will not happen this year?  What contacts took place, about the students, between administrative civil servants and the external assessors?  These are questions that have to be asked in view of the situation that exists in the college.</P>
    <P>Another recent event in the college which I found very disturbing, and <Col N="118" /> which we ventilated in the Dáil but which we have not sufficiently sorted out yet, is the curious case of the conflicting statements after the meeting with the Minister.  There was a meeting between the staff and the Minister which I had some little part in trying to get going by trying to get the two sides together to talk.  This meeting was followed by a statement by the Secretary of the staff association expressing dissatisfaction.  As I understand it, that statement was issued without the authority of his colleagues, off his own bat, and was his assessment of the meeting.  There followed a statement issued in the names of seven of the nine members of the staff concerned which did not actually repudiate the secretary's statement, as such, but repudiated Press reports suggesting that they were dissatisfied with the meeting with the Minister.</P>
    <P>In this statement, very properly I think, they paid tribute to the courtesy of the Minister.  Indeed, I must say that both members of the staff and students I have met have been at one in paying tribute to his courtesy and his willingness to listen to their views. There is no question about that.  They may not feel that he always takes the action they want him to take, but they all feel that they have had a full and courteous hearing from him.  After the issue of that statement by the seven members of the staff, or on their behalf, other Press reports appeared, other statements were made, which suggested that they were prompted to make that statement.</P>
    <P>We have had this out at Question Time and I must say that I was not impressed with the Minister's approach. I respect the Minister's integrity and I respect his honesty.  I am not suggesting that on this occasion he was dishonest, but he chose his words with great care, as is customary with politicians, to deny what had not been asserted.  The basic fact which concerns us here is that a statement was issued by the Government Information Bureau on behalf of the Department of Education, the flat statement that this letter was written of their own volition and without any prompting from any officer of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> If the word &ldquo;prompting&rdquo; means anything, it refers to a process under which a man is rung up, asked to come in, asked what he thinks of a matter, a letter is shown to him, and he is asked to sign it.  In fact, I would use a stronger word than &ldquo;prompting&rdquo;.  I could not use a less strong word than &ldquo;prompting&rdquo;.  That happened.  I have spoken to the man concerned. Incidentally, the Press reports of what I said in the Dáil on the last occasion were misleading in one respect and I want to correct any false impression given.  Perhaps the problem lies in the punctuation of what I said rather than the wording.  I did not say or intend to say that three members of the staff were shown a handwritten draft and that what appeared subsequently may not have been the same thing.  This was true of one member of the staff who was shown a handwritten draft of a letter in what he understood to be the handwriting of the civil servant concerned.</P>
    <P>The other two people to whom I spoke were shown a typed letter with signatures attached which was the final letter.  Owing, I think, to a fault in the punctuation, which extended to some degree to the Official Report, the suggestion was attributed to me a couple of weeks ago that, in fact, all three of them had been shown a handwritten letter.  That was not the case.  It was only the case in regard to one of them. It was only in one case that the teacher was summoned in by telephone to be shown this and asked to sign it.  In other cases the approaches were in the college and were less formal, but nonetheless the initiative in each of the cases I have tracked down came from the civil servant concerned.</P>
    <P>It is not satisfactory that the public should be misled by this kind of heading: &ldquo;No Prompting of Art teachers.&rdquo; The heading seems to be fully warranted by the text of the statement given underneath: &ldquo;This letter was written of their own volition and without any prompting from any officer of the Department of Education.&rdquo;  The Minister should not stand over that statement.  He should admit that a mistake was made, that whoever issued that statement went beyond what could <Col N="120" /> be justified and that, when a man is summoned in by telephone and shown a document and asked to sign it, that is prompting by any standards.  Indeed, even if somebody is approached in the corridor and asked: &ldquo;What did you think of what you saw in the papers about the meeting?  Do you think this kind of letter would represent your views?  Would you like to sign it&rdquo;&mdash; especially when he is a member of the part-time staff and could be sacked at a moment's notice by the civil servant concerned&mdash;I regard that, too, as prompting.</P>
    <P>The Department should not have issued that statement.  The Minister should have admitted the mistake in the House.  He should not have stood over it as he did.  I hope that, on reflection, and having thought over what I have said, and having considered the matter more fully, the Minister will, in replying to this debate, admit that an error was made there and that, in appearing to stand over it in the Dáil, he acted in error.  He will lose nothing by admitting to a mistake in a case like that.  On the contrary, I think his reputation will be enhanced.  I know as a politician that there is a widespread delusion amongst all politicians that to admit to making a mistake is disastrous.  This is a very widespread delusion and I can understand the Minister sharing it.  I hope that on this occasion he will see the wisdom of owning up that a mistake was made.</P>
    <P>This incident tells us something about the whole atmosphere of the college and the way it is run.  It demonstrates that it is a mistake to have an institution of this type run directly by the Civil Service.  I say this with no animus against civil servants but, to each man his job.  The job of civil servants is one of public administration. There are few things further removed from public administration than running a College of Art.  I suppose that in so far as they were running something, and administration is running something also, there is a kind of generic similarity between the two, but I do not think that the job of administering a Government Department, staffed by civil servants under a strict code of discipline&mdash;the Official Secrets Act and all the rest of it&mdash;is <Col N="121" /> in any way comparable to the job of running a College of Art.  All the evidence is that it has been unsatisfactory. The Minister may say: &ldquo;I agree.  That is precisely why the Bill is being brought in.&rdquo;  He may say that, perhaps, his predecessor should have done it sooner but at least he has brought in a Bill and, up to a point, that is true.  It is the terms of the Bill, and the determination on the part of those who drafted the Bill to retain tight control over so many areas and so many aspects of the running of the new board, that make me dissatisfied with the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are other features of the college which require more consideration. There are repeated allegations by the students that they are not issued with materials which have been purchased out of public funds and should be available to them.  I must admit that I have never understood these allegations.  I am not at all clear as to what happens to the materials and why the students do not get them. The persistence with which they make this claim suggests to me that there is something here at least to be looked into.</P>
    <P>They have also pointed out&mdash;and this has been validated in this House in replies to questions&mdash;that only part, approximately half, of the money allocated for scholarships is spent.  It would be easy for the Minister to say that they do not reach the standard but it seems to me that, in an institution of this kind where so many of the students are not at all well off and have to struggle very hard to keep themselves, it is most unfortunate to have a fund of money voted by the Dáil to assist these students by way of scholarship or grant not fully used.  The Minister can stand on the fact that, on the advice given to him, they are not all up to the standard required.  However, we should be thinking more in terms of grants than scholarships and the money available should be used for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year while driving down the country I gave a lift to a student from the College of Art.  At the time of stopping to offer her a lift I was not aware that she was a student from the college but, as is my custom on <Col N="122" /> encountering anyone seeking a lift, I offered her a lift.  In the course of conversation she told me that in order to put herself through the college she found it necessary to go down the country on two days each week to teach art, for which she received £8. By avoiding transport costs she lived on that £8 and got through the course even though the two days spent teaching would have an effect on her attendance and the amount of work she could do.  I have nothing but admiration for somebody whose determination to achieve his or her chosen career extends to such devotion and dedication as in that particular case. The fact that that girl and so many other students in the college have such a struggle to make ends meet emphasises how deplorable and saddening it is that funds voted by the Dáil to help such students should not be used fully.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that this small sum of £5,000 is not held back on the grounds of whether students reach a particular standard.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of library facilities but on this there are conflicting accounts.  Students insist on saying that the books are locked up and are not accessible to them, but the Minister says this is not the case and that the books are available to students. Short of going in and wandering around the place, a facility which, on at least one occasion, has been forbidden to politicians, I cannot check up on this matter.  It is to be deplored that Members of the Oireachtas have been forbidden from going into the college.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This displays an extraordinary attitude of mind on the part of the civil servants who gave such a ruling.  I understand that since March of this year the students have appropriated to themselves a room wherein they have put some books but, in doing so, they have acted in an unauthorised manner.  I do not know what justification there can be for denying the books to the students.  For all I know, the students who have been so refused are students who are suspected of having done damage to books on previous occasions, but in any case <Col N="123" /> the whole matter throws a curious light on the atmosphere of this academic institution.</P>
      <P>This year, too, there was the curious incident concerning repeats.  I have here a circular in this regard which is dated the 14th May and which says that failure to present work for assessment at the end of the session can automatically debar students from enrolment in the college for the following session.  This is an entirely new practice. One principle which, so far as I know, all academic institutions operate is that the rules of the game are not changed half way through.  It is not the practice of such institutions to entice the students to enrol on the understanding that there are repeat arrangements in operation but then, half way through the course, to tell them that the opportunities for repeats are being cancelled.  The proper way to do this is to say: &ldquo;As and from enrolment this year, there will be no repeats.&rdquo;  However, that is not the way in which the civil servants have acted in this instance.  This is another illustration of the reasons why the students are experiencing a sense of victimisation and frustration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another feature of the college is the very small number of full-time staff and the proliferation of part-time staff, nine of whom, if I recall correctly the answers given to parliamentary questions, teach a number of hours, which, in secondary or vocational school, would warrant them being treated as full-time staff.  The Minister's explanation of this is that he did not wish to prejudice the position with regard to the new governing board by appointing these people full-time, but in the Bill he introduces a provision under which any part-time staff having five or more years service are to be transferred to the new board. What was the purpose of not making them permanent while they were in the employment of the public service if, when the board is set up, they are to be transferred?  Perhaps the explanation is that they are to be transferred in the same capacity in which they now are so that the new board will be able to dismiss them if they are <Col N="124" /> part-time staff.  Whatever the reason or justification for this an institution run on that basis with so few full-time staff cannot be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>From my own experience I know that staff who have not got security of tenure will not be willing to stand up and be counted on issues between students and administrators.  There is a natural reluctance on the part of such staff to assert themselves when there are cases of, for example, suspected injustice in regard to students.  Of course, in such circumstances, they should stand up and be counted in the same way as all of us should, regardless of circumstances.  It is not for the politicians, who trim their sails to every little breeze, to criticise other people who, lacking any security of tenure, are unwilling to speak out in the fear that by so doing they might lose their jobs.</P>
    <P>Might I say that it is not necessary that somebody be dismissed before such fear exists because there could still persist, in an irrational way, the fear that one might be first to be dismissed.  An institution that is staffed to such an extent with part-time people as is the College of Art, cannot, in the academic sense, be satisfactory. The Minister may say that it was not desired to hand over a lot of full-time permanent staff to the new board; all that can be said is that the present conditions in the college owe much to the long delay in doing anything about the matter.  I can understand the Minister and successive Ministers not wishing to give to the new board all the existing staff but, if the logical consequence of that was to be a growing proportion of part-time staff, this emphasises the urgency of getting the board established.  It has taken a long time to reach the stage of introducing this Bill which is aimed at the establishment of the board.</P>
    <P>Now, to consider the Bill itself&mdash;I have already outlined the main objections to it but I shall consider them now in more detail in order to validate the opposition to it as drafted and on which we, on this side of the House, intend to give voice.  First, we shall consider the Minister's powers as proposed in the Bill.  Let me emphasise <Col N="125" /> here that we are talking now of an academic institution.  The Minister might make some kind of a case, as he tried to do in regard to the Higher Education Authority Bill, for giving himself certain powers in a State-sponsored body administering public funds.  I do not accept that case.  In the case of an academic teaching institution similar to a university of higher education when one finds that the Minister is included at every point, one begins to worry as to whether there is to be academic freedom of any kind.</P>
    <P>In section 5 the functions of the board are set out.  I would have thought that the one section of the Bill that would not include reference to the Minister would have been that dealing with the functions of the board. These functions should be laid down by the Dáil.  At least in the case of the HEA Bill the aims and objectives of the Authority were laid down in fairly clear terms.  We added a couple of objectives to these, but these were not determined by the Minister; they were determined by the Dáil The functions of this board are set out as:</P>
    <P>establishing and carrying on schemes of education of such scope and extent as it may determine with the consent of the Minister, in art, crafts and design...</P>
    <P>What has the Minister got to do with it?  It is unimaginable to me that we should have an academic institution which could not determine for themselves the scheme of education in art, crafts and design but which would have to go to the Minister to obtain his consent as to whether to teach sculpture, painting or some other form of art.  The Minister and the Dáil should decide what this body is to do. It should be decided what kind of institution it is, it should be spelled out clearly and they should be allowed to get on with the job.  There should be no question of going back to the Minister for consent to the activities carried on at the National College of Art.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (2) (b) states:</P>
    <P>If so requested by the Minister, providing courses for the training of persons as teachers of art,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> The Minister should not be involved in this matter.  Section 5 (2) (c) states:</P>
    <P>If so requested by the Minister, providing courses and lectures for the further training of teachers of art as such teachers,</P>
    <P>and this is another aspect of the same thing.  Section 5 (2) (e) states:</P>
    <P>establishing and carrying on schemes, of such scope and extent as it may determine with the consent of the Minister, for the giving of scholarships, bursaries, prizes and other awards in relation to art, crafts and design,</P>
    <P>In a university institution the decision about the granting of prizes or awards is a matter for the university&mdash;the authorities do not go to the Minister. Of course, the universities get grants largely from the Dáil on the authority of the Minister but because the bulk of the finances of the universities are so provided there is no question on that account that every detail of scholarships and prizes must be cleared with the Minister.  That would be regarded as an intolerable intrusion in the autonomy of the universities and even the present Government have not the nerve to propose such action.  Yet, this body cannot give a prize for sculpture without the consent of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (3) (a) states:</P>
    <P>An Bord shall have such other functions as may be assigned to it from time to time by the Minister by order.</P>
    <P>In other words, the whole operation of this body, the scope of its activities, the prizes and scholarships it gives and the kind of teaching courses provided cannot be settled except with the approval of the Minister.  This is abnormal for educational institutions and I see no reason for it.</P>
    <P>There is another feature of the Bill which is not germane to my present argument but which I shall mention in passing.  It is the rather curious reference to the National Council for Educational Awards.  My experience of legislation is limited to the last six years.  I may have missed a number of points in that time but I do not recall <Col N="127" /> offhand instances where there was reference in a Bill to a non-existent body which it is intended to introduce in future legislation.  In fact, it is the practice to make a general provision of such a kind so that it can be applied when a particular body comes into existence.  I should like the Minister's comment on what seems to be a curious process of draftsmanship.  It seems odd to have this reference to the National Council for Educational Awards before the Dáil has considered whether to have such a body.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 6 there is the feature, common to this case and the HEA, of the chairman being appointed and removed from office by the Minister&mdash;he is not an elected chairman. I should like to know the Minister's reasons for this.  As I understand it, the chairman's function is purely procedural; he is not carrying out a function in his own right, he simply presides at meetings.  In the circumstances, why should the Minister appoint him?  In any normal educational institution it is the board or the staff who elect the president.  Why should the president, or his equivalent, be appointed by the Minister?  This is not the case in the colleges of the NUI.  Because of historical accident it is more or less the case in Trinity College, but even there the system is that three names are sent forward in order of priority and the Government appoint the first.  Therefore, in theory the Government appoints the Provost of Trinity College but in practice he is chosen by the college.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that by dealing with the Bill in this fashion we are dealing with it as if we were on Committee Stage, if the Deputy goes too deeply into these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not dwell in detail on it.  It always seems to me valuable on Second Stage to indicate major issues that will be debated on Committee Stage so that the Minister may consider them.  As one moves on to section 13 one finds that the Minister has power to vary the quorum of the board, which is an extraordinary provision.  In section 14 the Minister has power to lay down conditions regarding current grants which, of course, would give him a complete say in how the college is run.  Section 17 provides conditions regarding the appointment of the director and registrar.  In section 22 the approval of the Minister is required for the construction or acquisition of premises. The Minister must approve the money for the premises&mdash;which is correct as capital expenditure is involved &mdash;but the details of the premises that are to be built must also be approved by him.</P>
      <P>Throughout the Bill the Minister plays a role in the affairs of the body which is not appropriate to an institution of this kind.  In view of the unhappy history of this body, as it has been under the control of the Department of Education and under the responsibility of successive Ministers, I should have thought this was one instance where the Minister should be careful to stay out.</P>
      <P>There are two other aspects of the Bill I wish to speak about.  First, I would emphasise how utterly repugnant is section 25 and I would ask the Minister to reconsider it.  This section states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> (1) An officer of the Minister or the Minister for Finance duly authorised in that behalf by the Minister or the Minister for Finance, as the case may be, may, at all reasonable times&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) enter the premises of the College and inspect them,</P>
    <P>(b) while on the premises, require any person having in his possession or control any records or documents relating to the College to produce them,</P>
    <P>(c) while on the premises, inspect, examine, copy or take extracts from any such records or documents.</P>
    <P>(2) A person who wilfully obstructs or delays an officer of the Minister or the Minister for Finance in the exercise of his powers under subsection (1) of this section or who does not furnish information within his power or procurement in connection with any records or documents relating to the college reasonably requested by such officer shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100.</P>
    <P>We shall debate this on Committee Stage but I wish to emphasise this as an illustration of the attitude of mind of those who drafted the Bill.  It is surprising that the Minister did not tell us more about this extraordinary provision and I should like to hear why this was considered necessary.  The power to go into any educational institution, to go to a teacher or an officer and demand&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the Deputy is dealing with matters which should be reserved for Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, this is a matter of principle.  I shall not dwell on it but it is repugnant that such power should be given to a civil servant in any educational institution. I hope the Minister will think twice about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point which I submit is of considerable importance to the institution on which I should like to <Col N="130" /> speak, namely, the transfer of staff.  I am of two minds on this matter.  I see the problem.  On the one hand, there is a very natural fear on the part of some of the junior staff in particular that their interests may not be adequately protected, that, under this Bill, they might be dropped out, not appointed, or victimised for their activities in seeking reforms of this kind.  This fear may be ill-founded but, as I said, when staff do not have any protection, when they are vulnerable, they get these feelings and ideas.  It may be paranoic but it is nonetheless deeply felt for all that.  I can sympathise with them.  From one viewpoint I would argue that the provision in the Bill which limits the transfer of staff to the new board to staff having five years, or more, teaching experience in the college is inadequate.  The normal period of probation in university institutions is three years.  It is a little curious to choose a period of five years.  It is, in fact, this choice of an unusual period which has aroused some fears of victimisation on the part of some members of the staff.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, there is the problem that the Bill, as drafted, will transfer to the new institution and present to the new director, whoever he may be, all the existing permanent staff and a significant proportion of the existing temporary staff.  It has been a characteristic of staff reports on this institution, not only in 1927 but more recently, that these reports have recommended that the whole question of the continuance of the staff should be considered.  The long history of this college has not been marked by a situation in which either the students or, indeed, the public generally have been encouraged to have confidence in the staff and the reports that have been made and published were so critical of the institution and, in some cases, of the staff that one must be a little concerned here.</P>
    <P>I am not too sure that it is wise to commit this board to having to take over all the existing staff.  I can understand the desire to protect the interests of existing staff but, in so far as the institution's problems are due to any extent to the existing staff&mdash;and some of the reports that have been made suggest this&mdash;we should think seriously <Col N="131" /> before we commit the new board to having to take over the entire staff.  Of course, if there were any question of not taking them over, it would be obviously necessary and right that adequate provision should be made for compensation for anybody not so continued. It may be a matter for the new director, whoever he may be, and, of course, results will again depend on that appointment.  It will be the first responsibility of the new board, and the future of this college will hang on that appointment, to build up a staff of a kind that will command the confidence of the community and of the students, a staff that will inspire the students, a staff about whom there will be no future reports of the kind we have had hitherto about the staff of this institution.</P>
    <P>Of course, if the old board are reemployed and the new director, when he is appointed, finds them facing him there he may find himself with some problems.  I am not too sure that in the special circumstances of this college and in view of its particular history we are wise to adopt this course. My mind is still open on this.  I see the two sides.  My normal instinct, and the Minister knows this, is to secure tenure of staff in any academic institution and I have had occasion to complain about this in the past.  We have a special case here where it may be important that the new institution makes a fresh start and the new director does not find himself with a staff in whom he may not have confidence. We must, therefore, think seriously about the provisions of section 27 as to whether we could either strengthen or weaken them.  As I say, I am in two minds.  This is, perhaps, the biggest question mark.  I suspect most of the points I have raised will not be taken too seriously by the Minister. He would not have written into the Bill all these provisions for ministerial control had he not been determined to keep them there.  I am probably wasting my time.  It may be that we could have a more open type of section 27 and decide the best way to tackle the problems.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should have made on section 6.  It is a general <Col N="132" /> point on the composition of the board. On the whole, the composition of the board has not aroused much critical comment.  I am not, however, entirely happy with it.  I may say that the students have not raised any major issue here.  I think the Minister was under the illusion that the students were going to demand 100 per cent student control.  What he is offering them is two seats out of eight or ten on the board.  As I say, they have not raised any issue on this with me, but I still am not very happy about the arrangement because, as it stands at the moment, if the board consists of the minimum number of eight, four will be chosen by the students and the staff, two by each, and the other four will be appointed by the Minister, one being the chairman with a casting vote. Even with a minimum of eight, the four ministerial appointees, not nominated by the staff and students, will have at all times control.  If the board consists of nine or ten members <i>a fortiori</i> the control will be all the greater.</P>
    <P>It is not the practice in other institutions in this country, such as the colleges of the NUI, that Government representatives have a majority.  Of course, there should be Government representatives and, as I had occasion to say before, the Government representatives in UCD have always played their constructive and helpful part and have never set themselves to be or acted as if they were agents of the Government; they have acted as independent people in the public interest.  I am very much in favour of Government representatives on bodies of this kind, but this is very much out of line with the practice in NUI colleges; it is not the practice to give Government representatives a majority control.  I am not happy about that.  I would prefer a situation in which another element of appointment was introduced from some other source or, alternatively, an arrangement in which a slight increase in staff/student representation did not leave the Minister's appointees in a majority.  As between the two I think I prefer a more diverse method of appointment.  I am not suggesting staff/student control is necessary, but I would be prepared to accept the <Col N="133" /> election of one or two representatives by the graduates of the college. I understand&mdash;I hope I am right in this; one sometimes gets the wrong end of the stick&mdash;that the graduates, or many of them, are organised in arts teachers' associations.  At least there is a body of graduates who are themselves teachers of art and who are obviously very much concerned with the whole set-up.</P>

      <P>We can discuss it on the Committee Stage.  There may be some way of finding another method of appointing another member or two to get over the particular problem of complete control by the Minister's appointees on the board.  We can go into detail on this on the Committee Stage.  I think the Minister is unwise from his own point of view in trying to have control through his appointees. I believe that when he makes these appointments&mdash;we may agree or disagree with them&mdash;he will not appoint four political hacks to control the place for him, or four civil servants to control it, and those who suspect that are being unfair to the Minister.  Nonetheless, as a matter of principle, I do not think the control should be in the hands of the four people appointed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also commend to his attention the long and unhappy history of Civil Service involvement in an activity to which the Civil Service is not well adapted and the desirability of not having Civil Service directors of the board in this instance.  There is nothing in the Bill about this.  Perhaps we can deal with it on the Committee Stage. I trust I have indicated why we are opposing the Bill.  It is not because we do not think the Bill is necessary.  It is, indeed, arguable that we could have taken the other view and said the Bill is long overdue.  But there comes a time when even the worm turns; after the HEA business, when one finds this Bill infringing to an even greater extent the autonomy of an institution, when the institution itself is concerned with education rather than financing, one <Col N="134" /> has to draw the line.  One has to say that this Bill goes so far and is so unsuitable for the purpose for which it is designed that we cannot support it and that a different kind of Bill altogether is needed if we are to set this particular institution at last on the right course.</P>

      <P>I shall not detain the Minister long.  It would be wrong to say I shall not detain the House long because there are very few Members of the House present.  I speak to this Bill with both considerable difficulty and a certain element of sadness.  I speak to it with difficulty for two reasons and in particular for one and that is as is so often the case that I agree with just about everything Deputy FitzGerald has said.  Secondly, I speak to it with some difficulty because, frankly, I think the Bill is so ill-conceived in its outline that the prospect of amending it in Committee to a point where it would be an acceptable educational measure does not exist.  I am sorry the Minister has presented it in this form.  I speak to it also with sadness for a variety of reasons.  The artists have got a very bad &ldquo;Press&rdquo; in this House and the absence of Deputies who are interested in this Bill tonight demonstrates that very clearly.  I am grateful for the assiduous attendance in the House of the Parliamentary Secretary: it has had a degree of permanence recently which I do not associate with Parliamentary Secretaries.  I can only infer, on a slightly irrelevant note, that, perhaps, the Minister for Education is destined for higher things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the whole, what offends me about this Bill is this; the Bill represents an overdue attempt to off-load an area of direct control by the Department of Education which is quite unique in the educational history of the country.  I should like to be able to welcome it on those terms because to off-load this load patently is what the Department should have done a long time ago but the manner <Col N="135" /> in which the Minister chooses to off-load the National College of Art demonstrates on the one hand, in my opinion, a complete misunderstanding of the role of the artist in society and on the other, that the Minister is retaining a degree of control over the college which I personally find totally unacceptable.  The Minister is launching the boat as it were but keeping a very firm grip of the mooring line.</P>
      <P>This is all of a piece with ministerial attitudes towards the College of Art. In reply to a question of mine some time ago the Minister suggested that the agitation of the students, or some of them, derived from some organised Maoist or Communist conspiracy.  I do not regard that attitude as good enough as a reply to a question.  It is a patent fact that the College of Art has been&mdash;it is not too strong a word to use&mdash;derided by every successive report about its teaching standards and the quality of the graduate&mdash;if that is the right term&mdash;which it produces.  It divides its teaching arbitrarily into painting, sculpture and design with no understanding of the inter-relation of these functions.  It produces people who, on the whole, go forward to one of two things.  In the vast majority of cases I understand they become teachers of art in secondary schools or go into commercial art.  When the Minister speaks of the distinguished alumni which the college has produced I confess, without desiring to patronise anyone, that with one or two exceptions I am oblivious of these alumni and I suggest the Minister is equally oblivious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard in this House sneers deriving from the Minister of implicit communism.  We have heard sneers from both Fine Gael and Labour benches&mdash;I have to admit this&mdash;about students of the College of Art as if they were long-haired, guitar-twanging layabouts.  All these sneers and suggestions imply a total lack of understanding of the role which art and design play in a sophisticated society at a time when&mdash;and this is not as irrelevant as it may sound&mdash;we are pulling down the heart of what was once one of the most beautiful cities in the western world and converting it <Col N="136" /> into something like Clapham and Balham in South London.  For the Minister to say&mdash;and I quote from his speech&mdash;that the college has a vital place in the planning of our economic future suggests to me that the Minister is totally unaware of the dignity which the successful artist communicates to society.  I wonder what would have been the reaction if someone had said to Modigliani, Matisse, Manet or Corot that they had a vital place in the economic future of nineteenth century France.  I think they would have laughed rather loudly and they would have been right to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister may think I exaggerate. I am not suggesting that everybody who attends the College of Art is a potential Modigliani or Manet but I am saying that the element of financial waste involved in sustaining a college which produces people who have vision which we lack, an awareness and a sense of prospective we lack, a capacity to understand beauty which we lack, is both socially deserving and necessary. I see nowhere, either in the Bill or in the Minister's introductory statement, anything which suggests that he fully comprehends how important such a college could be and has not been. This introduction here could have served as the introduction to a Bill setting up a school of business administration designed to aid the manpower and technology policies of the Government. Is it really appropriate to a College of Art?  I do not think it is.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald has so thoroughly covered the history of the criticisms made of the College of Art that it would be otiose for me to follow him into this field.  Suffice to say that I agree completely with everything that he has said.  It is ridiculous that any educational institution should be an arm of the Civil Service.  Again, echoing Deputy FitzGerald, I do not mean by that any criticism of the Civil Service as such, but I think that educationally it is ludicrous that the Civil Service should directly administer a teaching institution.  More than that, under the present system which the Minister seeks, inadequately in my view, to change I understand that the teachers, particularly the whole-time <Col N="137" /> teachers are technically civil servants. Again, it seems ludicrous that a teacher of art could be a civil servant.  How you can hire a budding artist of 28, we will say, and give him a 42 year contract, incremental and pensionable so that 42 years later he is still teaching the art he learnt under Orpen, I do not know.  Apparently, this is satisfactory to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The result of this chain of reasoning is that the college has earned the disrespect of very many serious artists. Only today the <i>Irish Times</i> has an article about a potentially promising Irish artist who declared that he would not be bothered going to the National College of Art.  This is one of the problems we find here because we do not simply face a restructuring of the administration of the college across the way.  We face the fact that the credibility of the level of teaching has virtually disappeared in the case of most of the teachers in the eyes of the students and in the eyes of such artistic public as we possess in this country.  How precisely one produces a Bill which revolutionises the level of teaching in the college, I simply do not know.  Here I have a certain sympathy for the Minister.  He has inherited a problem which was not of his making, a problem which is encrusted with 40 years of mismanagement and now suddenly he is asked to break through.  Personally, I should like the Minister to have adopted a completely different approach.  This is simply my own view.  It does not represent the view of anybody else inasmuch as Deputies are interested in the whole subject or they are not. I would have preferred the Minister to have adopted the line of tactic which he adopted towards the Higher Education Authority and to have appointed an <i>ad hoc</i> body of eight or ten persons and a young free-wheeling, spirited, progressive director, give him two years and see what happens then, two years in which he can hire and fire, two years in which he can revolutionise concepts of painting and design and then at the end of that, perhaps, pass on to other fields having proved unsatisfactory, either temperamentally or artistically.</P>
    <P>Instead, the Minister proposes to set <Col N="138" /> up a board.  I will not go into the details of the Bill because I know it is out of order to do so.  I have no particular objection to the numerical composition of that board although I have some objection to the built-in phrases to the effect that the Minister will approve the manner in which staff and student representation are chosen.  I see dangers there.  This will constitute four of an eight or ten man board. I can already anticipate the kind of names we will get on this ten man board&mdash;nice, tidy, conservative, retired people with a little bit of spare time, who will meet together and drink tea and appoint as director some safe and spent artist.  With respect, I do not think this is what the College of Art requires.</P>
    <P>Here we touch upon a difficulty which Deputy FitzGerald has touched upon.  In normal circumstances, dealing with an institution like a college, I too like Deputy FitzGerald would be the first person to argue for security of tenure, retirement at the age of 65 or 70 and incremental progression but I wonder if you really can do this in the case of a teacher of art.  By definition a teacher of art in any of the three encapsulated forms in which they exist in the National College of Art is someone whose qualification to teach is his creativity as an artist.  I wonder if you can really say to such a person that you can guarantee him perpetuity of tenure irrespective of whether or not the vein of creativity dries up.  Here I fear that built into the Bill is a provision that those older teachers many of whom have lost the confidence of the students, who are not always wrong, even if they do wear beards and twang guitars, to the annoyance of Deputy O'Hara on the Fine Gael benches&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>And Deputy Murphy on my benches.  I fear that these older teachers are the ones who will be totally secure in their professional involvement and that the younger teachers who have moulded whatever spirit of artistic creativity the college now possesses are the ones who will <Col N="139" /> look with trepidation at the section of the Bill which hedgingly says that some part-time teachers may be retained and some not.</P>
      <P>There are many other aspects of the Bill to which I take grave exception but I will not abuse the procedure on Second Stage by referring to them except to say that amendments will be going in in my name and I am sure in Deputy FitzGerald's name.  This provision for the right of entry of a civil servant smacks to me of a most extraordinary authoritarian attitude to a college.</P>
      <P>The Minister is faced with a difficult situation&mdash;I grant him that&mdash;and I do not want to try to make his job more difficult than it is.  It is rather as if he started from scratch trying to devise a constitution for a college like Trinity College, Dublin or University College, Dublin.  It would be very difficult for any of us to do this because, for better or worse, the constitutions of these colleges are things that we have inherited and they are encrusted with history. We can lop off a bit here and there and add a little bit of innovation, which may or may not be correct but, at least, we are proceeding from some base.  Here we are not.  We are proceeding from an institution which has been mismanaged and misgoverned from the word &ldquo;go.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I cannot help feeling that the understandable desire of the Minister to off-load a problem which, with due respect to him, I do not think he understands, has led him to produce an extremely shoddy piece of legislation. I think his attitude to the college is: &ldquo;Get rid of it as fast as I can. Put it under ten good men and true and let them go ahead and do what they like on condition that what they do is residually what I want them to do because, if they do not do what I want them to do, I have this power to pull them back by the back of the neck and send in my civil servants to inspect their books and records and sack the whole lot of them.&rdquo;  I do not think this is educationally sound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am reminded of another institute of which Deputy FitzGerald did not speak but it is relevant to this, and that is, the manner in which the structure <Col N="140" /> of the Government of the Abbey Theatre has been changed.  I see the Minister frowning with perplexity and looking at the clock but, in fact, this is not too grossly irrelevant.  The Abbey Theatre, again a grossly mismanaged institution for 40 years, in a spirit of great exuberance and much exhilaration had 25 shareholders, I think it is, added to the governing body, one of them myself.  We all met together and said: &ldquo;Now, great things are going to happen.&rdquo;  In fact, when you did the count of the voting powers of the shareholders of the Abbey Theatre you were brought to realise that only in the totally unlikely situation of the Minister, one director and all the shareholders speaking together with one voice could the conduct of the Abbey Theatre be changed and slowly most of the 25 shareholders began to realise that we had been sold a pup behind the window-dressing of the progressive move.</P>
    <P>I fear the same thing is contained in this Bill.  Apparent autonomy will be given to this college.  It will be a college run by a board in which ministerial nominees will possess a decisive power.  This self-same board's apparent autonomy will be subject to a right of dismissal by the Minister.  This self-same board's apparent autonomy will be subject to the right of the invasion of a civil servant at the direction of the Minister, at any time, to check the books and the records.  It will be subject to, as Deputy FitzGerald pointed out, the fact that if this board wishes to initiate new courses revising the concept of art in this college it must do so by reference to the Minister.</P>
    <P>This is untrue, in the main, of any institution of higher learning except the College of Art.  I wish the Minister had been either a bit more imaginative when drafting this Bill or had taken the advice of people who had more insight into and appreciation of art and beauty than the Minister has or, indeed, I myself have.  I admit this. Contemporary debate is full of talk about pollution and conservation.  Last week an American bought a painting for £1.5 million to hang over his daughter's fireplace.  I wonder how much good that did the artist who <Col N="141" /> painted the picture?  What did he die of?  Where did he die?  If the Minister were to look around him&mdash;and this applies to his whole Cabinet&mdash;at the shoddiness of Dublin the following Latin tag would seem appropriate: <i>Si momentum requiris, circumspice.</i> If the Minister were to look around him he might appreciate the place that beauty and creativity should have in our lives.  He might then be less ready to sneer about the communist influence of long-haired guitar players and might in turn be prepared to entrust this college and its prospective director, upon whom its success really depends, with a degree of autonomy, even for a short period of time.  This autonomy does not exist at present.  This Bill betrays so firmly a Civil Service, doctrinaire attitude to art that any attempt to amend it on Committee Stage will ultimately be useless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be a bit more general than the previous speakers, and particularly more than Deputy FitzGerald.  I must declare my interest in this matter.  Some of the earliest recollections of my life are of my father discussing the School of Art. Over the years I received much information from my father who worked there from 1911 to the mid-sixties. Consequently, I do not feel disinterested about the School of Art.</P>
      <P>One ought to say at the beginning that the question of education for the visual and graphic arts in Ireland is a problem of great importance.  We have an enormous tradition in the verbal arts.  We have nothing comparable in the graphic arts.  It may be that they are fundamentally a different sort of thing and that we are genetically predisposed towards one and not the other.  That may be a possible explanation. It may or may not be the truth. If we could order things better the great creativity which we have shown with words could possibly be extended into painting, sculpture and the whole area of non-verbal and non-musical art.  We need not try to analyse now the reason for our failures.  It is important to admit the existence of those failures if we are to set about seriously re-ordering our affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="142" /> I would not be as contemptuous as a previous speaker was of the final references which the Minister made. It is a matter of being in a competitive market.  We make false separations in the area of art.  In this decade art cannot be divided into painting or sculpture or design.  The question of good design runs through everything from the purest sort of sculpture to industrial products like motor cars, carpets and furniture.  One does not have to travel far from Ireland to see that there is a higher level of design awareness in most of the countries with which we are so anxious to join.  We will need to produce beautiful goods efficiently and at the right price if we are to be in a competitive position. No artist can set out with commission as his goal but good results can come in this area of art in Ireland.  We are notably deficient in the area of design.</P>
    <P>I have heard details about the School of Art all my life.  I do not propose to enter on a recital of the history of the School of Art; Deputy FitzGerald has done so.  There are many reports about the School of Art.  There are stories of procrastination.  It is not necessary to argue about them. The record is there.  The record is a scandalous and pitiful one.  The misleading of the student body is documented. Nothing more can be said about such matters.  I believe that there is evidence of vendettas against progressive members of the staff.  This is shameful.  Such a situation has existed.</P>
    <P>I was in the School of Art last October.  I was present at arguments between an unfortunate civil servant and the students.  In fact, the official was placed in a totally impossible position where he could not be frank with the student body.  It was a ridiculous situation.  It has been said that the essential thing which has to be generated now is the freedom to create. Freedom of creativity is important.  The whole structure and tradition of training&mdash;and indeed personnel selection&mdash; makes civil servants utterly unsuited, at whatever level, for having anything to do with the School of Art.  It is completely impossible to devise a mechanism.  I smiled, as other Deputies <Col N="143" /> did, when the Minister used these interesting words:</P>
    <P>With a view to removing the college from my direct control.</P>
    <P>We were laughing.  How true is that? The college as proposed in this Bill will not be removed from the Minister's direct control.  That is a bogus piece of information.  The Minister mentions the establishment of an independent governing board.  That is a reversal of the meaning of the words.  The community schools were mentioned.  The community schools were not designed for communities and the independent governing boards will not be independent. No interpretation of the English language could make those boards independent.</P>
    <P>The basic unsuitability of the ideas of the people who formulated this Bill is expressed over and over again in the recurring phrase about art, craft and design.  It is simply an indication of a thought that passed from being reputable in this area half a century ago.  If one analyses this phrase it will be seen that the three categories are without meaning.  The concept of design, if it is to be of any value at all, permeates everything.  It is not something separate.  I have no conviction that the people on the other side of the House will understand what I am talking about.  I will just place my views on the record to show that the whole of this exercise is offensive.</P>

      <P>The point I am making is that the concept of design <Col N="144" /> ought to extend to all of the artistic activities of people.  It is not a separate category.  If the word is being used correctly it extends to painting and sculpture and to the activities which must evolve in a serious art college, and which fall into neither of these categories; it extends to the production of textiles, to the production of books and handicrafts.  It extends, in other words, across the whole spectrum of what people do in a constructive way. Let me remind the House of a phrase of Marshall McLuhan quoting from the saying of the Balinese: &ldquo;We have no art.  We do things as well as we can.&rdquo;  That is the concept of design illuminating every kind of activity. That is the thought I was endeavouring, as I say without any hope of success, to convey.  It is a perfectly simple thought and one which, had the Parliamentary Secretary been in touch with the thinking in this area, it would not have been necessary for me to elucidate because it is quite central to the whole problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be coming a little later on to the real reason why I think it useless in this context to offer these thoughts to the Government at this time.  Before doing that I want to indicate, without trying to produce details of what would be an adequate Bill, the guidelines we on this side of the House consider adequate.  Everybody praises democracy if democracy means the holding of parliamentary elections and so on.  Again we are in a decade when democracy means that people who participate in something must run it.  The people who participate in the School of Art are primarily the staff and the students. There are, of course, other interests which have the right to representation, but again we come back to the basic consideration of the meaning that words have.  I know the Government party use the word &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;, to which it affects to pay serious attention, <Col N="145" /> in a way differently from that in which I use it.  Any Bill which does not provide for democracy in art education and freedom is worthless before it starts.  Distinct from democracy is freedom, freedom for people to innovate far outside these categories that are put down in the Bill as painting and sculpture.</P>
      <P>What does that mean in the current evolution of art?  It means that categories are to some extent losing meaning and will lose meaning progressively in the near future.  More seriously it means an effort to confine the creative activity of people.  It means an essential curtailment of freedom and any Bill which does not in the area of art education provide for the two things that lie close to each other but which are distinct, that is, for both democracy and freedom, is worthless.  This is an entirely worthless Bill.  It is not worth amending because the basic intention is, first, authoritarian; secondly, archaic; and, thirdly, anti-democratic.  The Minister decides who runs the new school; he decides what they must teach; he decides about spending money; he can have access to their documents.  There is no serious effort to off-load except in a window-dressing sort of way which I do not think deceives anybody and which I think will not deceive the students.  I have no doubt, however, in the light of my experience in this House, that there will be a mindless, dragooned majority which will march up those steps and put this Bill into action.</P>
      <P>One might conceivably have some influence on the Bill if it were not so utterly distant from what the situation requires.  It is so irrelevant, so 19th century, and has so little to do with the real requirements of the situation, that there is no amending we can do. Therefore I am rather speaking for the record and for the future.  The whole thing will have to be straightened out, done right another time with another Government, because the Government that could produce, even as a draft, the Bill we are now considering thereby demonstrates itself to be so out of touch as to be totally unfitted to have any relevant role in the area of art education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="146" /> My belief is that the students have been extraordinarily patient.  They have been misled and hoodwinked over and over again.  They have been denied a real art education.  There has been a confusing by the authorities of the acquirement of technical skills with the real creative function.  The students have been unable to explain to the people in charge what the nature of this creative activity is.  This has been a perfect example on the part of civil servants of a dog in a manger attitude: the dog cannot eat the meal itself but permits nobody else to eat it.  It is a case of civil servants who are incapable of creativity themselves or even of its appreciation.  I am not referring to civil servants in general, of whom I have rather a good experience in recent years, but to those responsible for the thinking behind this Bill in this Department. They will not allow the College of Art to get on with it and they are incapable of understanding what ought to be got on with, let alone permitting anyone to do it.  As a solution to the problem of serious art education in Ireland.  which has been kicking around for more than my lifetime, this is an offensive waste of parliamentary time.</P>
    <P>There are two suggestions with which I want to disagree.  One is that it is all the civil servants' fault.  It is perfectly natural that civil servants should be empire builders, if they are let, that they should try to push out the edges of their power, that they should try to play God, that they should want to tell creative people how they ought to create.  It is wrong, but it is not surprising or unnatural. The fault is, in fact, a governmental fault, a political fault.  We must not blame the civil servants for what they do in the name of a Minister who ought to be exercising power.  It has been suggested that the reason for this monstrous and ridiculous piece of legislation is simply that the Minister does not understand, that it is stupidity. I have a poor opinion of the abilities of the whole of the Government at the present time, but I do not think they are stupid.  I do not think the Minister for Education is that stupid.  There are reasons for <Col N="147" /> things, and one can discover a reason for producing a Bill which might temporarily push away the immediate crisis and which might structure a school in which people learned some necessary skills but which would certainly be destructive of the concept of art and of art education.  There is a reason for that.  I do not think it is Civil Service villainy or ministerial stupidity.</P>
    <P>It is inescapable that art must be critical, that art must be exploratory.  If artists are to be serious releasers of the emotions of the rest of the population who are less sensitive, less attuned, than they are, then they must also be the conscience of society.  They have to be critical.  They must be deeply concerned with moral issues. They have therefore at times got to be revolutionary, revolutionary in a broad sense; I do not mean you have to burn things.  I simply mean you have to say when certain institutions or societies are decaying and when they have got to be replaced.  Of course, serious art education is concerned with liberating people to express this sort of criticism and to train them to utter these calls for change.  Artists all over the world and down the centuries have always necessarily been in the forefront of criticism and of the call for change.  At a time when, as I have expressed it elsewhere, the Government party are putrefying before their death rather than after their death, which is more normal in living organisms, they have got to be basically anti-art.  Of course, they can dress up their concern in a technical interest in how you pass on certain of the skills at trivial level but, of course, they have no option but to try to limit in every way they can the creative impulse of artists who will necessarily be critical of an existing <i>status quo.</i></P>
    <P>Of course, they have got in every way to try to limit the exploration, the innovation, the seeking out of change that valid artists must experience, explain and utter at this particular stage. Of course, they have got profoundly to fear the aspect of the real artist's work, which is to function as the conscience of society.  It was not always so with the Government party.  It was not <Col N="148" /> always so with the movement they represent but in the days of their decay it is so now.  In fact, they have to stifle creativity and to reduce the creative student, who will be a creative channel for human emotion, to simply being a purveyor of technical skills.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in fact, wants the teaching of technical skills but he does not want the art.  I am not suggesting that the Minister has ever verbalised this or analysed this for himself.  I do not know whether he is or is not able to.  Perhaps, he is doing it deliberately; perhaps, he is doing it by the sort of reflex of the political will to survive. Perhaps, he realises instinctively the danger that serious art education and serious artists in our community pose for him.  I do not think it is possible to know whether the Minister has done it deliberately and consciously or just, as I say, by this reflex.  It does not matter.  It is of no importance to us to analyse the Minister's subjective intentions.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill will be rammed through but in the end that does not greatly matter either except for a little while because, in fact, the art I believe sincerely the Minister is trying to stifle is indestructible and the life which responds to that art, and which needs that art, is also indestructible.  This is a forlorn hope in the long run.  If the matter of real art education in Ireland is not solved now it will have to be solved later.  Neither in this Bill nor in the thinking of the Government party is there evidence of ability or desire to solve the problem that exists.  My purpose was to write these thoughts and ideas into the record so that the struggle for a real art education can be pushed on in Ireland in a unified and coherent way for defined objectives so that, in fact, the need for real art education can be solved by another Government at a better time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like briefly to add my voice critically to those who have already spoken against this Bill. We have to examine the causes for the Bill and see if the proposals contained in it are adequate to meet them.  The causes, indeed, are sordid but their sordidness has not been due to the students or largely to the staff.  It has <Col N="149" /> been entirely due to the administration of this unfortunate college.</P>
      <P>The country has been aware of the serious unrest within the college for a considerable time past.  That unrest has been manifested by the students and it has also shown itself in the staff.  We have certainly got a sick institution.  We have unrest among both the senior and junior members of the college.  Unfortunately, the seriousness of that unrest has not come across to the general public because it is too easy to look at the people causing the unrest, see them as an unorthodox and unconventional group, know that they are very much a minority group, shrug your shoulders and say: &ldquo;What about them?  They are only a nuisance.&rdquo;  Consequently, there has not been the same public awareness of the urgent need to cure the sick condition of this college.</P>
      <P>We know the college is very sick because of the type of instruction given there.  The students and the staff have made it very clear that the academic standards aspired to are not in keeping with what the national art college should have.  The administration of the college has been clumsy. It has ignored the needs of the college both as an art school and as a place for teaching technical artists.  The budget has been inadequate.  All these things have contributed to a very low morale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the appalling situation in this school that in a staff of over 30 only five are teachers one can describe as full-time, permanent and pensionable. The other teachers are merely there by the grace of some nameless, faceless person.  That is not a situation calculated to encourage academic freedom.  There is no need, I hope, for me to labour the necessity for academic freedom in any institution of learning in this country.  It is well settled and well recognised, and must be surely commonplace on all sides of this House, that in any higher institute of learning autonomy and academic freedom are essential to its wellbeing.  This applies as much, if not more, to an art school.  Instead of having that desirable situation, we have, in fact, the very opposite and <Col N="150" /> because we have the opposite we have had the serious and disgraceful unrest which we experienced over the past few years.  In fact it is a matter of national embarrassment that a small art school is in such a pathetic state.</P>
    <P>I have already stated the reasons for this.  I am afraid this Bill does not accept those reasons as valid.  The Bill refuses to face up to them.  The Bill is what one would commonly term a Civil Service document.  There is no spark in it and no recognition in it that a college of art and the people who work and teach in it are a different breed from the rest of us.  The make-up of this Bill is on all-fours with the Horse Industry Bill and to my mind that in itself is a serious criticism of it.  It shows complete ignorance on the part of those who conceived and introduced this Bill of the problem they had to solve.  It does not provide that an art school should be independent.  An art school has to be independent because of the very nature of artistic impulse.  It must be given free rein, not merely for one to put what one likes on canvas or paper, but there must be freedom throughout the institution, freedom of atmosphere.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not provide that.  It is hedged in with bureaucratic caution. As far as the teachers are concerned there is no protection in the Bill, nothing which can enable a teacher to say: &ldquo;I can teach art as my conscience directs me, as my inspiration drives me, without having to consider my job, my livelihood or my dependants.&rdquo; This is a serious fault in the Bill.  There is some recognition of the part students should be allowed to play in the administration of their own institution in so far as it provides certain student representation on the board, but again Civil Service caution ensures that in the background there will be the proviso that only the right students will be elected, because the scheme of student representation can be drawn up only when approved of by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The budget is entirely within the control of the State, the bureaucracy, and once that is the position independence cannot exist because if there is an outside source in a position to control <Col N="151" /> the finances&mdash;I am not speaking about the amount because public opinion might not tolerate interference with the annual amount&mdash;autonomy cannot exist.  You cannot have a real art school unless there is real autonomy.</P>
    <P>There is also a danger to be implied from the Title to the Bill.  It refers to a National College of Art and Design. Up to now the institution has been known as the College of Art.  The Title seeks to elevate design to the same status as art and I do not think it can be or should be elevated to that status.  There is certainly room for inculcating principles of design as part of the work of that college, but it is something that should be subsidiary to the main artistic function of the college.  Certainly I hope design will never be hived off from the College of Art.  Those entering the college intent on artistic careers, for some lack of inspiration, through no fault of their own, may have a bent for design and that should be encouraged within the school.  Otherwise there will be merely mechanical drawing and that will not improve standards.</P>
    <P>We want design which has been inspired by creative art.  I do not think there is any need or reason for the people to be afraid of any independent creative art school which may produce what might seem to be outlandish, improbable, incongruous artistic works.  It is a matter of selective taste which can be the product of education and environment.  In this country to date matters of this sort have been subject to conservatism, and one should not be afraid of unconventionality, for want of a better word, in artistic matters. Many conventional ladies of this country dress in blouses and other clothing which carry on them designs originating in impressionist art, cubism and other art forms which have had their effect on industrial design.  People outside may call it incongruous but they can go home and look at it in that way.</P>
    <P>It would be a great pity if the opportunity given by this Bill was not used to set up a completely autonomous school with real independence, governed by a board chosen with care and <Col N="152" /> objectivity and not with bureaucracy. That is the first essential.  The second is that it should be free in the spending of its budget.  Thirdly come the teachers and here there should be security of tenure subject to ordinary demands of good order.  It should have a board able to tolerate dissent from students, a board that will have more tolerance than a normal academic body because the type of student with whom they will have to deal will be of a different make-up from that of the average student in a university.  He may be unconventional, slightly rebellious, imaginative.  These things will show themselves in his dress and his attitudes and they will have to be tolerated and allowed for because, if they are not, his imaginative make-up and his potential may be stifled and that is where the real loss would be for this country.</P>
    <P>I regret that as the Bill stands the opportunity is not being taken to salvage something in relation to the board, which is the critical factor in this.  The board should be composed of people who may be nominated by outside bodies rather than the Minister. If the Minister would make it plain that the board will be nominated by outside artistic bodies it would go a long way to improving what at the moment is a bad Bill because, as I have said, the board will be the critical part of the whole operation.  Therefore, it is a pity the opportunity has not been taken, or has been only half taken, and this can only be a source of agitation of the kind that has taken place as a result of the dreadful conditions that have existed in the school.  It is disappointing that our Government and our civil servants are unable to realise the true nature of that dissatisfaction and meet it in a proper manner.  The unfortunate thing is that in the way they have met it they may perhaps be accurately reflecting the majority opinion in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cooney's concluding words, &ldquo;the majority opinion in this country&rdquo; have hit the nail on the head.  On that note I shall take up the criticisms which have been <Col N="153" /> expressed of the public servants involved in the drafting of the Bill, the Minister for bringing forward this particular structure and the administration of the institution itself.  While these criticisms are in most respects quite valid they unfortunately reflects the majority opinion in this country.</P>
      <P>There has always been great hostility and suspicion of visual arts.  Some of our civil servants may have had a poor training as public servants but in many respects they represent the traditions of our society and above all of the Government.  The concept of art of about four-fifths of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party hardly extends beyond what colours should appear on a general election poster or whether or not we should produce handknitted tricolours to flog to the tourists.  Lest I be accused of being entirely partisan I do not think the traditions of either the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party are very different.</P>
      <P>Our cultural life has evolved exclusively around the theatre and the spoken word.  We have to our eternal shame failed to appreciate, nurture and spend public money on fostering the visual arts.  Our educational system in this respect has been grossly at fault. Our deep-rooted hostility towards intellectuals, particularly intellectuals involved in the creative arts, does not reflect very much credit on our society as a whole.</P>
      <P>This is important when we get down to trying to understand the philosophy and the cultural tradition behind the introduction of this Bill.  If one goes through the records of this House one finds time and time again snide remarks about art students and about intellectuals in various political parties. There is such a lack of sophistication about such matters inside the House that I do not imagine opinion is very different outside it.  This Bill reflects our lack of sophistication in matters of art, design and sculpture.</P>
      <P>According to the Minister in his opening statement and I quote:</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to cater better for the increasing needs both cultural and economic of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly doubt the extent to which this Bill, in relation to the operation of <Col N="154" /> the College of Art, will ensure that a more valuable part is played by the visual arts.  I do not see any evidence of that assumption in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As politicians we should all strive to bring in a piece of legislation which would give encouragement, hope and opportunity towards the raising of the general standards of the visual arts in our society.  Certainly this Bill does not make that contribution.  Many of the sections of the Bill seriously limit the hoped for autonomy of the proposed board.</P>
    <P>The Chair has pointed out that we can talk only in general terms on the Second Stage but in relation to section 25 the powers given to officers of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education to enter the premises of the College of Art and require the production of documents and records, and the provision of general penalties for anyone obstructing or delaying such officers or refusing to give information to them do not give me much cause for hope.</P>
    <P>A board of this nature should be established with a view to the creation of a climate of trust and the ending of the recriminations which have gone on in relation to the College of Art in the past.  Such a section is not conducive to the ending of the kind of maladministeration we have witnessed in the past decade.  It has often struck me as miraculous that the students and staff did not burn down the institution in their very understandable frustration, such was the provocation which they had to undergo in terms of &ldquo;messing&rdquo; and lack of understanding which occurred in the administration of the college itself.</P>
    <P>These are harsh statements to make and they have been made by many members of the Opposition.  One hopes this Bill will help to get rid of that kind of situation.  I suppose some public servants will adopt the attitude that the nation is spending £95,000 a year on the College of Art and that they, as the custodians of the taxpayers' money, should have virtually absolute control over day-to-day administration. The acid test of this will come in the composition of the board itself.  The Minister has assured us that <Col N="155" /> he will establish an independent governing body whose duty it will be to carry out the management of the college and the organisation and administration of its affairs.</P>
    <P>The Minister has open to him the opportunity to appoint persons who will give it the climate and reality of an independent governing body.  If one is to view the calibre of Government appointments to such boards and the manner in which they are hawked around the Cabinet table where one's card-carrying membership of a political party is more important than one's artistic competence or administrative ability then one cannot be entirely hopeful about the composition of such a board.  At least we can say this much: five or ten years ago this Bill would have gone through the House without even half a dozen contributions. It seems at this stage of the debate that we will have some discussion on the role and function of the College of Art.</P>
    <P>I hope that as a result of the amendments we will table and of the contributions that will be made in the years ahead provision, particularly for the staffing of the college, will be substantially improved.  As a former trade union officer I am absolutely appalled by the cavalier failure of the Department to ensure, as was within their competence, even if they had to work day and night on this problem of administration, that there would have been an established full-time permanently employed cadre of staff in the college at this point in time.  It is an appalling situation that four-fifths of the staff of the College of Art are a temporary, part-time, one could even say gratuitously tolerated group of individuals who have neither social security nor redundancy payments and who are paid on a casual 37s 6d an hour basis by the Department of Education. Many of them are even on hourly notice.  This is not the way to run even a bingo shop never mind the College of Art.  I would say the operators of bingo take more care of people they employ.</P>
    <P>I am frankly suspicious of certain sections of this Bill.  I think they can <Col N="156" /> be construed, and if they can the fears of the staff should be laid to rest by the Minister, as being capable of being used against certain members of the temporary teaching staff.  I know one staff member whose average working hours were in excess of the minimum laid down&mdash;18 hours is the minimum laid down&mdash;and notwithstanding the fact that he has consistently worked approximately 26 hours in the past two years he got back his contract for 17 hours a week.  May I ask the Minister why?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are entitled to know why, and is it the intention that such a member of the staff will, on the transition period, find himself, in accordance with section 27 of the Bill, out on a limb?  I do not either have the time or the professional competence to adjudicate on relations between members of the College of Art and the staff itself.  This is a matter for a personnel director of the college and the teachers themselves.  I am not competent to judge such matters but one does not need any artistic sense of smell to become worried about some of the things that have been said about the college and some of the things that are anticipated in terms of what might happen to staff in the future.  These things have been raised I am afraid more out of the climate of suspicion and hostility and friction that has developed rather than from the truth of the situation, because it is so difficult to get to the truth in many cases.  Could the Minister give us some assurance on these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this Bill is a very small step it is a step in the right direction, a step towards placing the College of Art on a more hopeful basis.  Even in the field of design&mdash;our public buildings, our office furnishings, our Government publications, our stamp designs, many of them are downright bad and ugly and reflect little credit on Ireland at present.  Perhaps we can hope that in the long term a product of this Bill will be a dramatic improvement in that aspect of our lives.  We can hope that perhaps in future our Irish industrial products which have suffered so much on domestic markets and on the export <Col N="157" /> market from the absence of a tradition of industrial design in the country and the failure of the Government to develop and nurture a more dynamic and fruitful atmosphere of industrial design, will be improved.  One would even hope, and I suppose this would be a pious hope, that the standard of Irish church architecture and church decoration might be improved.  One might even hope, against all kinds of hope, that in future we might open our schools, particularly our national schools, to the prospect of much greater creative and visual activity.  I am chairman of a parent-teacher association in a large Dublin school with an attendance of something like 1,100 children and I can truthfully say that, by international comparisons I made, it is not an overstatement to say that most of our national schools and, indeed, most of our educational institutions can be classified as being nothing short of slums.  That is harsh but true.  I would hope that in future there would be a bold and imaginative approach which is so lacking in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I can have a certain sympathy for the Minister and the Department being, as they maintain they are, the custodians of £95,000 per annum of the taxpayers' money.  Perhaps in the 1970s we will have an opportunity to indulge&mdash;and I use that word in its more correct sense&mdash;in bold and imaginative structural changes, particularly in the College of Art.  Certain innovations and certain concepts of internal self-working may appear to some people to be at half-cock, but it is better to go in that direction and, by a process of experimentation, to give artistic freedom to Irishmen and Irishwomen and enable them to produce of their best with staff security of employment.  To use the Minister's phrase in relation to the minority he should bend over backwards to provide an aesthetic climate for Irish visual arts.  He could usefully bend over backwards in this area without getting a slipped disc in the process. He has a golden opportunity to make such a contribution.</P>
    <P>We are opposing the Second Reading of this Bill because of the defects in it which we have pointed out.  It is <Col N="158" /> seldom that we find ourselves in opposition to the Second Reading of legislation dealing with education and this shows the serious view which the Labour Party take of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Lest I forget, Deputy Desmond mentioned the fact that the number of hours in a teacher's contract in the College of Art was reduced.

      <P>I believe that there will be a very considerable improvement in the situation in the College of Art when this Bill is passed and I am concerned to ensure that there will be. I will admit that before I became Minister for Education I knew very little about the College of Art apart from seeing students going in and out as I came in here from Kildare Street. Since I became Minister I have had a number of meetings with the students and the teachers and, whatever they may have thought of those meetings, I learned a considerable amount.  As I stated in the Dáil on several occasions, I am convinced that the College of Art is a most important institution not only from the cultural point of view but also from the economic point of view.</P>
      <P>I should like to stress that in the past, despite, what has been said by some Deputies opposite, the college contributed very considerably to the cultural life of the nation, very much more, perhaps, than most people realise, particularly when we consider the type of publicity the college received in recent times.  I cannot understand&mdash;and I said this to the students &mdash;why anybody should create a situation which would give a wrong impression to the people of this country because very many of them now feel that the College of Art has no relevance. I differ from that view.</P>
      <P>I must also say that I was rather disappointed during the past couple of years by the fact that many people who owe so much to the College of Art failed to come to its defence.  I suppose this can be put down to the reluctance of some people to involve themselves in controversy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald referred to a number of reports which have been <Col N="160" /> made on the College of Art.  Perhaps I could refer to one of them, that is, the Scandinavian report which was based on a visit to an empty college.  Neither the students nor the teachers were present when the visit was made.  I regret to have to say this but the fact is that a group from abroad pronounced on a college which they literally never saw in operation.  This should be sufficient comment on the report but I might say also that these people did not interview even one member of the staff.  The Commission on Higher Education stated what had been suggested previously by the Department of Education; that was that a Department of State was not the most suitable apparatus to have control of an institution such as the College of Art.  I agreed fully with this view and have stated it on a number of occasions.  It was decided, therefore, that an autonomous body should be set up to assume this control and it is hoped that in the new era of administration this body will act as an impetus towards greater achievement. I sincerely hope this will be the case because, as I have already stated, the College of Art is an institution of exceptional importance to our nation, not only in the cultural but also in the economic field.  It would be well to remember that without proper co-operation no achievement is possible and that the future of this college depends not only on a new board and on a new physical building but also on a change of attitude on the part of some people.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer now to the remarks made by Deputy FitzGerald in relation to my meeting with the teachers.  If I am not misquoting the Deputy, he said that the secretary of the teacher's delegation issued a statement off his own bat after the meeting.  This was a rather peculiar procedure because I would assume that the secretary of a delegation would not issue a statement without consulting first with the other members of the delegation and ensuring <Col N="162" /> that whatever statement was to be issued would be agreed on by the other members.</P>

      <P>Of course, it was obvious to me at the meeting that practically all of the nine teachers concerned&mdash;seven, in fact, were satisfied with the meeting.  If the individual concerned had consulted with his colleagues he would not have been permitted to issue that statement.  In reply to a question in this House on Thursday, 17th June, in relation to this particular meeting I said that I was amazed to find in the newspapers on the day following the meeting, a report to the effect that the teachers were dissatisfied with the outcome of the meeting. It transpired that seven of the nine teachers who formed the deputation were highly indignant at the contents of that report which, as the Deputy has admitted, was published without their consent.</P>

      <P>The members of the staff covered by section 27 have given long and very valuable service to the college and it is owed to them to continue their services and, of course, the college will benefit from their being continued on the staff.  In this regard my only regret is that I was unable, before now, to make them permanent and pensionable.  I have explained in the House on a number of occasions why it was not possible for me to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that I should go further but this is to be an autonomous body and it is they who will make the appointments.  Therefore, I have gone as far as I should in relation to this particular matter.  It was suggested that the autonomy of the board was restricted.  Undoubtedly, Deputies must realise that a body that is financed almost entirely by the State must be subject to certain controls particularly in relation to finance.  It is now universal that educational establishments everywhere subsist on massive public <Col N="164" /> financial support and, naturally, this involves public accountability.  The provision in the Bill in this regard provides merely for the minimum safeguards.</P>
    <P>I have been charged here with calling the students various names.  I challenge anybody to study the Dáil reports and to point out to me any reference to my having called the students by any particular name.  Of course, I stated facts when I referred to the damage done by students in the College of Art and while this may have annoyed members of the Opposition as well as perhaps, a few of the students, I considered it my duty to state the facts.  I was interested to read, a few days afterwards, a letter written by a student to the three morning papers expressing indignation and outrage at the manner in which the plaster casts in the college were maintained by the Department.  What the reading public did not know was that this indignant student was seen by two other students daubing another cast in the college with brilliant red paint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>

      <P>One of the students who observed this happening wrote to me&mdash;he was not afraid to sign his name to the letter.  An extract from that letter is as follows:</P>
      <P>Incidentally, a letter condoning an act of wanton blackguardism, the destruction of the casts, appeared in Tuesday's daily papers.  The author was one of two students whom I saw actually defacing a statue here a very short time ago. Now one of these culprits had the audicity to condone such an act publicly.</P>
      <P>I might also add that the figure of £5,000 to replace the casts destroyed was arrived at by art experts.  The sum of £2,000 mentioned on previous occasions was a mere estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am given to understand that the collection of casts destroyed by these so-called lovers of art were unique in Europe and the fact <Col N="165" /> that they were presented to the college does not detract from their value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>They were unique in age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to note a letter which appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> signed by two ex-students of the college stating that the diploma received from the college was not recognised by the Beaux Arts school in Paris for entry purposes and that the diploma of the Beaux Arts school was acceptable as a qualification in Senegal, whereas the Irish diploma was not acceptable.  My information is that entry to the Beaux Arts school in Paris is limited and, in the case of foreign students, extremely restricted.  A test must be done for entry and the two students apparently passed this test and were accepted.  The standards they had achieved as a result of their courses in the National College of Art must have been pretty high.  I might add that with regard to the non-acceptance in Senegal of the diploma of the college, one must remember that Senegal is a former colony of France and still is within the French sphere of influence.  Naturally French qualifications would be acceptable before Irish qualifications.</P>
      <P>It was suggested that an administrative officer of the Department discussed the character or behaviour of students with outside assessors.  This is ludicrous.  Apparently any student felt free to relay any kind of story about what was happening in the college and this seems to have been accepted by some people.</P>

      <P>With regard to section 25, this is a provision which I am informed is normally inserted by the legal people when State property is being handed over to private control. I admit that I consider it is not necessary to have such a provision in relation to a college building and I intend to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to alter this.</P>

      <P>Reference was made to the director as being the most important person on the board.  I suppose there is something in that.  All I can say is that the director will not be appointed by me but the board. Deputy Desmond stated that the people did not seem to have a great love of the arts.  Possibly this may be true but we are trying to rectify the matter not only in relation to the National College of Art but from the primary school level.  He referred to the question of art teaching and training, and in the new curriculum we are making full provision for this.  It will also be carried on through the post-primary system.</P>
      <P>I do not need to say much more on this.  I think I have replied to most of the points made by Deputies.  We will have a further discussion on this Bill on the Committee Stage.  I cannot understand why Deputies condemned this Bill out of hand except that perhaps there is a slight tinge of jealously that a Fianna Fáil Government have introduced not only this Bill but something new in ensuring that students will have a right to sit on the board of this institution.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;securities&rsquo; means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) shares in the share capital of any body corporate or stock of any body corporate or debentures, debenture stock or bonds of any body corporate, whether constituting a charge on the assets of the body or not, or rights or interests (described whether as units or otherwise) in any such shares, stock, debentures, debenture stock or bonds,</P>
      <P>(b) securities of the Government or the government of any country or territory outside the State, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="169" /> (c) rights (whether actual or contingent) in respect of money lent to, or deposited with, any industrial and provident society, friendly society or building society</P>
    <P>and includes rights or interests (described whether as units or otherwise) which may be acquired under any unit trust scheme under which all property for the time being subject to any trust or other arrangement created or may in pursuance of the scheme consists of such securities as are mentioned in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this definition;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to insert a definition of &ldquo;securities&rdquo;. The term is used in the definitions of investment trust company and unit trust.  It is also used in section 13 (7) which empowers the Central Bank to accept securities from certain existing small banks in lieu of cash deposits. It is also used in Part 3 of the Bill where it is given a wider definition as it covers collaterals for bank advances. The definition proposed in the amendment is similar to that in the unit trust Bill.  It is comprehensive in scope and covers all the instruments which are generally deemed as securities in business and commerce.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 27, between lines 22 and 23 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>Section 14 of the Decimal Currency Act, 1970, is hereby amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection(1):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) Without prejudice to section 2 of this Act, section 10 of the <Col N="170" /> Currency Act, 1927, shall be construed as continuing to permit contracts, sales, payments, bills, notes, instruments, and securities for money, and every transaction dealing, matter, and thing whatever relating to money or involving the payment or the liability to pay any money to be made, executed, entered into, done or had according to the old currency, the new currency or the currency of some state or country other than the State, subject to the proviso that section 13 of this Act shall apply in relation to any amount in the old currency which is not a whole number of pounds and which is or becomes due for payment on or after the appointed day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I mentioned on the Committee Stage that I proposed to bring in this amendment on Report Stage.  It arises out of the formal ending of the period of changeover to decimal currency.  As indicated by a document laid before the House today and as will be indicated in a public announcement by the Decimal Currency Board tomorrow the smoothness of the introduction of the decimal currency system has made it possible to end the changeover period on 31st December next.  The purpose of the amendment is to remove any doubts about the position after the end of the changeover period in respect of all contracts drawn in £sd terms. Such doubts were raised last year in Seanad Éireann on the passage of the Decimal Currency Act, 1970.  While the fears expressed seem unlikely to materialise I decided to introduce this amendment in order to remove any possible uncertainty.  I should explain that section 10 of the Currency Act, 1927, is the basic statutory provision requiring contracts and various transactions to be made, executed, entered into, done or had according to Irish currency or foreign currency.</P>
    <P>In the drafting of the Decimal Currency Act, 1970 it was considered desirable to include a form of saver for the validity of formal contracts, wills and other documents.  This was done in section 14.  It was not considered necessary to make any specific provision to ensure the continued validity of other contracts.  However, <Col N="171" /> the point was made that the inclusion of the specific saver for formal contracts might raise a doubt about others. In the present amendment section 14 is substantially repealed.  In addition, specific provision is made to ensure that the basic currency provisions in section 10 of the 1927 Currency Act will be construed as permitting the continued use of £sd for the purposes specified in that section.  I am advised that these steps suffice to ensure continued validity of contracts made in £sd, whether formal or informal and no matter when made.</P>

      <P>I do not object to the amendment but I am struck by one phrase the Minister used in presenting it to the House, when he referred to the smoothness of the transition from £sd to decimal currency.  I do not know whether he was speaking as Minister for Finance or as the father of a family, or as the provider for a woman running a house.  I am quite certain that anyone outside this deliberative and legislative assembly who hears the phrase used &ldquo;the smoothness of the transition to decimal currency&rdquo; would begin to wonder whether he or we are living in the moon because the transition has been a traumatic experience for most women trying to run a house and for most husbands and fathers trying to provide cash and means of paying bills for their wives. I do not know if we ever had sufficient advice in regard to decimilisation but I am certain that the advent of decimalisation has stepped up prices in most of our shops, retail stores and supermarkets throughout the country. Indeed, it is demonstrated by the fact that in the three months from last February living costs have risen at the rate of 12 per cent.  Last year we were battling very well on the European league with a record 10 per cent for the 12 months.  In the three months after decimalisation our cost of living is running at the rate of a 12 per cent increase on the 10 per cent. Smoothness of the transfer to decimal currency may be something that may appeal in a fiscal sense to the Minister for Finance but I do not think it has been a good thing for the economy. <Col N="172" /> I do not know whether this amendment is going to dot the i's and cross the t's.  The Minister introduces it as being necessary in relation to an event that has already taken place.  In that sense it is agreeable to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I would have to re-echo what Deputy O'Higgins has just said.  I was amazed when I heard the other day the Minister using the same phraseology&mdash;the smoothness of the transfer&mdash;and again tonight he talks about the smoothness of the transfer to decimal currency.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of this or not but there are numerous persons in this country at the present time who are finding it extremely difficult to know when they go into a shop what prices actually are in so far as that even some of the supermarkets until recently were using the old currency, which only confused matters more. Not alone are old persons and children finding it difficult to handle the new money but, in fact, I fear that many shopkeepers have been deliberately using the unfamiliarity of the people with the currency to jack up prices.  In fact, when something costs an extra ha'penny, what we said would happen when the Decimal Currency Bill was before the House has happened, and that is, that the new half-penny is being deliberately confused with the old ha'penny and the new half-penny is of too high a value.  The result is that when increases occur which under the old system would be relatively small, under the new system they are very substantial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose there is no point in blaming the Minister for this now.  The House passed the Decimal Currency Bill; it became law, and that was that. But I feel that the Government, deliberately or otherwise, failed to inform the public of what was happening and the result is we have this situation where smoothness is not the word I would use.  I grant that there was a lot of smooth talk by people who wanted to create this situation but we have the unfortunate position of Ministers, the Minister for Finance being among the chief of them, preaching to workers about the necessity not to step over the line and of the wonderful thing <Col N="173" /> it was to have at the last minute a type of wage freeze which could be held until the end of the year and saying that prices must be kept down but suddenly everybody realises that because of something which was deliberately caused by this House, if not by the Government&mdash;and I would blame the Government as being the chief cause of it&mdash;prices are rocketing again.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is serious in his exhortations about trying to hold a fixed wage at what it is now, then he must realise that a smooth transfer is not the description which most people are giving to this.  We cannot object to the amendment if the amendment does something to ensure there will not be a bigger mix-up when the period ends. Anything that can be done in order to ensure that people will not be able to say that contracts which were entered into in £sd are no longer valid must be done.  We must agree.  If the Minister thinks it necessary to include a section like this to ensure that they are continued as valid, the House must pass it.  But, would the Minister get used to the fact that the situation has got out of hand and this sort of thing is not doing anything to bring it under control again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained the purpose of the amendment and I gather it is acceptable to the House but, to comment briefly on what was said by Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Tully, let me say, first, that when I used the phrase &ldquo;the smoothness of the introduction of the decimal currency&rdquo; I was, as Deputy O'Higgins surmised, referring to this in a broad fiscal sense. It should be realised that numerous checks, both official and unofficial, of prices since the introduction of decimal currency have shown that there is no substantial evidence whatever of excessive charges because of decimal currency as such.  What should be realised is that a number of price increases which were sanctioned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and which would have come into operation perhaps somewhat before 15th February, which was Decimal Day, were in fact held, because they had to be applied in decimal currency, from Decimal Day and therefore people may well feel <Col N="174" /> that some of these increase were simply due to the changeover in the currency system but many of these increases certainly were not due to that.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Tully and Deputy O'Higgins are more intelligent than that.

      <P>I said at the time, I have said it since and may I say it once more, that the carry-over because of increase in wages and other costs in the past&mdash;the spill-over into this year &mdash;meant that the effect on prices would not be very obvious in this year but by adhering to the national wage agreement we will certainly reap considerable benefit in prices next year.  I have said this before and am saying it again. I do not think there should be any misunderstanding.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether a member of the Garda Síochána against whom a disciplinary charge is made is furnished at any time and in any circumstances with a copy of the statements upon which the charges are based; and, if so, when and in what circumstances; and, if not, why; whether steps will now be taken to extend to members of the Garda Síochána in such circumstances the rights to statements of evidence available to persons under the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967; and, if not, why.</P>

      <P>Before preferring a disciplinary charge against a member of the Garda Síochána the investigating officer informs the member concerned of the allegations against him, shows him the statements containing the evidence <Col N="55" /> against him, unless some statement is of a highly confidential nature or there is some other very special reason for not showing it to him, and invites him to give an explanation.  If he is subsequently charged, he is, on request, given copies of those statements, if no special reason exists why he should not be given them.</P>
      <P>In cases where the commissioner directs the holding of a sworn inquiry into disciplinary charges a summary of the evidence available must be supplied in accordance with Article 10 of the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1926.  New regulations are at present being drafted in consultation with the commissioner and the three Garda representative bodies.</P>
