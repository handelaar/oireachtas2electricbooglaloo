      <Col N="674" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1971, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain services administered by that Office; for the pay and expenses of the Defence Forces and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Defence).</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on this Estimate last week I was referring to the recruitment of suitable men for the Defence Forces.  Unfortunately, methods of recruitment have not met with the success we would wish.  I suggest to the Minister that some more imagination should be used to encourage suitable young men to join the Defence Forces.  Officers have visited secondary schools for the purpose of recruiting suitable cadets.  Perhaps it would be possible to arrange to meet parent groups in different areas; that might meet with some success.</P>
      <P>I have a particular objection to one method of recruitment.  When FCA units go into barracks for training a regular Army officer appears, generally after the first weeks training, and he encourages the young men to join the Army.  There is nothing wrong in encouraging them to join the Army but I dislike the method adopted because some of these young men have joined, without their parents' permission, and have caused a great deal of inconvenience in their homes as a result of doing so.  Farm work and business have been disrupted because they have not obtained the consent of their parents before joining the Army.  This method of recruitment should be stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the FCA, in 1949 the young men who went for annual training received a gratuity of £6 and in 1971 an FCA volunteer going on annual training receives the same amount of money.  In 1949 an FCA NCO going on annual training got £8 <Col N="675" /> and in 1971 he still receives the same gratuity.  An FCA officer in 1949 received £10 and in 1971 the gratuity is still £10.  An OC of an FCA company received £15 in 1949 and in 1971 the figure is the same.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to be realistic.  Now that our FCA is a vital force in each brigade within the Army I would ask him to give some further encouragement and to increase the gratuity to a figure which is just and which bears some relation to present day standards.  I should also like to refer to the FCA uniform which is to be replaced in a year, or in a year and a half's time.  Over the past 20 years I have attended conferences in The Curragh with former Ministers for Defence, with OC's of the different commands in the Army and suggestions have been made to the Ministers in regard to the best method of improving the FCA and the best method of encouraging men to continue as good members.</P>
    <P>I can truthfully say that in those 20 years, despite the fact that intelligent suggestions were made from both regular and FCA commanders, I have never seen one of those suggestions implemented.  This hardy annual of improving the uniform of the FCA has been discussed up and down the country but still the same uniforms have been mass-produced.  These are ill-fitting; they are either too long or too loose and rarely can they be described as being properly fitting.  I suggest that it might be worth considering measuring men for their uniforms so that they will fit them.  I have seen piles of measurement forms but I have seen nothing being done about it.  Every man in the FCA and in the Army should be measured so that he will have a properly fitting uniform.  It has been said here that rarely do we see men in the street who are proud of their uniforms.  If properly fitting uniforms were issued it would be some contribution towards having a more contented group of men.</P>
    <P>FCA transport is deplorable.  If you have not got a mobile Army and mobile units then you just get bogged <Col N="676" /> down.  I know two FCA battalions in which there is practically no transport. In one battalion a station wagon has been taken away and given to another battalion, leaving the former unit without any transport.</P>
    <P>The Government should make an adequate sum of money available to the Department in order to provide adequate transport for our Defence Forces.  Why this position has been allowed to continue I do not know. Trucks purchased in 1952 are still being used and no effort is being made to replace them with modern transport. It is very difficult to understand the mentality behind the decision to permit a necessary corps of the Army to degenerate in this way.  It is a tribute to our fitters and mechanics that they can maintain this transport in its present condition.  Any visit to a barracks will show that the transport is well maintained but the cost of doing this must be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to some injustices in the Army.  A single man who retires after 21 years service gets no gratuity.  There is no good reason why such a man should be deprived of a gratuity simply because he is not married.  He gave the same service and did the same duties as a married man, yet he is not being rewarded. That is an injustice which should be rectified.  Another injustice exists in regard to NCOs and men in receipt of old age pensions.  When they receive the old age pension they go from the high rate of increment to the low rate. That is after 21 years service.  The Department should look into this.  These are just a few points to highlight some defects and a few suggestions so that things can be improved in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to Army competitions and the suggestion was made that there should be more competitions. If those who made these suggestions were familiar with the competitions already operating they would not suggest overloading the present fine programmes of training.  You have inter-company competitions, inter-battalion competitions, inter-brigade competitions and command and all-Army competitions in all weapons, in <Col N="677" /> all sports and in all forms of athletics. If further competitions were introduced it is possible that the necessary training would not be given to the majority of the men in the forces.  When you enter a competition you train a limited number to a very high standard and because you devote a lot of time to a small group it is probable that there is not the same time available to devote to the greater number.</P>
    <P>If we continue with the programmes we have in operation and if we succeed as well as in the past we will be doing quite well.  I should like to pay tribute to the men of the regular Army who introduced into the FCA the various competitions, whether basketball, football or other sports.  I consider it a worthwhile project to introduce these various competitions in the battalions. I paid tribute last year to the men who were responsible for introducing these competitions and I should like to repeat my appreciation of the work carried out by the NCOs and the officers in this regard.</P>
    <P>If we enter the EEC there will be further demands on our Army and it is essential that our equipment be maintained at a standard equal to that of other member countries of the Community. It is possible that we might have to make a contribution of, say, a battalion and should this situation arise we must be prepared to cope with it.</P>
    <P>I should like to make reference to our Army personnel on overseas duties and I commend the Minister for the treatment he has given to Army men in this regard.  Quite recently the men received some overtime payments which were due for overseas service and the Minister has the gratitude of the men. Our forces have distinguished themselves overseas, whether on the Gaza Strip, in Cyprus or elsewhere.  Last year we made the complaint that they had not been paid in respect of this overtime and we are pleased that it is now rectified.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Army bands, it is necessary to give some attention to the recruitment of men who have a flair for music.  It is also desirable that the personnel in these bands should have an attractive uniform and I regret to say <Col N="678" /> that I do not consider the present uniform very becoming.  In the issue of uniforms to our Army personnel much more thought should be given to the design of the uniforms because it is important that the men present a neat and smart appearance.  This is particularly essential when our Army appears at, for instance, the Dublin Horse Show, at functions for visiting dignitaries and on special occasions. Much is expected of our Army band and it is important that they present a smart appearance.</P>
    <P>With regard to our equitation school, it is well known that those who have engaged in competitions abroad have brought credit to our country with the victories they have gained.  However, if they are to continue to achieve good results in competitions abroad the men must have good animals.  I suggest that our Army officers and those people who purchase suitable animals for our equitation school should visit the various shows throughout the country. They should take note of the animals who compete in the competitions in these shows and in this way they would be in a position to make recommendations regarding the purchase of suitable animals.</P>
    <P>It is time we considered whether we are getting an adequate number of engineers in the engineering corps of the Army and if this is not so we should do something about it.  Looking back over a number of years, I doubt whether we can feel happy about the situation.  It is vital in any Army that the corps of engineers should be properly staffed and of a very high standard and this cannot be done if qualified engineers do not enter the corps.</P>
    <P>Because of improved pay and conditions in the Army there should be a greater tendency for young men to offer their services but as the competition from civilian jobs is quite keen the Army have a difficult problem in recruitment.  I am not suggesting that we should reduce in any way the method of discipline that exists in the Army because a high standard of discipline is vital.  Some people have suggested that we should allow young men to wear their hair long, as in the popular trend, and they have suggested <Col N="679" /> that this would encourage more recruits.  However, that is a matter on which the Army authorities must use their own judgment and I realise that Army personnel must look neat and smart on all occasions.</P>
    <P>In the matter of civil defence it is necessary to continue training throughout the country.  It may not ever become necessary to cope with atomic fallout, but the information gained in civil defence lectures will be useful in civilian life.  The men and women who attend these lectures gain useful knowledge; they are most efficiently trained and we should not underrate the contributions made by the instructors, wardens and Army officers who are involved in this work.  We should encourage all civilians who are able to do so to volunteer their services to the civil defence effort.</P>
    <P>Some complaints have been made about soldiers who do not get an opportunity because of age to go overseas. I am aware that a man must be medically fit before he can leave his own barracks or command.  However, I have known men who went to the North of Ireland under canvas and they were able to endure their terms of duty.  The age limit should be extended to give some of the soldiers an opportunity of sharing in the contribution made by their friends in the regular Army.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased the Minister has strongly indicated his intention to improve conditions in the Army.  I hope in the year to come he will continue to pay particular attention to the housing of our soldiers.  The National Building Agency have, to date, erected between 400 and 500 houses for the Garda.  That agency did a splendid job and they should now be directed to providing houses for our regular Army men.  Men in Sarsfield Barracks in Limerick and Collins Barracks in Cork find it very difficult to get houses when they retire.  Replacements have been made in Sarsfield Barracks and other places but it is only recently that effort was made. Again regular men assigned to duties <Col N="680" /> in different areas should get priority from the local authority, and the Minister for Local Government, in consultation with local authorities, should allocate houses for these men. These men are assigned rapidly to an area.  There is a big upset to their families if they cannot get suitable accommodation.  This is a problem which has been in existence for years and it must be tackled at some stage or other.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to note the recent purchases of vessels for our Naval Service. We hope they will provide adequate coastal protection.  This is an improvement which has been sought over a long number of years.</P>
    <P>Although we would always hope our Defence Forces would not need to be a belligerent force and would always be assigned to peaceful missions, there should be no skimping on expenditure which is necessary to maintain and equip a modern Army.  A great deal of leeway has to be made up because for years there has been far too much skimping.  An effort must be made to rebuild something which has been overlooked for far too long.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputies for their contributions to this debate, and also to express my appreciation of the tributes paid to the work of our services throughout the year.  Heavy demands were made on our Defence Forces.  They have stood up to them admirably and have proved that the confidence we have in our Defence Forces is well founded.  I am happy to say also that it has been a rewarding year for the Defence Forces in so far as substantial pay adjustments were made as well as adjustments in pensions and gratuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was particularly interested to hear the remarks of Deputy Clinton, Deputy Coughlan and Deputy Malone following their visits to military establishments. Deputy Clinton may have got the impression that obstacles were put in his way regarding these visits, but I can assure him that was not the case. The important thing is that he did eventually visit The Curragh.  I entirely agree with his sentiment that if there <Col N="681" /> is one area in this country where there should be no party politics it is the Army.  It was in that spirit that I agreed to the visits, and I would earnestly ask that it would always be respected.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that Deputies had some very generous things to say as a result of what they saw and experienced. As might be expected, some of our shortcomings were highlighted, and I must concede that if I were on the other side of the House I would be endeavouring to pinpoint such shortcomings as well.  I myself am acutely conscious of them and nothing would please me better than to spend generously on such things as new barracks, new married quarters, transport, uniforms, radio equipment, weapons and so on.  However, public funds and the share of them available for Defence are strictly limited and we must chose our priorities.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to provide the best possible conditions for our officers and men as reflected in pay, allowances and pensions.  I doubt if, by and large, any other vocation comprehends as wide a range of skills and professions and offers comparable opportunities and rewards.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of an Army, even a small one like our Army, is very costly and I should like to give some figures which will illustrate that point: 1,000 men would cost about £1 million per annum to feed, cloth and house, to say nothing of their equipment; one armoured car costs £40,000; an armoured personnel carrier costs about £20,000; a medium helicopter costs £100,000; a single shell can cost up to £95; a modest fishery protection vessel costs about £1 million; a radio transmitter can cost anything up to £25,000; a married quarters would cost £4,000 or £5,000. These figures give some idea of the massive sums required to maintain an Army.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate the financial problems that would be involved if we were to support all of these needs simultaneously.  I believe the estimates before the House represent the best assessment of the priorites.</P>
    <P>I was a bit disappointed to hear <Col N="682" /> Deputy Cooney speak in such gloomy tones of what he alleges is the low professional morale of our Army.  I entirely disagree with him.  Only last week I was down in Killarney commemorating the 50th anniversary of a very historic engagement at a place called Tureengarriff on the Cork-Kerry border where a small party of I.R.A. successfully attacked an enemy convoy.  In that attack the equipment of the party consisted of a poor Hotchkiss gun, a few rifles and a few shot guns.  Nevertheless, the operation was successful and of the 26 participants in that engagement five were present at the function last week and from my observation they were as eager and spirited last week in Killarney as they were 50 years ago.  I find it hard then to accept that now in 1971 Irishmen dressed in the uniform of their country, well paid and reasonably well equipped should lack in spirit or in purpose.  The bearing and performance of our men at home and in foreign lands is abundant proof of the quality of our armed forces.  I am quite happy that there is a high level of professional morale within our forces and I would oppose any suggestion to the contrary.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to assemble as much information as possible on the points raised by the Deputies in the course of the debate.  The question of Army equipment was raised by Deputies Clinton, Coughlan, Cooney, Dowling and Tully and in this connection I want to say that a continuing programme of capital expenditure has been in progress over the years for the purchase of equipment of all types. The weapons and other equipment purchased for the Defence Forces are up to date and much the same as their counterparts in other armies.  Their numbers and level of sophistication are, of course, limited by the relatively small financial provision available annually for the purchase of arms and equipment generally.</P>
    <P>Regarding transport vehicles, we have in the last two financial years purchased nine land rovers, 11 trucks, 11 saloons, 11 station wagons, 20 motor cycles and eight other such vehicles. This year we are purchasing 64 land <Col N="683" /> rovers, seven trucks, six station wagons and four ambulances.  I hope to make further substantial purchases of vehicles in the next year.  I am fully conscious of our transport shortcomings and I hope from what I have indicated here that Deputies will be satisfied that this aspect of military requirements is receiving attention and will receive further attention in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The question of Army and FCA clothing has been mentioned by a number of Deputies including Deputies Clinton, Coughlan and Tully.  As I mentioned in my opening speech it has been decided to introduce a new type of cloth for uniforms for both Army and FCA.  This will give the desired improved appearance.  Perhaps also there is excessive fault-finding with Army dress.  I am aware of the need for its improvement and this matter is in hands at the moment.  We expect that when the present stocks have been used up the new uniforms will be available in about 1½ years.</P>
    <P>The need for new barracks in the Dublin area has been referred to by Deputies Clinton and Dowling.  We recognise that there is need for the building of new barracks and the modernisation of existing ones but there again the financial limitation is the restricting factor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Portobello must be worth £2 million, to sell the site alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be quite happy to think that it would be and that we could build a new barracks in its place. We need the accommodation but until such time as we can be assured of having our new barracks we would be ill-advised to part with our existing possessions.  In the matter of billets, efforts are mainly directed at the improvement of billets for soldiers and the improvement of married quarters. According to my estimation the sale of existing barracks would hardly provide for the cost of a new barracks but again I can assure Deputies that this is a requirement we fully recognise and we are giving it very full consideration and when the opportunity presents itself we shall certainly take advantage of it and <Col N="684" /> provide the much-needed military accommodation in the form of new barracks.</P>
      <P>The question of the shortage of married quarters has been mentioned by Deputies Clinton and Dowling.  In this connection I should say that the provision of houses for soldiers must primarily remain a matter for the local authority concerned.  A soldier has an equal claim with other members of the community on the local authority.  The policy of the Department is to supplement as far as possible housing requirements where the need is greatest.  Since 1954 the Department has built 176 such houses including 88 in Dublin, 24 in Cork, 20 in Athlone, 30 at The Curragh, eight in Naas and six in Limerick.</P>
      <P>The matter of the duties of officers' orderlies was referred to by Deputies Dowling and Clinton.  They suggest that the system of providing officers' orderlies should be eliminated.  Batmen orderlies have traditionally been allocated to officers occupying quarters in barracks to maintain these quarters as well as the officers' equipment and uniforms in proper condition.  I cannot see any justification for changing this system.</P>
      <P>The lack of facilities available to serving soldiers to make suggestions has been mentioned by Deputies Clinton and Cooney.  There is nothing to prevent an officer or soldier whether inside or outside Dublin from making suggestions through the normal military channels and if they do so there is no apparent reason why these suggestions should not get through.  In this connection also I think that rather unfair remarks were passed regarding the civil side of the Department.  There are, of course, the normal channels through which an officer or soldier can seek redress under Military Defence Regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling referred to what he described as depressing conditions at Naas.  The apprentices are accommodated to a large extent in wooden huts.  It is planned to replace them with a new building but delays have occurred in getting the site.  Agreement has now been reached with the Naas Urban Council for the acquisition of its interest in an acre of land adjoining the barracks.  The legal formalities <Col N="685" /> have not yet been completed but it is hoped they will be in a short time and it will then be possible to proceed with the building of substitute accommodation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>What about equipment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards equipment we concede that improvements are desirable but the present equipment meets essential requirements.  While some of it might be old it is fairly adequate.  We shall endeavour to replace it with more modern equipment and improve that aspect as well.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling also raised the question of electric fittings.  Considerable progress has been made in the installation of electrical plugs in married quarters.  There are problems because of shortage of current in the mains but it is hoped the ESB will take over the direct supply to these quarters in the near future and it will then be possible to install all the additional fittings required.</P>
      <P>The question of overholders has again been raised, this time by Deputy Dowling.  The provision of houses for non-military personnel is a matter for the local authorities concerned and they are generally in our experience co-operative in this matter.  We advise soldiers who are going to retire from the Permanent Defence Force to apply to the local authorities concerned for re-housing.  We also make recommendations to the appropriate local authority to facilitate such personnel as best they can.  We recognise that it is sometimes difficult for retiring men to acquire accommodation but it must be appreciated that married quarters in the Army are for serving personnel. We cannot agree to the continued occupation of quarters by people who have ceased to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooney thinks that the Civil Defence service should be trained by the military instead of being in the hands of local authorities.  As its very name implies, Civil Defence is a part of national defence which does not come within the province of military activities as such&mdash;it is designed to mitigate the effects of war on the civilian population.  The reason why it <Col N="686" /> was decided that local authorities should carry out civil defence functions was that the kind of organisation necessary to carry out such functions as, for example, bringing succour to people who have lost their homes, and the rescuing of people trapped in catastrophies such as fire or flooding, are operations which should be conducted under the direction of the local authorities.  On occasions the military may be called in to assist in such operations but they only do so in cases of extreme need.  It is in the main the responsibility of the Civil Defence forces to provide help in these circumstances. It must be remembered that the military have sufficient work in their own field and they would be unnecessarily overburdened if they were given the additional duties of Civil Defence work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney also dealt with allowances for officers serving with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East.  The Deputy seems to have got his information a little mixed up.  There is no question of remedying some situation without it costing a penny to the Exchequer by making a claim to the United Nations.  The position is that officers engaged on these duties have since June, 1969, been in receipt of subsistence allowance of $12.50 a day from the United Nations.  Prior to that time the allowance was $10 a day.  The question of paying additionally an overseas allowance, which would come out of our own Exchequer, has been under consideration for some time and it has been decided to grant such an allowance. It will be at the rate of £1 a day for the period from 1st June, 1967, to the 31st December, 1970, and £1 10s a day thereafter.  In some cases this will mean an officer will receive a lump sum of something over £700 which I think adequately meets the requirements under this heading.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney made a passing comment about the Red Cross, and at this time, when the investigations are being carried out, I think it was inappropriate of the Deputy to have referred to the activities of the Red Cross at all. I think the Deputy might well have refrained from making the comment which he did make.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> Deputy Cooney also mentioned ONE.  He felt that more use could be made of ONE.  I am not sure what the Deputy has in mind but my Department co-operates as far as possible with ONE in the matter of the resettlement of discharged personnel.  We have meetings with representatives of ONE in order to discuss problems.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan had an interesting tour of barracks in both the Southern and Western Commands.  I may sum up by saying his remarks on his experiences were highly gratifying.  I am obliged to him, as I am to Deputy Clinton and Deputy Malone, for their comprehensive reports on what they saw in these places.  Deputy Coughlan referred to the cooking ranges installed many years ago in the Kickham Barracks in Clonmel.  He said they were out of date and I think he is quite justified in saying that.  These ranges are no longer being manufactured and it is proposed to have them replaced by gas or electric cookers as they become unfit for use.  Deputy Coughlan also referred to the equipment which is lying idle in the vicinity of Kickham Barracks. These are items for which it is difficult to obtain spares.  If it is found that spares cannot be obtained the equipment will be disposed of.  This is a minor matter and one which is receiving attention.</P>
    <P>The selection of personnel for service in Cyprus was mentioned by Deputy Clinton and Deputy Malone. Their remarks were in the nature of an inquiry as to how personnel were selected.  Many factors have to be taken into consideration.  It is a testing engagement and the selection of the men must necessarily be left in the hands of military personnel who are conversant with the capabilities of each individual medically and professionally. I think there is not any justification for interfering with the present system. The standard of physical fitness, age and standard of training and efficiency and the recommendations of the immediate superior officers are taken into account.  From what I have seen of our troops in Cyprus I would compliment the selecting officers on their choice.  These men are behaving in an <Col N="688" /> exemplary fashion and they are a credit to our country.  The care and attention that is given to the selection of men for such service cannot be overstressed.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister do anything to meet the request of the senior NCOs for an extension of the upper age limit to 55 for this type of duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Age is a prime factor and we must be guided by the recommendations of the senior military and medical officers in relation to selection. We are in their hands and it is right and proper that we should be because they are the people closely associated with the Army and they are in the best position to select age-wise and otherwise the most suitable personnel.</P>
      <P>The strength of the Army was referred to by Deputies Clinton and Tully. Deputy Clinton inquired about the present strength of the Army and whether normal recruiting was going on.  The strength of the Permanent Defence Force as on 31st December, 1970 was 8,563 comprised of 1,119 officers and 7,444 men.  In addition there were, as on that date, 226 members of the Reserve, First Line, on full time service. The special advertising and recruiting campaign has been discontinued but normal recruiting is, of course, in progress.  We will need to undertake a special recruiting drive for recruits for the Naval Service and this will be undertaken in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the provision of fishery protection vessels was mentioned by Deputy Clinton.  As I already pointed out we have agreed to purchase three minesweepers.  An all-weather fishery protection vessel is being built at present at Cobh and this will be ready for delivery in March, 1972.  The first of the minesweepers will be brought into service in the middle of this month and the remaining two will come into service in March.  This is a highly desirable development in fishery protection and it will, I assure the House, be the intention of the Department of Defence to take every opportunity to further strengthen the defensive potential of our Naval Service.  As <Col N="689" /> well as that, of course, a decision has been taken to purchase three all-weather fishery protection vessels.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney referred to the question of resettlement of officers.  I mentioned that officers become eligible for pension after relatively short service. This is a great help to those officers who wish to retire to take up civilian employment.  The fact that many officers in future will have an opportunity of obtaining a university degree should also prove of benefit as far as resettlement is concerned.  The question of undue numbers retiring has probably been exaggerated.  The conditions under which they retire must be taken into account.  Officers qualify for pension at an early age and by virtue of their military training, and now with the addition of a university degree, they are considered eminently suitable personnel for civilian employment.  We are not opposed to early retirement.  We are happy to see our young officers capable and qualified to undertake responsible civilian employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton referred to Army involvement in the local community. This is highly desirable but the position is that, as for others in the Public Service, there are restraints, of course, on military personnel whose contribution to aspects of community life is thus circumscribed.  Subject to such restraints personnel can and do participate effectively in cultural, social, charitable and sporting activities.  I should point out, however, that the Army are fully occupied in meeting their military obligations and we have to call on the services of the FCA for security.  Because of this we are conscious of the fact that the Army are fully committed and we do not encourage over-involvement in local community matters.  This is only reasonable and sensible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton mentioned the undesirability of soldiers filling in their time doing unnecessary chores.  It is recognised, of course, that some of the duties of soldiers are routine and tedious but none of them are unnecessary. They are all required in one way or another to run the barracks and units to which soldiers belong.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary asked about FCA <Col N="690" /> accommodation in some villages and towns.  We are not aware of any general deficiency in FCA accommodation. However, in so far as financial resources permit, a programme is proceeding of replacing rented accommodation used by the FCA Company Headquarters with newly constructed State-owned premises.  The same Deputy alleges that there are derelict FCA halls in many rural areas.  We have no knowledge of such conditions. If we get more specific information on the matter we will certainly have it looked into.</P>
    <P>Deputy Malone expressed the opinion that some of The Curragh lands should be given to Kildare County Council to enable them to solve their housing problems and the problem of housing for Army personnel.  May I remind him that in 1966 my Department offered to sell to the Council two acres of The Curragh for the erection of 12 houses but the Council intimated that they were not interested in acquiring the site?  As Deputy Power mentioned I have recently indicated that I am still prepared to examine sympathetically any application from Kildare County Council or the National Building Agency for housing sites on The Curragh.</P>
    <P>Deputy Malone is also concerned about the curtailment of the activities of certain traders in The Curragh Camp. I want to clarify the position by saying that in recent years the camp has been inundated by agents of various firms, many of whom engage in high-pressure door-to-door salemanship.  This traffic created a grave security risk.  It also resulted in the families of military personnel in the camp getting into financial difficulties.  The Officer Commanding the Camp, who is responsible for Camp security, decided that the passes issued to all these agents should be withdrawn on a phased basis so as to allow them to clear up any outstanding accounts with residents of the Camp.  I am satisfied that the action of the Commanding Officer was reasonable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Malone referred to a deputation of Curragh sheep owners which I received some time ago accompanied by Deputy Boylan, Deputy Power and <Col N="691" /> himself.  This deputation dealt with the improvement of the lands at The Curragh.  Following that meeting I invited proposals from the Association for the carrying out of various works of fertilisation and rehabilitation generally which would not impose any financial burden on the State.  This was only reasonable.  So far we have not had a reply from the Association.  So far as the provision of sheep-dipping tanks is concerned, this is a matter for the Association to arrange with the local authority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully had much to say about civil defence.  I would like to thank him for his complimentary remarks about the personnel of this service which rightly deserve the tribute.  The civil defence are doing an excellent job.  The Deputy feels that the organisation is not up to the strength which the press would lead one to believe.  In my introductory speech I have already dealt with this point by mentioning that a special check was made in 1969 of the effective strength of civil defence.  Of the 26,000 trained volunteers on the rolls who were asked in writing if they intended to continue membership and report for duty if required to do so in an emergency, some 14,000 people replied in the affirmative.  This is a satisfactory picture and it establishes the real truth of the situation.  Taking into account the hazards of modern nuclear warfare which could have widespread effects, it is necessary to have as many civil defence volunteers as possible trained in every part of the State so as to ensure that expert help would be available at all points very quickly in case of necessity.  I do not think that Deputy Tully's suggestion of a small, select band of volunteers would give us the coverage which we have at the moment or would be more effective than the present system.  I have not received any complaints from the civil defence personnel about the shortage of equipment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred also to the Northern refugees and to the camp at Gormanston.  Refugees naturally create problems but we have a humane responsibility to ensure that they are fully looked after.  We must provide <Col N="692" /> food and suitable accommodation and as well as that, we must provide it in the most suitable and practical location. Gormanston was one of the camps selected because of its convenient location. Since the necessary organisation and equipment had been provided at Gormanston it would be wasteful in personnel and materials to duplicate it elsewhere.  The camp was able to cope with the problem.  It was necessary to open refugee centres in other places to take the overflow.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the point made by the Deputy about Gormanston being perhaps too convenient for those who might adopt the role of refugee unnecessarily, and prolong their stay. This is the type of problem which we expected, but we must be very tolerant in dealing with distressed people and we must try to ensure that we provide for distressed persons even if, on occasion, we are providing for people who would hardly come within the category of genuine refugee.  That problem is still on our hands.  We are endeavouring to cope with it but for the present we must bear with it.  I am not aware of any refugees from Gormanston Camp or any other camp going to the hairdressers, the local supermarkets or the pictures in taxis at the expense of the State.  I do not think we are affording that luxury, and I hope we are not doing so.</P>
    <P>Deputies Tully and Coughlan were concerned about the quality of bacon being supplied to our army personnel. I may explain that Grade B bacon is purchased for the army.  This bacon is above the average quality available to householders generally.  I consider the quality of bacon is reasonable.  From what I have seen myself this is the fact, and the army are getting the best possible quality of bacon.  There is no case for complaint in this respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary voiced the feelings of many when he recommended the extension of free travel to the wives of veteran holders of free travel cards. From our point of view I should say that the Department of Defence scheme follows the scheme for old age pensioners operated by the Department of Social Welfare.  Under this scheme spouses have free travel only when <Col N="693" /> accompanying pensioners.  The idea of the extension of the scheme to spouses was that many old age pensioners, even if they have free travel, are unable to get about on their own.  This is why the extension was granted.  The same principle has been applied to the scheme in the Department of Defence for veterans.  If spouses of veterans were given unrestricted free travel it would be impossible to refuse the same concession to widows of veterans.  Many veterans died without ever applying for pension or medal.  At this point of time the amount of investigation which would be involved in establishing eligibility could be very heavy and, perhaps, impossible because so many of the verifying officers are dead.  If widows of veterans were given unrestricted free travel, there would be a similar demand from the widows of old age pensioners.  In effect, all widows would have to be eligible.  This problem goes beyond the functions of the Department of Defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In a case where the veteran is so infirm that he is not able to leave the house, could his voucher not be passed on to his wife who does his shopping and chores for him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>We would like to grant that extension but if a precedent is established, where does one draw the line?  If such a concession is given to one, it must be given to all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could it be given on a doctor's certificate?  Could the Minister give any idea of the numbers involved because, in honesty, I do not feel that the comparison with old age pensioners is quite the same as with veterans and people who have been awarded these services.  I believe that they are more deserving cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  It is debatable, of course, whether their condition is worse than that of old age pensioners. It would create an enormous problem.  It is the size of the problem rather than the amount involved that is the main concern because if you extend it, as I say, to enable wives to travel unaccompanied by their qualified husbands, you will then automatically have to extend it to the widows. <Col N="694" /> This would be only fair and reasonable to the widows of the old IRA men. This would be a very sizeable task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not a simple pass for the widows be sufficient, signed by the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is where our problem begins, so to speak.  Many old IRA men did not apply.  They died before the medals were issued. You would then have the problem of defining and identifying a widow of an old IRA man, that is, the widow of a person who had not got a medal but who would have qualified for a medal if he had applied.  It is a far-ranging kind of difficulty.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary raised the question of a scheme of pensions for the widows of Old IRA veterans.  There is, of course, already provision for pensions for widows of veterans who had disability pensions under the Army Pensions Acts.  The transfer to widows of the military service pensions or special allowances held by their husbands presents many difficulties both in terms of costs and otherwise.  I can say that I have special sympathy for this proposal and at the moment I am looking into the matter to see if it can be put into effect.  At this point I could hardly make any definite promise.  It certainly is getting very sympathetic consideration and it is one recommendation we would be highly pleased to put into operation because we can well recognise the plight of the widow of a veteran.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary also raised the question of the means test for special allowances.  He looks for a more liberal approach generally in regard to special allowances.  In actual fact, the means test has been relaxed considerably over the years.  It would be tedious to give all the details of these relaxations. As Deputy O'Leary referred particularly to unmarried sons and daughters, I should to say that in such cases the income of the children is not taken into account.  What is taken into account is the contribution they make to the household, and that to a limited extent only.  No assessment is made in respect of the first £3 10s of the contribution in a rural area or the first £4 in an urban area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> Deputy Taylor referred to the FCA grants and reserve grants.  In this connection I should say that the annual grant is only one item in the total remuneration payable to the reserve personnel each year.  The grant is only one aspect, one factor of it.  During periods of annual training and courses of instruction the rates of pay and allowances applicable to personnel of the Permanent Defence Force are paid and they qualify for increases granted to the normal Permanent Defence Force personnel.  I can inform the Deputy also that the question of increasing these grants is being considered at present.</P>

      <P>This token Supplementary Estimate is being introduced to enable the debate on agriculture to be resumed.  As Deputies will recall, the original Estimate for £65,534,000, together with a Supplementary Estimate for £3,942,000, was passed by the Dáil on 11th December, 1970, before the debate on the main Estimate was concluded. As I spoke at length on the main aspects of agriculture when introducing the original Estimate on 2nd December, 1970, I propose to make my opening remarks on this occasion brief, and to deal in my closing statement with the various points already raised and those which will be raised during this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> The combined total of the original and supplementary Estimates comes to almost £69½ million.  This large sum&mdash; which is some £3 million higher than the 1969-70 figure, reflects the cost in the present financial year of the various measures being operated by my Department in support of agriculture. These measures provide support for a wide range of commodities and help substantially in the improvement of agricultural resources and output.  The range of measures in operation is continually being expanded and improved. Over the past year alone, the rate of Exchequer support for our four main agricultural commodities&mdash;cattle, sheep, pigs and creamery milk&mdash;was increased on two occasions.  Headage payments for both cattle and sheep were substantially improved.  The price payable to producers of liquid milk was increased twice in 1970.  Further benefits will accrue to farmers in 1971 from the increase in the beet acreage this year and from the increase of over 10 per cent in the floor price for this year's barley crop and there will be a consequential adjustment in the minimum prices for pigs next autumn.</P>
    <P>The increases in the rate of support for creamery milk will cost the exchequer more than £3 million extra in a full year, and creamery milk suppliers will further benefit from the reduction in the Bord Bainne levy.</P>
    <P>The overall cost to the Exchequer in a full year of the additional measures introduced during the past year will be about £10 million.  This figure, of course, takes no account of the increases in the price of liquid milk which are borne by the consumer or of the value to farmers of the higher guaranteed price for Irish cattle and sheep fattened in Britain.</P>
    <P>I have referred on a number of occasions recently to the large sum represented by State expenditure in relation to agriculture. The amount is now approaching £100 million a year.  Whatever efforts may be made to play down this figure, there is no escaping the fact that the Government have to find this money and that the job of providing it is not an easy one although I have no doubt that the justification for it is <Col N="698" /> beyond question.  Farmers as well as the rest of the community must realise how much agricultural output, income and efficiency would suffer without State expenditure of this order.  I would add that, if agriculture were to suffer in this way, the adverse effects would be quickly felt in the rest of the economy.</P>
    <P>Firm figures of agricultural output and income for 1970 are not yet available but preliminary estimates indicate a growth in both the volume and value of output and, despite a continuing increase in farmer's operating expenses, a rise in total family farm income.  While figures based on averages have serious weaknesses, they serve as indicators of trends.  Figures available point to an increase of some 6 per cent to 7 per cent in the average per head income of the self-employed in agriculture in 1970.  While this could be regarded as reasonably satisfactory in normal circumstances, average incomes outside agriculture have been rising faster.  Indeed, it was in the light of this divergence in trends as between agricultural incomes and those of others that the Government introduced a second series of measures towards the end of 1970 to improve the income position of farmers.</P>
    <P>In the near future, I hope to have discussions with farming organisations regarding the agricultural position and prospects, and I can assure them that their views will be carefully considered by the Government.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate affords the Dáil an opportunity of discussing what has always been regarded as the main industry in this country, agriculture.  Indeed, if I may say so, this opportunity that has been presented to us now to discuss agriculture is one that is long overdue. It is a terrible indictment not merely of the Government but of our parliamentary <Col N="699" /> system that the leader of one of the farming organisations was able to appear on a television programme a fortnight ago and say that it has been four years since Dáil Éireann had a major debate on agriculture.  I say Mr. O'Keeffe was wrong: that it has been five years since the Dáil had an opportunity of having a full-scale debate on an Estimate for Agriculture.  I repeat that it is a terrible indictment of the Government and of the parliamentary system and I think all sides of the House must bear a fair share of the blame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement is completely incorrect.  We have had a full-scale debate every year during the past five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Murphy can make his contribution later.  I assert my right to state my views and I will not be deterred from making my case by interruptions, from whichever side of the House they come.  I repeat that as far as I can check in the Dáil Library, it has been five years since the Dáil has been able to have an uninterrupted major debate on agriculture. This may be not merely symptomatic of the attitude of the Government towards the agricultural industry but symptomatic also of national thinking in recent times in relation to the role of agriculture in our economy.</P>
      <P>I am perturbed at the tendency to relegate agriculture to a relatively minor role in our national affairs.  It would appear that in the order of our national priorities now, as exemplified by the priority accorded to other issues in this House in recent years, agriculture is not being regarded as the significant factor it once was regarded as and still is.  Maybe it is a political thing in the sense that the rural community, the farming community, are diminishing in numbers and that their voting power <i>vis-à-vis</i> other sectors is declining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I welcome the opportunity presented by this Supplementary Estimate to Dáil Éireann to look into some of the major problems that now confront this major industry. <Col N="700" /> Despite the fact that he did, as he said today, make a major speech prior to the Christmas Recess, I am disappointed that the Minister did not avail himself of the opportunity today to elaborate on some of the points he mentioned in passing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the House?  I have been called urgently away.  I mean no disrespect to the House or to Deputy O'Donnell, but I must attend a Government meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making is that in view of the present state of unrest in the farming community that has emerged since last November when the Minister made the speech to which I have referred, I would have expected the Minister to give some information on Government thinking in relation to the case that has been put forward by the various farming organisations.  I believe that at the present time the agricultural industry is in a state of unprecedented chaos. Farming organisations have begun a campaign of civil disobedience and other forms of protest.</P>
      <P>The question we have to ask ourselves is why have the farming community in this year of 1971 decided to resort to these forms of protest, bearing in mind that the farming community as a rule are peaceful, law-abiding people who in order to make a living have to work on their holdings round the clock seven days a week.  The House will appreciate that when a section of the community like the farmers feel compelled to engage in a campaign of civil disobedience and other forms of protest there is something radically wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be grave reasons why the farming community are now engaging in protests.  I believe the farming community are as much entitled as any other sector to raise their voices in protest against injustice, against the fact that their problems are not being solved.  The fact that they have resorted to these various forms of protest leads one to conclude there must be very serious reasons.  From what I can gather from my contacts with the farmers and my interest in agriculture, there are many reasons why the farming <Col N="701" /> community are up in arms.  The problems are complex.  It is possible to identify certain key factors which led the farmers into taking the course of action that they have taken.</P>
    <P>Looking back at Government policy over the past seven or eight years, particularly since the introduction of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, it will be seen that their policy in relation to agriculture has been a history of blunders, a history of stop-gap measures which, in most cases, were dictated by political expediency. Since the introduction of that programme there has been no real effort to formulate and implement a comprehensive, dynamic and long term policy for agriculture.  In addition, the farming community have had to face a situation of continuous rising costs coupled with a continuous fall in their income. There has been a worsening in their income <i>vis-à-vis</i> other sectors of the community.  Leaders of farming organisations are now claiming that the average weekly income of a farmer is £8 less than the average income of those in other sectors.</P>
    <P>This figure of £8 has been quoted time and again from public platforms and so far it has not been refuted by the Government, by the Minister or by anybody else.  At Question Time last week, the Parliamentary Secretary, who was deputising for the Minister, was challenged on this income differential but he did not refute the figure.  I described the situation as a grave social injustice.</P>
    <P>I believe the figure of £8 to be correct. This differential is a shocking indictment of Government policy&mdash;it is an indictment not only of their policy in relation to agriculture but of their whole approach to economic development and social justice.  What has been the result of the irresponsible manner in which the Government have dealt with the agricultural industry?  The result is that the farming community have now realised that they must fight for survival because, as a result of the Government's policy, 14,000 persons have been forced to leave the land each year.</P>
    <P>The present difficulties in relation to the industry were referred to by the <Col N="702" /> Minister when he spoke of the divergence in trends as between the incomes of those in agriculture and those in other sectors and he tells us that the Government have now decided on a series of measures to improve the income position of farmers.  When the Second Programme for Economic Expansion was introduced, I stated that the Government and their experts, forecasters and economists had made a fatal mistake.  I said this because the role assigned to agriculture under that programme was unreal.  The targets were unrealistic in that they were too low.  In other words, there was failure to recognise the fundamental importance of agriculture and its potential contribution in an expanding economy. There was also the failure to give representation to agriculture on the NIEC.</P>
    <P>However, the greatest failure of the Government in relation to agriculture has been their failure to recognise the key role which co-operation could have played in developing agriculture to its fullest potential.  On every occasion on which I have spoken here on agriculture, I have referred to the principle of co-operation.  A golden opportunity was lost by the Government during the past decade because of their failure to formulate and implement a practical programme of co-operation; their failure to apply to Irish agriculture the principles and practice of co-operation that have been tested and tried in other countries.  I am even more convinced that the only hope for the preservation and future viability of the average family holding is through the practical application of the principle of co-operation.</P>
    <P>The great tragedy of Irish agriculture in the last 20 years has been the scrapping of the parish plan.  The more one examines the social and economic problems of rural Ireland and of Irish agriculture the more one becomes convinced of the tremendous foresight and wisdom of that great apostle of rural Ireland, the architect of the parish plan, the late Canon Haves, the founder of Muintir na Tíre.  That unique plan was initially in advance of any other plan in Western Europe and it has now been accepted in many countries.  Here it was never given a <Col N="703" /> fair trial.  It was a tragedy that the plan was not modified to enable it to work successfully.  The greatest mistake made by Fianna Fáil when they returned to Office in 1957 was the scrapping of the parish plan.  I regard the failure to formulate and implement a proper policy and plan for co-operation in Irish agriculture as the greatest failure on the part of the present Government and that failure is the greatest tragedy in Irish agriculture today.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the State subvention to the creamery and dairying industry.  The history of Fianna Fáil policy in recent years in relation to agriculture has been a history of blunders and that is nowhere more apparent in the agricultural industry than in the dairying sector.  The Minister says the increased subvention will cost the Exchequer more than £3 million in a full year and the creamery milk suppliers will have the additional benefit of the Bord Bainne levy.  That is the only reference the Minister made to the dairying industry.  Our dairy farmers, particularly those in the creamery areas, are the most vocal at the moment in their demand for a better deal from the Government and it is only right and proper that some attempt should be made to assess the situation and to examine the demands for an increase in the price of milk and an improvement in their incomes.</P>
    <P>Dairying is the most important sector of our agricultural economy.  It is a major national industry.  It provides a livelihood for 120,000 dairy farmers and their families.  It provides direct employment in the creameries, in the processing industry, in transport, distribution and so on for a further 10,000 people.  When one looks at the contribution made by the industry to the national economy in the matter of direct exports one finds that these are now running at £30 million per annum; that is the direct contribution made by the dairying industry to our total agricultural exports.  Dairying is the foundation of our agricultural industry and, unless we have a viable dairying industry, we cannot have a viable livestock industry.  I am sure the most urban-minded person and even the <Col N="704" /> armchair academics, who drive me up the wall, appreciate the fact that dairying is a fundamental and vitally important industry from the point of view of the national economy.</P>
    <P>I do not ask for a better deal for the dairying industry or an improvement in the incomes of dairy farmers simply for social and economic reasons. There is another reason: the acid test of any industry is its performance.  In advocating additional State assistance to the dairying industry one has to examine the performance of that industry. A very satisfactory picture emerges, despite the lack of long-term planning for the industry by the Government, the various stop-gap measures and so forth.  Over the past six years the dairying industry has proved itself to be a highly efficient industry, an industry which can produce products to be sold on the British market at premium prices.  The price commanded by Kerry Gold Butter is the highest of all imported butters in Britain.  Not alone are we holding our own with the Danes, the New Zealanders and the Dutch from the point of view of quality of product and attractiveness of presentation but the British housewife is actually prepared to pay more for our product.</P>
    <P>What has been wrong here is the fact that farming organisations have not, perhaps, emphasised enough the fundamental importance of the dairying industry.  It is a viable industry which has proved itself.  It is an industry in which, so to speak, the men can be separated from the boys from the point of view of the export market.  It is not an industry composed of people incessantly moaning and ullagoning.</P>
    <P>Another very important aspect in relation to this industry is the fact that our dairy farmers and our creamery milk producers are receiving the lowest price of any dairy farmer in Western Europe.  Despite our products commanding premium prices on the export market our dairy farmers are the lowest cost milk producers in Western Europe.  The average price per gallon paid for creamery milk is only half that paid in the Common Market.  If the Government had any foresight at all, any concept or realisation of the importance <Col N="705" /> of this industry to the economy, directly and indirectly, surely the formulation and implementation of a proper long-term plan for the industry should have been a top priority in Government policy.  It should be a top priority.  The dairy farmers who have been forced to fight for survival and for recognition of their just grievances are at present resorting to a campaign of civil disobedience.  If we had proper Government policy this would not be necessary now.  Far from having had a proper policy for the dairy industry we had a ridiculous situation where for a period of three or four years, from 1964 to 1969 in fact, it was the policy of the Government to induce every dairy farmer to increase milk output. This was deliberate government policy and the target laid down in the Second Programme envisaged such expansion. All the resources of the Department through the advisory services were thrown into a campaign for about five years directed to increasing milk production. This was the Government's policy.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to spell this out from the Second Programme documents and the numerous speeches made by the different Ministers for Agriculture in that period.</P>
    <P>In the mistaken belief that they were doing the right thing, heeding the advice of the advisory services, thousands of dairy farmers involved themselves in very heavy capital commitments in improving grasslands and the stock-carrying capacity of the lands, installing the most modern dairy equipment, introducing the most up-to-date milking equipment and in making every effort to produce top quality milk and adopting modern methods of grassland management and intensive grazing.  All this was done following continuous exhortations from the Government and on-the-spot advice transmitted to them by the advisory services.</P>
    <P>What happened?  Before the target fixed in the 1964 Second Programme for Economic Expansion had been reached&mdash;530 million gallons I think it was&mdash;the then Minister for Agriculture in 1969, or early in 1970, announced out of the blue that there was now panic; there was surplus milk and in <Col N="706" /> order to curtail milk production the Government had decided to introduce a new pricing system for creamery milk which has since come to be known as the multi-tier system.  This decision by the Government was the worst and most retrograde step ever taken by any Government.  The multi-tier system of milk payments has no precedent in any dairying country in Western Europe or in the world, so far as I know.  It runs completely contrary to the payments system in the EEC countries.  Before the target for the Second Programme had been reached the cry went out that milk production should stop and the very farmers who responded best to Government exhortations to increase milk production found themselves overnight faced with a situation where they would have to take a substantial reduction in income because if they exceeded a certain figure of milk production the price went down.  There was a graduated scale.</P>
    <P>This is the system that operated in 1970.  It is a ridiculous and stupid system and events have now proved it to have been stupid and ridiculous because as a result there has been in 1970 a significant reduction in milk output so that Bord Bainne found themselves on a very sticky wicket towards the end of that year.  They were worried lest they might not be able to meet export commitments they had entered into.  A fortnight ago the stupidity of the multi-tier pricing system for milk really hit us between the eyes, so to speak, because Great Britain where our butter is commanding a higher price than the produce of any other country exporting butter to Britain, were looking for 30,000 tons of butter and we could not supply one pound.  This is a diabolical situation which further proves my original contention that there is a lack of long-term policy for the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>At Question Time last week I challenged the Parliamentary Secretary about this matter.  He attempted to get around it by saying that they could not forecast or foresee this development.  If we could not foresee it there is something radically wrong.  Surely our market research is sophisticated enough, or should be in a position to get advance <Col N="707" /> information of the market position and market trends in a country only a few miles across the Channel? If this had been the Malaysian or some such market there might have been some excuse for not being able to foresee this development.  We had an opportunity to supply 30,000 tons of butter to Britain a few weeks ago at top price and we could not do it.  I believe the downward trend in milk production will continue.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Blaney as Minister for Agriculture announced the multi-tier system I told him that I would advise dairy farmers to continue in milk production. I was confident that before one year had elapsed the stupidity of the multi-tier system and the stupidity of the decision to curtail milk production would have become obvious.  Unfortunately many dairy farmers have gone out of milk production and they have no intention of going back into it. I forecast that in 1971 there will be a further and more alarming decline in milk production.  We find, in 1971, the Minister for Agriculture coming in here with a two-page brief for a token Estimate. At the same time we find the farming community resorting to campaigns for an improvement in their incomes. Since I became a Member of this House nearly ten years ago I have spoken continuously about the dairying industry and never in those ten years have I seen the morale of the dairy farmer and of the people engaged in the industry at a lower ebb.</P>
    <P>This most important industry is now in a state of absolute chaos because the people in the industry, the farmer, his worker, the creamery employees, those engaged in the processing plants, do not know what the policy of the Government will be for 1971.  This is why I expected the Minister to give us some indication of what the Government's policy is to be for 1971 in relation to this industry.  As I say, I have never seen the morale of the people in the industry at a lower ebb, or seen the industry in such chaos, and I want to warn the Minister that it is absolutely imperative that he should immediately formulate a comprehensive, long-term plan for the industry.  I am not given <Col N="708" /> to making exaggerated statements here because I like to do my homework but I want to say that if such a policy or plan is not implemented in February or March&mdash;time is getting short now&mdash; the position in the dairying industry will decline still further and in three months time, or six months time, or at the end of 1971 we could find ourselves faced with a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this whole matter.  Apart from being a terrible indictment of the Government it is a national tragedy that when we are negotiating in regard to our entry into the European Economic Community the one major industry that has the capacity and potential to benefit from such membership finds itself in a state of utter chaos and confusion.  Despite the stop-gap measures of the Government and the lack of policy the industry has proved, by its performance in recent years, to be as good as the dairying industry in any other European country with which we will have to compete when we join the EEC.  In view of that surely the Government should have given special priority to the industry and ensured that when we enter EEC the industry will be fully geared, that the morale of the dairy farmers will be at the necessary high level and that we will be able to go into Europe with confidence in the ability of our farmers to produce top quality milk efficiently, with confidence in the ability of our creameries and processing plants to produce top quality products as good as any in Western Europe.</P>
    <P>Surely this consideration should have compelled any Government who realised the importance of agriculture to have a proper long term plan for dairying?  If more farmers go out of milk production what will happen to the industry?  What will those people in the export markets which we have built up so successfully in recent years for dairy products, think about our marketing board and about us if having gone to the trouble and expense of getting these markets we say tomorrow: &ldquo;Sorry, we cannot supply you&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>What will be the position in the livestock <Col N="709" /> industry?  What will be the repercussions and implications for our livestock exports and our beef and meat exports from a reduction in milk production? I say without fear of contradiction that the downward trend experienced in 1970 will be continued in 1971.  It is a serious situation and I appeal to the Minister to take immediate action regarding this position.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the Minister had only a two-page brief he did say that he would deal extensively in his reply with the points raised in the debate.  In the light of that statement I want to get his views on a number of other problems.  I am not as accurate as I used to be in matters relating to the dairying industry; this is one of the penalties of specialisation.  When one finds oneself on the Front Bench&mdash;and this applies to all parties&mdash;one has to specialise in particular aspects of the work of certain Departments.  There has been much talk in recent years about rationalisation and amalgamation of the creamery industry.  The subject has been bandied about, talked about, and written about, but no worthwhile progress has been made.  If one asks any dairy farmer what he thinks of amalgamation and rationalisation it is obvious that he does not want to hear about it.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from all that has been said and all the controversy that has been aroused, so many studies have been made on this subject and so many reports have been issued that it is impossible to keep track of them all.  I remember the survey team set up by the Department of Agriculture to examine the dairy products industry.  I remember the study carried out by Dr. Knapp.  There was much documentation issued by the IAOS and the various dairy organisations on this question.  American consultants, Messrs.  Cook and Sprague, were called in.  In the past year a committee was set up by the Minister to make final recommendations regarding amalgamation and rationalisation.</P>
    <P>This is an important topic and it is relevant to the points I have made regarding the need for long-term rational planning for the dairying industry.  We have wasted five or six <Col N="710" /> years just talking about it and so many people have said so many different things that persons connected with the dairying industry do not know what is the position.  It is obvious to anyone who knows anything about that industry that a certain amount of rationalisation is necessary and some amalgamation is essential.  Unfortunately the big blunder made was the attempt to implement almost overnight a major national blanket policy&mdash;the famous 19 points plan which was introduced some years ago.</P>
    <P>This scheme should have been carried out on a phased basis.  We should have identified the places where the need for rationalisation and amalgamation were so obvious that everyone could appreciate that need.  We should have started on a pilot basis and thus learned as we went along what were the economics of amalgamation and what benefits would accrue to the farming community.  We should have been able to tell the farmer how much extra money he would receive by agreeing to a policy of amalgamation. Instead of this a complete plan was thrown at the dairy farmers, and the impression was created that there would be 19 major creameries and the others would be closed.  Naturally this was rejected out of hand.</P>
    <P>This brings us to 1971 when we are facing entry into the EEC.  Any long-term planning in relation to the dairying industry must contain plans for rationalisation of the creamery industry. I do not know what are the Government's views on this important matter. I do not know what has happened to the study group that has been set up. If the Government, the IAOS, and other State and semi-State bodies concerned with this industry are convinced of the wisdom of amalgamation why do they not start with the Government's own semi-State company&mdash;the Dairy Disposal Board?</P>
    <P>On previous occasions I have pointed out an outstanding case that calls for amalgamation or rationalisation in the Knocklong group in County Limerick. In this instance there are six or seven small branch creameries attached to the Knocklong central creamery.  The average number of suppliers to each of <Col N="711" /> those creameries is about 40 and there are three such branches in one parish. I shall never understand why this was not used as a pilot project for rationalisation and amalgamation.  I hope when the Minister for Agriculture is replying to this debate that he will spell out clearly his views and tell us what decisions have been reached in regard to this problem.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go over every aspect of agriculture because I do not consider myself sufficiently informed or competent to make a detailed analysis of any sector other than the dairying industry.  In regard to the latter I have some specialised knowledge, or at least I am interested in the matter. One aspect of agriculture in which the Government have failed completely is in regard to the co-operative movement. I am a believer in co-operation as one who had the great privilege of having known the late Canon Hayes, the founder of Muintir na Tíre, and of having served in that organisation for a number of years before I became a Member of this House.  I realise the tremendous potential of the co-operative movement and I regret very much that in 1971 we still have not developed a formula by which we can apply the principles of co-operation down to farm level.</P>
    <P>However, there has been a slight development in recent times with the emergence of group farming.  I have spoken on this matter on a number of occasions in this House as I have had practical experience in this regard.  One of the first attempts at group farming in County Limerick was in the parish in which I lived.  I notice now the Land Commission are experimenting with the idea.  There are a number of farming groups.  I think they started in most cases as farm discussion groups.  I see Deputy Smith across the way.  There is a group in the Newport area and also one in Nenagh.  Looking at the traditional structure of the average small family holding, I have always believed that the only way this structure could have been preserved and the only way in which the maximum number of these small holdings could have <Col N="712" /> been made viable was through co-operation, through farming a number of small holdings as one unit, where mechanisation and other facilities could be availed of.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Gibbons, is also a keen advocate of the co-operative movement.  Over the last nine or ten years, in speaking on agriculture, in this House, he and I have been very much on the one wavelength in relation to the value of co-operation and the potential of the co-operative movement for the agricultural industry. I sincerely hope that, now that Deputy Gibbons is Minister for Agriculture, he will tackle this problem.  Whether we look on it as a problem of the west, the fact is that north, south, east or west, a substantial proportion of the farm holdings of this country are small family units.  Instead of talking about the west and putting forward all sorts of economic theories as a solution of the western problem or of the problem of small holdings, we should have tackled the problem in a practical manner by enabling small holdings to form viable groups.</P>
    <P>I advocated five or six years ago in this House that a specialised advisory service should have been established and that there should be in each county a number of advisers specialising in various aspects of agriculture.  I particularly appealed for the selection of at least one or two advisers from every county who would be sent away to be trained in the principles and practice of co-operative group farming.  The situation has improved.  I would not be so presumptuous as to say that the Department of Agriculture heeded my voice on this but the fact is that there is a move now towards the development of a specialised advisory service. However, the point I have been making is that it is far more important that an agricultural adviser should understand social and economic problems and that he should be trained in the best way of organising small farmers into groups than that he should have technical know-how and scientific knowledge.  I have made the same criticism of the Agricultural Institute, which is doing a fantastic job in pure scientific research and doing a bit of work in social research <Col N="713" /> and in research into rural economics in general.  However, the Department of Agriculture, the advisory services, the Agricultural Institute, the Faculty of Agriculture in the National University and the other university, have all fallen down completely in one fundamental respect, that is that they have all failed to carry out research into the economic, social and psychological problems which prevent groups of farmers from working together.  They have failed to advise on a proper formula for the efficient operation of group farming.</P>
    <P>Now that Deputy Gibbons is Minister for Agriculture I hope he will convert into practical reality the interest which he has expressed here in the House on many occasions in the co-operative movement and group farming, and that we can look forward before very long, and before several thousand more small holders have left the land, to having a proper scheme or plan which will make it possible for a group of farmers to work together and thereby make their own holdings individually more productive.  Unless we make an attempt to save the family holdings of this country we will eliminate the small holders and we shall end up with a nation of ranchers.  Everybody interested in the future of rural Ireland would hate to see this happen. I want to see the traditional family farming structure of this country made viable.  I am convinced it can be made viable and that the only way to do it is through the application of the principles of co-operation or through the system which has come to be known as group farming.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister back.  I am sorry he was not here five minutes earlier because I was referring to him in rather complimentary terms.  I was dealing with the co-operative movement and the fact that the Minister and I on a number of occasions here in debates on agriculture have seen very much eye to eye on the potential of the application of co-operation to farm production and so forth.  I hope the Minister will convert his belief and enthusiasm in group farming into reality.</P>
    <P>I do not want to monopolise the <Col N="714" /> time of the House, I see Deputy Cluskey is waiting patiently to speak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not many farmers in Dublin Central.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us say Deputy Cluskey is on the fringe of agriculture.</P>
      <P>I want to refer in passing to the question of agricultural research and the performance of the Agricultural Research Institute.  An agricultural research institute is of vital importance to any country where agriculture is a major sector of the economy.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment the Agricultural Research Institute has been the subject of much comment.  Some of these comments have been critical and others have been praiseworthy.  In the past I have expressed concern about the fact that the results of the research undertaken were not flowing as freely as they should be to the farming community. There appeared to be certain bottlenecks.  Over the last year or two there has been a considerable improvement and the results of the research now appear to be transmitted much more expeditiously to the advisory services and in turn to the farmers themselves. I feel I should say this as one who has been critical of the Agricultural Research Institute in the past.  I have been impressed by the prompt manner in which the Agricultural Institute have come to the assistance of people confronted with a special problem about an animal disease, about farm planning or about technical type problems and have sought specialist advice.</P>
      <P>I regard the establishment of veterinary research laboratories in regional areas, including the one in Limerick, as a step in the right direction.  I hope more such laboratories will be established because they are vitally important when one is confronted with a disease in a dairy herd or a livestock herd such as brucellosis which is a deadly scourge and terrifies all dairy farmers.  This veterinary laboratory in Limerick will be of great assistance to the Limerick region and adjoining counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to research generally I feel the Agricultural Institute should <Col N="715" /> turn its attention to research into rural, social and economic problems.  This is essential, confronted as we are with an alarming rate of depopulation in rural areas.  There is a rural economy division in the Research Institute which has done some research and independent research into social and rural problems is being carried out by universities and other groups.  I would like to see a continuous system of research into rural, social and economic problems. If this is not done, I cannot see how an effective rural development programme can be formulated or implemented.  It would not be a major task to bring the various research bodies together.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Government will have to decide what the future of rural Ireland is going to be.  They will have to decide what the future of the average family holding is going to be and what type of a rural community we want.  Having decided on that, large scale, comprehensive research will have to be undertaken before plans can be formulated to achieve those objectives.  This is a matter of extreme importance to which the Minister would do well to turn his attention.  It is related to the principles of group farming.</P>
    <P>What is wrong, and I say this as one who is sincerely interested in the welfare of rural Ireland, is that the problem of rural depopulation, rural development, the viability of the family holding and all the problems of the west appear to have been tackled by too many different groups and too many different people.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries should bring together all university and other groups which have undertaken research and assess what is being done and see what further research needs to be done. It should be possible in the course of one or two years to get a comprehensive picture of the best way to tackle rural development and family farm viability. If the Minister does this he will be doing a very good job.</P>
    <P>I am now going into something in which, in order to be able to speak with authority one would have to <Col N="716" /> have a professional qualification in psychology or sociology and so forth, but what I am trying to get at, is that the problem of rural development must be faced up to.  The major problem within that particular sphere of rural development is the future viability of the small family holding.</P>
    <P>I understand that the brucellosis eradication scheme is proceeding reasonably satisfactorily.  I wonder if it would be possible to accelerate this campaign.  Brucellosis is a deadly scourge.  In certain parts of the country, particularly the more intensive dairying areas, I understand the incidence of the disease is very high and there will be great problems encountered. When the Minister is replying, perhaps, he would be good enough to give some indication as to what progress, in fact, is being made with this scheme and whether there are any plans to accelerate it.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude with one or two grass roots problems.  I had a number of complaints from farmers that they are being left a long time awaiting payment for reactor cattle.  I also had complaints to the effect that the Department's buyers could, perhaps, use a little more flexibility in the matter of prices and so on.  However, the main complaint I have got&mdash;I had a number of such cases in the last few days&mdash;is the delay in payment for reactor cattle. A case that comes to mind is that of a man&mdash;I have made representations to the Minister about this&mdash;who sold a beast to the Department last November and he has not yet been paid.  There is a sum of £60, £70, or £80 involved.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's reply to the various points I have made particularly in relation to his plans for the dairying industry and in regard to rural development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to congratulate Deputy Gibbons on his appointment as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  He has always been very interested in agricultural affairs and I know he will now apply that interest in practical terms to the advantage of the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We often hear about the disparity <Col N="717" /> that exists in practically every country between agriculture and other sections of the economy.  The reasons for this are complex and deep-seated and there is no Government who do not wish to narrow the gap and ultimately to eliminate it but we should also remember that there are quite remarkable disparities within agriculture itself not only between large and small farms but between farms of approximately the same size.  There are marked disparities between the position of agriculture in fertile areas and the more unkind terrain of the west.  Even in a small country like ours there is a marked difference in the rate of agricultural expansion in Leinster and Munster, on the one hand, and Connaught and Ulster on the other.</P>
    <P>The main objective of agricultural policy in the First Programme for Economic Expansion introduced in 1958 was to maintain and intensify the upward trend in agricultural output on a sound economic basis.  Considerable progress had been made in achieving this objective by the time the Second Programme was introduced in 1964. The expansion envisaged for agriculture under the Second Programme depended to a very significant extent on the cattle industry and cow numbers; cattle output and milk output have all increased substantially.  The policies which have proven so successful under the two earlier programmes will be continued and further developed under the Third Programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when introducing his Estimates here in December, gave us a very detailed account of the activities of his Department during the past 12 months.  It is encouraging, indeed, to note that progress is being made in spite of what some people may think and I hope this progress will continue and the farmers will prepare themselves for the great challenges that lie ahead.  Our entry into Europe will, indeed, pose many problems for our Government and for our farmers but I am confident that these problems can be resolved by the Government and the farming organisations working together for the common good.  Some people ask what will become of the small farmer when we join the EEC. <Col N="718" /> They seem to forget that there are small farmers in the EEC also.  In fact the average size of the Irish farm is 45 acres compared with 27 acres in the EEC, two-thirds being under 25 acres. The agricultural provisions of the Rome Treaty and the proposals of the commission dealing with a common agricultural policy are something with which we can, I think, be in full agreement. The common agricultural policy is based on a system of fixed prices with variable levies on imports with the objective of raising farming incomes and maintaining the family farm. This is a very desirable objective as far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's Estimate I notice that a sum of £5,000,000 is provided for agricultural education, research and the advisory service.  This is one thing about which I feel very strongly.  I feel we have fallen behind in providing training for our young farmers.  The problem of agricultural education has been much more widely acknowledged in countries competing on our export market for food such as Denmark and The Netherlands than it has been in Ireland.  In these countries 70 per cent of the entrants to farming have undertaken a full-time course in agriculture, generally lasting from two to four years.  I am pleased to see that even at this stage we are taking a step in the right direction and centres are being provided for the education of our young farmers.  Education in itself is not a guarantee that high standards of managerial and business ability will be reached but it is a very vital ingredient in a successful and competitive agricultural business.  The increase in our exports from £155 million in 1968 to £163 million in 1969 is very encouraging and of the utmost importance to the national economy.  It is essential that this trend should continue and that our goods should be presented in first-class shape on the foreign market.  The store cattle trade is still our biggest source of income.  It was also encouraging to note that our quota of frozen, boneless beef to the US has increased to 30,030,500 tons.  The market for this product in other countries should be explored.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a scheme to <Col N="719" /> assist the shorthorn cattle trade is very laudable.  The numbers of this breed were declining in recent years.  This breed has served us very well in the past for beef and for milk and it is important that it should be preserved. The beef cattle incentive scheme has met with most enthusiastic response throughout the country.  The scheme will help considerably to increase the output of quality beef animals for export purposes and enable many dairy farmers to switch over to beef production. The scheme has a special appeal for the small farmer in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to discuss the various schemes introduced and operated by the Department of Agriculture.  Deputy O'Donnell, the last speaker, spoke at length about the dairying industry. There may be a serious position in the dairying industry but the difficulties in this industry are not confined to Ireland alone.  There is a milk surplus in Europe.  Some of the EEC countries are paying grants for the slaughter of cows.  The rationalisation of creameries would be desirable and of advantage to the milk suppliers, but I am afraid I do not know how this could be done.  I favour an increase in the price of milk provided it was fixed on a sliding scale. In this way the small farmer would stand to gain most.  Coming from an area where there are many small farms it is only natural that I should be fighting for the rights of the small farmer.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase announced recently for the extension of water supplies to farmyards.  This announcement is most welcome and will be of particular help in my area where so many group water supply schemes are being organised.  We all know that anyone supplying milk to a creamery needs a good water supply.</P>
    <P>Good progress is being made in connection with the brucellosis scheme.  I hope that in the near future County Galway will be included in this scheme because we are supplying a very large percentage of store cattle.  There is another aspect of agriculture which also needs to be developed to our advantage <Col N="720" /> and that is the horticultural industry.  There is great potential in this industry particularly for the smaller farmers.</P>
    <P>I notice that a grant of £400,000 is being provided for glasshouses in this Estimate.  This scheme is a very good one.  My information is that most of this money goes to people who are not involved in horticulture at all, such as hoteliers and business people.  This scheme could be utilised by the small farmers to their advantage.  It would give them additional income.  The Minister should look at this.  I mentioned this point to a former Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Erin Foods are doing a very important job in selling our goods on foreign markets.  Their method of presentation is very encouraging.  They have undertaken a very important task from both the national and agricultural viewpoints. Apart from the direct national benefits which will accrue from the successful development of their activities in foreign markets Irish food exporters will generally benefit from the successful distribution and sale of the company's products, because Erin Food products are directly associated through their brand name with this country.  I hope the company will continue their activities in the foreign markets to the advantage of us all.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that this debate would not have taken place until next week and that we would have had more time to prepare for it.  I wish to congratulate the Minister.  I hope he will continue his good work on behalf of the farming community in this country.</P>

      <P>It is not usual for a Dublin Deputy to speak on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture for the obvious reason that a man who was born and reared in Dublin has a very limited knowledge of agriculture. I am vitally interested in one matter which comes under the Minister's care.  I refer to the dead meat trade.  The dead meat trade has been very successful over the years and has given a considerable amount of employment to our people.  In the Dublin area alone there are approximately 3,000 people directly employed.  There <Col N="721" /> are many others indirectly employed, both men and women.  Most of these people are employed in the larger factories situated in and around Dublin and confined solely to the export market.  Many people employed in the export trade work in the Dublin Corporation abattoir.  Four or five years ago these people suffered a very severe blow which jeopardised their employment. The Department of Agriculture, without any consultation or prior warning, withdrew the licences for the export of dead meat from the Dublin abattoir to a number of European countries.  This was of vital concern to me then.  It was of importance to a large number of people living in my constituency who were former colleagues of mine when I worked in the Dublin Corporation abattoir.  I knew these people were solely dependent on this work for their livelihood.  After considerable trouble and difficulty we managed to reach agreement so that the trade could continue from the abattoir.  I want to avail of this opportunity to intervene in this debate and say to the Department that one would hope a situation such as that which arose some four or five years ago, through the direct action of a Government Department, which put so many jobs in jeopardy&mdash;and a considerable amount of our dead meat export trade comes from the abattoir&mdash;will never arise again and that there will never be a repetition of that performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people working in the abattoir &mdash;not only the employees but also the employers engaged in that trade&mdash;work under very considerable difficulties. One would expect, and, indeed, hope, that any help the Department could give these people, not only to maintain the existing trade but to expand it and to create more employment, would be readily forthcoming.  I mention this because I understand that a letter has been sent to all the licensees working in the export trade in the Dublin Corporation abattoir asking them to meet with officials of the Department in the coming week.  After the experience of these people some four or five years ago which I have outlined&mdash;and the letter does not state precisely what the meeting is about&mdash;this letter has caused a considerable amount of unease, to <Col N="722" /> put it mildly, amongst the exporters and, naturally, amongst the people who get their living from the export trade in the abattoir.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there will be a repetition of the behaviour by the Department some four or five years ago.  I sincerely hope, and, indeed, I believe, that the purpose of this meeting next week is to find out what difficulties are being experienced by the exporters in the abattoir, and to offer whatever assistance the Department can offer in order to maintain this very valuable export trade, and to ensure the continued employment of some 350 people.  With the announcement a few days ago of the Booth Poole closure&mdash; and a number of the workers involved live in my constituency&mdash;any ripples that might put it into people's minds that their own employment is not secure would be erased immediately.</P>
    <P>I hope the Department have learned from past experience and that the meeting which they have asked these people to attend is to ensure not only the maintenance but, if possible, the expansion of the export trade in the Dublin Corporation abattoir.  I am sure the Minister is interested in the employment of these people.  This is a matter that possibly has not come to his personal attention as yet.  I am sure he will acquaint himself with the details of the proposed meeting and ensure that this assistance will be forthcoming to these people and that the employment of the 350 people involved will be maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In my constituency we have quite a large number of small holdings.  The greater number of the farmers belong to the small farming community.  I am sorry to have to say it, but I can say it in all truthfulness, that the number of people who are going off the small farms today is alarming.  It is sad to see so many homes closed and so many lights gone out.  That is one thing we regret very much in that part of the country.  We must face facts.  Not enough attention is being given to the people in that community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that people cannot carry on today when the price they are getting for milk is the same as it was ten <Col N="723" /> or, perhaps, 12 years ago.  All costs are soaring.  The farmer must be very careful about his milk and how he handles it, if he wants to qualify for some of the extra payments that are made. Some of our good neighbours are very disappointed at the price of milk.  Were it not for some of the extra money which is paid at the end of the year, and other allowances paid per gallon for top-quality milk, practically nobody would be in that business.</P>
    <P>Nowadays people will not slave for seven days of the week and for about nine months of the year trying to earn a few pounds while a young lad of 17, 18 or 19 years of age can start work at £14, £16, or up to £20 a week and finish on a Friday evening.  Something will have to be done if we want the farming community to take any interest in their work.  No young farmer who sees his neighbour dressed up on a Friday evening to go to a dance&mdash;and he is a free man until Monday morning&mdash;will be satisfied with his own unhappy position unless he gets a very good reward for this work.  Unless a small farmer is very careful today he cannot possibly exist.  Down through the years, for generation after generation, the older people always said: &ldquo;The cow and the calf.&rdquo;  A very old man said one time to a young man: &ldquo;Joe, be careful in good times and bad times because you will never go very far wrong if you have the cow and the calf.&rdquo;  That is quite true.</P>
    <P>A change is coming.  I make no apology for saying that agriculture has been neglected.  In my part of the country there was very little drainage and very little attention is being given to the land.  In some cases now there is an awakening, but unfortunately it is too late.  There are very few to put their shoulder to the wheel and do a good job.</P>
    <P>Drainage has been sadly neglected. The Department at least should have sent their inspectors down to the country to see the conditions and try to do something about them.  In present conditions of high costs it has gone beyond the reach of individual farmers to do even small drainage jobs.  Ordinary farmers are not well mechanised.  After <Col N="724" /> a storm we are called to a meeting in the local village and we hear stories of total destruction of crops simply because no attention has been paid by the Department to farm drainage.</P>
    <P>This is probably outside the scope of the Supplementary Estimate but I avail of this opportunity once more to draw the Minister's attention to the serious hardship being caused to farmers because of lack of drainage.  If grants were made available to groups of more than two farmers much good work could be done in this field.  At the moment money is the main problem in the matter of drainage.  Farmers cannot drive cattle into fields or set the fields to hay or to crops because even if the land is reasonably dry in spring, after even a short rain storm there is complete destruction.</P>
    <P>I realise the Minister's hands are tied in this respect but as I have said he should send his inspectors down to areas such as mine, where all the farmers are smallholders, to see how the farmers are suffering.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about farmers going out on the streets to protest against the conditions in which they are forced to work.  My knowledge of farmers is that they usually do not protest until they are forced to do so. When they compare the return they get from their seven-day week with the incomes of industrial workers nobody should be surprised.  The Minister will find it very hard to get co-operation from those people unless he does something to improve their lot.  Recently the bank people closed the banks for six months and left everybody standing outside.  Whether the people had money or not the bank people did not mind. They kept the banks closed until they accomplished what they had set to get. When people of that status can leave towns, villages and cities standing idle for want of money, surely to God the hard working farming community are entitled to go out and protest, even to the point of coming to the city streets to do so.  They would have the sympathy of every TD, whether he be Fianna Fáil, Labour or Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>You had CIE workers paralysing the country in order to get their rights. ESB workers fought for their rights <Col N="725" /> and the Post Office people went out to protest and fight for their rights.  Therefore, I can see nothing wrong with the farming community going out publicly to ask that the returns from their hard work be improved.  Those people are slaving on the land with barely enough to keep them going.</P>
    <P>When the beef subsidy scheme came into operation, 25 per cent of the farmers, even in the richer areas where the Leas-Cheann Comhairle comes from and in Tipperary and other places, found that taxation and high expenses did not justify their participation. The Minister will find that there will be a much greater defection than 25 per cent this time.</P>
    <P>Within the last few months I was told that a group of four or five people intended to apply for special term bulls. I sent in a recommendation on their behalf and we got the usual acknowledgment. Now I discover that the Department's answer is that no bulls will be allocated because there is not sufficient demand for them.  Farmers faced with this situation, who cannot find a bull nearer than eight miles away, have to resort to keeping scrub bulls.  This is no way to help to improve our cattle.  The Minister should consider this matter carefully.  I can name four people who have been refused special term bulls and I ask the Minister seriously to re-examine the position. The leaders of the farming community who appeared on television recently presented the situation as it actually is.  If there is not some change in relation to agricultural policy, many more people will have to leave the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this subject was debated at length before the Christmas recess, there is very little left to be said concerning the original brief which the Minister read to the House.  Unfortunately, Deputy Keating who is our main spokesman on agriculture, will not be available until, perhaps, next week because he is engaged on the Public Accounts Committee.  However, it is important that the debate should continue until then because Deputy Keating is anxious to put some important <Col N="726" /> points before the House.  In the meantime, I should like to make one or two comments which the Minister may have heard before but if he has not heard them already, perhaps he would take cognisance of them.  One is in relation to the beef subsidy scheme. As the Minister is aware, when this scheme was introduced there was a dispute here concerning the first inspection date and I think it was my then colleague, Deputy Farrelly, who made the point that the date of the first inspection was too early.  Eventually, if memory serves me correctly, it was agreed that the first inspection be in late April or early May.  In fact, in most cases, the inspections were carried out up to the middle of May.  I am surprised that this year the date has been fixed as the 1st March.</P>
      <P>I have been making inquiries from members of the farming community as to what effect this might have for them and I have been surprised to find that, in their estimation, the change of date will result in reducing by about half the amount that the Government would otherwise have to pay by way of grants. I am sure that the Minister would not wish that to happen.  Therefore, I appeal to him to set the date for inspection at the 1st May, at the very earliest. Otherwise, the farmers will be at a great disadvantage.  In fairness to the farmers this change to the 1st March should not take place.  They have been taken advantage of in this case.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker referred to the recent appearance on television of members of the farming community. My only regret in relation to the programme was that it highlighted their differences rather than any unity that might exist.  While most of us would agree with what was said by a number of them, there was the usual narking backwards and forwards.  Some of them were representing organisations but others represented nobody other than themselves.  Certainly one or two of the people who appeared on the programme did not give the impression that the Irish farmer is prepared to fight for his rights and for nothing more.  It is a pity that the farming community cannot get together and seek their rights. If they did this, they would get a better hearing than they get now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> The Minister tells us that the amount paid to farmers by way of subsidies is in the region of £100 million.  I accept his word for that but we must remember that, because so many people must be paid out of that amount before it reaches the farmers, the farmers do not get anything like £100 million.  In my opinion the farmers, whether they be on a large scale or on a small scale, are not getting a fair return or fair consideration.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is the solution. Possibly a solution could be found in the setting up of a special farming committee who would advise the Government in relation to expenditure.  By a special farming committee I mean a committee appointed by the farmers and not a group hand picked by the Government or the Minister, a group that would be truly representative of the farming community and who would determine whether schemes put forward by the Government or individuals would work.  In that way, we would not have the present situation whereby schemes are tried for a time and then found not to produce what they were intended to produce or, as happened in one case, over produce.</P>
    <P>The farmers are prepared to admit that efforts have been made by the Government to assist them but if one speakes to them, he will sense a disillusionment on their part.  It has been repeated to me time and again that the Government do not seem to know what should be done.  Perhaps they do not know.  There is this stop-go policy but it would be much better for the farmers if they could be given an idea as to what they were likely to be asked to produce in abundance for a period of, say, five years and if they could be told what they were likely to get by way of prices during that period.</P>
    <P>There is confusion among farmers because of the various statements made in relation to what their future will be in Common Market conditions.  It is wrong for Ministers of State, whether at cumann meetings or in this House, to try to give the impression that everybody except those sitting in the Fianna Fáil benches, are out to destroy the farming community.  Nothing could be <Col N="728" /> further from the truth.  If the Government intend to remain in Office&mdash;personally, I should hope they will not&mdash; until such time as Ireland may be accepted as a member of the EEC, they are doing themselves a disservice by telling the farmers that they should gear themselves towards the production of a certain commodity because such commodity will result in plenty of money for them.  Those of us who have been making on-the-spot inquiries as to what is likely to happen to Irish agriculture if ever we go into the EEC, have brought back time and again the same story&mdash;that it will be no bed of roses.  The farmer should be told that. In view of the fact that it now appears as if, for political reasons, agricultural prices in the EEC were fixed originally at too high a level, the position now is that agricultural prices have not been increased for three years and it is quite possible that, if those who are running it succeed in doing so, they will try to hold prices at their present level for the next three or four years.  Eventually the falling value of money will catch up and, if we go in in five years time, the prices paid here may not be very much different from those paid in the EEC countries.  It is unfair that the farming community are not told that.  In my opinion, and in the opinion of my party which has carried out an on-the-spot investigation, that appears to be the situation.  Quite a number of hardworking farmers have got the impression&mdash;they quote Government Ministers as the source of this impression&mdash;that, if they go into the EEC, they are bound to get very much higher prices than they are getting now.  It is most unfair that they should be under any illusion.</P>
    <P>The Government have been criticised for the way in which they have been playing up and down the system of milk subsidies.  It should be evident to the Government now&mdash;I think it is evident, judging by the last change they made&mdash;that the system they adopted had the effect of considerably reducing the production of milk.  One of the things those of us who live in the country find somewhat peculiar is the fact that there is such a disparity in milk prices.  I notice the Minister says the consumer pays the price.  The difference between what the producer gets <Col N="729" /> and what the consumer pays is out of all proportion.  This should not be the case.  There is no reason why someone should get three times as much for taking milk from a stand, bottling it and distributing it, as compared with the man who keeps the cows, milks them and brings the milk to the stand. There is something radically wrong in the present system.  This is the sort of thing that disillusions farmers.</P>
    <P>The Government are entitled to interfere&mdash;I was told on another occasion that the Government did not want to interfere&mdash;in this sort of thing. Recently it was impossible to fill butter quotas at short notice because we had not got the butter required.  That might not be such a great hardship actually. I suppose, when people have a market, they like to keep that market but, remembering the losses sustained as a result of the price of butter, the fact that there is a shortfall may not be such a tragedy at all.  Recently I asked what had happened to the mountain of butter in the Common Market.  It was there on 31st March last year.  I was assured it had been disposed of. It took quite a few questions before I discovered that it was disposed of by selling it very much under cost and by turning the remainder into anything and everything, including fertiliser.  It was turned into chemicals for use on the land.  It was got rid of.  I cannot see those representing farmers in the Common Market welcoming anybody into the Common Market who also has a mountain of butter to be disposed of. For that reason I think a reduction in the quantity of butter produced might be a good thing.</P>
    <P>What will happen with regard to beet?  The Minister should make a comment as to whether or not there will be a future for beet growing here <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Common Market.  What will happen with regard to wheat?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that in a moment.  There has been in Europe a great deal of co-operation between farmers.  This is an excellent idea.  We do not seem to have got round to the same kind of co-operation here.  When I was a young lad there was a system <Col N="730" /> of swopping labour.  The small farmers swopped around at harvest time and they seemed to do reasonably well. There was no hard and fast rule except that the fellow who did not pull his weight was left out the next year.  By and large the system worked reasonably well.  It seems to have disappeared now and the amount of co-operation is nothing like as great as it was.  That is a pity.  Recently a decision was made to try co-operative farming in County Meath and three men were brought up there from County Kerry.  The local people were not consulted.  Indeed, this whole thing was such a great secret that even the local County Committee of Agriculture were not told about it. This was a mistake.  I do not blame the Minister, but the whole operation should have been discussed initially with the local Committee of Agriculture, which is responsible for advising on agriculture in the area, and then three good local farmers should have been invited to take part in this co-operative effort.  I hope it will be a success, but this kind of approach does not encourage others to follow the example set because they are not given an opportunity of studying things for themselves at first hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the fruit growers.  For a number of years the soft fruit growers had great difficulty in getting rid of their fruit and I headed many deputations from the Fruit Growers' Association to see officials of the Minister's Department.  The officials were always very courteous but they never seemed to be in a position to say straight out what was causing the trouble.  The growers alleged that fruit pulp was being imported and this was preventing them selling their fruit to the jam manufacturers.  The officials usually denied this.  Eventually I adopted the system of putting down a question here before the fruit season started to find out how much fruit pulp had been imported, from where, the price, <i>et cetera</i>.  Usually the answer was that no fruit pulp was taken in until the Irish fruit crop had finished, which would be round about now, and that it was not, in fact, damaging the sale of Irish soft fruit at all.  The farmers could never understand the position.  Even though there had been a fall in jam <Col N="731" /> consumption the farmers believed there must be some other reason why the jam manufacturers who, for generations, had bought fruit from them, ceased to do so.  The farmers were told that the manufacturers did not need the fruit or, if they offered to take it, they wanted it at a sacrifice price.  Last year I asked the same question and got the same answer.  I then asked about the import of jam.  Then the secret came out.  What was happening was a British firm which has a subsidiary here was importing jam from Britain.  They paid 4d a lb duty, but the tragedy is they put the soft fruit growers out of production. This is something which should not be allowed to happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not so many of them.  This was deliberate policy and I blame the Minister and his officials because, realising that, if we go into the Common Market, the sunnier countries in Europe will be able to produce fruit very much cheaper and better than we can, it was decided to apply as it were, a disincentive.  This was deliberate policy because someone must have known at official level what was happening.  This year those in my constituency who produced soft fruit, working seven days a week, have gone out of fruit production.  The number who have gone out of production is astonishing&mdash;perhaps not astonishing when one understands why.  If the Minister is serious about helping farmers, particularly small farmers, something should be done about this matter.  Perhaps I am unfair in putting it to this Minister now; perhaps he was not aware of this but I appeal to him before things become any worse to have the whole matter investigated and see what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to apples, it is usual if you go into any shop at any time of the year to ask for an apple to be offered a foreign apple, English or American or most likely, Canadian or Australian. You pay anything from 8d to 1s or perhaps 1s 1d for an eating apple.  Why is no effort made to build up the apple-growing industry?  Why is not some encouragement given to farmers to <Col N="732" /> pull apples, not shake them from the trees, and preserve them properly? The whole secret in my opinion lies in the way apples are handled when being pulled and afterwards.  I think the Irish farmers can grow as good fruit as any others even though they may not get as much sunshine as in some other countries.  Apples could be sold at a much lower price.  Children are being encouraged to eat fruit but if they have to pay 1s for an apple which may keep the doctor away, the parents in a working class family would be relying on the medical card to pay the doctor and they would be able to do that better than to pay 1s every day in the week for an apple for each child.  That is the situation. Perhaps the people selling the apples get a bigger cut out of foreign fruit.  If that is so, the Minister has the solution in his hands.  He should ensure that foreign produce is not allowed to compete with Irish produce to such an extent that people making their living out of it are put out of business.</P>
    <P>We always heard that Irish fruit and vegetables could compete or should be able to compete with anything in western Europe.  Apparently, that is no longer so and apparently fruit and vegetables are affected.  When you go into any supermarket particularly, and perhaps in some of the smaller shops at present, you find tinned carrots, tinned tomato and even tinned cauliflower. Any vegetable you name is there in a tin.  Because the vegetable is in small amounts and is all edible the price may appear tempting to housewives particularly those who have not much money to spend.  Is there any reason why in a small agricultural country such as ours the best vegetables should not be available to the consumers anywhere in the country at a reasonable price?  It is ridiculous that this sort of thing can be allowed to happen and I think the main cause is that the Department of Agriculture have completely ignored the problem saying: &ldquo;It is no problem of ours; let somebody else worry about it.&rdquo;  Anything that affects the farming community should concern the Department.  You now see even farmer's wives buying this stuff.  It would be much better if farmers were encouraged to grow vegetables which <Col N="733" /> could be sold at a reasonable price and bought at a reasonable price.  I ask the Minister, if he takes any interest in this, to ensure that the middle man does not treble the price and therefore put this produce off the table.  I think that is what happens and that this is one of the reasons why the present situation has built up.</P>
    <P>The same thing is happening with potatoes.  You can get not only powdered potatoes which, with the addition of water turn into something like potatoes&mdash;whether it is good for the stomachs or not I do not know: it produces a type of mashed potato&mdash;but also peeled potatoes in tins, preserved and imported here.  It is rather stupid that that is the position.  Very often, and particularly in country villages, you find that the bag of potatoes or whatever quantity is bought turns out to have more than half of it uneatable, black.  There should be some regulation to stop that.  I know one rather large firm which is sending potatoes to Dublin and out of the country, first-class potatoes, and they are selling potatoes in this particular place themselves. If you go there to buy a bag of them once you will not go again because while the price appears to be reasonable the potatoes are absolutely uneatable.  This sort of thing gets a bad name for Irish agricultural produce and it puts the housewife off and she, in the main, is the buyer of vegetables.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that potato crisps seem to be doing well and absorbing much of the Irish potato crop.  Otherwise, I do not know what would happen because I believe it is only a short time until we see Irish potato production going down like cabbage, cauliflower and everything else.  Production will continue to drop until eventually we, an agricultural country, will be in the main importing even potatoes which is rather like importing coal to Newcastle&mdash;I believe they did that recently also.</P>
    <P>We had an arrangement that no tomatoes would be allowed to be imported until a certain time of the year.  I was told, and I raised the matter with the Minister some time ago, that Spanish tomatoes had found their way in here and were being sold in boxes marked <Col N="734" />&ldquo;Irish tomatoes&rdquo;.  If this sort of racket is allowed to continue it will damage the tomato market and this will go the same way as everything else.  The Irish tomato has a particular flavour and personally I think there is nothing to beat it.  An effort should be made to protect the tomato grower.  It is rather a pity that sometimes the price seems to be high but I believe there can be a very good market for the Irish tomato if proper attention is given to it.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Institute are doing a fine job and their experimental work is something for which everybody in the farming community should be grateful.  In other countries farming co-ops&mdash;the larger ones, at any rate&mdash; are carrying out the work that the Agricultural Institute is doing here. When we have not farming co-ops on the same scale, if we have them at all, the Agricultural Institute should be entitled to as much co-operation from the Department as they need.  No matter what it costs to have that Institute continue to do its work the money should be made available to them. They seem to be a group of dedicated people who know their job and are determined to give good value for any money given to them.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of agriculture has suffered a great deal of damage and that is land drainage.  I do not know whether it was a decision or whether it just happened that way.  I was told some time ago that the number of inspectors available for this work was not as large as it should be and if inspections could not be carried out the drainage could not be done.  If the drainage is not done the pipes are not needed.  We know that one pipe factory has closed down and that another, employing members of my trade union, is on a three-day week for two reasons, one, the starting of the big mechanical pipe factory in Castlecomer and the second, that even in the area in which they do operate and had a market they cannot get the land inspected so that the work can be done.  Therefore, the pipes are not needed and a chain reaction is set up which, again, is putting people out of employment and leaving land in a bad condition.</P>
    <P>I note that at present the NFA have <Col N="735" /> decided to cut down on the use of lime on farms.  In my opinion this is a mistake because they are doing harm to themselves as well as to the people who produce lime and to the hauliers who haul it.  I would appeal to them that whatever they do they should ensure that they are not doing harm which will be difficult to repair.  For many years the land was starved for lime and over the last number of years it has been improved and I would hate to see the situation being reversed.  Possibly the campaign they are running is only for a short time but whether it is long or short I feel, while I do not want to intervene in their internal arrangements, that they should not continue it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, Arising from statements made in the Dáil yesterday the Committee of Public Accounts have asked me, with your indulgence to make the following statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Dáil in referring to the Committee the examination of certain expenditure instructed the Committee to furnish a separate report on it as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to comply with this instruction the Committee decided to proceed with the examination of witnesses with all expedition.  In this connection, it was brought to their attention that the Official Reporting Staff available was not adequate to report concurrent sittings of the Dáil and Seanad and of the Committee.  In the circumstances the Committee conveyed to the House authorities their wish that arrangements should be made to provide adequate staff to enable the Committee to proceed with their business even if necessary by recruitment from outside <Col N="736" /> the country, and that any necessary sanction for this course be sought from the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Committee understand that the Minister gave sanction for the employment of such staff as were necessary and that when it was not found possible to recruit staff in Ireland, arrangements were made at the instance of a London agency.</P>
    <P>The Committee have no powers in relation to the engagement or conditions of employment of staff, including matters relating to the Official Secrets Act.  These are matters, they understand, for the House authorities and for the Minister for Finance.  The concern of the Committee is that they should be enabled to comply with the instructions of Dáil Éireann.</P>

There was one other area where, for a short period, there was an excess of bacterial content in the sea water.  In the other areas the bacterial content was well below what was regarded as the safety level.  It is on that I have to base my decisions in regard to my communications to the Dublin Health Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no evidence that the level of interest rates currently prevailing has been detrimental to trade expansion. The relevant financial factor in the development of trade and industry at present is more the availability of sufficient capital than the interest rate. The guidelines of the Central Bank to the commercial banks provide that in the allocation of credit priority should be given to productive investment and I am satisfied that this is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that the demand for capital exceeds the supply.  If interest rates were brought down artificially, there would be less incentive to <Col N="744" /> save and less capital would be available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate charged here is very largely influenced by the commercial considerations.  I agree, in so far as it is closely related with Britain, that it is at present somewhat above the level that might be indicated by commercial considerations, but only slightly.  There are variations in different countries in Europe but in those cases there is much less free movement of capital than exists between this country and Britain so that effectively the rate charged here is very closely related to the rate charged in Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the amount of allowance given for protective clothing to workers under PAYE; the date on which this amount was fixed; and if it is proposed to consider increasing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no statutory amount of allowance given for protective clothing to workers under PAYE. <Col N="746" /> Under existing law an employee can claim a tax deduction for any expenditure which he is obliged to incur &ldquo;wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of&rdquo; the duties of his office or employment.  While expenditure on normal clothing would not be allowable, a deduction can be claimed in respect of necessary expenditure in respect of protective clothing.</P>
      <P>As a matter of administrative convenience, flat-rate allowances are given to various classes of employees with common working conditions, as representing a round-figure estimate of the deduction for expenses to which the employees concerned would be entitled under the Income Tax Acts.  These flat rate allowances which, <i>inter alia,</i> cover expenditure in respect of protective clothing have been agreed with representatives of the employees&mdash;usually the trade unions concerned&mdash;and they vary according to the type of work carried out in the course of employment.</P>
      <P>If it is thought that the flat-rate allowance in respect of a particular group of employees with common working conditions is not adequate, the question of increasing it will be considered by the Revenue Commissioners if the matter is taken up with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the usual flat rate allowable to an ordinary manual worker is about £8 and that that represents £2 2s per year? Further, is the Minister not aware that the statement that it has been agreed on with representatives of the employees is hardly correct because while representations were made on a number of occasions no discussion on this matter has taken place with the Revenue Commissioners or with the Minister for many years?  Would the Minister not agree that this is so and make some effort to bring it up to a realistic figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With regards to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary he is not correct, because the allowances in the case of manual workers, which as I said, vary from occupation to occupation, range between £5 and £20 per annum.  With regard to the second part of the <Col N="747" /> supplementary, it is true that in some cases it is quite a number of years since the figure was fixed.  However, in these cases, as I have indicated, if an approach is made to the Revenue Commissioners the matter will be considered again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am aware of this.  The situation is that in many instances the Land Commission can act very promptly in relation to the division of land but in other cases where there are considerable problems in relation to title and so on, there are long delays.  This is not the fault of the Land Commission.  In my experience it is very often the fault of the people who own the land in not sending in the information requested by the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>As the Deputies are no doubt aware recent salary proposals have been accepted by both the INTO and the VTA and are due to be ballotted on next Tuesday by members of the ASTI.  That being so I will confine myself to referring to two misapprehensions under which apparently many teachers in secondary schools labour and to allaying any fears they may have in relation to them.  Firstly, the various Associations of Secondary School Managers have made their position in relation to appointments to posts of responsibility clear and have indicated unequivocally that there is no foundation for any feeling that lay secondary teachers will not receive their due share of these appointments.  Secondly, any question of secondary teachers on joining a joint scheme of conciliation and arbitration being outvoted by other teaching groups does not arise.  Any teaching group is entitled to bring in a claim under that scheme and to have it processed right up to a hearing by an independent arbitrator and no group or groups can prevent another group from proceeding to arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>While we welcome that clarification I take it from the form of the Minister's reply that he does not wish to say anything about the terms of the proposal which is now being ballotted at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I could expand&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to press the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a little further perhaps, not on these specific proposals, but on the general situation.  One of the great difficulties I find in regard to the problem generally is that those who are not directly involved in it tend to over-simplify it, either because of the manner in which it impinges on their own particular situation, and this is understandable, or because it permits them to come up with what may appear to be an excellent solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I might paraphrase part of a <Col N="761" /> leading article which appeared in one of our daily papers recently it might explain what I mean.  This leading article said that the Minister had stated that no solution could be found which did not include the three teaching bodies.  It also said that while there was some merit in this, nevertheless this was not the immediate problem.</P>
    <P>What it did not recognise was that if I attempted unilaterally to solve the problem in relation to one group I would have an immediate problem in relation to the other two groups the following morning.  At this moment I feel that those who were not convinced of the fundamental truth of what I was saying in relation to the three teaching bodies have every reason to be convinced now because in the last fortnight they have seen the reaction of the various groups.</P>
    <P>I would like again to stress that a solution to this very serious situation must involve the three teaching bodies. Since I first began to deal with this matter one and a half years ago £650,000 has been added to teachers' salaries.  I have made my final offer and I feel it would be very wrong of me to allow anyone to be under any misapprehension on that point.</P>
    <P>I was asked on one occasion by a member of the standing committee of ASTI in the course of discussions which we had, if I were satisfied that the present scale of salaries for graduate teachers was satisfactory.  My reply was that, recognising as I do the fundamental importance of education to the wellbeing of the nation and the great contribution made by all teachers that it is very doubtful if any country could pay teachers sufficiently for their services but the Government, when allocating funds, had to take into consideration all the other sections of the community.  I pointed out that we were paying salaries to our teachers which were considerably in excess of the salaries paid to teachers in Britain and Northern Ireland and I felt that was an earnest of our goodwill in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to add that although the present discussions have ended this does not mean an end to salary negotiations. A joint scheme of conciliation <Col N="762" /> and arbitration is available to teachers and discussions can take place between the various bodies concerned as to the most acceptable form that this can take.  I am aware that the ASTI have rejected the joint conciliation and arbitration scheme already in existence, but I now know that this particular scheme was widely misunderstood by them at the time and that is what I referred to in my reply.  They were of the opinion that they could not go to arbitration should conciliation break down unless they had the consent of the other two teaching bodies.  This, of course, is not the case as I have already stressed in my reply.  I think I should also say this: my greatest worry particularly knowing the intricacies of this problem is that if the secondary teachers should go on strike it would be almost impossible to reach a solution. We know how difficult it is to reach a solution in an atmosphere which is relatively calm.  How much more difficult is it likely to be in a strike situation?  Bearing in mind that the three teacher bodies must be involved and that substituting one strike for one or two other strikes is no solution, I can only hope that the wisdom of an orderly approach will be obvious to everybody.</P>
    <P>I would be very grateful to the news media if they would underline the points I have made here.  I am very anxious about this whole matter.  It is very clear to me and I think to the other Deputies on all sides of the House who are in very close touch with the matter that it is a very difficult one, that it is one which must be solved by the three teaching bodies together and that, difficult as it is now, it would be very much more difficult in a strike situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if, in the event of this offer being accepted, arbitration is immediately available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if I might say this to the Leader of the Opposition: if the proposals are accepted I would imagine that the first thing the secondary teachers would wish to do would be to discuss with the other two teaching bodies and with the Department <Col N="763" /> the type of conciliation and arbitration to which all of them could agree.  They had some objections apart from the one I mentioned, to this particular scheme.  They could immediately then go into conciliation and if this did not produce the result they desired the ASTI, if they so wished, could themselves go on to arbitration.  They could insist on having the matter brought to arbitration and this would be done as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I be clear on this?  The ASTI can on their own go on to arbitration but can they on their own go into conciliation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course any teaching body which wishes can bring any relevant matter before conciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There are two other questions I want to ask the Minister arising out of his helpful statement and we all share his hopes that this thing will be regulated without further difficulties.  First of all, could I ask whether his reference to graduate teachers and to the door being open of course to further claims&mdash;because this does not end the whole question of salary increases&mdash;could this be interpreted as meaning that claims for improvements in degree allowances for graduate teachers which are, I think. arguably, very inadequate, would be regarded with sympathy in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer not to go into detail on these matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but anything about which a teaching body feels aggrieved can certainly be brought before conciliation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, I shall not press that further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>What would worry me in this instance is that I do not want to make a statement on this and then have it said afterwards that I put limitations to certain aspects of the discussions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. The only other question is that the <Col N="764" /> Minister made a reference to the agreement of the managers to equitable distribution of posts of responsibility.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if the particular points the Minister has made this afternoon in public have been conveyed to the three organisations. I do not think it is unfair to comment that the current prospects ballot-wise seem extremely difficult and certainly, if I may say so on a personal basis, I wish to see a unified conciliation and arbitration system evolving and I have no desire to make any political capital out of this apart from the particular point that has to be made that retribution has come in the context of what was entered into in 1969 and it has cut more ways than one.  I am not directing this against the present Minister but I would ask him would it also be possible for him to circulate the terms of the proposals to interested Deputies here because it is extremely difficult for us to discuss the matter internally in our own parties without formally having the proposals before us.  Bearing in mind that it is an industrial relations matter, it is taken to be not our function but as public <Col N="765" /> representatives we do have the right to the information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if any consideration has been given to the abolition of the levy on wheat and its replacement by a scheme whereby wheat for milling purposes would be grown on a variety basis recommended by his Department and if he will introduce a special commercial price to encourage the further usage of home grown wheat for the manufacturing of animal foodstuffs so as to offset the importation of approximately £9 million worth of animal foodstuffs every year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>The levy arrangement under which wheat growers meet the cost of disposing of surplus production for animal food was introduced originally by agreement with the growers as an alternative to a contract system for milling wheat.  This arrangement has operated satisfactorily over the past two years and apart from the immediate difficulties in operating a special scheme for growing wheat for milling purposes as suggested by the Deputy, any such scheme would not be acceptable under Common Market regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he considers the present arrangements desirable and in the interests of the economy in view of the importation <Col N="767" /> of £9 million worth of foodstuffs which could be offset by the application of the scheme I have mentioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two factors in the Deputy's supplementary question.  One is that there are obviously certain disadvantages in the present system in that to a certain extent it imposes a reduction in price on the smaller growers who are least in a position to take such a reduction whereas the bigger operator can stand it better.  On the other hand, the operation of a contract system would, in itself, give rise to possibilities of unfair practice in the allocation and it would also be an infringement on the right of any farmer to grow wheat if he wanted to.  As regards the second part of the supplementary, there was, in fact, an increase of about 10 per cent&mdash; I am speaking from recollection&mdash;in barley acreage in the 1970 season but there was a drop of a similar amount in yield and that is the only reason why there was a shortfall in animal feed in the last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I do not advocate a contract system when I advocate the growing of wheat on a variety basis which is a different thing from growing it on a contract basis.  This growing of wheat on a variety basis is recommended by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the fact that certain new varieties of wheat are being developed at the present time which may make it possible for the division of wheat growing into bread wheat and animal feeding wheat, but I do not think that the number of the new varieties or their performance are sufficient at the moment to broach the subject just now.  I know that there is a distinct possibility that new heavy animal feed wheats are in the process of production.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned in answer to previous questions, the Commissioner, with the assistance of the Garda Research and Planning Unit, is carrying out a comprehensive review of strength distribution throughout the country.  One of the major factors which the unit has to bear in mind is the increase in crime in Dublin.  Pending completion of the review, I am not in a position to say what recommendations will be made for the policing of Dublin.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, however, every effort is being made to cope with the increase in crime.  In the past four years, an extra 253 gardaí have been allocated to the Dublin Metropolitan Area, the number of Garda cars and motor cycles has been increased by 24 to a figure of 136 and there has also been a considerable improvement in radio communication systems.</P>

      <P>When does the Minister hope that this study will be carried out in view of the fact that in the past two years there has been an increase in the number of offences in the country of 5,441?  The detection rate in Dublin has dropped 48 per cent.  In 1969, in Dublin 15,270 offences were committed and the detection rate is only 48 per cent.  Does the Minister not think that his answer is completely unsatisfactory and entirely too vague?</P>

      <P>A number of interim recommendations were made from time to time by this Research and Planning Unit with regard to specific areas throughout the country, including parts of Dublin.  Then the difficulty was found that taking <i>ad hoc</i> measures in respect of small or limited areas was most unsatisfactory because, on a broader view being taken later, it was sometimes found advisable to change the <i>ad hoc</i> measure that had been taken as a result of the interim report. Accordingly the Research and Planning Unit now feel that it is better for them to look at complete areas and not to make interim recommendations in respect of specific districts.</P>

      <P>I am not clear whether the Deputy intends the term County Cork to include the city but the position is that most of the crime in the Garda Divisions of Cork is in fact committed in the city area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that it is correct to say that in Cork, as in other parts of the country, indictable crime is increasing. The detection rate in relation to crimes against property in Cork has fluctuated very much in the last few years though the average figure is good.  However, the gardaí have been concerned about the most recent <Col N="781" /> trends, even though firm figures are not yet available, and they have recently held special conferences to devise ways and means to improve the situation.  They hope that this will produce results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest period for which these crime statistics are available is up to 20th September last and, as the statistics have already been compiled on the usual annual basis, I am not in a position to give a six month figure.  The number of undetected larcenies and housebreakings in Limerick for the entire year ended 30th September last was 140.  As this represents a detection rate of 79 per cent, which is high for an urban area the size of Limerick, I cannot accept the implication in the question that the present system is defective.</P>
      <P>The question of the relative merits of the garda on the beat, as against the use of the patrol car, in any particular area is, as I pointed out to the Deputy in reply to a question on 25th November last, a matter primarily for the judgment of professional policemen. I said also on that occasion, and repeat now, that I accept the commissioner's advice that the police needs of Limerick city as a whole are best served for the time being by the methods now in operation.</P>

      <P>I assume that the question refers to the fact that since May 1970 five instances have occurred in which persons living alone have had money and some other property taken from their homes in the West Waterford area.  However, in one of these cases there was no question of personal violence.  In the others, generally speaking&mdash;I do not want to particularise since the matter may become an issue in court proceedings&mdash;the expression &ldquo;brutally beaten up&rdquo; would not be justified but of course when a person is living alone, especially an old person, even a suggestion of violence can be extremely terrifying.</P>
      <P>There has been one acquittal and one conviction in one of these cases, but the conviction is being appealed against.</P>
      <P>Extra gardaí have already been sent to the area and other special measures have been taken by the gardaí in this and adjoining areas.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the people in West Waterford have been living in fear for a number of months past and that there seems to be a breakdown of law and order in the area due in the main to the inadequacy of gardaí supervision? In the circumstances, can the Minister assure the people concerned they will be protected in their lives and property, an assurance they have a right to expect from the Minister for Justice?</P>

      <P>Since May last there have been five robberies at night in this area and the steps which the gardaí have taken and which I referred to in a general way are that an additional inspector and sergeant have been allocated to Dungarvan and two extra <Col N="783" /> uniformed gardaí and one extra detective have been allocated to Ardmore. In addition, a patrol car had been assigned to Ardmore.  It is only fair to say that the considerable influx of gardaí shows the serious way in which the Garda regard these incidents, and shows the great trouble they are going to in order to solve these crimes.</P>

Is the Minister not further aware that the lack of supervision in the area has been very largely attributed to the closing of small Garda stations and to the extension of the activities of the already depleted Garda force who, with the application of the recent recommendations in regard to conditions of employment, can have only a quarter of the force utilised at one given time? What has the Minister done about recruitment to end this growing incidence of crime which is not only applicable to Waterford but which extends to all areas?</P>

As far as I know, up to a few days ago there was not a prosecution and the reason there was not a prosecution is that the gardaí had insufficient evidence to prosecute anybody. If the local people who, no doubt, would be able to help the gardaí are prepared to do so, the gardaí would prosecute at once.</P>

      <P>The statement by the Deputy to the effect that the recommendations of the Conroy Commission are not being implemented is ludicrous. Every important recommendation of the commission has been implemented, most of them have been in effect for the past eight or nine months.  The few recommendations not yet implemented are of comparatively little importance and affect only a small number of members of the Force.  The Deputy seems to imply in his question and in his supplementary that there is an obligation to give overtime as it were and to pay for overtime.  I cannot accept that.  It is not a recommendation of the Conroy Commission.  There was no question whatever of granting overtime.  In cases where it is necessary to work overtime, the Conroy Commission suggested that the overtime be paid for if it could not be compensated for within the following three months.

      <P>Young persons, that is to say, persons between 15 and 17 years, may not be sent to prison by a court unless the court certifies that they are of so unruly a character that they cannot be detained in a place of detention, or of so depraved a character as not to be fit to be sent to a place of detention. Likewise, they may not be transferred to prison from St. Patrick's Institution unless the visiting committee recommends it in a particular case on the basis that the person concerned is incorrigible or is exercising a bad influence on other inmates.</P>
      <P>At present, there are seven young persons, all males, in Mountjoy Prison. The reason for detention in all cases is that the court certified that they were of so unruly a character as not to be fit to be sent to a place of detention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the continued hardships affecting citizens of Dún Laoghaire Borough who have to travel to the Dublin District Court to transact licensing cases, children's cases, civil matters, landlord and tenant cases, <i>et cetera</i>, because of the failure to set up a local district court in Dún Laoghaire which could also service the South County Dublin area; and if he will make a statement in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there are conflicting views on the merits of establishing a district court with full jurisdiction in Dún Laoghaire.  In particular such a proposal would run counter to the unanimous recommendations of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.</P>
      <P>As of now, I personally favour having a court with full jurisdiction in Dún Laoghaire which, in addition to serving the present area, would also serve adjoining areas in South County Dublin.</P>
      <P>However, there are complicated issues involved.  For example, the removal of the Dún Laoghaire area from the Dublin Metropolitan District would have some serious side-effects on the status of the area in the context of the licensing laws, and amending legislation would be necessary to preserve the present status.</P>
      <P>I hope to reach a firm decision in principle at an early date.  However, it will be clear from what I have said that there must be some delay in implementing any decision involving the removal of the area from the Dublin Metropolitan District.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision but I ask him if he would <Col N="793" /> accept that at present there is inflicted on the public generally as well as on members of the Garda Síochána very considerable inconvenience and hardship because there is no district court sitting in Dún Laoghaire?

      <P>I have told the Deputy what are the difficulties.  Legislation would be necessary because of licensing laws but, as I said, personally I favour it.  It is not correct for the Deputy to say that there is no district court sitting in Dún Laoghaire.  One sits several days a week but it is limited to a certain type of jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>Very well.  I will go through their qualifications.  Three represent the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee; they have been co-operating with the authorities in the institution to a very great extent.  One is there because he is a trade union official of the No. 9 Branch of the Workers' Union of Ireland, Guinness Branch.  Another is there because he is a trustee of the Shankill Youth Club; another is there because he is the secretary of the Shankill Youth Club and a member of the Bray Youth Council.  The lady is there because she is a doctor.  The next gentleman is a personnel officer and the last gentleman <Col N="795" /> is there because he is the chairman of the Shankill Residents' Association.  I think they are all adequately qualified.</P>

      <P>I assume that what the Deputies intend to refer to is the testing of blood or urine samples by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  The breathalyser is used to detect the presence or absence of alcohol not to measure it.</P>
      <P>I understand that up to 21st January, 1971, the bureau had examined 191 samples in all, of which 178 showed the presence of alcohol in excess of the prescribed limit.  The corresponding figures for the period from 21st December, 1970, to 21st January, 1971, are 69 and 67.</P>
      <P>To ascertain the number of cases in which convictions have followed the finding of the presence of alcohol in excess of the prescribed limit it would be necessary to address an inquiry to the gardaí at local level throughout the country.  The value of the information would not be worth the expenditure of resources that would be required to assemble it, particularly in the light of the fact that the taking of samples by doctors was suspended throughout most of the country shortly after the system was introduced in November, 1969, until December, 1970, and, accordingly, in a good proportion of cases the court proceedings have not yet concluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of allegations that a large number of land and estate agents, auctioneers and developers seem to have full access to the maps and explanatory memoranda of the draft Dublin County development map; if he is aware of the actions of land speculators moving in for purchases of land in such draft designated areas; and what legislative action he proposes to take to prevent and/or recover such speculative gains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that allegations have been made that copies of the proposed second draft development plan for County Dublin may be in the hands of persons who may not be entitled to have them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the county council that copies of the maps and written statement which comprise the proposed draft plan were supplied to the members of the council who are at present considering the draft proposals prior to publication in the normal way, that no copies of the proposed draft plan have been made available to any member of the public by the County Planning Department, and that in view of the fact that allegations have been made that copies of the documents are in the hands of unauthorised persons it was thought advisable to have the matter fully investigated by the garda authorities; this is at present being done.  I understand that the meetings of the council at which the contents of the proposed draft have been discussed, <Col N="801" /> have been held in public and that representatives of the Press were free to attend.</P>
    <P>I have no information about any transactions in land in County Dublin which might be attributable to disclosure of the contents of the proposed draft plan.  I would remind the Deputy that at this stage the designation of lands for development can have no more effect than the publication of the previous draft plan.  A revised draft plan has yet to be officially adopted. It must be put on public display and objections must be considered before any development plan is formally adopted. I need hardly point out that there may be changes.</P>
    <P>On the general subject of building land prices, the Deputy will know that I recently announced the appointment of a committee, under the chairmanship of a High Court judge, to examine all aspects of the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that inevitably where draft development plans of a fairly hard and final nature are made available to a substantial number of persons, whether public representatives or otherwise, a great deal of speculation evolves around land values of particular zoned areas?  Would the Minister agree that even if legislative action is now contemplated by him or by the Government, inevitably the door has been left open and gains have been made of a substantial speculative nature?  I put it to him, for example, that in South County Dublin land changes hands at £500 per acre and on that basis some people have made quite substantial fortunes.  This is all based on information coming from local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The County Planning Department did not make the draft plans available to any member of the public.  They were given to the members of the council and they were asked to keep the contents to themselves. The making available of information regarding future zoning and development for certain areas as contained in the revised draft plan should not have a great effect on land values because it would follow fairly generally the principles laid down in the previous draft <Col N="802" /> plan.  The local authorities sanitary services programme is fairly well publicised. Generally, I think the Deputy would accept that this type of activity on the part of speculators is very hard to avoid because it would be impracticable, I think to expect that the information could be kept secret, especially as the Press were allowed to attend the meetings and the matter is discussed in public and the councillors who represent members of the public naturally would be interested to discuss the contents with the people they represent and to have their point of view and to carry that point of view to the discussion table when the plan is being discussed by councillors.  Generally, although I accept that there could be a tendency on the part of some speculators to try to benefit, there is no great evidence that they have in fact benefited from such disclosures as the Deputy alleges.  The matter was put in the hands of the Garda when it was discovered some documents were missing and that is being investigated.  I do not think there is very much more that I could do to prevent the type of occurence which the Deputy is inquiring about.</P>

    <P>Extensions to the Kinnity water supply and Kinnity sewerage scheme were originally designed to be carried out as one project.

      <P>The problem of unfinished estates is essentially a matter to be dealt with locally.  As I explained in my reply to a question by Deputy P.J. Burke on 26th November, 1970, I feel that the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, went as far as possible in enabling planning authorities to apply enforcement powers to older estates developed on the basis of planning permissions granted before the 1963 Act came into operation. Where it has become clear that these enforcement powers are not going to provide a solution in certain cases, it is a matter for the planning authority concerned to take such other measures as are open to them to deal with the cases.</P>

The figure of 4,190 applications, referred to by the Deputy, is the total number of existing applicants, other than elderly persons, who had been approved, or were likely to be approved, by the corporation for inclusion in their revised housing list. The report does not indicate the total number of persons in families comprising the 4,190 applications.  It is not possible to give this number, since the figure of 4,190 includes an estimated 490 cases in course of inspection by the corporation.  In any event, the total number of persons in the families on the approved waiting list varies constantly.</P>
      <P>I have not received an estimate from the corporation of the number of dwellings which they expect to have completed in 1971 and 1972.  At the 31st December, 1970, the corporation's housing programme comprised a total of 19,132 dwellings to be built or sites to be developed.  In their weekly tenancy programme at that date they had 1,956 dwellings in course of erection or about to commence; 5,953 dwellings were at planning stage; and sites had been or were being acquired for a further 9,315 dwellings.

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Last August, by public advertisement, I invited manufacturers and contractors in the building industry to submit to me proposals for dwellings which would offer significant economies in cost on the basis of guaranteed orders over a period of years.  Because of the continued rise in building costs, I felt that positive action to secure economies of cost on a national scale was called for, apart from the various measures which I had already in train such as the co-ordination of component manufacture on a modular basis, the encouraging of smaller type houses by alterations in the grant system, the preparation of standard plans for use by persons wishing to build their own houses, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My intention in issuing the advertisement was to give contractors and manufacturers the opportunity to propose <Col N="813" /> the type of dwelling unit which they could provide on the most economical basis.  An outline performance specification was made available to ensure that any proposals put forward would comply with minimum standards. I made it clear that I was prepared to consider proposals for dwellings of traditional construction or pre-fabricated and for dwellings having a shorter life than the type of dwelling now normally provided.</P>
    <P>Firms were asked to quote on the basis of guaranteed orders of 100 dwellings or multiples of 100 dwellings each year over a period of three to five years.  Housing authorities were informed, through their county managers, of my intentions in issuing the advertisement and their co-operation in the project was sought.  As a result of the advertisement, I received about 90 proposals, of which some 50 could be regarded as firm proposals.  The contractors who submitted these latter proposals were interviewed subsequently and additional information was obtained from them for the purpose of evaluating their proposals on a comparative basis.  A short list was then prepared of the firms who were offering the lowest prices consistent with the performance specification standards. This list included firms offering dwelling units of a traditional nature, of rationalised traditional construction and of prefabrication.</P>
    <P>In the case of some of the firms short-listed where dwellings are of a type which were not familiar to housing authorities, I intend to arrange immediately to have prototypes built.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, all firms whose proposals have been short-listed are being asked to submit detailed working drawings and a detailed specification for the dwelling units proposed by them and accepted in principle by my Department as complying with the performance specification.  They are also being asked to submit an outline specification and a schedule of rates for development and site works, since they may be required to carry out such works.</P>
    <P>As I am anxious to get some dwellings built under the low-cost housing project as soon as possible, I am seeking <Col N="814" /> the special co-operation of a number of housing authorities in proceeding with the building of low cost houses on sites which they can make available for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I am awaiting an indication from housing authorities generally of the extent to which they may be able to participate in the low-cost housing project.  I am not as yet in a position to give detailed information as to costs but I can say that from the examination made to date it appears that while maintaining essential minimum standards I can hope for economies in the cost of the current housing programme.  The present project will also contribute economies in the longer term by supplementing the drive for rationalisation and greater efficiency in the building industry.</P>
    <P>I might add that I remain open to receive any proposals which manufacturers or firms or the professions wish to put forward which offer promise of cost savings while maintaining acceptable standards.</P>

At present Mayo County Council have work in progress on 24 rural cottages, <Col N="815" /> 52 dwellings are at tender or planning stage and sites have been or are being acquired for a further 69 dwellings. In addition, the council are providing 37 demountable dwellings and caravans and propose to provide a further 67.  A scheme of 22 houses is in progress in Ballina urban area and sites are available for a further 86 houses in the town.  In Westport Urban District work is in progress on a scheme of 24 houses; plans are being prepared for 50 private sites and sites are available for a further 54 houses.  In Castlebar, plans are being prepared for a scheme of 24 houses and about 48 private sites and further land has been acquired for about 300 houses or sites.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government why £1,000,000 allocated for Dublin County Council for SDA purposes from the local loans fund is to be returned to his Department while at the same time applicants to purchase new houses are being forced by the council to obtain finance at variable interest rates from building societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>A capital allocation of £2.7 million was made to Dublin County Council for the payment of house-purchase loans and supplementary grants in 1970-71, as compared with an allocation of £1 million for these purposes in 1969-70.  The council estimate that this increased allocation will not be fully required during the year, due mainly to the effects of the cement strike.  All savings are being re-allocated to meet additional demands for capital by local authorities in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume the second part of the question refers to the schemes of low-cost houses which are being provided by the council, under a &ldquo;package deal&rdquo; arrangement with builders, for sale to eligible applicants.  Because of the size of the council's existing housing programmes, it would not have been possible for them to go ahead with these schemes unless they were able to negotiate loans for intending <Col N="816" /> purchasers from outside sources.  For this reason, a condition of the schemes was that the loans to finance them would be raised from building societies and assurance companies with the aid of guarantees from the local authority.  A large number of purchasers have already taken out mortgages with building societies and have entered into occupation of their houses.  The scheme provides excellent value and it is not considered that the purchasers are at any disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> purchasers of houses not in the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>While the cement strike was one of the factors causing the low number of applications for money, would the Minister not agree that the income limits for loans are too low at this stage?  Would the Minister not agree to increase the figure of £1,200 at some early stage?</P>

      <P>The income limits which apply for local authority loan purposes are under constant review in the Department.  There were, of course, other factors involved.  The building societies had a phenomenal inflow of funds in the past year because of the bank strike and in nearly all cases they were able to arrange loans for persons who made application, even for persons with low incomes whom they had not been too keen to accept in previous years.</P>

      <P>It is appreciated that in certain conditions of visibility, the degree of clarity of the flashing yellow beacons at pedestrian crossings may not be entirely satisfactory.  I am not satisfied, however, that the use of the colours red or green, instead of yellow, would provide a desirable alternative, since these colours are internationally associated with traffic light signals and might be confusing if used at pedestrian crossings.  The internationally recognised signal to indicate that traffic may proceed, but with caution, is a single amber or yellow flashing light or two amber or yellow lights flashing alternately. The present flashing yellow beacons are in line with this international practice.</P>

Batteries can only provide a comparatively low level of light, the effect of which would be greatly diminished or obliterated by more powerful lighting in the background for example, street lighting, shops and car headlamps.</P>
      <P>Further consideration is being given to the question of making a school warden more readily visible to traffic, whether in darkness or daylight.

      <P>The report concerns a decision to allow pensionable officers and pensionable servants of local authorities to reckon for superannuation purposes any service as wholetime temporary officer provided certain conditions are complied with.  The main condition is that the wholetime temporary service should have been continuous, or substantially so, and that it should have been followed immediately by service in a pensionable capacity.  The decision follows a similar decision made in 1967 in relation to the reckoning of unestablished service in the determination of Civil Service superannuation awards. Both decisions have effect from 1st January, 1968, and persons who retired on pension before that date will also benefit by having their pensions redetermined with effect from that date. Instructions on the implementation of the decision affecting local authority officers and servants are being prepared and will be issued to local authorities as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the newspaper report referred to by the Deputy and I can assure him that I am fully conscious of the need to make the roads more safe.  In this connection, I would refer the Deputy to my reply of 24th November last to two similar questions, in which I outlined in some detail the efforts being made to deal with this most serious state of affairs.  Since then, further positive steps have been taken <Col N="827" />&mdash;the breathalyser has been brought into full-scale operation and a number of local authorities throughout the country have at my request appointed Road Safety Officers in an effort to create a greater awareness of the problem at local level.  The Deputy may also have seen newspaper reports regarding my recommendation to local authorities on the desirability of restricting development on arterial roads, in the interests of increased safety as well as better traffic flow.  I also propose to have a monthly review of accidents in the present year.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that the measures taken will help to reduce the appalling toll on the roads but I must again emphasise that official action cannot of itself solve the problem&mdash;the remedy lies mainly in the hands of those who use the roads.</P>

      <P>The Minister is well aware that the appalling toll on the road at the present time is over 500 people and that by this time next year over 500 people who are in the prime of their lives today will unfortunately be dead.  Many people claim it is due to the fact that our roads have been neglected.

      <P>The Government are continuing to invest vast sums of money to enable the improvement of arterial roads and main roads with a view to accommodating the increasing traffic <Col N="828" /> and in all cases to try to minimise the danger spots and reduce the number of accidents on the roads.  We have maintained international standards as far as possible in the construction of these roads and are continuing to improve the type of roads being provided. I am very conscious of the part we can play but I must emphasise what I said at the end of my reply, that the real cause of accidents is something which official action cannot eliminate.  It lies in the hands of those who use the roads to exercise more care and show greater patience and courtesy towards other road users.  In that way there would be a substantial reduction in the number of road deaths.</P>

    <P>Dublin County Council have co-operated with Dublin Corporation in the provision of 59 fully serviced camping sites with living accommodation at Labré Park, Ballyfermot and Avila Park, Finglas.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The improvement of reception is primarily a matter for Radio Telefís Éireann.  I understand from the authority that since establishment of the VHF network of stations some years ago to provide for areas which could not receive medium-wave transmissions, radio reception has been generally satisfactory throughout the country.  The authority point out, however, that in certain areas, including portions of South-West Cork the use of a small rooftop or attic aerial&mdash;as well of course as the correct type of receiving set&mdash;may be necessary.</P>
      <P>Medium-wave reception over the entire country will be substantially improved when the Athlone transmitter is replaced by a more powerful one.  RTE have this matter under active consideration at present, and also some works which will have the effect of improving VHF reception in certain areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> Concerning television, I understand that the quality of reception is below an acceptable standard in a number of places, and that the authority are dealing with these on the basis of giving priority to the most populous areas. The necessary improvements in West Cork were planned for this year but owing to a deterioration in RTE's financial position these plans had to be put back, and I am now advised that they are unlikely to be implemented until 1973-74.</P>

      <P>With your permission a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>The statutory authority for the charge to which the Deputies refer is section 58 of the Housing Act, 1966 and the Housing Authorities (Loan Charges Contributions and Management) Regulations, 1967.  Prior to the making of these regulations, a tenant of a local authority dwelling who kept a sub-tenant was acting illegally and was in danger of having his tenancy terminated.  Under Article 6 of the regulations, a tenant may, with the consent of the housing authority, keep a sub-tenant.  The consent is necessary in order to ensure proper control and to prevent housing estates provided at such cost from deteriorating into new slums through overcrowding or other abuses.</P>
      <P>By circular letter H.5/67 of 14th April, 1967, local authorities were advised to make the consent the subject of an agreement between the authority and the tenant and that the terms of the agreement should provide for the payment by the tenant of a sum in addition to his ordinary rent but it was left to each authority to decide the amount of rent to be charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may add that the arrangement is associated with arrangements under which subsidy at the higher rate may be paid for the rehousing of local authority sub-tenants.  Only houses <Col N="839" /> provided for sub-tenants whose sub-tenancies were authorised not less than three years previously by the local authority may normally qualify for this higher rate of subsidy.  It is, therefore, in the interest of every sub-tenant who thinks he will, at some time, be seeking a local authority house, to ensure that his occupancy is authorised by the authority.</P>
    <P>I understand that Dún Laoghaire Corporation decided recently to regularise the position of sub-tenants of corporation dwellings many of whom are applicants for rehousing, by authorising sub-tenancies where appropriate and to provide in the agreement for the payment by the tenant of £1 per week in addition to the normal rent.  I understand further that on reconsideration of the matter the local authority have decided to reduce the charge to 7s 6d a week.  Under the scheme the extra charge is not payable where a tenant brings a dependent to live with him provided the dependent's income does not exceed £3 a week. This aspect of the scheme is being further examined by the local authority.</P>
