    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he will ensure <Col N="988" /> that the precise date on which perishable foodstuffs have been packaged will be printed on the outside of packages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am not at the moment considering the making of regulations to provide for the date marking of perishable foodstuffs, I am keeping the matter under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the public any kind of defence at all against food that has been packed over a long period and has deteriorated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are regulations about serving food the quality of which is liable to cause danger to the public. This is a most complex question and I have not in my Department any evidence that foods that are sold beyond a certain date are causing illness amongst the public.  I should be very glad to get evidence, if there is any evidence.  The Food Advisory Committee is engaged on a matter which I regard as a priority interest, namely, the use of additives.  The whole question of food preparation, and its quality, will be the subject of legislation and regulation later on.  The Food Advisory Committee is also examining the use of pesticides and their effect on the quality of food.  Frankly, I do not think the matter raised is a priority, but I will keep it under review and, if I find any evidence that food sold beyond its correct date is not, first of all, noticed by the consumer as being, as it were, out of date and, secondly, can have an ill effect on the public, I will consider asking the Food Advisory Committee to examine the matter, if I can get any substantive evidence to support the complaint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs what explanation the British Government gave for the incursion by units of their army across the Border adjacent to Swanlinbar, County Cavan on Monday, 25th January, 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations were immediately made to the British authorities in connection with the incident under <Col N="989" /> reference.  In reply, they have stated that the incursion was accidental and have expressed regret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this trespass took place on the main road between Enniskillen and Longford and that there are tourist signs indicating to motorists that they are leaving Northern Ireland?  Had this patrol gone another few hundred yards they would actually have seen the village of Swanlinbar.  Would the Minister emphasise to the British authorities that these trespasses are dangerous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that during the emergency Irish troops, accompanied by Members of this House, crossed the Border accidentally on numerous occasions, apologised, and that was the end of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This could not have been accidental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it was accidental. The Deputy could do it himself and so could I.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs what has been the outcome of representations to the EEC with regard to protecting the livelihood of Irish fishermen when this country becomes a member; and if he will make a comprehensive statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my statement in the House on 27th January in reply to a question on the progress of our negotiations with the European Communities in which I dealt with the question of fisheries and our special concern with this question in the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>How many meetings has the Minister had with the Commission about this question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the question of fisheries at all the meetings I have had. I think there have been two ministerial meetings since the announcement of the policy.  It was also raised at Ministers' deputies level.  There have been at least <Col N="990" /> two, or probably three, of those meetings. There has been a meeting with the Commission at technical level to study the regulations and how they will affect us and, when it is clear from this study how the regulations will affect our fishermen, I expect to be able to deal with the matter on negotiation with the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not likely when we become a member, if we do become a member, that European boats will fish in Irish waters and take away the fish?  At present herrings are fetching £13 per cran.  Will foreign trawlers not be detrimental to the interests of the Irish fishermen?  The European boats will have the same right to fish as Irish fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>There are different regulations and the one in regard to access would have serious effect on our Irish fishermen who enjoy protection off our coasts.  The regulation would give access to other members of the European Economic Community and that would be a very serious situation for our inshore fishermen. There is a provision for protection in certain cases by limiting access to fishing for a certain type of fish, outside the three mile limit, for a limited period.  The other applicant countries are equally concerned with us and together we shall be trying to arrange to protect the interests of our inshore fishermen.  It is a very serious problem for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister had any discussions with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries about modernising our fleet and enabling our fishermen to compete with the European fishermen if the worst comes to the worst?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may take it that there is full communication between us in this matter.  One of the regulations of the Community would provide for the Community financing such structural improvements in the fishery fleet as well as marketing. There are some advantages in the policy also.  We may take it that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is conscious of the needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister take steps to meet the fishermen and allay the fears and suspicions they have about this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister state how many meetings he has had with the Norwegian Government on this subject in view of our common interest in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>There is common interest in that the three applicants have expressed concern to the Community. I am visiting Norway for discussions on membership in about a months time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will this be the first meeting of this nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I met their Minister but I want to visit the country itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will come back from Norway in a hurry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also prepared to meet our own fishermen but the Deputy must be aware that one of the conditions of negotiation for membership of the Community which applies to the four applicants is that we accept the Treaty of Rome and decisions already taken under it.  This is the position of the Commission.  I do not want to lessen in any way the serious implications of that aspect of the fishery policy.  I would certainly meet the fishermen and discuss it but I could not guarantee to be able to allay all their anxieties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will foreign fishermen be able to fish in Irish waters in the same way as Irish fishermen when we become members of the Community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This has not been negotiated.  At the moment fishermen from any member country could fish in the waters of another member country. This regulation came in after we had begun the negotiations.  We felt that, perhaps, it could have waited until we were members and had a say in it.  We will try to influence the application of this regulation because it would have a serious effect but at present <Col N="992" /> the study that is going on is a technical one to try to find out fairly accurately how bad an effect it would have on our fishermen.  When we are clearly in possession of that knowledge we shall negotiate with the Community and see if we can improve the position.</P>

      <P>The phasing out of the bogs at present in peat production will be a gradual process starting approximately 12 to 15 years from now. It is calculated that on average these bogs will be worked for a further 25 years.</P>
      <P>Considerable research is in progress to establish the best form of utilisation of the cutaway areas resulting from peat production.  I would refer the Deputy to the annual report of Bord na Móna for the year 1969-70 which gives full details of this research work which is being conducted in conjunction with An Foras Talúntais.</P>
      <P>In addition, Bord na Móna are investigating the possibility of other forms of diversification suited to the skills and resources available to them.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister state if there has been over the past few years a decrease in the number of casual workers employed by Bord na Móna?  Would he further state if they are investigating the possibility of expanding their work on the manufacture of machinery on which they have entered at present, making machinery for themselves?  Is it proposed to expand this further in view of the fact that the type of horticultural work to which the Minister refers does not have, perhaps, as high an employment content as would be necessary to absorb all the workers who would eventually be disemployed?</P>

      <P>The assumption in the first part of the Deputy's question is correct.  There has been a diminution of lowly-paid unskilled employment and a substantial increase in well-paid, skilled employment.  This is precisely why I mentioned in the last sentence that Bord na Móna are very actively investigating some possible forms of diversification which may require legislation.  By diversification I mean the type of diversification mentioned by the Deputy in regard to engineering or other aspects of industrial or other activity which will absorb in time the skills that have been created by Bord na Móna in these areas.</P>

      <P>A contract has, however, been placed by CIE with a Belgian firm for the re-bodying of 16 tour coaches. These coaches have reached the end of their useful life as tour coaches, but as the engines, transmissions and chassis are still quite serviceable the old bodies have been removed and new bodies are being fitted by the Belgian contractor.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has recommended duty-free import facilities for these coaches on the grounds that no Irish body builder was in a position to meet CIE's requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Reporters in the Houses of the Oireachtas comprise two categories: established permanently-employed officers recruited by means of Civil Service Commission competition and casually-employed fee-paid reporters.  As no competition was held in January, 1971 for the recruitment of established Reporters, I presume the question refers to the latter category.</P>
      <P>The selection of casually-employed reporters is entirely a matter for the Ceann Comhairle.  He has informed me that a rota has been prepared of persons suitable and willing to do casual reporting work; that one of them is at present employed; and that the two remaining persons on the rota have indicated, when asked, that they were not currently available.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to cast any reflection on the Chair, and the Chair will appreciate that, but I am quite sure that the Minister could answer the question of whether or not any effort was made to recruit Irish staff for this particular job on a temporary basis, even at a very much less rate than that being paid to this personnel from London.  Would the Minister not agree that the whole trouble in this case has been caused by the fact that the Seanad was sitting along with the Dáil and the Public Accounts Committee and that it was a peculiar type of arrangement that the Seanad should be asked to sit knowing that it was going to leave a shortage of staff, <Col N="998" /> particularly as they only met four days since 31st July, 1970.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As regards the first part of the Deputy's question, the information available to me is that efforts were made to recruit people from here and they were unsuccessful.  As regards the second part of the question, I am not sure if I understand correctly what he is getting at but in view of the fact that there was business for the Seanad to do, and in particular that there were many complaints about the lack of business for the Seanad in the previous session, I would be surprised if the Deputy is now saying that the Seanad should not have been engaged on the work on which it has been engaged because of the activities of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Seanad has been introducing Bills, something which it has not done before, except once or twice; we know that.  Would the Minister not agree that no effort was made to recruit available staff to do the work for which the English personnel were brought over?  I am not saying one thing against the personnel who are doing a good job, I am told, but what I am saying is that it is a damn shame that with all the people who are unemployed in this city you could not get somebody to do this reporting when reporters were required and that you had to send across to an agency in Britain.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 18 of the Finance Act, 1969, provides, inter alia, that the profits or gains arising from farming are not taken into account for income tax purposes.  Farming means farming farm land in the State wholly or mainly occupied for the purposes of husbandry.  Income from other sources is of course chargeable to tax in the ordinary way.</P>
      <P>The occupation of farm land by a dealer in cattle, which includes sheep and pigs, or by a dealer in or a seller of milk, where the land is insufficient for the keep of the cattle brought on to the land, is regarded as the carrying on of a trade and the profits are chargeable to tax.

As I indicated in reply to a question on 28th January, the bank closure and its aftermath have delayed the completion of this scheme.  I am hopeful, however, that some details which still remain to be settled will be disposed of soon and that the scheme will be introduced at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if there are still loopholes <Col N="1003" /> in the Land Acts which allow foreigners, through the manipulation of shares, to acquire Irish land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no loopholes as such.  The transfer of control of a company by means of a transfer of shares is governed by subsection (5) of section 45 of the Land Act, 1965.  This provides, broadly, that if a company passes into the control of a non-qualified person, this fact must be reported to the Land Commission.  The subsection further provides that should the Land Commission then institute acquisition proceedings for that land, the ordinary defences against acquisition would not apply.</P>
      <P>Due to the complexity of company law and structure this was the only practicable measure of control that could be devised.  This provision was brought specially to the notice of the Dáil by the Minister for Lands in the course of the debate on the Committee Stage of the Land Bill, 1963; columns 1168 and 1169 of the Official Report of 19th November, 1964 are relevant.  The actual purchase of land by companies is controlled by subsection 2 (a) of section 45 of the Land Act, 1965.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am telling the Deputy is that where the company passes into the control of an unqualified company this fact must be reported to the Land Commission.  The Land Commission can if they wish, so far as I am aware, decide to acquire the land. If they do the ordinary defences are not acceptable in such cases.  However, they can also decide for some other reasons that they will not interfere.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a large estate in County Meath has now passed out of the hands of a German to a Swiss company by this arrangement?  If the price makes the land unattractive to the Land Commission this kind of arrangement can continue.  In the case I have mentioned, <Col N="1004" /> is the Minister aware that an Irishman was prepared to pay more than the Swiss company but he could not get the land simply because they wanted to transfer it to a Swiss company?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <P>I do not accept that. What I said is that it is quite possible that if they say they are going to start a stud farm the Land Commission will accept that this is so.  However, I do not accept that if they carry on in some other manner afterwards that they will be permitted to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>In connection with the substitution of a half-yearly demand for the ten year receivable order for payment of land annuity instalments, it was estimated that the overall increase in costs of the change-over might be in the region of £1,800&mdash;arising mainly from increases in the cost of stationery and postage.  Due to the prolonged banks' closure, which had repercussions on the normal pattern of annuity payments, it has not been found possible as yet to make a precise evaluation of the cost of the new system.</P>
      <P>The question of including the relevant folio numbers in future issues of the new half-yearly demands is at present under consideration.  The omission of folio numbers from the demands already issued was due to technical difficulties in transferring these particulars to the magnetic tape files used in the computer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Octane ratings are shown on some petrol pumps for purchasers who wish to know them.  As such ratings are only a partial indication of the nature or quality of the fuel, I do not think the benefit to the purchaser of such a requirement as the Deputy suggests would justify the administrative difficulty involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding of it is that the octane rating is not what might be termed a reliable guide.  A survey in Britain some five or six years ago showed that apart from the general differences between various brands of petrol, each brand would behave differently in different cars and that a car may even need different petrols at different periods of its life. Therefore, I do not think the octane ratings as such can be looked upon as being so important.</P>

      <P>While it might not be foolproof, is the Minister aware it is the only reliable guide to the quality of petrol?  Surely the consumer is entitled to know what quality he is buying. The only reason why the major petrol companies would not want to show the octane rating of petrol is that they might infringe the Sale of Goods Act, 1893?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that, from the point of view of the volume of unemployment and its causes in the boot and shoe industry, a case for special terms for the industry within the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement could not, at present, be sustained.  I should add that I am informed that difficulties facing certain footwear factories arise not because of imports but from problems related to the particular manufacturing units concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not feel a case could be made for a <Col N="1020" /> bilateral agreement with Britain on the extent of protection?  Under the free trade agreement there is a provision whereby for 18 months we could unilaterally take a decision to protect an industry if there is serious unemployment. Does the Minister not agree that at the present time there is serious unemployment and closures?  If we do not want to take the bilateral step of applying to Britain for agreement we can invoke a section of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement whereby we can unilaterally decide to provide protection for up to 18 months by way of quotas or restrictions of imports?</P>

Any unemployment is serious both from the point of view of the area and the people who become unemployed, but I do not think the problem of unemployment which has arisen in the industry is such as to justify our being able, under any heading, to take up the matter in relation to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement at this stage.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the answer, which I gave to a similar question last Thursday.  I would like to emphasise that the considerations which led to this firm's decision to cease assembly related to its own operations and do not apply to the Irish motor assembly industry as a whole.</P>
      <P>The case submitted to the EEC for the retention of the special arrangements under which the Irish assembly industry has been operating since 1967, is designed to ensure continued assembly here on a long-term basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

We made things extremely easy for motor car manufacturers and assemblers from Britain to come here and assemble on the basis that there would not be any such closures but notwithstanding all we did there is, in fact, a closure.

If you like, it is across <Col N="1022" /> the board.  This question of the closing down of a particular car assembly outfit does not mean that there will be a falling off in assembly because it is tied up, if you like, with an amalgamation where the assembly will be maintained.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In a period of a single week nine people&mdash;possibly more &mdash;have died by violence in the North. Even a child is dead, by accident, and this must give us a special sense of grief and of sympathy for the bereaved parents.</P>
      <P>I have already expressed the Government's abhorrence of the activities of those who deliberately advocate or use force in the North for any political objective.  In all the statements I have made in regard to the North and in all my activities on behalf of the Government, I have attempted to explain and to establish that the Irish people, with very few exceptions, are committed to a peaceful resolution of our divisions. The greatest contribution which I would urge in these days of change in the North is patience on the part of the minority and generosity on the part of the majority.</P>
      <P>An extraordinary effort of will by the Stormont Government is required to reverse practices which were wrong and failed and which brought the community close to total destruction.  The depth and extent of what needs to be done demands courage and compassion. Major Chichester-Clark's task towards this end, which needs to succeed, can be lightened by the support of all the elements of the Northern majority who must realise now that the stability and progress of the community depends on the participation of the minority in its affairs and in its economic wellbeing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Patience, in addition to their own constructive gifts and talents, is the best contribution the minority can make at the present time.  The errors of two generations cannot be corrected overnight.  The important thing is that they are in course of correction and that there could be no question of a reversal of this progress.  Senseless violence and destruction are the surest way of interrupting progress and benefit no part of the community either in <Col N="1025" /> the short or the long term.  On all sides there must be forbearance.</P>
    <P>In a community which is divided, as the North is, tolerance must be extended by each side to the other.  The majority must take the lead in this as they control the organs of State.  The authority of the State should not be used to offend the sensibilities of the minority much less to discriminate against them.  Against the total background of Irish history needless impositions are humilitating and dangerous. The majority bear a special responsibility to avoid them.</P>
    <P>Similarly the minority must refuse to be incited to actions contrary to their own interests by the provocations of people, not in authority, who threaten them and the peace with words&mdash;words which can be rendered impotent only by being ignored.  They should equally refuse to respond to the provocations of agitators in their own midst whose peculiar view of the history of Ireland and its future gives no hope of peace and brotherhood among the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I have never been anything but frank with our Northern brethren that reunification of our country is our purpose, reunification through peace, by promoting friendship, goodwill, co-operation and understanding so that mental barriers which are more powerful than physical borders will be broken down. We have engaged in co-operation with the Northern Administration in various economic fields in the past.  I myself initiated and administered as Minister for Industry and Commerce the extension of tariff concessions to Northern Ireland firms.  We are willing and anxious to seek out and promote other forms of practical co-operation.</P>
    <P>The leading article of <i>The Guardian</i> today says that economic underprivilege and civil strife are twin problems. While we know that there are many difficulties other than economic underprivilege, we want to promote further economic co-operation&mdash;for example, we are willing to examine the possibility of co-operation in regional development in areas like Leitrim-Fermanagh that could promote the wellbeing of people on both sides of the border.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to spare no effort <Col N="1026" /> to promote increased knowledge and understanding of each other among the Irish people and to work positively towards reconciliation in the North and in Ireland as a whole.  May I express the hope that all our fellow-Irishmen in the North will reciprocate this spirit of goodwill and co-operation thereby bringing nearer the day when all of us in this island will live in peace and harmony.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like at the outset to place again on record the sympathy of my colleagues and myself for the relatives of the unfortunate people of all denominations and all shades of political opinion who lost their lives in the tragedies in Northern Ireland in recent days.  Clearly there is an immediate need for new initiatives to put an end, first of all to the present bloodshed and sordid civil strife.</P>
      <P>In a statement that I issued on Saturday I said that these shootings and explosions, and all the horrible incidents and atrocities of civil war, will inevitably recur in the North unless an immediate reappraisal of the whole situation is undertaken.  Keeping things as they have been for the last 50 years is no solution.  At the same time it is important that there should be no doubt about where majority opinion in this part of the country stands.  I have no restraint in expressing without reservation, what has been the consistent attitude of my colleagues in this party and amongst the members of this organisation: we have publicly expressed the view that the only way to achieve the ultimate unity of the country is through peaceful means and through co-operation.  We have given practical evidence in the past of a start in that direction.  It is, of course, our aim, as it should be the aim of every Irish man and woman, to unite the whole people of Ireland and the whole territory of Ireland into a united Ireland, to abolish the memory of all past dissensions and to substitute the common name of &ldquo;Irishman&rdquo; in place of the denomination Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of mutual fear is the biggest obstacle to the realisation of that aim and, until that is resolved, <Col N="1027" /> the people of the North will never be able to live normal lives, whether they find themselves continuing in Northern Ireland or in a united Ireland.  The situation would be farcical if it were not so tragic, with rival groups shooting and killing each other.  None of these groups has any authority to act for this country.</P>

      <P>Very few of them have tried to.  There have been some&mdash; indeed, there was one recent notable exception.  The reforms have been dilatory and, in some cases, halfhearted. Some of the mistakes that have been made would have been avoidable if those responsible had an elementary knowledge of or acquaintance with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the establishment, or the creation, of Northern Ireland under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, Britain has had a responsibility, be it <Col N="1028" /> complete or partial, for conditions there.  It is obvious in the time that has elapsed since August 1969 that the units of the British Army now in Northern Ireland are incapable of maintaining peace in that area.  Indeed, British Army units can never be accepted or welcomed in any part of this country.  The fact that special units with certain historic associations have been sent there has made it even more difficult than it might otherwise have been to establish and maintain peace.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat what I suggested earlier when a United Nations peacekeeping force was rejected; the events of the last 18 months show that this was a mistake.  A United Nations peace-keeping force should now be requested to undertake the task of restoring peace and order in the North of Ireland.  It would command the respect of and acceptance by the people which the British Army will never get. Unfortunately, 18 months ago, a proposal made from this side of the House that an all-party committee should be established was not acceptable.  At that time an undertaking was given that consultation would take place between the Government and the Opposition. So far, as far as I am aware, no consultation has taken place.  If consultation had taken place it might have been possible to ascertain the full facts of the situation; at times, one is tempted to wonder what is going on or do the Government know.</P>

Events in recent weeks have demonstrated that there has been a steep down turn which, in my opinion, makes the situation now graver than it was at any time since October, 1968.</P>
      <P>The gravity of the situation has to some extent been emphasised by reason of the Taoiseach's suggestion that the leaders of the three parties make statements here today.  I regret very much that this is not in the form of a discussion, even over a limited period of some hours, as I suggested yesterday. The events of yesterday, particularly those in Fermanagh and in the streets of Belfast, seen by all of us on television or read about in the newspapers, evoke not alone a feeling of deep sympathy but also one of revulsion and fear, a fear which is not confined to the people in the Six Counties but is to be found also amongst those here in the Republic of the 26 Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in such a situation now that I believe&mdash;and this was my motive in asking for a debate yesterday on a Resolution&mdash;that Dáil Éireann should make some gestures in order to try to lessen the undoubted fear there is in the North particularly in cities like Belfast, Newry, Dungannon and Derry. This should be done&mdash;may I emphasise this&mdash;without qualifications from any of the three parties and without qualifications from any member of the parties. This is of vital importance particularly in view of a discussion we had some time ago.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned I speak confidently for every member of this Party: we believe <Col N="1030" /> a rational and responsible policy as far as the North is concerned should resolutely exclude from the national concensus those who encourage and condone violence and especially those who engage in surreptitious collusion with violence practised by others.  May I respectfully suggest that we should put our own house in order first in view of recent events and in view of recent statements because we are not in the strongest position to preach to others?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in a weekend statement, listed ways in which, he said, in Northern Ireland the British authorities had contributed to the present dangerous situation.  It is certain that past policies of the Northern Ireland Government and some of their attitudes have contributed to the situation in which we find ourselves at present.  So too have actions of the British military authorities and some of their troops especially when it appeared that they were selective in their searches for arms by a concentration on the minority areas.  It must also be recognised that the untoward developments have been greatly aggravated by persons working inside the Catholic areas deliberately and of set purpose fomenting, at first, friction and then actual confrontation with British troops, the troops they welcomed some time ago, the troops originally brought in for the protection of this minority group against the Paisleyite mobs.</P>
    <P>It is now alleged that these elements in these areas received support and encouragement and money and arms from, among others, members of the Taoiseach's party who are Members of the House and who were formerly Government Ministers.  There was the delusion that arms being sent to the North were for the defence of the Catholic minority.  That surely has now been dispelled by recent events and by recent allegations.  There is nothing defensive about nail bombs, about a landmine on a lonely mountain road. There is certainly nothing defensive about a booby-trapped car.  Neither my party nor I believe that such activities will make the minority safer: on the contrary, we believe that such activities will increase the danger to both communities.  Therefore, in the current <Col N="1031" /> escalation of violence elements, mainly the so-called provisional IRA, are using the Catholic areas as their base for armed attacks on troops.  The cruel irresponsibility and dishonesty of these tactics presented as a defence of our people need not be spelled out now. In these circumstances the allegations by the head of the Special Branch before the Committee of Public Accounts will add to the fear of the people in the North.  It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to say that investigations are continuing.  Grave charges have been made against two Members of this House, Deputy Haughey and Deputy Blaney and, of course, there have been denials also.  If these charges are true these two Deputies should not be Members of this House purporting to support the Taoiseach who professes&mdash;and I believe he is sincere in this&mdash;rejection of all types of force in trying to unite the country.</P>

      <P>We have a situation in which these two Deputies say by their votes that they have confidence in the Taoiseach.  How can people have confidence in the Taoiseach and at the same time, as alleged, contravene Government policy?  These are matters that must be cleared up.</P>
      <P>The great majority of the Irish people have condemned the recent murders and killings and the Taoiseach has rightly expressed the Government's condemnation but it is not enough to deplore and condemn when something particularly shocking occurs.  We must make sure that at least none of us in this House is encouraging or condoning those acts.  We must make sure that nobody, no party in the Republic is playing politics at the expense of the lives of the people in the Six North Eastern counties.  That is why the charges made by the head of the Special Branch must be speedily investigated.  The House and the people of the country are entitled to know who is right and who is wrong.  There have been allegations and there have been denials.  We may be somewhat close to it but the ordinary man in the street is certainly frustrated and confused with these allegations and counter-allegations and denials.</P>
      <P>May I repeat&mdash;and the situation has become worse&mdash;the people are rapidly losing faith in our public institutions and in the idea of this public institution called Dáil Éireann?  We have done little but talk here.  I do not say this in criticism of what the Taoiseach or Deputy Cosgrave said or even of what I am saying now.  We have passed resolutions; we have talked about co-operation and about meeting people. We have blueprints, long-term though they may be, for a solution of Partition. There have been some practical suggestions and I think the Taoiseach should not stand idly by and should listen to people who are sincere when they say they want to help him and the Government of the country in trying to allay the fears of the people in the North and in trying to put a stop to this mad killing that has been going on for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1033" /> I have no hesitation in supporting, as I did on the last occasion, the idea of an all-party Committee of the House to watch the situation in the North and take whatever action is necessary in order that we may help and do a little more than make speeches and try to advise and assist in this particular problem.  I suggested yesterday&mdash;I think Deputy Cosgrave suggested it also&mdash;that there should be talks between the three Governments. Some time last year the Taoiseach said he had sought an appointment with the then British Prime Minister Mr. Harold Wilson.  It never materialised.  We are asking Protestant and Catholic, Unionist and Labour in the Six Counties to talk to each other and get together.  We are inviting our own people to go up there and the Northern people to come down here.  Surely if the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister at Stormont and the Prime Minister at Westminster were to meet and talk seriously about the northern situation it would be a good example?</P>
    <P>I believe also, and this I have suggested, that the possibility of a joint session of Dáil Éireann and Stormont should be explored.  Think what you may about the personnel at Stormont, in respect of certain people, but at least let us hear their point of view.  If they have fears let them express them and let us, if we can, allay them.  I believe that this as an experiment would go a long way towards cooling the very hot atmosphere that exists now as far as the Unionists in the north are concerned and the people in this Parliament and, if you like, the members of the SDLP.  There are many in the SDLP who could by their experience and knowledge of the situation be very helpful to us.  I suggest one is the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, Mr. Gerry Fitt, who with his other colleagues is living in the centre of this strife torn city of Belfast and who can speak with first hand experience and first hand information.</P>
    <P>It would not be contravening the rules of this House if I were to read a message that I received this morning from Gerry Fitt, this courageous man. I quote:</P>
    <P>There are people undoubtedly in <Col N="1034" /> Northern Ireland at the present time who see Irish unity only being brought about by the sacrifice of many lives.  I am utterly opposed to this concept.  I believe Ireland can never be united at such a terrible cost.  I am convinced that the only way to bring about the unity of this island is by taking positive steps to unite the Catholic and Protestant people in Northern Ireland so that they may all realise that the only hope for future prosperity and happiness is by the acceptance of all the people in Ireland that Partition has been a signal failure.  Steps must be taken immediately to involve the British, Irish and Stormont Governments in discussions in the full realisation that things can never be the same again.  I am a Socialist and Republican but I do not wish to see my objective of a 32-County Socialist Republic achieved at the expense of human lives.</P>
    <P>That certainly echoes my sentiments as far as the North of Ireland is concerned.</P>
    <P>In conclusion may I say that as long as the present situation obtains the credibility of our Parliamentary institution, of our machinery for law enforcement, remains in serious doubt.  The Taoiseach, though sincere in his peaceful aspiration, has a share of responsibility for this grave situation, a situation which has been brought about by the acts, omissions and collusion of what he himself describes as his first Government.  Neither the Taoiseach nor any of us can do much directly for the people of Northern Ireland.  His claim to be second guarantor for the minority in the North has always had an element&mdash;I think he must admit it now on recollection&mdash;of pretence about it.  What he can do for the people in Northern Ireland is to set his own house in order here in the Republic and for that the main responsibility lies squarely on his shoulders.</P>

      <P>Tairigim: &ldquo;Go léifear an Bille an Dara Uair anois.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Mar adubhairt mé ar roinnt ocáidí cheana féin is aonad an t-oideachas ón mbun-scoil go dtí an chéim is airde san ard-oideachas.  Mar sin má bhíonn easnamh i mbrainse amháin den oideachas bíonn an droch-thoradh le sonrú i ngach brainse eile de.  Sin é an príomh-fháth atá againn le hatheagar do chur ar an gcóras oideachas ón mbun aníos.  Tá a lán déanta cheana féin ó thaobh an chórais bhunoideachais agus an chórais iarbhunoideachais sa tslí go bhfuil go leor de na fadhbanna a thárla sa dá bhrainse sin ar bhealach a réitithe.  Ó thaobh an ard-oideachais an chéad chéim bhunúsach a tógadh chun na mórcheisteanna a bhain leis d'aithint ná bunú an Choimisiúin Ard-Oideachais. Is ó mholtaí an Choimisiúin sin a tháinig an smaoineamh faoin ar bunaíodh an tÚdarás Um Ard-Oideachas sa bhliain 1968.  Is status <i>ad hoc</i> atá ag an údarás ó shoin de bhrí nach raibh aon reachtaíocht ann faoin a bhféadfaí status reachtúil a thabhairt dó.</P>
      <P>Tá an t-am tagaithe anois chun é sin do dhéanamh d'fhonn seasamh níos daingne agus níos buaine a thabhairt dó chun deighleáil leis na ceisteanna móra i leith an ard-oideachais atá nó a bheidh faoi bhráid an údaráis d'fhonn moltaí ina leith do dhéanamh. Is chuige sin atá an Bille atá le bheith faoi dhíospóireacht anois tugtha isteach sa Teach so.  Tá lán-léargas againn óna bhfuil déanta ag an údarás go dtí seo gur maith ar fad ann é mar chuid anthábhachtach den chóras ard-oideachais agus go mbeidh páirt mhór le glacadh aige i ngach a bhéas riachtanach chun na mór-fhadhbanna a bhaineann leis an gcóras san a réiteach.</P>
      <P>An tÚdaras Um Ard-Oideachas was set up on <i>ad hoc</i> basis in August, 1968 and given these terms of reference:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  examine the existing provision for higher education with a view to making recommendations to the Minister for Education on the necessity for the existing provision and <Col N="1036" /> on the elimination of unnecessary duplication;</P>
    <P>(b)  examine budgets prepared by higher education institutions and plans for development and advise the Minister thereon;</P>
    <P>(c)  advise the Minister as to the allocation between the institutions concerned of the funds made available by the Government for higher education purposes;</P>
    <P>(d)  arrange for the placement of students;</P>
    <P>(e)  maintain a continual review of the country's needs in higher education;</P>
    <P>(f)  advise on higher education matters referred to it by the Minister or other appropriate bodies;</P>
    <P>(g)  conduct inquiries and initiate and publish studies on problems of higher education;</P>
    <P>(h)  arrange for as much uniformity as possible in the system of grading of university staff in the country, the system of appointment to academic university posts, the procedure for the fixing of conditions of service and tenure of such posts and of superannuation benefits for academic and administrative staff, the implementation of a system of mobility of staff members between universities and between universities and other institutions of higher education and research, and the correlation of salary scales for university staffs;</P>
    <P>(i)  make regulations governing the form in which each institution will present its annual budget and accounts to the authority;</P>
    <P>(j)  endeavour generally to further the development of higher education and to promote a knowledge of its value to the country.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill before the House it is proposed to constitute An tÚdarás on a statutory basis so that it might be on firmer ground in relation to performing the tasks which are assigned to it. These tasks are spelt out in detail in the Bill.  The general functions being given to An tÚdarás are as stated in section 3:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1037" /> (a)  furthering the development of higher education;</P>
    <P>(b)  assisting in the co-ordination of State investment in higher education and preparing proposals for such investment;</P>
    <P>(c)  promoting an appreciation of the value of higher education and research.</P>
    <P>The specific functions are set out in the succeeding sections of the Bill. From these it will be seen that the main role of An tÚdarás will be to assist in the development in an orderly fashion of higher education whilst assessing the requirements on one hand and on the other seeking to assess the financial and other provisions which will be necessary to meet these requirements. In discharge of its functions An tÚdarás will be the link between my Department and the institutions of higher education.</P>
    <P>As will be seen from the terms of the Bill the role of An tÚdarás in relation to the provision to be made for higher education will be that of making recommendations.  In the matter of finances An tÚdarás under the provisions of section 10 (1) may assess the amounts of State financial provision, both current and capital, which it recommends for higher education and research or for any part thereof, either in relation to current or future periods. It will of course be for this House in dealing with the annual estimates for my Department to approve of the sums allocated for higher education.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis An tÚdarás has worked stead-fastly at the tasks assigned to it and has much to show for its labours.  Its first general report which related to the year 1968-69 contained a review of its activities and dealt with many of the immediate problems connected with higher education.  Previous to that it furnished recommendations in relation to the question of establishing a body which would award national qualifications at technician and technological levels.  At the same time it made recommendations in regard to the provision of third-level educational facilities at Limerick.</P>
    <P>Recently An tÚdarás furnished a <Col N="1038" /> comprehensive report on teacher training. At present it is engaged on the consideration of the future provision for higher education in the country in general and in Dublin in particular. When its recommendations in this latter regard have been received they will be given the fullest consideration as a prelude to the omnibus legislation which it will be necessary to introduce in this House.</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás at present consists of a chairman and 14 other members.  Section 2 of the schedule to the present Bill provides that the membership shall be a chairman and not more than 18 ordinary members of whom at least seven shall be academic members and at least seven shall be other than academic members.  It is not proposed at the outset at any rate to appoint the full number of ordinary members.  The reason for this is that at any time it might be felt desirable to add an additional member or members to An tÚdarás who might have special competence in particular fields.</P>
    <P>I see this Bill as a major step forward in our effort to deal with the problems of higher education in a rational way.</P>
    <P>I am aware, however, that there have been a number of comments in relation to the text of the Bill.  It seems to me that the comments which have been made in relation to section 12 may have some validity.  There is no doubt in my mind as to what was intended under that section.  This House would be asked to vote two bulk sums one related to the total current expenditure and the other to the total capital expenditure for all the institutions of higher education.  The Book of Estimates would contain, by way of information, details in relation to the various institutions concerned to show how the bulk sums were arrived at.  As this <i>modus operandi</i> may not be clear from the existing draft, which might be said to inhibit the discretion of the authority, I propose to introduce an amendment at Committee stage which will clarify the position.</P>
    <P>Before concluding my remarks at this stage I would like to pay a well deserved tribute to the members of the <Col N="1039" /><i>ad hoc</i> body for the assiduous and painstaking manner in which they have applied themselves to the problems with which they have had to deal since the body was set up in 1968.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Hitherto in this country the financing of universities by public authorities who are responsible for the great bulk of financing of these institutions, as well as other institutions of higher education, has been arranged by direct negotiation between the relevant Government Department and the institution concerned.  However, in the case of some higher education institutions which are more directly under the control of the Department, the form of negotiation is different but basically the decision regarding the allocation of funds is one for the relevant Department&mdash;in recent years the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>The need to introduce a Bill of this kind arises because this system has become less satisfactory for several reasons.  We welcome the recognition by the Government of the need to change the method.  While there are many criticisms one could make of this Bill&mdash;I shall be making a number and we shall be putting down a number of amendments at Committee Stage&mdash;the principle of having such an authority is one we welcome and is in accordance with the stated policy of Fine Gael, as put forward in this connection four years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons the change is necessary are twofold.  First, as the dependence of universities in particular on public funds has grown&mdash;some are dependent for more than three-quarters of public funds for their finance&mdash;the direct relationship with the Department of Education in determining this amount involves, in the view of the universities, an increasing threat to their autonomy. While the method by which control is exercised over funds is entirely proper in the viewpoint of the Department who are concerned about accountability particularly when the proportion of university finance is so large, it begins to create a problem.  In recent years in various contortions of public policy with regard to fees and in negotiations regarding salaries there have been <Col N="1040" /> indications that the proper degree of autonomy of the universities has come under pressure.</P>
    <P>At the same time, third level institutions other than universities are rightly aspiring to a greater degree of autonomy and independence from direct departmental control than they have had up to now.  The proliferation of institutions of higher education having, or seeking, this degree of autonomy involves a need for a better method of controlling finance.  For these reasons this Bill has been introduced. To say it is timely would be too polite because it is overdue, as is much of the legislation in this House in recent years.</P>
    <P>It is almost ten years since I gave evidence on this point on behalf of the Academic Staff Association of University College, Dublin to the Commission on Higher Education.  I proposed that some body of this kind would be established to act as an honest broker between the Government and the institutions of higher education, which would present to the Government an impartial and objective assessment of the needs of the universities, carrying more authority than the <i>ex parte</i> statements of the institutions.  It could be a body responsible for distributing to these institutions whatever funds the Government found it possible to make so that by keeping the Government at one remove the autonomy of these bodies would be maintained.  The form of this proposal is somewhat different from the ideas then expressed but that is not surprising as ten years have passed. Some of the details worry me a little but basically the idea is good.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to recall the history of the development of this idea since the Commission on Higher Education considered the matter.  The commission proposed that such a body be established and it recommended this in its report which was originally published in summary form in the spring of 1967.  The details of the proposal were spelled out in the first volume of the full report published in August of that year.</P>
    <P>The proposal was somewhat different from the present one.  It suggested a part-time chairman and a smaller number of members&mdash;eight part-time members. <Col N="1041" /> It also suggested that none should be drawn from the institutions that would come within the scope of the authority of this body.  This was a rather curious recommendation.  It did not seem to me, and I gather from the framing of this Bill, it did not appear to the Government, to be justified by the arguments put forward.  I am glad that that idea, which could have led to the creation of a body too remote from the real needs of these institutions, was not pursued.  That is not to say, nor do I suggest, that a purely academic body would fulfil this role adequately.  To suggest that any group of people&mdash;academics included&mdash;could be given full authority over the disposal of public funds to themselves would be something this House would not readily accept.  That there should be representation of academic interests and people with practical experience of academic institutions should be on the body and able to give advice, while not having a majority determining voice in the decisions, is a good thing.</P>
    <P>To the extent that this Bill modifies the commission's proposals, I think the Minister has acted correctly.  The commission proposed that this body to be established would deal with the universities and with the new colleges that it proposed&mdash;of which we have heard nothing since.  They proposed that the body should deal with higher level work in vocational colleges, with the Royal College of Surgeons, the National College of Art, the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies and with two other proposals that have not come to fruition&mdash;the National College of Agricultural and Veterinary Science and the proposed technological authority.  When one allows for the fact that some of these institutions have not come into existence the scope of the Bill appears to cover potentially much the same range that the commission recommended. However, one is not clear regarding the extent to which some bodies are necessarily to be included.  This has been left open and I think the Minister could have helped us a little more had he referred to this in detail in his opening speech.</P>
    <P>The question of what bodies are to be included is not clarified.  The Bill is <Col N="1042" /> specific with regard to universities and colleges of universities, but beyond that it leaves open the question of the other bodies to which the Bill applies.  However, the Bill is drafted in such a way that it could cover the bodies mentioned although I should like clarification of the Minister's intentions in this regard.  There are bodies&mdash;to take one obvious example, the Royal College of Surgeons&mdash;which give university degrees or their equivalent.  It is not clear whether the Minister considers such institutions to be universities or if he does not, why he would omit special reference to them.  The whole question as to the bodies to which the Bill applies is something we would need to discuss further.  Indeed the mechanism of choosing them is something about which I may have something to say later on, because the Bill as drafted leaves this fundamentally to the Minister.  While requiring him to consult with the authority, it does leave the choice to the Minister, and I am not sure if that is entirely satisfactory or that it will preserve adequately the autonomy of the authority itself.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recommendation of the Commission on Higher Education to establish a body of this kind, not identical but similar, to be called a Commission for Higher Education&mdash; I think the Minister's title is perhaps neater and indicates more clearly what the body is to do&mdash;that proposal was accompanied by a proposal for the establishment of a Council of Irish Universities where functions would cover all the matters in which the universities have a common interest, and it would have mandatory powers in respect of a number of matters, entrance and degree standards, schemes for extern examining, conditions for transfer of students, exchange of information on policy&mdash;although to make the exchange of information on policy mandatory seems perhaps a little difficult to achieve&mdash;development of research, and participation in postgraduate studentship and fellowship schemes.</P>
    <P>The Government gave their decision in principal on these two proposals, on the Higher Education Authority which the commission had itself denominated <Col N="1043" /> as a Commission for Higher Education, having functions similar to this body about which we are now talking, and on the proposed Council of Irish Universities. The Government's decision on these proposals was given on 6th July, 1968, in a document which contained a good deal of material which has been the cause of heart-searching and controversy in our academic institutions since then.  The Government accepted that these two bodies should be established.  They also accepted at that time that the proposed Higher Education Authority would have members from the institutions concerned.  The Bill, however&mdash;and I shall come back to this&mdash;does not contain any provision for a body equivalent to the recommended Council of Irish Universities.  There has been reference to it since then, but the Bill itself does not propose to establish the Conference of Irish Universities, the endorsement of which was contained in the Government's statement of 6th July, 1968, over two and a half years ago.  Indeed that raises the question as to why it was omitted, and I shall come back to that.</P>
    <P>The next stage was the announcement by the Government on 15th August, 1968 of the establishment of an <i>ad hoc</i> Higher Education Authority which began work in September.  Its membership includes members of the staffs of various institutions as well as non-academic people from outside the institutions.  It has a full-time chairman, Dr. Ó Raifeartaigh, the former Secretary of the Department, himself a man of academic distinction and one whose genuine concern and interest in higher education is universally accepted in the academic world.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the <i>ad hoc</i> authority was, however, surrounded by some controversy because of a certain ineptitude on the part of the Minister concerned&mdash;not, may I emphasise, the present Minister&mdash;in his handling of the matter.  The Minister concerned appeared to be making it a condition of appointment that those concerned should accept not only a merger but even the merger then proposed, but at any rate that they should accept in <Col N="1044" /> principle a merger of the two Dublin colleges.</P>
    <P>This had little relevance to the job to be done in the immediate future by the <i>ad hoc</i> body which, as the Minister said, was given as its primary task the bringing forward of proposals for its establishment on a statutory basis and the establishment of a Conference of Irish Universities.  It certainly prejudiced the acceptability of this body in academic circles because at that time the movement of opinion against the merger of the Dublin colleges was perhaps at its height.  There was a good deal of academic excitement.</P>

      <P>It was then certainly getting off the ground in a big way, as Deputy Thornley and myself had reason to know when we faced in Maynooth, just after 6th July, something which could not properly be described as a howling mob of academics but a group of academics who were very incensed about the 6th July proposals.  For the Minister to have appeared to make it a pre-condition of membership of this body that those concerned should accept a merger or the merger was certainly unwise and tactless and, I think, unnecessary.  It did cause some difficulty at first within the body and for some time afterwards outside it.  However, the apparent threat to the autonomy of the body involved in selecting people for their acceptance of a particular viewpoint on one matter was to a large degree resolved when the body at its first meeting asserted itself and one might almost say extorted from the Minister a statement of the matter and made its own statement of its autonomy and of the fact that it was not to be bound in its decisions by decisions taken in that way.  This authority was still somewhat prejudiced by the pre-selection of the members but it did endeavour to restore its authority in the academic community by asserting its independence. That was a useful thing to do and it did help to make the body more acceptable despite the bad start it had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be said that while at that time there were academics who were perhaps inclined to the view that a <Col N="1045" /> body so selected was so prejudicial to their views and interests that they would not accept it at all, that view lost ground very rapidly, and the actions of the authority and the way it has done its business since then has gradually restored confidence in it.</P>
    <P>The authority sat down to do its work very quickly, by the standards of government, and well within a year produced its proposals to the Government for its establishment in permanent form.  It decided not to advise the incorporation of proposals for a statutory Conference of Irish Universities in the legislation which would give statutory form to itself.  It has been suggested authoritatively that it was because the authority felt that this conference should not be set up until the reconstruction of the university system was completed.  That was an irrational view based on an optimistic assessment of the pace of reconstruction.  I am not sure it was a viewpoint that one could stand over now.  Indeed, I am not sure it was a viewpoint the authority would want to stand over.  The whole process of the reconstruction of the university system has ground to a halt and nothing has happened either in regard to the proposed association of the two Dublin colleges into a single university or with regard to the internal reform of these colleges.</P>
    <P>The question arises as to whether in fact the decision of the authority not to recommend simultaneous legislative action with regard to the Conference of Irish Universities and the Higher Education Authority itself, should be maintained.  As it has taken the Government such a long time, over a year and a half, to do anything about this recommendation it is a pity that the authority did not use that time to reconsider its view on the Conference of Irish Universities.  One can see why in the optimism of the time they thought it should be left until the university system was restructured but by now they must have realised it was a mistake. If that line is pursued we may not have a conference in existence for a few years to come.  We must realise the existence of such a body is important. One cannot help wondering whether their reluctance to press the <Col N="1046" /> matter over 18 months ago, when they made that recommendation, or their failure to do anything since, reflects the feeling they would like to get themselves off the ground first before any body, which might appear to be a rival body, is started.</P>
    <P>This Bill should have included provision for the Conference of Irish Universities.  In the Government's original statement in July, 1968, there was no suggestion about not having them contemporaneously.  Indeed, the two bodies are designed to be so complementary that a system involving one and not the other would become lop-sided and might not work as smoothly as it should.  I regret the authority's decision in respect of the Conference of Irish Universities and I regret their failure to reconsider that decision over a period of 18 months during which time they have waited, no doubt, with impatience for Government action.  I also regret that the Minister when introducing the Bill did not on his own initiative decide to do something about this and refer back to the authority and ask for their recommendations on the Conference of Irish Universities so that he might include provision for it in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I regret and deplore the delay in bringing this legislation before the House.  It is not easy to find any topic on which I have to address the House in respect of which I am not in a position to deplore the delay of the Government decision-making.  No matter what area of Government one discusses the problem is the same.  Things which in the private sector would be done in days or weeks take not just months but years when the Government and their servants get their hands on them.</P>
    <P>The Government were presented 18 months ago with recommendations for this Bill.  I have not seen these recommendations but clearly they were in considerable detail and if they were not a draft Bill they were heads for a draft Bill.  Parliamentary draughtsmen could have knocked the Bill together on the basis of what they were given in a couple of days, and for all I know they did, but it has taken over 18 months to bring the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that it <Col N="1047" /> is now almost four years since the late Deputy O'Malley made his announcement about the so-called merger involving the association of two Dublin colleges and one university.  There is not even a glimmer of a hope of a decision on this matter.  We are no further on.  I do not place the full blame for that on the present Minister; other forces have been at work. The proposals were perhaps misconceived in their origins and some of the detailed work done subsequently was mistaken in various ways but a good deal of the blame rests obviously in other quarters&mdash;the slow tempo of decision-making.  But from the point of view of the public, and I speak here as a public representative rather than as an academic, it is unsatisfactory that the matter has taken so long because everything is held up for the want of this.  The fact that this Bill does not contain, as it should contain, proposals for a Conference of Irish Universities, does not reflect any great credit on the Government or indeed on people in the universities who have been slow to make up their minds and have had difficulty in reaching agreement amongst themselves.</P>
    <P>While we are waiting for these decisions the universities are continuing in structures which are totally outdated. A serious breakdown was avoided less than two years ago in the largest college in this country because the structures of the college are so ill-designed that they do not reflect the wishes of either students or staff and for a period indeed the authority of those who control power in the college was so shaken that it lapsed for a period.  It was only with a degree of luck and a degree of hard work that it was possible to master that situation and bring that institution away from the bring of what could have been a disastrous situation and put it on an even keel again.</P>
    <P>Since then there has been no more trouble or effervescence in the college but that will not necessarily last.  We have had a sense of post-revolutionary anti-climax for the past 50 years and things have been peaceful but it is no thanks to the Government and the Minister who have failed to introduce <Col N="1048" /> any reforms in existing institutions or to make concrete proposals and implement them in legislation for a restructuring of the system.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister has many difficulties to face with regard to the proposed merger and, as I say, the delays are by no means all his fault.  The Minister should have faced the fact some time ago that it was going to take years to implement if year after year is to pass without anything being done. We cannot wait indefinitely for a reform of the institutional structure of these colleges, which is extraordinarily antiquated.  In the NUI it is a system which grew out of an uneasy compromise between such dispirited forces as the Irish Parliamentary Party, which has been defunct for some years past, the Irish Hirearchy at that time and the British Liberal Party, which has also been virtually defunct for some decades.</P>
    <P>The battle between these forces produced a particular structure enshrined in legislation, designed to be as rigid as an oyster in its shell, whose rigidity has failed completely to cope with the changes which have taken place during the last 60 years.  An institution whose structures were fossilised in a mould designed, not to meet the needs even of 60 years ago, but to meet the counter-pressures of different groups, several of which have disappeared since, is a dangerous structure to maintain.  Our universities are continuing to operate with difficulty and at any given moment they are on the brink of much greater difficulties, avoiding them only by luck and at times by the degree of skill exercised by those who have a responsible part to play whether they are staff or students.</P>
    <P>We should not allow our university structure to drift on in this condition, unreformed and without any immediate hope or prospect of reform because a particular proposal made by a particular Minister four years ago has got bogged down.  The association of the two Dublin colleges into a single university, if it is to happen, will require legislation but whether they are associated or not into a single university, the structures within those colleges will be much the same: the same problem of securing <Col N="1049" /> a democratic system responding on the one hand to the public interest, which these institutions must respond to, and on the other hand to the wishes and needs of those deeply involved in them, staff and students.  That need is there and the solutions to it will be the same whether these colleges are associated into a single university or not.</P>
    <P>The issue of the association of these colleges into a single university and the issue of the rationalisation of faculties, while of great importance and great interest, are not vital to the structures of the colleges.  In fact they have little to do with the structure of Trinity College, University College Cork or University College, Galway who have been left to continue in their antiquated structures, pending the resolution of a problem which is totally irrelevant to them.</P>
    <P>I would impress on the Minister the need for urgency in this regard because one cannot judge at what moment the persistence of outdated structures, which are not democratic in character, may lead to an explosion or an outburst. The fact that we got through one such outburst without fatal results should not lead the Minister to breathe a sigh of relief and think he can let things rest at that.</P>
    <P>It was pure accident, in many respects, that we succeeded in getting through on that occasion.  The same thing might not happen again.  It is a matter of serious neglect to allow year after year to pass and take no action to deal with this problem.  The blame for the neglect is not solely the Minister's. I am not aware that he has secured from academic bodies or even, indeed, from student bodies adequately worked out proposals for structural reform to encourage him to move in this matter.  There is a responsibility on the Government to initiate action and not always to wait for other people to press for it.  The need here is great and urgent.</P>
    <P>This Bill is isolated in many ways from the realities of the university system and it fails to do anything about the need for an academic co-ordinating system through conferences of Irish universities.  It fails to reform the structures <Col N="1050" /> of the colleges and it fails to tell us any more or to do anything about the proposed merger arrangement. While it is welcome in itself for the little it does&mdash;it is subject to many individual criticisms&mdash;I would hope that the Minister will see that it is inadequate and that he will see to it that other legislation dealing with these problems will come before us soon.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about some aspects of this Bill.  Before doing so I must refer in general terms to the question of university autonomy. This is a subject which is rarely discussed satisfactorily.  Usually it is either discussed within a university where the prevailing opinion is that autonomy means that the university should be allowed to run its own affairs and send the bill to the taxpayer, or else it is discussed outside the university amongst people who, frustrated by what appears to them at times to be the failure of the university to respond to community needs, regard the claiming of autonomy with either suspicion or lack of comprehension.</P>
    <P>You can have two sets of discussions, one inside the university and one outside, both failing to appreciate each other's viewpoint and with no great meeting of minds.  The truth is that this issue of autonomy is one which can only be settled in a sense by not settling it.  If you attempt to lay down everything in clear, legal, precise form, to divide responsibilities off one from the other between the Government and the universities and institutions of higher education, you are liable to get into difficulties.  It is only by not pursuing matters to their logical conclusion that the system can work in this area.  It must be recognised by the universities that if they wish to have the say in how they run their own internal affairs, they must act responsibly.  They must respond to legitimate community pressures. They must recognise the force of these pressures and they must want to meet them, within the limits imposed by their financial resources and the limits imposed by their duty above all to maintain their standards.</P>
    <P>On the part of those outside the universities concerned to ensure that the university does, in fact, achieve the <Col N="1051" /> goals which the community want it to achieve, there must be a recognition that any attempt to achieve this by directing the university to run particular courses, or to lower its standards in a particular area, any such direct intervention involving a legal power to direct, would undermine the autonomy of the university and, although it might achieve the immediate objective of securing the particular aim of community policy, it could be prejudical to the long-term interests of the country.</P>
    <P>In any given situation when there are two bodies each of which has its particular interest and rights, and when there is no system of arbitrating between them, tension will exist.  It can be constructive tension but it could be destructive.  If at any stage the Government were minded to take powers to intervene in certain matters which directly affect the life of the university, that could have disastrous consequences. Equally if the universities are minded to resist community pressures in a way which creates amongst public representatives a sense of legitimate frustration, the failure of the universities to respond to community needs could endanger their own autonomy.</P>
    <P>There is no clear-cut answer to this. It must be said for this Bill that, by establishing a buffer between the Government and the universities, something useful is being done, on the one hand to secure more adequately than hitherto the achievement of community aims and, on the other hand, to ensure the autonomy of the universities. I will have criticisms to make on particular aspects of the Bill as failing to meet these requirements perfectly or adequately.  The existence of such a body would be helpful.  We cannot have any body that would arbitrate between the Government and the universities because, particularly when it comes to the allocation of funds, the Government must ultimately have supreme authority, but the existence of a buffer body which could put the needs of the universities more cogently and in a more co-ordinated and comprehensible way to the Government, and which could iron out duplication where it might exist, and ensure that <Col N="1052" /> any demands for money are backed up by logical arguments, and are not the consequences of in-fighting between the institutions, will clearly be helpful in persuading the Government to provide the money.</P>
    <P>The existence of a body which will distribute that money between the institutions concerned, and which will get the Government out of the act, and ensure that the Government are not in a position of allocating funds directly to institutions and involving themselves to that extent rather directly in their affairs is a useful thing too.  So, the setting up of this body proposed in this Bill is something which everyone must welcome.  It is the best contribution we can make, subject to some changes which I shall propose in due course, to &mdash;I will not say to the solution&mdash;meeting the problem of maintaining university autonomy while ensuring that the Government have control over public expenditure, because about that we must be concerned in this House also.</P>
    <P>That is as far as one can push this issue of autonomy.  It is important to stress that there is no solution that is absolutely satisfactory and to resist any claim on either side to more than they are entitled to: to resist claims by the universities that they have the right to spend money and have it given to them without its having to be duly authorised by Parliament&mdash;not that they have claimed that but such thinking might arise at some stage&mdash;and to resist any claims by the Government to interfere with the internal life of the universities. I think that is as far as one can push this question of autonomy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill itself, there are a number of features I want to comment on.  Naturally a number of the points I will be making are, in their detailed implementation, more a matter for Committee Stage.  It may be helpful to air some of the major points so that the Minister can consider them in the meantime.  First of all the Bill makes no provision for student representation on this body.  I do not want to press this particular issue excessively. I do not suggest for a moment that in matters of long-term financial planning, which is what is involved here, the role of the students is likely to be nearly <Col N="1053" /> so important or vital as it is in the internal life of the university where everything that is done affects them directly: the lay out of courses and all the arrangements for running the university.  They all affect them.  They are the consumers.</P>
    <P>I feel and I have always felt that they must have an adequate voice and a very significant voice in the internal affairs of the university.  I do not suggest that the voice they should have on a body such as this should be comparable because I do not think that student representatives have as immediate an interest here or are likely to make as full a contribution here.  At the same time, their complete omission is a mistake I think.  I would say in this respect&mdash;and the Minister may agree with me&mdash;that the contribution that has been made by the Union of Students in Ireland to the evolution of policy in the past couple of years should command respect and I think it entitles them to consideration for representation on a body of this kind.</P>
    <P>I have found that the USI in the research work they have been doing, and the data they have been producing, have been doing an extraordinarily useful job.  It is rather paradoxical that because there are so many more students, and therefore they have the finance, they have a full-time staff who are able to do this kind of work and do it extremely well, whereas the university teachers being smaller in number have not got a full-time staff for this purpose.  While they have made a remarkable contribution in the papers they have submitted to the Irish Federation of University Teachers on many matters when it comes to research and quantification the USI are actually better equipped and they have made a very real contribution.  I have found that when I am stuck for information of a factual character often if I turn to them they have the information.  I have been impressed by the quality of the work they have done.  We are fortunate to have this body doing this work.</P>
    <P>Of course there can be many criticisims of any student body.  The congresses of the USI or the elections to SRCs are not always, even to politicians, <Col N="1054" /> entirely edifying but that should not take away at all from the solid work done by this body and the useful contribution it is making.  There is a strong case for some student representation here not as the USI have proposed&mdash;one third/one third/one third representation to students, academics and others.  I think for this body that is inappropriate.  Indeed I have said that to some student representatives. However, a couple of student representatives could, judging by the quality of the work they have been producing, make a useful contribution and they do have an interest in the work of this body although a less direct and vital one than they have in universities and institutions of higher education themselves.  I would, therefore, suggest to the Minister that he should consider making provision for some student representation and I will in fact bring in an amendment to that effect in due course.</P>
    <P>The question of the definition of &ldquo;academic post&rdquo; in section I has given rise to a good deal of comment from several bodies.  There is concern that academic representatives should be genuine academics, that they should be full time academics and not simply people who perhaps give a few lectures and classify therefore as having academic positions but whose interests are mainly outside the university.  That seems to be a fair point.  There is also a suggestion that it would be important, if they are to represent the academic viewpoint, that they should be not only at the time of their appointment but for the duration of their period of service members on an academic staff, that for example the appointment to this body of a 69 years old professor who will then remain on the body until he is 92 might not necessarily make as good a contribution as somebody who, throughout the period of his membership, continues to be an academic.  I think there is a point there though one is loth to tie things down too tightly because of course there will be cases where the man who will make the biggest contribution will be a man who has retired but retains a vital interest in academic affairs.  This is something we should look at.  There is concern among the academics and this <Col N="1055" /> has been expressed by the Irish Federation of University Teachers to ensure that academic representation is genuine, live, academic participation in this body.  That is a fair point.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the question of what bodies should be included. I think the Minister should consider including at this stage a number of bodies such as the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland which is clearly a body that ought to come within the framework of this Bill.  I am not quite sure why it was omitted.  I would hope that other bodies would be added to that but anyway the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is already in the same position as the universities and it certainly should be in at this stage whatever one can say about the other bodies.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely happy about giving to the Minister alone, though after consultation with the authority, the power to designate other institutions of higher education for the purposes of the Act. This is one of the things the authority should have the power to do.  It should have the power to initiate proposals for extending its functions to other bodies although the final decision should rest with the Minister.  I do not suggest that the authority should be able to add to its responsibilities off its own bat but I do suggest that it would be more satisfactory if it had the power of initiative and the Minister the power of decision in such a way that there would be an assurance that bodies which are elevated to the position of being under the auspices of this authority are ones which this authority itself feels are eligible for, and appropriate to such treatment.  A small amendment could perhaps achieve that result, which seems to me worth securing.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a chairman and members involves a rather unusual procedure when taken together.  The Minister appoints a chairman and then having consulted the chairman he has appointed he appoints the members.  I am not aware off-hand of that procedure being adopted elsewhere.  I am open to correction on that.  I think there is a strong case for any body choosing its own chairman.  For a body to be <Col N="1056" /> chosen by the chairman, in part, is a singular reversal of known procedure.  I wonder if the Minister would indicate why he is adopting this curious procedure. It may be that it, in some way, relates back to the way the <i>ad hoc</i> authority was chosen.  It is quite possible that the then Minister did consult Doctor Rafferty who became chairman of it before he selected the members but it is one thing to launch the <i>ad hoc</i> body in that way&mdash;there may have been particular reasons for that at the time, Doctor Rafferty was at that time Secretary of the Department of Education if I recall correctly because it was his transfer to this post of chairman which was the occasion of his departure from the secretaryship&mdash;the fact that that was done then, if it was done then, does not make it good normal procedure.</P>
    <P>I feel the same procedure should be followed here as is followed in other similar cases, that the chairman should be chosen by the body itself.  I can see that the Minister will say that in State-sponsored bodies the Minister often chooses all the members including the chairman but it is a bit different here because he is, in fact, introducing a new element of which I am not aware in State bodies, of the chairman himself having been chosen and helping to choose the other members.  It is a little different from establishing a State body and appointing a board and nominating a chairman just like that.  It seems to relegate the chairman into a very particular position and all the members are beholden to him, in part, for having been nominated.  That would suggest a kind of relationship which is not the happiest one for this body.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider that arrangement or at least to start by explaining it to us and if the explanation seems to us and to him unconvincing then to reconsider it.  There are other questions to do with the chairman and indeed the members, as to how long they should hold office.  These are matters for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On the powers of the body the question arises as to whether more safeguards are needed to preserve those elements of the autonomy of these institutions which should properly be <Col N="1057" /> preserved if not to them individually at least to them working within a conference of Irish universities.  The powers given to the authority are in some respects undefined and open-ended. One of the disadvantages of establishing this authority now in a Bill which does not include provision for a conference of Irish universities is that this body starts off with rather open-ended powers and the conference when established has to carve out a niche for itself in an area where the authority could claim to have a competence. A combination of a two stage operation establishing the authority first and the conference second and giving the authority rather open-ended powers is a somewhat unhappy one and suggests at the least that perhaps some safeguards for academic autonomy&mdash;by that I do not necessarily mean autonomy in one institution but either the autonomy of the individual institution or of the institutions taken together in the conference of Irish universities&mdash;should be preserved in matters such as admission standards, staff/student ratios and so on.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is the controversial one. The Minister has indicated that he has had second thoughts on this, I think following representations to him by the Higher Education Authority.  I am not entirely clear&mdash;it is rather difficult to take this in at short notice&mdash;what exactly the Minister is proposing.  I would like him to explain more fully what he means by the Book of Estimates containing, by way of information, details in relation to the various institutions concerned to show how the bulk sums were arrived at.  If I understand this correctly, it is just as prejudicial as section 12, as it stands, because, if the Book of Estimates is to contain a statement as to how the sums were arrived at, this immediately prejudices the authority in the distribution of the total sum it receives.  We have to make up our minds to it that, when this body is established, there will be a grant, or a grant-in-aid&mdash;I hesitate to say which in view of current events&mdash;to it and the size of that will be determined by the Government in their own discretion, having heard the representations of the authority, and, if the Government give the full grant, one would <Col N="1058" /> expect the authority in all logic to distribute it in accordance with the proposals it has itself submitted.  If the Government do not give the full grant and, so far, Governments have not given anything near the full grant required by universities&mdash;they have fallen far below minimum requirements in all respects&mdash;then it is a matter for the authority to decide where the cuts will have to be made.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister mean when he says the Book of Estimates will contain, by way of information, details in relation to the various institutions concerned to show how the bulk sums were arrived at?  I wonder does the Minister appreciate the significance of what he says because, if that means what it says, it implies that the sum granted will be in all cases the sum sought.  A Book of Estimates containing sums more than the sum voted would be curious and that would be the consequence of what the Minister said.  If the sum granted is somewhat less than the sum sought that would be a different matter.  Does the Minister propose that the full sum will be given in each case or does he propose to insert in the Book of Estimates sums beyond what are voted?  Has the Minister thought out the logic of what he has just said?  Because of relatively recent representations made to him he may not have fully thought out the implications and, perhaps, the suggestion that this should be done is designed in some way to keep some kind of departmental control over the allocation of the amounts.  If that is so, then I am against it in its own right; it is an awkward and unworkable system for the reasons I have just given.  The Minister should forget that and arrange that the authority is given a sum which the Government decide should be allocated for university education and, if that sum is the full grant sought, the authority will distribute it accordingly.  The authority will have to decide whether the case will be made.  I cannot understand the logic of retaining control.  I do not think this is relevant, proper or workable, for the reasons I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Minister's statement <Col N="1059" /> that he proposes to amend section 12, I will await the form of his amendment&mdash;I may put down one of my own to spur him on&mdash;and I would hope that he would explain more fully what his intentions are when he comes to reply to the debate and give us a further indication of precisely what he proposes to do with section 12.  This is very important because this is a most sensitive area.  It is one in respect of which universities and university teachers have reacted most strongly and the Higher Education Authority has been in touch with the Minister about it.  The Minister is aware of the importance of doing the right thing here.  The whole value of the Higher Education Authority would be undermined if its role as distributor of the grants secured by its representations were diminished in any way by Government intervention.  If we are going to have a Higher Education Authority between the Government and its institutions, then let us have it, and be done with it, but no half measures of this kind.  I hope the Minister's amendment will clear the matter up once and for all and resolve this problem.</P>
    <P>When one considers the internal autonomy of the colleges and their power to use the money the Higher Education Authority allocates to them, one should be very clear about what we want.  On the one hand, we do not want colleges putting in for money to build a library, getting it, and building a canteen instead.  If I were the Government I should be slow to permit that kind of thing to happen.  These capital grants must be expended on the purposes for which the Higher Education Authority allocates them and the authority should impose conditions on the spending of these capital grants. The situation is different in the case of current expenses.  Each college will make its submission with regard to its needs.  It will have to discuss these and justify its figures, perhaps more fully than it is required to do at present, with, one hopes, more constructive and generous results.  The authority having decided the sum to be given, it would be quite wrong if, in the spending of that money, there was a tight control over every item.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1060" /> The kind of case the universities and the Higher Education Authority will make will be that its staff/student ratio is inadequate and it will need more staff; salaries will have to be increased; more equipment will be needed in certain areas.  When it comes to spending the money, as in any institution, the exact pattern of expenditure will never be indentical with what is proposed.  It may say it needs 40 more academic staff and its maintenance costs will go up by a certain amount.  When it comes to the point it may not be able to get 40 extra academic staff and, at the same time, it may be short of money to cut the grass, or something.  In all reason, when it comes to current expenditure, the institutions must be allowed flexibility within the total sum.  At the moment they are forced to justify all expenditure and they must submit their accounts at the end of the year.  Any deviation from the general pattern will be known to the Higher Education Authority and it would be wrong, as the Bill suggests, to tie down the precise pattern of expenditure to the exact pattern set out in the university's budget.  It is quite proper with regard to capital expenditure but undesirable with regard to current expenditure. Some amendment is needed to cover that point.</P>
    <P>On the question of the aims and objectives of the Higher Education Authority, the Bill formulates these in sections 3 and 4 in a way which is not entirely satisfactory.  First of all, in section 3 it selects as general functions of the authority, in addition to the specific functions it may have, furthering the development of higher education, assisting in the co-ordination of State investment in higher education and preparing proposals for such investment, and promoting an appreciation of the value of higher education and research.  I wonder how these were selected.  I could think of a different list equally valid.</P>
    <P>In section 4 we have the statutory adjuration to bear in mind constantly the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture.  This has been included in similar phraseology in other Acts, such as the Broadcasting <Col N="1061" /> Authority Act.  These two sections set out a framework.  They specify the criteria by which the work of the authority is to be guided.  I am not sure they are adequate as a statement of what the authority should be about. If we want to give guidance to the authority as to the things it should aim at doing, we should be a little more concrete.  &ldquo;Furthering the development of higher education&rdquo; and &ldquo;promoting an appreciation of its value&rdquo; are very vague phrases.  Are they worth putting in?  Are they not things any authority would be doing automatically?  Could you imagine an authority doing anything which did not involve these things?</P>
    <P>There is something to be said for being a little more specific and setting out the criteria by which the authority should judge the proposals put before it in order to determine its decisions and these criteria would, I suggest, include, on the one hand, what is loosely called the democratisation of education &mdash;that is, endeavouring to ensure to the maximum degree possible equality of opportunity.  This is a legitimate aim and it is no harm to write it in.  There is also, however, the less popular and, for that very reason, perhaps more important, maintenance of standards. This should be written in.  It was one of the great merits of the Commission on Higher Education, whose report did have many defects, including the length of time it took to prepare it, that it laid stress on this, unfashionable stress but, for that very reason, necessary stress, on the maintenance of standards. Indeed, the chairman of that commission, in talking to university teachers, which he had occasion to do once or twice, laid great stress on the need to stand firm on the maintenance of standards and not to be sidetracked in response to even legitimate popular pressures.  The pressures are there, legitimate and proper pressures, but it is important that, in allowing these pressures to have effect, we do not prejudice standards and there is a danger they will be prejudiced.</P>
    <P>I should like to see among the aims of the Authority that aim to which the commission attached such importance enshrined there as a guideline to them <Col N="1062" /> so that if, at some time it is under pressure to follow a particular course of action which could be prejudicial to standards, it has something to fall back on and it could say: &ldquo;We must bear in mind the maintenance of standards and your proposal is one which would be prejudicial to this.&rdquo;  The Minister might give a little thought to the wording of these aims.  They are at present so general as to be meaningless and useless and should either be omitted or replaced by something of practical value to the Authority in its work.</P>
    <P>My only other detailed comment on the Bill itself is that at several points the approval of the Minister is inserted as a requirement in a manner which I think is quite unnecessary and seems to betoken the Civil Service origins of the Bill.  The Authority must be seen to be an independent Authority.  If it wants to recruit staff it must be free to do so; it must be free to dismiss, staff. It is quite wrong that the approval of the Minister should be involved in these matters.  There has been far too much of this tendency to exert quite bureaucratic control over bodies that should be independent.  I know of one research body in respect of which, at a meeting at which I was present some years ago when some question arose of a member of the staff going to a research conference abroad, we were solemnly told that this could not be done because the Minister and the Department concerned said there was a shortage of money and in his Department nobody was going to leave the country for a certain period.  This was considered to be mandatory on this allegedly independent body.  The matter was fought and settled but the fact that this kind of claim could be made, that this attempt to impose departmental policy could arise in an independent body, shows the need to eliminate this kind of attempt to the the hands of those concerned.</P>
    <P>It is very important that this body should be independent if it is to have the confidence of the academic community&mdash;which it must have&mdash;as well as the confidence of the Government and the public.  It is important that it should be seen to be independent and that it should have power to select its own staff and that the staff should not <Col N="1063" /> be civil servants on secondment.  I do not mean that none of them should be because we are fortunate at the moment in that we have Dr. Rafferty who is not, of course, on secondment but came directly from the public service and to whose work on this body I have already paid tribute.  I do not know the staff of the body intimately but I know of one member of the staff who was seconded from the public service and who is doing an excellent job there.  I do not wish to rule out such people but it is very important that the corpus of staff should as a whole not be drawn from the Civil Service concerning which the Minister must accept that the academic community have suspicions just as deep as public servants have about academics.  That mutual suspicion would best be met by having this body staffed as independently as possible.  Anything that appears to tie the hands of the Authority in this matter and which involves seeking the Minister's approval could happily be deleted, without any loss.  If the Minister thinks about it I believe he will agree that it is better to omit it and retain or secure confidence in this body than to have this sort of provision which appears to tie their hands in a manner that can do no real good but could do harm.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points of a more general character that I wish to make before I conclude.  I should like the Minister to say what he proposes about this body and its method of reporting. We had one general report from this body so far.  I took it that this was its first annual report but although it has produced, I think, two other reports since then on particular topics, it has not produced a second general report. A body of this kind should have the same obligation to produce an annual report as any other of its type, any other State-sponsored body carrying out functions in the public interest. I do not know if it is worth writing it into the Bill.  I am reluctant to write in things that might tie the hands of the Authority but the rather surprising fact that it has not produced a second annual report a year after the first makes one wonder whether it is necessary to require this.  I should have <Col N="1064" /> thought that a suggestion from the Minister that he would like to see a report might be sufficient without necessarily putting it into the legislation. Perhaps the Minister would indicate his views on this subject?  While, of course, we value the special reports of the Authority on particular topics&mdash;we may agree or disagree with them but they are valuable&mdash;we are entitled to have a report each year on progress so that we know how it is getting on because it has a great deal of work to do and we would like to keep an eye on how it does it.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been aroused not only in academic circles but in wider circles about the autonomy of this body and its functions because of the rather curious and, as far as I know, unresolved conflict between the Authority and the Department on the question of the capital needs of higher education in the years ahead.  We had a statement in, I think, the general report of the Authority on what these capital needs would be.  We had a statement by the Minister&mdash;I cannot recall whether it was from the present Minister or his predecessor; I think it was the present Minister&mdash;that the sum required to achieve the same objective would be enormously less.  Subject to correction, I think the figures were £25 million and £15 million.  I think there is confusion here to which the Minister may have inadvertently contributed. I do not think the same job can be done for the different sums of money.  In fact, I think more is involved here than less expensive building standards and that the two bodies, the Minister and his Department on one hand and the Authority on the other, are talking of different things.</P>
    <P>The Minister must appreciate that if the Authority produces a figure of this kind it is a considered assessment and it is the Authority's job to produce this assessment.  If this is shot down by the Minister and his Department as too high by two-thirds for a given amount of building space this can only raise doubts on one hand, about the competence of the Authority and on the other, about the competence of the Department.  Both cannot be right, if in fact the two figures relate to the same thing.  There is a deep suspicion&mdash;probably <Col N="1065" /> justified&mdash;in academic circles that they do not and that the Minister in naming this figure of £15 million was not simply saying: &ldquo;We know how to build cheaper than you do&rdquo; but &ldquo;We do not think you should build so much&rdquo; or &ldquo;You should be building different things&rdquo;.  Either way, this unfortunate conflict has arisen and it is one that has raised serious doubts about whether this Authority is allowed to do its job because it is its job to decide what buildings are required and what the cost will be.  It is the Government's job to decide if it will give the money.  I am not suggesting the Government should fork out £25 million if the Authority says so.  If the Government so decide that it cannot afford the money or that some of the money is for purposes which it does not regard as sufficiently urgent, that is the job of the Government to do.  It is quite different if the Government say: &ldquo;We think your figure is wrong; you have made a mistake in calculating it; you have over-estimated building costs.&rdquo;  I do not think that is the function of the Government.  Of course, when the time comes to build, the Government could legitimately offer the benefit of its building expertise to the Authority if it thought it was needed and advise the Authority on any way in which it could build more cheaply.  That could be done privately and comfortably behind the scene and if, as a result, we get the same amount of buildings for less than £25 million everybody will be very happy, the institutions concerned, the HEA and the public.</P>
    <P>This controversy has been unfortunate and has raised doubts.  It should be clear that this is a matter for the Authority and I think the Minister should clarify the matter.  I know he has had some discussions with, I think, among others, the Irish Federation of University Teachers.  I am not aware of the outcome of these discussions, at least in any detail.  I still have no clear or satisfactory picture as to how this divergence arose.  It would be helpful if the Minister explained it to us and would help to clear up what is, perhaps, no more than a misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>The figure of £25 million seemed to <Col N="1066" /> me at the time not inappropriate.  It represented about twice the annual building rate then current which was £2 million a year.  I should have thought that if the Authority was right in its assessment of future student needs&mdash;and this is a matter of opinion &mdash;if the student needs were there, it would require approximately double the very inadequate rate of building we have seen until recently.  I accept that these are matters of opinion and that my opinion is worth no more than that of anybody else and less, perhaps, than the Minister's or the Authority's as I am in less direct contact with it.</P>
    <P>There is another report of the Authority to which I should like to make reference because I have not had occasion to do so hitherto and I think this is a legitimate opportunity to do so.  I refer to the Teacher Training Report.  I found this report most unsatisfactory, unsatisfactory because I disagreed not only with its conclusions, which is a very good reason, but also with its logic, which is a more profound reason.</P>
    <P>The Minister may recall, because I think he has a special interest in this subject, that this report quoted from an international source with a view to validating the decision it took as to the way teacher training should be carried out.  He should read carefully that rather long footnote in which is set out the view of the international body representing a number of countries, including ourselves, as to how teacher training should be carried out.  As far as I can see the recommendation of the authority was really in direct conflict with this international viewpoint which it was quoting in support of what it was doing.  I am not just saying that without having given it thought or without having consulted people directly concerned. I have endeavoured to discover if there was any method of reconciling the two and I have argued with the people concerned and the argument has convinced me that I am right and the two are not reconcilable.  I think our teacher training is in danger of taking a wrong turning because the authority have not taken an imaginative enough position on it.</P>
    <P>The viewpoint of Fine Gael, set out <Col N="1067" /> in our policy document four years ago, is that very serious consideration should be given as to whether in the Irish circumstances teacher training should not be carried out by first of all arranging for the aspiring teachers to get a university degree in a university college and then completing&mdash;and this is what happens with secondary teachers&mdash;the teacher training subsequently.  I am aware of arguments which would appear to contradict this but I think one can reconcile them.  I am aware that the idea of one year actual training in teaching techniques may seem inadequate but&mdash;and this is something to which we gave a lot of thought and we had consultations with many people on this matter, some of them directly concerned in teacher training&mdash;what we had in mind was that people who wanted to do teaching would do an ordinary BA, not a B.Ed, which is what is implied by this unfortunate recommendation, which would then be treated as a second class qualification, but that through an arrangement with the university they would be able to do a certain amount of concurrent training in theory and practice of education during the period of the BA, if they were doing a general BA.</P>
    <P>If they were doing an Honours BA then the position would be different and the advantage of getting the specialised knowledge of the subject and the ability to teach it at a high level would compensate because such teachers would then be teaching at a level where the actual method of teaching is a little less important and that would compensate for the lack of this continuous pedagogic training during the period.  Having completed the university training you would then have general degree students who would have had contemporaneous training in theory and practice in education, and honours students who would not have it, and the two together would then go on for a year devoted to the whole question of the techniques of teaching.</P>
    <P>In fact, at the moment there is a two-year course in the training college. As far as I am aware the time over the two years is broadly divided between academic subjects and teacher training <Col N="1068" /> in the narrower sense.  The total amount of time that would be available for training in theory and practice of teaching in education would under my proposal be no less and in the case of general students who would have done a certain amount of work contemporaneous with the degree course would be rather more.  It would mean that our teachers would have the advantage of a university education in all cases.  I do not believe you are going to get ultimate complete acceptance of the concept of the single teaching profession if you are going to turn out one lot of teachers in teacher training colleges, elevated to give B.Ed's, and other teachers going to universities and then going on to do a subsequent course.  I am well aware that the subsequent course as done in the university has traditionally not been very satisfactory and in some cases is still not satisfactory.  I am not defending the H.Dip. in Ed. for one moment, as at present practised in some of these institutions, but you are not going to resolve the basic problem of the unity of the teaching profession with which the Minister is deeply concerned, in the long run if you have these two different systems.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know, and his predecessor should have known, that you cannot just elevate the existing teacher training colleges into colleges giving degrees overnight, and expect that their degrees will be recognised immediately as university degrees. There is a big difference between these institutions and universities.  Even in St. Patrick's College which is one of the best equipped training colleges, both in terms of its premises and of its staff, and which has the advantage of having this research unit working there, I do not think they would claim that overnight it could become, without a transitional period, a university college whose degrees would be accepted everywhere.  The idea that all these colleges could be so converted overnight and that they then give a B.Ed., because only teachers would be going there, and that this would be accepted as having parity with university degrees, is not the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister may like to think that it would be but it will not.  It seems <Col N="1069" /> much more to the point that, as we are at the stage where in any event our university education is relatively cheap, particularly in the case of the general degree, where the actual cost is much less than the teacher training course at present, which is largely residential, we could in fact at very little cost, if not at some saving, give a university education to all our teachers and ensure that they do not start their full training period until they have had that.  The system of bringing in people straight from school and putting them through a training college, even if you elevate it and call it something else, and call the qualification at the end a B.Ed., is not satisfactory.  All teachers have a right to a full university education in a university institution in which there are other students not going on to be teachers.  They must not be segregated into separate institutions.  That has gone on too long and the proposal which the Minister and his predecessor have being pursuing, and a proposal which is endorsed by the Higher Education Authority, wrongly I think, would continue this.  I appeal to the Minister not to accept in this case the authority report automatically.  He should consider very carefully the implications. I would hope that one or more of the existing teacher training colleges could quite quickly become university colleges with a transitional period.  I am not suggesting that the existing institutions must remain and simply do the year's course afterwards.  On the contrary. In the case of St. Patrick's, in particular, things could be organised so that working in conjunction with an existing university college for a few years it could very quickly reach the point where it could become a full university college and would have coming to it all kinds of people who are not going to become teachers at all. Some of the other institutions would continue their training college functions doing a one year's course and at the same time I would hope the H.Dip in Ed. course in the universities for secondary teachers would be improved drastically and would be made much more full time.  That would require financial assistance for the students so that they would not have to teach during that year.  That would be one of <Col N="1070" /> the Minister's main priorities.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have an open mind on the question of teacher training and not just accept his predecessor's policy or the HEA recommendations without further thought but that he will examine the internal logic of that document which seems to me to be seriously defective.</P>
    <P>One other point which I wish to air for the benefit of the Minister is that I am not convinced that the present method of financing undergraduate education in universities by block grants to the university, enabling the university to cut the fees by an average of three-quarters, is the right system.  It is socially objectionable and it does not help the autonomy of the universities. As things are, if a school student gets two or three honours and does not qualify for a Government grant his ability to go to university is determined by his parents' ability to pay the fee and to keep him during his time at the university.  If they can pay the fee of £85 or £120 or whatever it may be, then the Minister in his generosity will give him three times as much again, because by giving block grants the universities are enabled to reduce their fees by three-quarters, and in some cases by over three-quarters.  What happens is that the man who can afford to pay £100 perhaps, for a particular course, gets access to the £300 of Government aid for students, which is the average aid for students at the university at present&mdash; but only if he has £100.  The student whose parents cannot afford the entrance fee does not get the benefit of the Government's £300.  This is a reverse of the whole basic principle of our social welfare code.  Here we have a system of to whomsoever hath, it shall be given because if the student has the £100 the Government will help him.</P>
    <P>I should prefer a system whereby the full fee for university education was charged and reimbursed by student grants.  It would be preferable that the universities should not receive direct grants but that the student should receive the grant and he should be able to spend the full £400 at the university of his choice.  The universities should <Col N="1071" /> not have to look to the Government for finance and the students should be financed regardless of their parents' means.</P>
    <P>That is the last point I wish to make as we have reached the time for adjournment of Public Business and another speaker may wish to contribute on the resumption of Public Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like at the outset to condemn some of the statements made by my colleague, Deputy Clinton, with regard to my efforts and <Col N="1072" /> the efforts made by the previous Minister for Local Government in this matter.  Deputy Clinton said I gave a public assurance that something would be done about the increased rates of the building societies.  He stated that nothing concrete was done and this was a condemnation of me.  As a public representative of an area in which a large number of people had expressed their dissatisfaction regarding the interest rates charged by building societies, I gave a public assurance that I would urge the Government to look into this problem in a speedy and efficient manner.  That assurance was given and was given back to me by the then Minister for Local Government, by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce and by the Minister for Finance who was directly involved at that time.</P>
      <P>I represent a constituency in which there is a large number of young married couples.  Many of these young people have been tortured by the increased rates demanded by the building societies during the years.  I express my sympathy with borrowers whose interest rate has been increased, in particular those who originally were charged a rate of 5 per cent and now find themselves having to pay 8 per cent.  This is no credit to the building societies in view of the fact that many of these borrowers were within two or three years of completing payments on their houses.  Many of the people who found themselves in this position had to re-budget their family income. People such as gardaí or civil servants or those in similar occupations had to adjust their budgets in an effort to meet the increased costs of the building societies.  It was unjust that they should have been put in this position when they were within reach of owning their homes.  For most couples the only piece of property they will ever own is their own home and it was shattering to find that they had to continue payments for another four or five years.  I express sympathy with these people and I hope the Minister in his reply will give some hope and assistance to the people who have suffered as a result of these increased rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must recognise that building <Col N="1073" /> societies borrow money on short term and loan it on a long term basis and this course cannot be recommended.  I realise that people are inclined to invest their money for a period and, having made substantial profits, they withdraw it when they need it for themselves.  The building societies should encourage long term investment and they can do this by offering attractive terms.  The societies should realise that long term investment may be the solution rather than increasing the interest rates as has been done in the recent past.</P>
    <P>A large number of building societies advertise on television and radio.  They are all looking for money and I see no reason why they cannot join together and run a joint advertising campaign rather than each conduct an expensive advertising campaign.  At the moment six building societies are advertising on television and radio; three are from one company and two are from another company.  It appears ludicrous to me that they do not cut their costs by having a joint campaign. By doing this they could save a considerable amount of money which might be diverted towards helping to reduce the high interest rates now charged.  There should not be any problem for the societies to get together in the manner I have outlined.  If the Government decided that the building societies should come together there would not be any difficulty in having joint managership and having the societies operate as a single entity.  I feel very strongly about this matter.  I consider that amalgamation such as I have outlined would eliminate duplication of expense and would be a worthwhile course to follow.</P>
    <P>The Government should urge young people to invest money in building societies and to help the societies which play a major role in our building industry. I am on record on the 15th November, 1969 in the <i>Evening Press</i> and the <i>Irish Times</i> as having said that I realised the building societies play a vital role&mdash;a role the Government would not be able to play at the moment.  If the Government decided to do this they would need tremendous financial resources which could be expanded so that other less well off <Col N="1074" /> sectors of the community could benefit. In this way the building societies could help the Government and help themselves by allowing young people to invest their money on a long term basis so that when the time came for requesting a loan from the building society, the early investment by these young people would reap its reward.  They would gain the facilities which they would normally expect to gain from the local authority or some other body.</P>
    <P>I requested an inquiry.  An inquiry is being carried out, and here I want to differ from my colleague, Deputy Mark Clinton, who said nothing has been done.  However, I urge the Minister, in the interest of all the middle-class people who are burdened with these increases, which will continue if we do not do something about it, to ensure that when loans are granted building societies will make it quite clear to the borrowers that the rate can be increased. I have had numerous letters from young people who did not know whether they should seek a lawyer's advice or go ahead and pay the increased rate.  Deputy Clinton made a case here for a person who did not pay it and went on paying the old rate.  I had a similar case, and the person who paid the old rate discovered afterwards he would never own his house by paying the old rate.  He therefore, had to pay the new rate which was such a heavy burden that the family had to readjust their financial affairs.  The Minister should ensure that the terms of building society agreements are legible and that important conditions are not to be concealed in small print in the document.</P>
    <P>I have expressed my dissatisfaction about this matter in the newspapers and I shall continue to do so until something is done about it.  This motion requests an inquiry, but an inquiry is being held.  I would urge the Minister to do what he can to expedite this inquiry and thus ease the minds of the thousands of borrowers who are completely dismayed and many of whom, as I say, have had to adjust their incomes or, perhaps, sell their houses and live in flats because the payments were beyond their means. The Minister is capable of tackling this <Col N="1075" /> problem, and I do not believe there is any necessity for this motion.  However, the principle is a good one, and it is not merely the concern of the Opposition that is involved here.  There is concern in the Government benches also for the middle-class people who are shouldering the greatest burden here.</P>
    <P>If it is necessary for the Government to take over the building societies this should be done.  That may be a very drastic remedy but if something positive is not done there will be complete dismay among borrowers.  No resources will be available to help them, and the payments will be too heavy for them.  If this happens our whole building industry will fall asunder.  I do not want to see that happen, and I am convinced that if the problem is tackled in a workmanlike way it can be solved.  I would ask the Minister to look into this matter and to let us know in his concluding speech when the findings of this inquiry will be made known to the public.</P>

    <P>Everyone realises the important part building societies play in trying to satisfy the housing needs of people.  It is quite possible that local authorities who have money which they can lend for house purchase may never be called on to lend much of that money because they cannot lend money above a certain ceiling limit.  Even a modest house costs £4,500 or £5,000 yet local authorities in Dublin anyway cannot lend more than £3,000.  This means that purchasers have to find an extra £1,500.  Many people find that because they cannot save the deposit they are unable to avail of a local authority <Col N="1077" /> loan and they have to turn instead to building societies.</P>
    <P>Most people, apart from those in the higher income brackets, buy only one house in their lifetime.  They have to consider this very carefully and even if they decide to buy a washing machine they must weigh up all the pros and cons before they decide what to buy. They may buy several television sets and several cars but buying a house is a great transaction in their lives.</P>
    <P>Before Dublin Corporation give a loan they inquire into the applicant's income, in order to ensure that the applicant can afford the repayments and provide for his family as well.  He may not have a family at that time but long before he has paid for the house he will have a family.  Dublin Corporation insist that a certain amount is left after the repayments, rates, <i>et cetera</i> are allowed for.  Dublin County Council announced today that deposits on houses at Donaghmead are to be increased by £200.  I do not think this will be welcome news to many prospective house-purchasers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton rightly pointed out that the wholesale tax has added to the cost of housing and the increased tax on cement and timber has also increased the cost of housing.  The average person decides how much he can afford to repay but after five or ten years, and by this time he may have a family, the building societies increase the rate at a time when he can hardly afford to pay what he originally agreed to pay; and possibly in another five years or even less, when the children are going to school and there is considerable expense involved in clothing them, he finds the building society is calling on him to pay even more money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Foley said he did not see much need for this motion.  This motion has been on the Order Paper for quite some time.  The inquiry was probably started when the motion was put down and I will give Deputy Foley full credit for his efforts.  An old proverb which states that it is often the last straw which breaks the camel's back may ring true.  It is possible that this extra push may have helped.</P>

      <P>I did not put it down.  Actually it was Deputy Foley's colleague, Deputy Clinton, who did. The motion says:</P>
      <P>...to examine the causes giving rise to the increase by building societies in mortgage interest rates for existing borrowers;</P>
      <P>There is no harm in asking for an inquiry to be held to examine the causes of the increase in interest rates and to report on the need that is claimed for increases and whether and when such increases can be reduced.</P>
      <P>As the Minister agreed when I put down the question, the building societies have some special arrangements&mdash;I do not know exactly what they are&mdash;some special concessions due to the fact that they lend money to help people to acquire their own houses.  If those societies get special privileges for this reason, they should be aware of their responsibilities.  I am not saying they are not.  Possibly they are.  Not only should Deputy Foley welcome this motion but the building societies should also be glad to be given this opportunity.  If building societies have a case to make&mdash;and perhaps they have&mdash;if they are entitled to an increase and can justify it, there is no use in having a whispering campaign going on outside that they are putting up the interest rates when they like and making huge profits.  This would come out in an inquiry.  The building societies should be glad of this opportunity to show the public that they are not doing this just because they want to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Foley had one criticism of the building societies which I found hard to follow.  He said that different building societies advertised separately on radio and television.  He seemed to indicate that he thought they should advertise together.  This might help them to economise but I do not see what is wrong with the present system.  We must remember that each building society wants to get money for itself. There are several other firms engaged in the same business.  On radio and television it is quite common for <Col N="1079" /> several firms engaged in the same business, and with the same product to sell, to have separate advertisements. We have this in the case of beer.</P>

      <P>It is only a point. Deputy Clinton raised another point of which I was not aware.  I am sure Deputy Foley is aware of it.  I represent a city constituency and I have very little to do with farming.  Deputy Foley would have something to do with farming. The Agricultural Credit Corporation lend money to farmers at a special rate and there is a subsidy on the interest rates for farmers.  I am sure that very many Dublin people would be interested to hear this, because the average Dublin person believes that the Government are giving too much by way of subsidies and otherwise to farmers, and too little to city people. I do not see why the Minister could not devise some scheme to subsidise the interest rate on housing, or to give some relief to the person who is trying to buy a house.  To the normal city dweller the buying of a house is as important as any undertaking engaged in by a farmer.  If it is right to subsidise farmers&mdash;I am not saying it is not&mdash;surely it is equally right to help the city dweller in this huge undertaking and to help him to live in peace and quiet without having to wonder and worry about when he will hear that the building society has had to increase its rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I am appealing to this youthful Minister.  Surely it is not beyond his power or his capability to devise some scheme whereby the purchaser of a house could say at the start: &ldquo;I will be able to pay so much per month and after so many years I will own my own house.&rdquo;  It has been pointed out by every Deputy who has spoken so far, Deputy Clinton, Deputy O'Connell and <Col N="1080" /> Deputy Foley, that as things stand at the moment, if the purchaser finds when the building society asks for an increase that he is unable to pay it, that he is stretched to the limit of what he can pay, his only alternative is that he can continue to pay the old rate but he will never own the house.  That is a dreadful thought.  The Minister should try to solve that problem and to ensure that people in urban areas who embark on the project of buying a house will own their own houses in 25 or 30 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department should do everything possible to encourage these people to provide their own houses.  Under such a scheme there are quite a number of people who could buy their own houses but, because they cannot have any definite idea of what their repayments will be they wait and try to get the local authority to house them.  Therefore an unnecessary number are thrown onto the waiting list to be housed by the local authority.  If the amount could be fixed at a certain level and the borrower knew he would have to pay the amount&mdash;as he knows in the case of a local authority loan&mdash;that would help to relieve the local authorities of a certain number of housing cases with which they have to deal.</P>
    <P>I do not see that this motion has done any harm.  Deputy Foley seemed to think it had.  I think there was every need for it.  It certainly did not hinder but helped the starting of such an inquiry. As regards the building societies it gives them an opportunity to justify their claims if they have a case, and possibly they have, for an increase in their rates of interest and it prevents people from wrongly criticising them for doing so.  The Minister should wholeheartedly accept this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1969.  Late in the year 1969.  I hope they will be able to report to me within two months. The whole question of building societies is very interesting and one should get it into perspective.  My remarks, of course, will not cover those matters which are at the moment under review by the Committee.</P>
      <P>When one speaks about housing and especially when the Minister for Local Government speaks about housing he must keep at the forefront of his mind the various sources of capital for housebuilding.  There is no doubt that the building societies are a vital source of capital for housing and are a very important arm in the provision of finance to enable us to continue with an adequate housing programme.  The question of increasing the flow of funds into the building societies was raised several times and is included in the terms of the motion.  I can only illustrate the extent to which building societies are involved in housebuilding and the increasing investment that they are making in housebuilding by giving figures which are available to me since the early 1960s.  Since then they have more than trebled their annual lending for house purchase and in fact in that period lent up to £76 million for housebuilding.  That is quite a sizeable contribution and there are many thousands of our people who would not be housed today if it were not for the contribution which the building societies made and the opportunities which the building societies gave to these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two sides to the operation of building societies.  One of course is the borrowing of the money which is then lent so there is borrowing on one hand and lending on the other. The money that is borrowed, of course, is on short call and those investors who <Col N="1082" /> place money with the building societies can withdraw their money at very short notice.  However, the money that is lent by the building societies is usually lent for a period of 25 years. So, we have a situation where long term lending is being operated by the building societies but on short term borrowing.  The difficulties for the building societies should be quite obvious. To ensure a continuous flow of funds to them they must offer current interest rates, interest rates which will be attractive to people who have money to invest.  When we speak about those who invest in building societies it is as well to mention that investments vary in size.  It is not confined to people who make large investments. They are a source of investment also for people with small amounts of money for investment.  There is a whole range of different classes of people who are benefiting from their investment in the societies.</P>
    <P>It will readily be appreciated by Deputies on all sides that if these interest rates were not attractive, the investor would withdraw their money and invest elsewhere, where they would find the attractive interest rates.  If that were to happen, if the interest rates offered by the building societies were not attractive, it would bring to an abrupt end any expansion in the operations of the building societies.  It would bring to an abrupt end any expansion in lending and if it were to continue a situation could be brought about where money which had been lent out on mortgage would have to be called back to repay those who had lent money originally.  If such a situation were allowed to come about it would be a great disaster for the building industry, for those without homes, for the 80,000 men involved in the construction industry. Our whole housing programme would be affected.</P>
    <P>The conditions the building societies lay down in their agreements with the borrower are matters over which the Minister has no control.  He cannot dictate the terms of the agreement the building societies will make with those who borrow money from them.  If, as has been suggested by several Deputies, they were to attempt to operate fixed rates of interest and bearing in <Col N="1083" /> mind that they are obliged to pay current interest rates on their borrowings, a situation could be brought about where present day borrowers who would be paying present day prices for houses would have to pay interest rates ranging from 12 to 15 per cent and they would, in fact, be subsidising people who had borrowed money at the lower interest rates at a time when house prices were also lower.  I do not think any reasonable person would support that situation or would agree that building societies should be obliged to lend money at an interest rate which was to remain fixed for the rest of the period of that loan.  It would be throwing an unbearable burden on present day borrowers and they would, in fact, be subsidising persons who had obtained loans in previous years as I have said, at lower interest rates and bought houses which were very much cheaper.</P>
    <P>How could the existing interest rates remain fixed without throwing that burden on to present day borrowers? Deputy Clinton suggested that we should subsidise the interest rates. There are many arguments against doing that and I would like to put them on the record of the House.  In the first instance it would be an extremely expensive exercise for the Government to subsidise building societies' interest rates.  For example, the cost of stabilising interest rates at 7 per cent would be about £550,000 in the first year and, of course, that would double in the second year to £1,100,000 and rise to £1,650,000 in the third year and so on, continuing to increase at a fantastic rate; if interest rates were to rise the cost would be even greater than this.</P>
    <P>The existing aids for house purchase are State and local authority grants, rate remissions, which are available to persons building grant-aided houses, stamp duty exemption and site subsidy.  All these aids to enable persons to build houses and to purchase houses are worth in all more than £1,000 to a house purchaser so houses are being heavily subsidised by the State in all these varying forms.  Sometimes people forget to mention such things as rate <Col N="1084" /> remission, stamp duty and State subsidy in certain cases.  All in all, this is a fairly accurate assessment of the total subsidies paid on average to enable those who want houses to purchase them.</P>
    <P>The relief from income tax, which is allowed on the interest content of the loan repayments has the effect of reducing an interest rate of 9 per cent to about 6½ per cent.  Another point that should be stressed is that it would be anomalous in present conditions to subsidise interest rates when one of the greatest difficulties in providing houses is to secure sufficient capital to finance the houses and to boost artificially the demand for capital by subsidising interest rates would certainly be anomalous. Subsidising interest rates would mean that the person who could afford to borrow most money would get the greatest assistance.  In all State-aided schemes operated by the Department to help persons to purchase houses we strive to ensure that the maximum State aid goes to that section in greatest need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if that happens in the Agricultural Credit Corporation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that before I finish.  Subsidies inevitably come up when people discuss housing. Subsidies are already absorbing £14.8 million.  If that capital were not being used to subsidise housing many more houses could be built with the money being used for subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, it is mistaken thinking that the loans made by the corporation are made at subsidised rates of interest.  The rates charged are based on the rates the corporation has to pay on its borrowings.  The only exceptions are some relatively small loans made under specific schemes; the costs involved in these are infinitesimal compared with the costs involved in interests rates in house purchasing.  Moreover the operations of the corporation are not comparable to those of building societies because the latter do not have to rely entirely on short-term borrowing while the corporation loans are, as we know, generally for much shorter periods <Col N="1085" /> than those of the building societies, which lend for a period usually of 25 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have already told the House we are reviewing the tax arrangements and I hope to have the report within two months.  Building societies offer money at 5½ per cent tax free.  This is a very complex matter but I think I could briefly give some explanation as to how this works.  Interest to the investor is £5 10s in the £100 and the tax paid to the Revenue Commissioner is 70 per cent of the standard rate, 4s 11d in the £1, amounting to £1 16s in the £100; then there is an allowance for management expenses of £1 6s making a total of £8 12s.  The societies lend at 9 per cent leaving a surplus of 8s of which about 2s 9d goes in tax at the standard rate of 7s.  The 4s 11d is applied to the gross amount of £7 6s &mdash;that is the total of the £5 10s paid to the investor and income tax at the rate of 4s 11d, that is the £1 16s tax.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that the Central Bank in its annual report for 1969-70 stated that the building societies have little option but to bring their rates into line with those elsewhere if they are to continue to attract funds.  The Central Bank group had no axe to grind and this was, therefore, valuable, independent opinion as to how free the building societies should be and how they should operate.  They said it was essential they should have this freedom to fix their own rates so that they would continue to attract funds.  The interest rates are determined by the levels prevailing in the economy generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion refers to increasing the flow of money for housing.  The necessity to increase the flow is not borne out by the facts because there has actually been an increase and this increase is mainly because of this freedom <Col N="1086" /> to fix their own interest rates. The White Paper, Housing in the Seventies, gave an assurance to the building societies that they would be left free to fix their own interest rates and, since then, there has been a tremendous increase in the flow of funds into these societies.  To illustrate the size of the increase, in the past 18 months building societies have approved 9,388 loans.  This was 3,687 more than the figure for the 18 months prior to the publication of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The capital inflow in the six months prior to the publication of the White Paper was £6.4 million and in the six months after publication it went up to £9.7 million.  No one could deny that the building societies are attracting money and using it in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the societies on an arrangement they made with Dublin Corporation to give up to 95 per cent loans for package deal houses.  This was done on the basis of guarantees by local authorities.  It is up to other local authorities to follow that example and give similar guarantees. That would help to make building society funds available to those on lower incomes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton said building societies have a surplus available and this surplus should be invested in houses.  That is not the true position. At no time have the societies had money in excess of the demands for house purchase loans, except during the bank dispute, which was an exceptional period.  Much of the money that was left with them in that period could not possibly have been lent for long-term loans as it would have been recalled when the bank strike ended, which is actually what happened.  The extent of their commitments in applications on hands shows clearly they are not in the position of having surplus funds. The applications on hands on 31st September, 1970, amounted to £17.3 million of which they approved £12.7 million.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Deputy Clinton was serious when he suggested that the Government should encourage house ownership.  I thought everybody was <Col N="1087" /> fully aware of the Government's policy in relation to encouraging house building and house ownership.  This is a basic part of our housing policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Deputy can be assured that these are matters on which I keep a very close watch. He will have noticed that some of the limits have been increased recently, as I thought they should be.  I intend to continue to keep a close watch on them.  We have increased housing grants in the past 12 months and we have increased income limits for supplementary grants.  These limits are selected only for a period for which it is felt they are reasonable and if it is thought that they should be increased, the Government will increase them.</P>
      <P>I have already said that the total aid for construction of a new house comes, on average, to about £1,000 for a typical house.  I have already listed these aids: housing grants, supplementary grants, site subsidies, rates remission, stamp duty exemption, <i>et cetera</i>.  The success of this policy of encouraging people to provide houses themselves rather than seeking homes from local authorities can be gauged by the fact that an estimated 75 per cent of all the houses are owner-occupied. This is probably the highest owner-occupation rate of any European country.  With that record of house ownership I found it strange that it should be suggested to me as a representative of the Government on housing matters that I should encourage home ownership.  As it was put, it would imply that I was not encouraging home ownership.  I do not think the Deputy was serious.  I think Deputy Belton referred to the same statement.</P>

      <P>I must kill the idea that the building societies have very big profits.  I do not intend to, and I have no obligation to defend building societies which are well able to defend themselves, but I think it is right that where there is public discussion of their affairs such discussion should be based on facts.  Profits of building societies are not normally distributed as are the profits of limited companies.  It is normal practice for building society profits to be retained and set aside as reserves to meet any losses the society may have to incur arising from the sale of liquid assets or defaults by borrowers, which can frequently happen.  In 1969, the latest year for which figures are available, the profits of the five principal societies totalled £182,000, representing about 5/8d for each £100 of the societies' total assets which I suggest is hardly excessive, especially having regard to the need for the societies to maintain their reserves at a reasonable level to meet contingencies.</P>
      <P>In fact, the level of the societies' reserves fell in 1969 from 5.4 to 4.9 per cent of their total assets.  This fall underlines the necessity for the increase in interest rates which took place that year.  I do not want to go into that because it is being reviewed and we shall have another opportunity to discuss the results of that review.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell said that building societies were lending money for purposes other than housing.  Total building society lending for non-housing purposes has averaged about 6 per cent of their total lending in recent years.  I do not think that could be regarded as excessive.  In any case, the White Paper indicated that it was proposed to review the tax concessions and tax arrangements of the societies in order to favour and encourage societies which lend over 90 per cent of their total advances for all purposes in house purchase loans not exceeding £6,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell also suggested that anybody with an income of less than £40 per week could not get a loan from a building society.  This is not correct because statistics collected by my Department <Col N="1089" /> show that of the 4,954 persons who got loans from building societies in 1969-70, 1,807, or roughly 37 per cent, had annual incomes of less than £1,400 or £27 a week.  In the first half of the current financial year 980 out of 3,210, or 31 per cent, had incomes of less than £1,400 a year.  I take it these figures will be accepted as facts.  They do not bear out Deputy O'Connell's contention.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell also suggested that insurance companies should be required to put more money into housing.  I have no power, as Minister, to direct insurance companies to do that but my Department had discussions with the principal insurance companies on several occasions on the matter of encouraging them to invest in housing.  It is noteworthy that the amounts the companies have put into housing have grown fairly steeply in the past few years and I should like to get this also on the records of the House. The amount paid out in individual house purchase loans in 1969-70 was £6.8 million compared with £4.3 million in 1966-67.  In addition, some companies put substantial money into the direct building of flats.  Figures for the total investment holdings of the life assurance companies operating in this country show that next to Government and other public authority securities, housing is by far the largest investment in the companies' portfolios.  It represents about three times their holdings in office buildings, other than their own offices.</P>
    <P>I hope what I have said helps to clear the air regarding some of the myths that exist about building societies. They are a source of revenue for house building which I would be very anxious to continue to cultivate and try at all times to ensure that the conditions that operate are favourable towards greater investment by the public in building societies.  I am convinced of their great value in this field and I believe there could be further substantial growth in the amount of community saving that could be invested in building societies.  There is no better way in which people could invest their savings than in a building <Col N="1090" /> society and so help in a great national work.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to the condition that a borrower must place his insurance only with the company nominated by the building society.  I should be greatly disturbed if this were true.  It would be a restrictive practice of the worst kind which I would certainly condemn.</P>

      <P>They have no right or authority to suggest to borrowers that they must place their insurance through an agency that they hold.

In fact, the best thing might be to refer the matter to the Fair Trade Commission.  They might be the proper body to investigate it.  I would ask Deputies to join with me in inviting the public to invest their savings in building societies.  They are one of the soundest investments in the country.</P>

      <P>They are offering very attractive interest rates and are providing essential capital for house building and in that way helping my programme to build houses for those who have not yet got them.  I am grateful to the Deputies opposite for the opportunity they have given me of placing some facts on record in relation to the operations of building societies.  This discussion may have come a little bit soon as the review group have not yet reported to me but <Col N="1091" /> I do not think discussion does any harm and it can help to clear the air. However, the Deputies opposite will appreciate that I could not accept the motion in view of the fact that we are, and have been since 1969, carrying out a review of the operations of the building societies.  For that reason I would ask them to withdraw the motion if they thought fit to do so, but I want to indicate to them that I am as concerned about the matters mentioned in the motion as they are, but at the same time I could not at this stage accept the motion as worded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I can assure the Minister and Deputy Moore that we are not withdrawing the motion, certainly not until we have had it fully discussed.  I repeat what Deputy Belton said that a great deal of good might have come about if the inquiry had been public.  I must say that the amount of irritation in my soul was growing as the Minister was speaking because there was an air of chastisement in his remarks that we should dare to put down a motion without having the facts, but I appreciate that he wound up by acknowledging that the Opposition had done a service by allowing this matter to be teased out and discussed in public.  That is something which needed to be done.  I look forward to making a study in depth of some of the factual information which the Minister has given us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am one of the people who have the greatest admiration for building societies, who have seen and continue to see the great benefit that building societies confer on our community by assisting would-be house purchasers to acquire their own houses which, certainly as long as we live in an era of inflation, means that people are buying and living in savings boxes and that they can never lose even if the <Col N="1092" /> rates are, as unfortunately they are, extremely high.</P>
    <P>It is also useful that there should be a breakdown of the income and expenditure of building societies.  That was the whole purpose of the motion tabled by the Fine Gael Party, to have a public inquiry so that the facts would be known and where there was unjustified criticism people would learn that the criticism was unjustified and that where there was room for reform that reform would be implemented.  The Minister on his own statement has clearly indicated one area for reform in relation to building societies.  The Minister pointed out that the actual profits of societies are small enough&mdash; £182,000 in the year 1969.  Of course, profit is something which is calculated after running expenses and it may well be that the administrative expenses are higher than they ought to be and that some incomes received by people running the societies are higher than the quantity of business merits.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the income of building societies is subjected to a considerable reduction by reason of the income tax which the State collects from investments in building societies.  When the Minister takes credit for what he calls a £14½ million subsidy, which the State is paying annually, he should, as he does, also set off against that the immense income which the State has from such things as the revenue from income tax levied on building societies.  If the income tax was no longer to be levied on the funds of building societies you could have a reduction up to 8 per cent&mdash;I think that was the figure the Minister gave&mdash; of interest rates.  I am quite certain that many house purchasers, with the aid of building society loans, would be quite grateful to have a reduction of that size, or even ½ per cent, granted to them and this would come if the Minister for Finance would take his hands out of the pockets of the building societies.</P>
    <P>Apparently the Minister in calculating the £14½ million which he said is conferred by way of benefit on house purchasers every year, has taken credit for the relief from income tax which some people get who are repaying <Col N="1093" /> money to building societies.  Let us consider who receives that benefit.  It is the person who has an income sufficiently large, or whose dependants are so few that they are actually paying income tax, but the man with the comparatively small income who has a large number of dependants has no income tax, he has not got to pay income tax and that person does not receive the benefit for which the Minister has taken credit, because he gets no allowance against non-existent income tax.</P>
    <P>It is a particular relief which I know is quite valuable to those who get it but it is not something which is of any assistance to the person whom the Minister says all legislation is designed to benefit, that is the small earner, the person who has the biggest sacrifice to make.  That income tax benefit is not there for that purpose and therefore it is a rather shallow argument to suggest that the effective rate of interest for purchasers of houses with building society loans is 6½ per cent.  That applies to those who are well to do, and many of them are not well to do, but they may still have to pay the tax, and it does not apply to the 37 per cent of the people whom the Minister says received building society loans in 1969-70.</P>
    <P>I doubt very much whether anybody with an income of £1,400 is paying income tax but such a person if he is a house purchaser with dependants is certainly not paying income tax, and that is the kind of person who in most cases will be purchasing a house with a building society loan.  There you have a situation in which, on the facts which the Minister has given us, 37 per cent of the people may not be receiving loans at the rate of 6½ per cent such as the Minister claims but they are actually paying at the rate of 9 per cent which is prohibitive.</P>
    <P>The Minister was critical of those who he said were not speaking on the basis of facts but on the basis of rumour and suspicion, yet in his closing remarks he became indignant at the suggestion that building societies insisted on house purchasers insuring through the building societies' agencies. He said it was wrong and that if he knew it was going on he would stop it. I was glad that Deputy Dowling was <Col N="1094" /> able to assert what I also can assert, that this is a universal practice.  I handle building society loans month in month out and I know of no case where a building society allows a mortgagee freedom in the selection of the insurance company to insure the property against fire.  In relation to ground landlords the law has long since been clarified as a result of which ground landlords may no longer impose as an obligation in a ground lease that the lessee will insure through a particular insurance company.  The obligation not to make that imposition does not apply to building societies or to any other mortgagee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <P>There are many other terms in mortgages from building societies and building agencies of a similar kind and there is precious little the would-be borrower can do about it for the simple reason that the person lending the money has a cure for any grouse.  He can say: &ldquo;Sorry, no money.&rdquo;  A building society cannot be forced to lend money to Mr. X, Y or Z&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not condoning it but I am saying it is a fact.  I am entirely in favour of freeing people from what I consider to be unnecessary obligations.  However, one must be fair and accept the fact that building societies must have proof immediately available to them that any property which is offered as security is adequately covered by insurance.  By having this insurance carried through a particular agency that is associated with the building society, they have available information to establish whether the property is insured.  The <Col N="1095" /> building society invariably arrange for their agency to notify them if there is failure to reinsure and if this is so they add the necessary premium to the capital loan and thereby secure repayment.</P>
      <P>With respect to the Minister, it is not good enough that he should come here and criticise members of the Opposition who have not got access to information which his Department collected through a private inquiry.  At the same time, he does not know some of the basic rules applied by the building societies in relation to insurance.  There are other terms of house building loans which are universal.  If there is to be an inquiry all these matters should be investigated.  Let the reasons be stated for certain practices; if they are considered necessary let them be continued, but if they are not necessary they should be removed.  That is the purpose of the Fine Gael motion which seeks a public inquiry on this matter.</P>
      <P>It is fair to comment that this motion was tabled in 1969 at about the same time as the Department was considering having a private inquiry.  Is it not a sad reflection on the Minister for Local Government and his predecessors that an inquiry of this nature should have continued for so long?  It is an added justification for our bringing forward this motion.  Of all the motions on the Order Paper we considered that in this case an adequate investigation was long overdue.  This motion, in fact, refers to certain events that are almost 18 months old.  The Minister tells us that all this is under close examination and that we should not have put down this motion.  However, we have not had the results of this investigation; all we have had today is the information selected by the Minister which he thought would be of assistance.  I am grateful for the information he has given but we should like to know all the facts and have a public inquiry so that the other questions of concern to the public should have an opportunity of being aired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with those speakers who criticised building societies for advertising for funds.  It is perfectly legitimate that they should advertise on radio, on television and in newspapers. <Col N="1096" /> How else can the societies obtain funds?  There are many agencies seeking money from the public compared with five or ten years ago.  A large proportion of these lending organisations reinvest the money in projects much less deserving and with considerably less social value than house building.  Deputy Foley criticised the fact that up to six building societies advertise on television on the one night but I cannot see anything worse in this than for six manufacturers of alcoholic beverages advertising on the same medium or six manufacturers of detergents doing likewise.  They are all looking for customers and so long as we have free enterprise I think we must tolerate the imperfections of advertising. It is no disservice to would-be house purchasers that building societies compete with one another in order to get the maximum amount of money for house building.</P>
    <P>In his assessment of £14½ million annually for State aid to house building, the Minister apparently took credit for what he called stamp duty.  It is a strange state of affairs when we have Minister claiming credit and measuring the value of their credit for not imposing taxes.  If this is to continue the Minister could say that there was a subsidy of £240 million for housing merely because he does not impose 100 per cent tax on every new property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not being constructive when he claims as a concession the non-imposition of a penal tax on house purchase.  The attitude which makes a Minister complacent because he is not imposing tax is what leaves Ireland at the bottom of the house building league.  The Minister said we had every reason to be proud of the fact that 75 per cent of our houses were owned by the occupiers. He said this was one of the highest rates in Europe.  Of course, it is but he is not comparing like with like.  In any society which is urban-orientated there is a high density of population and you are bound to have a smaller proportion of house owners.  However, in a rural-orientated community, or in a community not having a high density of population, in any society other than <Col N="1097" /> a communist one there will be a high proportion of house owners.</P>
      <P>We should not be complacent about the fact that 75 per cent of houses in our society are owner-occupied. It is not a particularly high figure and whatever improvements there have been in this field in recent times were opposed for years by Fianna Fáil.  The improvements were opposed by the votes of Deputy Dowling and others in this House, in Dublin Corporation and elsewhere.  These people voted in the lobbies of this House against motions seeking to have introduced a system that would enable tenants of local authority houses to buy their houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always very difficult for me to follow Deputy FitzGerald.  In fact, I sometimes think that Deputy FitzGerald has been invented as a private cross for me to carry as spokesman in the same area for the Labour Party.  There are three reasons why it is particularly difficult: first, because his speeches are always so exhaustive, not to say exhausting; secondly, he and I have been talking about this sort of subject in one context or another for the last ten to 15 years and agree upon so many things; and, thirdly, because he tends invariably to pre-empt nearly all the logical points which can be made in a discussion on a measure of this kind dealing with higher education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I think I can fairly say that there is a slight difference of emphasis between Deputy FitzGerald and myself in our approach to this Bill.  I approach the problems of the Minister with, perhaps, a greater <Col N="1098" /> degree of sympathy than Deputy FitzGerald has always shown.  I cannot help remembering that in discussing a measure of this kind we are dealing with what is in statistical terms an esoteric level of education, one which, for example, is extremely unlikely to be made available in the immediate future to the vast majority of the kind of constituent whom I represent.  When, therefore, Deputy FitzGerald and, indeed, academics of all kinds speak of the correct fact that Governments never make available to them the level of financial endowment which they would wish, I, perhaps, speaking as a Labour member, feel more strongly than Deputy FitzGerald the realisation that the Minister's shopping bill every year is a very extensive one, one with very many claims upon it, and that the claims of the university or the tertiary institution is only one among many such claims.  While it is an important one, it is, as I said, a claim that comes from a section of society which is scarcely representative of society as a whole.</P>
    <P>I say that at the outset in order that any remarks I may make here about the shortcomings or virtues of this Bill can be kept in the correct perspective. It remains undeniably true that for the bulk of our people primary and, with some luck, secondary education or vocational education is the highest to which they can aspire.  Therefore, those of us like Deputy Dr. FitzGerald and myself who are practising academics are in danger at times of forgetting this fact and of putting on the wrong hat at the wrong time.  I can assure the Minister that this does not apply in my case and I am sympathetic to his difficulties in framing this and other measures that relate to university education.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to carry my discussion of this measure into quite as broadranging a field as that into which my predecessor took it.  Nevertheless, certain broad issues must be taken up before approaching the Bill in any detail.  One which Deputy FitzGerald spoke of was university autonomy, that precious and indefinable substance behind which the academic retreats whenever his comfort appears in any <Col N="1099" /> way to be threatened by the realities of the outer world.  University autonomy is one of these beautiful phrases usually associated with talk of the quality of the teaching, the maintenance of standards and, above all else, delivered in a manner which appears to settle any point of dispute in Newman's <i>Idea of a University</i>.  I well remember the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley saying to me once during the very early period of the merger debates that if he heard anyone again standing up at a meeting and referring to Newman's <i>Idea of a University</i> he would scream.  This is a very understandable attitude.</P>
    <P>Academics are notoriously conservative. I do not think the Minister can be blamed&mdash;although he was not exclusively blamed by Deputy FitzGerald, but I do not think he can be blamed even to the extent to which Deputy FitzGerald blames him&mdash;for his failure to shift the academic community into the 20th century.  Personally I have the utmost sympathy for anyone who endeavours to take on the academic establishment, more particularly if he is not an academic himself.  By that I do not intend to suggest for a moment that somebody who is not an academic is in any way unqualified to act as Minister for Education.  All I am saying is that a period of personal, face-to-face knowledge of the degree of blood-letting, convolution and mutual bickering which goes on in the academic world is an asset when it comes to endeavouring to discern the reality that lies behind some of these resounding phrases.  My own personal experience would suggest you would have to go as far as the Roman Curia to find a body of men as conservative as the average academic.</P>
    <P>Talk of autonomy must be seen in the context of the social responsibilities of our universities.  There are forms of university autonomy which I would defend to the death, and I shall have something to say about that in the context of this Bill.  However, the concept of autonomy has to be taken in the context of the fact that it is ulimately the taxpayer who is the fount of the existence of the contemporary university.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> All the universities today depend on the taxpayers, the great majority of whom have no opportunity of entering the institutions which they finance unwillingly, and I think we should remember that.  It is a point to place on record even at this time, that even my own college, Trinity College, Dublin, is now almost entirely dependent upon State grants.  The widelyheld illusion that it has vast funds of a private kind dating back to the Reformation or something like that, I regret to say, is not the case.  The depreciation in the value of money, the growing cost and size of education has rendered my own college as dependent upon the community as any other institution.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in approaching a Bill like this we should be wary of the academic motor reaction of falling into a sort of hysterical suspicion of the Minister and of the Department of Education. As far as I am concerned, in introducing this Bill the Minister, whether he be a Minister of a Fianna Fáil Government or any other Government is the spokesman of the community to whom these institutions ultimately owe their existence and their loyalty, and he is entitled to precisely the degree of respect which attends upon his office. As a dissident lay Catholic once said to me: &ldquo;One may dislike the Pope but one should not abuse the Papacy.&rdquo; The same is true of the Minister for Education.  That respect has been sadly lacking amongst academics, a group of whom I once heard refer to the late Deputy O'Malley in this way: &ldquo;and him not even a university man&rdquo;, which of course was not true.</P>
    <P>The university academics concept of autonomy is an interesting one.  It is, as Deputy FitzGerald hinted, an ideal situation in which he would approach the Minister for Education or the Authority with a bill and, standing smartly to attention and touching his forelock, the Minister for Education would supply the moneys requisite to meet the bill and would not direct the smallest inquiry as to the manner in which they were dispensed.  Reading even the critique of the present Bill produced by the Irish Federation of University Teachers, an organisation of which I have the honour to be a <Col N="1101" /> founder member and was for many years secretary, I could not help feeling that their view of the Bill was that in an ideal world the Higher Education Authority would be totally autonomous <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Minister and the universities would be totally autonomous <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Higher Education Authority.  It seems to me mildly impracticable, to indulge in something of an understatement.</P>
    <P>At the same time, to balance this slightly&mdash;I hope I have made my sympathies clear to the Minister&mdash;the fact does remain that here statutory recognition is being given to a body which must possess a measure of dignity and independence if its recommendations are to carry weight and if it is to be other than simply a clearing house for ministerial directives.  When this body was first set up the gentlemen, some academics and some not, who accepted membership of it, I think I am correct in saying on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, were subjected to a considerable amount of criticism by some of what I might describe as their more reactionary colleagues.  It was argued that it had the effect of taking something like the king's shilling.  Their position was not rendered any more envious by the impression created by the then Minister that their function was to implement in detail broad policies which had been agreed upon already in principle.  I think he used the immortal phase, &ldquo;What has been decided has been decided.&rdquo; Oh, that that were so in the case of the university merger.  However, it is not.  Certainly that statement did nothing to enhance the status of the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in the Estimate for Education last April the Minister dealt what I can only describe as a very calculated rebuff to the expertise of the very institution that he had established.  I quote from the Official Report, Volume 245, column 1320:</P>
    <P>Members will recollect that the Higher Education Authority in a recent report estimated that £24 million would be needed to meet the capital requirements of the universities in the coming six years.  This Estimate and the accommodation planned in relation to it has been <Col N="1102" /> very carefully examined by the special building unit in my Department. This has been done in a very thorough fashion having regard to the most up-to-date building techniques and costs based thereon.  I am fully satisfied that accommodation of the magnitude proposed by the Higher Education Authority can be provided at a cost not exceeding £15 million.  The intention of the Government to provide funds on this basis has been notified to the Authority.</P>
    <P>With respect, that is a very peremptory dismissal of the expertise of a body which the Minister had himself set up.  It would have been better to say &ldquo;You want £24 million, but I have not got it.  All you are going to get is £15 million&rdquo;, rather than saying to them, &ldquo;you have done your sums so badly that my building unit can do the same sums and come up with an answer which is £9 million less&rdquo;.  That seems to suggest they are mentally defective.  The Higher Education Authority were put in an embarrassing situation at the outset.  I should hate to think that the idea of having a Higher Education Authority with real motive power and dynamic would be turned into a sort of repository where unwelcome ideas could be dumped and where difficult questions about the merger could be dealt with by saying, &ldquo;Ah well, the Higher Education Authority is talking about it.&rdquo;  When the Higher Education Authority makes its mind up it is told by the Government it is an ass, that no notice will be taken of it.  I do not know whether the Minister has ever read <i>David Copperfield</i> but if he has he may remember in that novel there was a legal firm called Spenlow and Jorkens and Mr. Spenlow always took the view when approached by one of his clients for any concession that he would be delighted to concede it but that Mr. Jorkens would not permit this.  Mr. Jorkens was an invisible character who turned out to be one of the most inoffensive of men. I hope the Minister does not intend to play battledoor and shuttlecock with the Higher Education Authority in this way too, utilising it to express the wishes of his Department when these <Col N="1103" /> are appropriate and at other times ignoring it.  This would be very unfortunate and I hope he will not allow this to be done.</P>
    <P>I do not ask that universities should be granted that degree of autonomy which permits them to spend in any fashion they like and educate in any fashion they like irrespective of the manpower needs or the social aspirations of the people, nor do I suggest, and here I differ from Deputy FitzGerald, that any Minister of State who sits in that chair over there, with the dignity attendant upon the fact that the people have voted him there, can be expected to bring into existence a small body of men who are totally independent to administer so vast a section of the country's welfare, irrespective of Government decree.  The answer lies somewhere in between.  I hope he will permit the Higher Education Authority a degree of autonomy which will allow men to assume membership of it with dignity and make a constructive contribution to education as the Bill seems to suggest it wishes they would.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about section 12 of the Bill and the Minister has expressed his readiness to amend that section on the Committee Stage.  I welcome this readiness on his part and I hope his amendment will be appropriate. The most dangerous implication of that section is the possibility that grants for university institutions should be earmarked.  Deputy FitzGerald and I have argued this point out with the Higher Education Authority in different contexts and like Deputy FitzGerald I fully appreciate the necessity to earmark capital grants.  It is patently absurd that a university should be given £½ million for a third or fourth generation computer and spend it on the most sophisticated school of Greek on these islands.  Obviously we cannot have that.  It would, however, be dangerous if areas of teaching which have established academic excellence in universities were to be phased up or phased down at the whim of the person who dispensed the money.</P>
    <P>As I have said, academics are conservative people by nature.  When I was attempting to conduct an analytical <Col N="1104" /> study of the possible rationalisation of departments between the two Dublin colleges in the context of the Irish Federation of University Teachers I found, and I think Deputy FitzGerald found the same thing, that the most pristine academic arguments could be produced satisfactorily and triumphantly to establish the absolute necessity for retaining everything that was being taught on either campus in precisely the form in which it was being taught, if not better and more expensively. Obviously this cannot be permitted to continue.</P>
    <P>Fashions in teaching change and sometimes the academic in his otiose bumbling way may be clinging to a truth which is worth preserving and the relative wastage of public money in permitting him to continue to teach subjects which do not have an obvious instant technological feed back for the community, may be justified in the long term gains for the community. For example, at the moment technology is all the rage.  I am not saying that is wrong but as a university man I consider the problems of Kevin Street and Bolton Street in terms of space and equipment are far worse than any that exist in our universities and must have a far higher claim on the Minister's attention.  We are all going technology mad.  The Americans started it and then Harold Wilson took it up and made it a big thing and just as they are stepping away from it we are picking it up and married to this are dangerous signs that education is solely the servant of the manpower needs of the community.  In those circumstances it might seem appropriate to go down to one of our universities or colleges and say, &ldquo;Stop teaching Latin altogether, stop teaching Greek, turn out a quarter as many doctors as you are turning out at the moment, do not turn out any lawyers for ten years or more, but give us 500 electronic engineers by 1975.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That would be highly dangerous because fashions change and what has been destroyed cannot be built up again.  I do not know if it would be legislatively possible to build that into the section.  I do not think it is.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that it is not intended that <Col N="1105" /> the current expenditure of existing departments in universities should be tinkered with in this way, first, because it would be a bad thing academically and secondly because, as the Minister and the Department very well know, this will mean that the HEA to some extent, and the departments still more, will become a battlefield over which the conflicting claims of academics will rage with a sort of incestuous fervour which will redound to the benefit of everything except education.  I would heartily advise him not to do that.</P>
    <P>On the subject of the chairmanship I should also like a little bit of illumination. I infer from the Bill that the chairman will, of course, be a fulltime official.  I am not completely clear from the Bill&mdash;and again Deputy FitzGerald touched on this point&mdash; whether he will be a civil servant who is seconded for this purpose, and what kind of person he will be.  I should like to join with Deputy FitzGerald in praising the present Chairman of the Higher Education Authority.  There are qualities in Dr. Ó Raifeartaigh which equip him superbly for that post.  He is a man of enormous administrative experience, a man with a genuine interest in and a deep knowledge of both the practice and the philosophy of education and a man of wide culture.  There was a most happy coincidence in his becoming available, if one might so put it, at precisely that moment.  There is no guarantee that a similar person will become available in the future.</P>
    <P>I would tend to the view that the chairman should be elected or appointed by the HEA with, perhaps, a power of ratification in the Minister's hands. I am not for a moment casting any aspersions upon the present chairman or any foreseeable one in the immediate future, but there is enough &ldquo;hole and cornery&rdquo; in this country without leaving so central an appointment in ministerial hands.  This will be a better system.</P>
    <P>I, too, am a little unhappy about the designation of other institutions as being of higher educational status. This is referred to in section 1 (c).  I ask the question at once, by whom? The answer is, of course, the Minister. <Col N="1106" /> What institutions?  There are institutions, as Deputy FitzGerald said, like the Royal College of Surgeons which would seem instantly to qualify but there are other institutions which fall into more shadowy ground.  This power would be better left to the authority itself.  There is a dangerous tendency again creeping into educational fashion in Western Europe, that is, that you create a university by calling it one, by calling something that exists a university.  I do not think this is correct.</P>
    <P>I am as anxious as anyone else to break down the distinction of status between the technological institute on the one side and the university on the other.  It is often a very unreal distinction. This is a much deeper problem than simply designation by a Minister, a sort of act of knighting by which this thing becomes elevated to a university. The whole question of improvement of facilities in the context of such an institution arises.  It is obviously an enormous subject and if I may, in a moment of self-parody, define the problem which faces the Minister, it is, I think, whether at the tertiary level the binary system should continue, which is the kind of gobbledygook, I am afraid, that people like academics tend to use when they are pretending to be helpful to Ministers for Education.  There is a slight danger here and I share some of the fears of the academics.</P>
    <P>Reference was made also to the supervision of the overall provision of student places.  I wonder if the Minister would illuminate this a little further when he is replying?  Is it intended that the Higher Education Authority can set a ceiling on an individual college? For example can it say to UCD: &ldquo;You are too big.  Get smaller.&rdquo;  Or to Trinity College: &ldquo;You are too small. Get bigger.&rdquo;  I do not know.  This type of action would be very bitterly resisted by the academics.  Obviously some sort of agreed pattern of development and size must be attained.  I wonder what is the best way to do it. I think it had better be done by consultation. Certainly, a policy of the inflation of the Dublin complex is highly undesirable and there have been signs for many years that this is what is happening. Oddly enough, speaking as a <Col N="1107" /> member of a Dublin college, my fears here would be for the colleges in Cork and Galway.  I hope we can rest assured that the Minister is thinking of them when he speaks in this way.</P>
    <P>This is a point I intended to bring up in the context of the earmarking of grants even on the issue of capital equipment.  I wonder how it is intended that the provision of money for costly equipment will be determined in the future once this body is statutorily in existence.  Will the buck stop ultimately on the desk of the Secretary of the Department of Education?  Will it stop at the desk of the Higher Education Authority?  If for example TCD and UCD come to the Minister looking for an identical computer at the same point in time, both of them will not get it, and quite right too.</P>
    <P>This, of course, is the very issue which the universities in their insensate blindness, in my opinion, on 6th July, 1968, refused to face by refusing to have anything to do with the merger. Here, <i>sans</i> merger we are left in a situation where I am not quite clear what will happen about the provision of this sort of costly capital equipment or, indeed, the provision of buildings in the permanent competition that takes place for capital grants for buildings.  I can think of instances but it would be invidious to mention them.  I might seem to be falling into my other function.</P>
    <P>In the absence of a merger solution there will be a battlefield somewhere and I wonder where it will be.  If there is to be an ultimate power of appeal in financial matters to the Minister, the Authority will inevitably be downgraded and lose status.  I want to put this as courteously as I can about some of my colleagues.  Any really good university politician or operator will know where the buck stops, and that is where he will go to look for his grant. If it is not the HEA he will cock a snook at the HEA and by-pass it.  He will take the Minister out to lunch or something like that.  In those circumstances the HEA will become a pretty ludicrous institution.  This worries me.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (2) of the Bill provides:</P>
    <P>Requests submitted under this section <Col N="1108" /> shall be examined by An tÚdaras annually or at such other intervals as it may determine.</P>
    <P>I hope it will do its best to encourage a system by which three or five year university budgeting is encouraged rather than annual budgeting which I do not think has proved to be a very satisfactory way of planning the long-term development of universities.</P>
    <P>There are a number of small points which do not bear directly upon the Bill.  At the outset let me ask the Minister&mdash;I think this is relevant and I have addressed a question to him on this subject&mdash;where does all this leave the university merger?  Here we have an education authority which is set up to co-ordinate and look after the interests of a number of teaching institutions. These teaching institutions are antiquated in their structure and static, on the whole, in their attitudes to educational development.  They have passed through a seething turmoil in which by the strangest series of alliances all sorts of odd bods have got together to thwart the Minister and his predecessor about the merger, all sorts of people with no ground in common.</P>
    <P>In all this the one thing that has been lost sight of is educational necessity, educational desirability.  When the dust has settled, if it has settled about the merger, we are left with institutions unchanged except that they can now perhaps celebrate the famous victory of preserving themselves in their previous mothball condition.  I do not think this makes the task of the HEA any easier because a great unanswered question mark still hangs over the shape of the institutions which it is supposed to bring together in harmonious development.  I am, of course, an unrepentant supporter of the merger plan.  I thought there were many good things in that 6th July statement of 1968 and I do not cast the same blame upon the Minister's predecessor for failing to deal with the academics as Deputy FitzGerald has cast.  It is totally impossible to get agreement from any body of academics and I think the late Deputy O'Malley appreciated that the only way to get an academic to do what one wants him to do is to make up one's mind and consult him afterwards. <Col N="1109" /> They cried for consultation throughout that whole period and when they got it all they did was to reject every possible alternative put before them.</P>
    <P>This leaves us with a whole lot of unanswered questions which this unfortunate Authority will have to deal with&mdash;the rationalisation of existing facilities, for example.  The community simply cannot stand the expense of maintaining parallel facilities in the more expensive fields of teaching. The present question mark which hangs over medical teaching is an example of this.  The community can perhaps bear the cost of having duplicated teachers of classics, history or political science, the so-called blackboard and chalk subjects, because they are cheap.  Even if they are inessential they can be permitted to continue because they are cheap.  This is not true in the case of the dearer subjects. I hope this concept of rationalisation about which much wind has been generated by the academic staff association which has never been explained to me will not be left to the universities in Dublin in particular to determine.  I hope the Minister will appreciate that if he brings to the attention of these universities that they are, within the limits of genuine academic freedom, the servants of the community and that it is his function to knock their heads together, he has the sympathy of the people on these benches.  It would be a very sorry state of affairs if university education, which is so often the hard won prize for sacrifice in a family for a working class child, if the needs and orientation of this tertiary level of education, should be left to log-rolling bargains between institutions.  I hope we will find that that is not the case, that the HEA will, in fact, have teeth if not to implement the merger, which I still hope defiantly that it will, at least to test the sincerity of the academics about their apparent desire to avoid expensive duplication.</P>
    <P>One specific way in which a major reform has been delayed by this permanent merger thing is the review of the governing body structures of all the Irish colleges and an attempt to achieve their uniformity.  My own college, by a paradox which is typical <Col N="1110" /> of its history, possesses a governing structure which is superficially undemocratic but in practice, I think it is fair to say, proves highly democratic. I do not think the same can be said of the constituent colleges of the National University.  In a situation where not merely student opinion is not adequately heard on these bodies but junior staff opinion is excluded and where a shadow of insecurity hangs over non-statutory lecturers and professors approaching retirement age who know that the extension of their jobs for a further five years depends on the goodwill of persons of authority, this sort of thing should be remedied quickly before we have a repetition of the case which the then Justice Kenny took.  I see no reason why this knot should not be cut quickly.  I would ask the Minister to ask the HEA to make up its mind one way or another about the merger quickly and then to expedite the review of the structure of the governing bodies of all the Irish colleges, including my own.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement of the Minister that one of the subjects which the authority will look to is the common grading of levels of university staff.  Ridiculous anomalies have existed here for many years with assistants and junior lecturers in my college, assistants, assistant lecturers, non-statutory lecturers and so on in the other colleges.  The sooner some order and logic is brought into this and justice is seen to be done the better. I am also glad that he has referred to the fact that the authority will have as part of its function, the examining of common methods of appointment to university staff.  Again it would be invidious to go into specific cases but I can think of one case which has occurred within the last 12 months which, to my mind, cast serious doubt on the method of appointment in one college at any rate.  The sooner all these appointments are filled in the same way with public advertisement and with, in the case of senior posts, external assessment by qualified people, the better.</P>
    <P>I do not share Deputy FitzGerald's enthusiasm for the projected council of universities.  It has always seemed to <Col N="1111" /> me that a council of universities would inevitably prove to be a large, unworkable body of estimable men&mdash; dons, clerics, county councillors and such like people&mdash;who would travel long distances at 1s 6d per mile at three-monthly intervals and exchange platitudes and return to their places of origin.  I do not think a body of that kind could ever be anything else.  I do think the Minister should clear the air as to whether this council of universities will be founded or not.</P>
    <P>I am a little bit unhappy about the provision in section 6 (1) of the Schedule to the Bill that the Government may remove an ordinary member of the authority from office at any time.  However, I am not experienced in these things and perhaps this is normal procedure.  The Minister might be prepared to comment.  Certainly, some member of his party have made statements about academics by name which would not tend to leave me with the feeling that an excessively independent-minded member of the authority would be immune from jealous attention.</P>
    <P>I endorse Deputy FitzGerald's suggestion that there should be students on the Higher Education Authority though not six as requested by the USI which I think is unrealistic.  Two or three would be a logical number. I notice the Minister did not tend to fill up the full complement of places on the authority in the first instance. I wonder if, perhaps, he had something like this in mind for a future stage.  I hope he had.</P>
    <P>One subject which could very well be referred to this body in the very near future is this issue of evening students which is so pressing at the moment.  This is surely the sort of thing it ought to be talking about.  I shall not develop that point.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald and indeed the Irish Federation of University Teachers' memorandum made much play about the maintenance of standards in universities.  I am a little sceptical about this.  Just as I say the university academics idea of Heaven is an autonomous university, so also a university teacher's idea of proper standards in a <Col N="1112" /> university would be a staff-student ratio of one to one and lengthy vacations during which he could refresh himself upon the deeper aspects of his subject, only in practice he probably would do nothing of the kind.  While so many people are clamouring for admission to our universities it is only realistic to expect the academics to accept that we do not live in an ideal world.  Very often this concept of the maintenance of standards is a dignified facade to hide a form of snobbism which I find objectionable, the sort of argument put forward by Kingsley Amis in England that more inevitably means worse.  I do not think this is so and if the day ever comes that our university educational system, which should be geared to the admission of all those who have the ability to enter, as ours is not at the moment, shuts its doors to qualified Irish applicants, even with the best academic motives, that would be a very bad thing.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister in relation to the authority what is to be the position of the various research institutes which have proliferated in the country over the last 20 or 30 years. Some of these are doing excellent work. Some of them were developed because inter-collegiate rivalries of one kind or another, which we hope no longer exist, made it impossible to locate their work on one campus or another with the result that there is a certain illogical divorce between them and the whole structure of tertiary education I should like to see a situation in which there would be a much higher degree of cross fertilisation between these institutions and the universities and I hope the authority which, apparently, will have responsibility for the whole field of tertiary education, will also bear these institutions in mind.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to elaborate on the recruitment of staff to the authority and the status they will hold.  Will the authority advertise and recruit staff in its own way or will staff be seconded to it from the Department of Education?</P>
    <P>On the whole, the Bill is a good one. The idea behind the Bill is the correct one.  I do not blame the Minister for the delay in introducing the Bill.  Anyone <Col N="1113" /> who has had any experience of academics knows that delays are inevitable.</P>
    <P>I should like to associate myself with the expressions of approval of the existing officers of the authority, Dr. Ó Raifeartaigh and Mr. Jukes in particular, who have been very helpful and very worthy servants of the authority.</P>
    <P>There is a slight air of unreality about this Bill and that is borne out by the paucity of the attendance during this debate and the few speakers who are anxious to offer.  This is very, very sad.  It shows that to the majority university education still has not got very much relevance.  That cannot be said about a debate on agriculture.  As I say, it is sad.  It is also very wrong.</P>
    <P>I endorse what Deputy FitzGerald said about writing into section 3 a specific clause providing that one of the functions of the authority will be to produce equality of opportunity in education.  It might lead to nothing.  It might be as much of a dead letter as are the principles of social justice enshrined in our Constitution, but at least it would be there.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that he will endeavour generally to further higher education and promote knowledge of its value to the country.  Judging by these benches he has quite a task in front of him.  I hope he will instil into the authority that its function is something more than merely taking over the <i>status quo</i> in university education. I hope some element of crusading fervour will be imparted to the authority.  I hope it will consider the level of university grants to students and admission requirements, relating these to the leaving certificate curriculum and to the needs of the new generation of children, who, under the beneficial results of the Minister's and his predecessor's secondary education policies, will be hammering at the doors of these universities in the next five or ten years.  I hope the authority will have a responsibility to them as well as taking off the shoulders of the Minister some of the burden of running the university machine.  If the day dawns when these young people clamour for and find their way into <Col N="1114" /> our universities, perhaps then these benches will be full for a discussion on higher education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The somewhat casual manner in which this Bill has been circulated calls to mind the story about a senior member of a political party; on being offered a Cabinet post by the incoming Taoiseach, he said he had done his bit for Ireland and he would be happy to take Education as his portfolio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, yes.  He was not a member of the Labour Party or of the Fianna Fáil Party either.  We have at last a piece of legislation which is most welcome. The Labour Party fully recognise there is urgent need for the establishment of this Authority and we hope this is a logical step towards providing an effective basis for the current operation and future development of university education.  There has been a good deal of messing about over the past four or five years with educational developments. Free secondary education was introduced on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. There were murmurs about raising the school-leaving age and operating transport systems without any great thought to the cost involved.  They were purely <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements. One is sick to death of the subject of comprehensive education, now translated into community school concepts. Quite frankly, if I were a senior official in the Department of Education I would have been tempted to commit self-immolation on the floor of this House simply to try to get clear-cut decisions on education.  We had all the talk about mergers and so forth.  Certain things were done which bore little relationship to the needs of higher education and the future of education generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is refreshing to find that we can tonight welcome this Bill.  In doing so I want to pay tribute to the farsightedness and the competence of our educational planners within the Department who have been asking for <Col N="1115" /> years for this kind of legislation and who got very little assistance from this House and from successive Ministers. Negotiations between educationalists and the Department have broken down.</P>
    <P>I concur in the criticism in relation to section 1.  It should be more explicit. I have confidence in the Department of Education as such, distinguishing it from its political head and its previous political heads.  Some people may feel the present Minister lacks imagination; some may feel he is caught in an impossible position but at least I think he has integrity, a quality badly needed in a Minister, one might even say stubbornness which is so necessary in facing the political pressures brought to bear on Ministers for Education particularly.  I am rather worried about paragraph (c) of section 1 which says:</P>
    <P>(c)  an institution which the Minister, after consultation with An tÚdarás, designates by regulations as an institution of higher education for the purposes of this Act:</P>
    <P>Initially, I think there should be contained in the Schedule to this Bill the various institutions which, as of now, will be designated by the Minister as coming within the broad, functional ambit of the authority.  This would clear the air because there are various rumours and comments and representations made to Members of the House as to whether this institution or that would be included.  Some of this talk is being deliberately provoked but it would clarify the position if the Minister were more explicit in that regard.</P>
    <P>I concur with Deputy Thornley&mdash; it is always refreshing to see two Labour Deputies agree&mdash;that we have not just misgivings but that we would rather publicly put a question mark after the proposition of the Conference of Irish Universities.  I am not convinced that a real need for it exists. I have a horror of building up in the educational field consultative organisations which would be superfluous.  I have a holy terror of finding a redundant body on hand composed, as a Labour Party spokesman said, of bishops, provosts, county councillors and others meeting occasionally to give <Col N="1116" /> us their collective wisdom on higher education.  I have yet to become convinced of the need for such a council in a small country such as ours and one might suggest gently to Deputy FitzGerald that he is indulging in a little special pleading.  I sympathise with him because he is so often the target of his own academic colleagues and so often regarded as being so terribly reactionary in their eyes that in order to get himself off the hook on occasion I think he has to try to placate them.  At any rate, so far as the conference is concerned, we are not convinced.</P>
    <P>As regards section 3 which deals with the general functions I would urge the Minister to be more explicit on Committee Stage.  One could usefully develop and expand that section to provide more general functions for that authority.  On an historic occasion such as this it would be undesirable to have some dreadful hair-spliting in the future with various university presidents, for example, indicating that the authority had no function in relation to this or that matter.  Such things as the need for planning and development for higher education, not mentioned in section 3&mdash;admittedly, it has the vague phraseology, &ldquo;promoting an appreciation of the value of higher education and research&rdquo;, &ldquo;co-ordination&rdquo; and &ldquo;furthering development&rdquo;&mdash;should be included.  The section should be more elaborate.  It could certainly prove a useful defence for the chairman and members of the Authority in years ahead.  I think this is necessary because I detect in many academic institutions a somewhat hostile reaction towards this Bill.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been put by the Labour Party spokesman that there should be incorporated in section 3 or section 4 of the Bill the need to democratise general administrative and governing structures of the higher educational institutions.  It does not require any effort on our part to point out that in the national university structures the governing bodies, as I know them&mdash;I know one of them very well&mdash;are far from representative of either staff or students and not entirely representative of the local community.  By any criterion one will <Col N="1117" /> hardly regard them as even representative, apart from being democratic or otherwise.  There are within governing bodies self-perpetuating dynasties of a monopolistic type which have proved in many ways rather unresponsive and rather feudal and occasionally just stupid in terms of their reaction to the public interest, to staffing and to students.  Such matters as the right of the authority to stipulate standing orders for the current governing bodies should be included.  It would be a slight advantage in the case of some of these bodies and the Minister should consider this in connection with sections 3 and 4 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 7, I would, perhaps, query the suggestion that the Authority &ldquo;may annually or at such other intervals as it may determine, require any institution of higher education to submit a statement of its financial position...&rdquo; I should be more harsh than that.  A statement of its financial position may result in some of the accounting officers of universities in their deviousness saying &ldquo;At this point we have X number of pounds in hands and X number at bank.&rdquo;  One may then tell the Minister and the authority to &ldquo;get lost&rdquo; and that no further information is forthcoming.</P>
    <P>There is, admittedly, the proviso that the institutions of higher education must comply with any requirements imposed on them under this section. Knowing something of the manner in which some universities keep their accounts and make them available to Departments and so on, I think this section should be further examined by the Minister or, perhaps, he might comment on it and reassure us in that regard.</P>
    <P>One must refer to the other topic, autonomy, covered by Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Thornley even if one is repetitive, because all parties have received strong representations in relation to this Bill on the question of university autonomy generally.  It is, admittedly, the function of universities to advance teaching, research and the development generally of the intellectual and cultural values of the country.  At times when one hears <Col N="1118" /> some of the comments by some of the Minister's colleagues about the word &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; and particularly &ldquo;intellectual values&rdquo;, one holds up one's hands at such snide comments and I think, therefore, one would sympathise with universities in endeavouring to develop intellectual and cultural values.</P>
    <P>Of course the universities, in theory at any rate, are there to encourage open academic inquiry at university level.  I see no conflict in the advancement of these aims and the setting up of this authority.  I am convinced that it will not in any way diminish the overall freedom and relative, although admittedly limited, autonomy, which the universities now possess, because there does seem to be a general myth that the successful pursuance of the functions of this Authority will inevitably destroy that limited autonomy which the universities possess.  I do not share this view any more than I would share the view that if the universities are to pursue their stated public functions their functions will be diluted in any way and taken over by the State, as is so often said to us.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe that State involvement on behalf of the people, not on behalf of any allegedly bureaucratic sector of the public service, or group of public servants&mdash;a common assumption so often advanced by a university spokesman&mdash;will not in any way prove detrimental to academic freedoms. It is extremely difficult to get this across.  As a trade unionist and knowing how jealously trade unionists tend to preserve their limited public freedom I can appreciate the point of view without sharing the attitude.  I do not accept that experience in other countries proves the point of view that this Bill will be an encroachment on the academic freedoms currently enjoyed by the universities.</P>
    <P>In the recent past and indeed to a fair degree as of now many of the governing bodies of the universities, in terms of the attitude of some of their staff and in terms of the social and political attitudes of many of their graduate products, have been the most staunch upholders of a self-elected élite and at times a self-appointed, self-administered and self-perpetuated <Col N="1119" /> sector in our society.  The purpose of this House, of political life and of political agitation, is to democratise that development in our society over the decades.  This Bill is a measure towards the advancement of that ideal.</P>
    <P>I should like now to comment on section 12.  I appreciate that there may be some confusion, as the Minister said, and that he may bring in an amendment to clarify the position.  I accept generally speaking that it is not desirable that in the Book of Estimates one should get a predetermined, predecided allocation for a specific institution. The Minister did say that:</P>
    <P>The Book of Estimates could contain, by way of information, details in relation to the various institutions concerned to show how the bulk sums were arrived at.  As this <i>modus operandi</i> may not be clear from the existing draft, which might be said to inhibit the discretion of the authority, I propose to introduce an amendment at the Committee Stage which will clarify the position.</P>
    <P>I certainly await the amendment with interest and when we see it we can consider the matter further.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald has been making an undue distinction in regard to current capital expenditure in relation to the Bill and again I would wait until I see what the Minister has in mind.  The allegations which might arise in regard to the earmarking of current expenditure, and the specific allocation of moneys for specific capital programmes, would best be left for consideration until we have heard the Minister's reply or get the amendment, when we can decide what to do.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party may consider an amendment in that regard.  In many respects it would be strengthening the hand of the authority rather than weakening it in any way.  As regards the remaining sections I agree that on the authority there should be some student representation.  It is stated that the members shall consist of a chairman and not more than 18 ordinary members of whom at least seven shall be academic members and at least seven shall be other than academic <Col N="1120" /> members.  The Federation of University Teachers want half of the authority members to be drawn from the academic world but honestly one cannot accept that proposition.  Likewise, the Union of Students of Ireland suggest that there should be six student members.  My colleague, Deputy Thornley, and I feel there should be at least three student representatives nominated by the council of the USI.</P>
    <P>If we had that situation it would be a logical development of the current student representation on the various governing bodies throughout the Republic.  I am convinced that the other members of the authority would find a fresh and constructive approach coming from the student representatives. It is to be regretted that such was the relative lack of sympathy displayed by the governing body of UCD that the student representatives are finding life on that body rather difficult. They are not resigning and perhaps at times it does not do any harm to walk out in sheer disgust to show one's viewpoint.  In relation to the higher authority itself this would bring a certain element of openness to it and it would be quite fair, if we want to build up, as the Taoiseach has often said, a participative democracy, that we should develop that power of representation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Thornley has suggested that the chairmanship of the Authority should be decided by the appointed members of the authority itself.  I would concur with this but I doubt very much if the Minister would accept it.  I have the utmost faith and, in many respects, admiration for the current chairman.  So long as the current chairmanship continues the Labour Party are quite happy.  However, there could evolve a situation where the chairman would become the special preserve of changing Ministers of Education&mdash;and they have changed rather rapidly in the past decade&mdash;and that an element both of political and public service uncertainty might tend to enter into the appointment.</P>
    <P>I would oppose the idea that members of the authority be appointed following consultations between the Minister and the chairman.  This would <Col N="1121" /> place the chairman in an invidious and unfortunate position.  He, above all, must be seen to be independent.  He has tremendous national responsibility in a position of extreme delicacy and he should not be placed in that kind of position.</P>
    <P>Regarding the removal of members from office, I would suggest that there be inserted in the Bill something on the lines of &ldquo;Following consultation with the chairman of the authority&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Following notification to the authority&rdquo; or &ldquo;where good cause exists&rdquo;.  It is a bit bold for the Government to state &ldquo;The Government may remove an ordinary member of An tÚdarás from office.  That is a little harsh and I think the Minister will find many legislative precedents in matters brought before this House, particularly in relation to health legislation where there is, at least, an element of consultation before a person finds himself getting a polite letter from the Minister and overnight he is gone.</P>
    <P>I would question also the position where members might be nominated for election to either House of the Oireachtas, or nominated to Seanad Éireann, and thereby cease to be a member of An tÚdarás.  I can think of a situation, for example in university academic life, where a person might be nominated for election to either House of the Oireachtas.  He may not be elected&mdash;a number of people are not.  If he is elected he should cease to be a member of the authority but I suggest to the Minister that a simple amendment stating a person ceases to be a member of An tÚdarás on election to the Houses of the Oireachtas would be in conformity with general practice, for example in the RTE Authority.  In regard to the latter where a member is elected to either House of the Oireachtas he ceases to be a member of that authority.  It would be wrong if 18 persons of eminence in this country, in charge of our higher education, should overnight find themselves out of office and out of the work of the authority.</P>
    <P>These are my comments for the moment in relation to this Bill.  It has been suggested that the chairman of An tÚdarás should be appointed by the President, but the Labour Party do not <Col N="1122" /> see a great deal of merit in that.  If the Federation of University Teachers have not found much consolation from the Labour Party benches this evening in relation to the amendments they have suggested, this was not meant in an anti-academic sense.  It was simply that we want this Bill to go through the House as quickly as possible.  We consider it is a valuable piece of legislation and we are not going to indulge in any special pleading on anyone's behalf in relation to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the guidance of the current chairman of the authority and with the hope that he and his fellow members will not find themselves in the years ahead being subject to enormous fluctuations in Government policy in relation to higher education, we support this Bill.  Perhaps our wish that these fluctuations will not occur is expecting too much, with due respect to the Minister who is certainly not the target of our comments this evening.</P>
    <P>There is one final point in regard to paragraph 21 of the schedule.  We hope an annual report will be brought before this House rather than the periodic reports that were suggested yesterday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. We all realise that if the Minister were St. Peter himself he could not deal with all aspects of education.  The Minister is truly democratic; he is trying to see that higher education is undertaken in a democratic way and the Preamble to the Bill proves this point.  It states that its purpose is to examine the existing provisions for higher education with a view to making recommendations to the Minister for Education on the necessity for the existing provisions or the elimination of unnecessary duplication. I was in this House when it was proposed that a Higher Education Authority be set up.  I was very pleased with this because if anything will raise the standard of the people of any country it is education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Higher education has been undertaken in all civilised countries and in States that have enjoyed their freedom for many years.  We were hampered in this country and there was a lack of secondary schools so that very much depended on our national schools and <Col N="1123" /> the teachers there.  These people did very good work and we owe much to them.  Now we have free secondary education and this is a step that has been welcomed by all.  The provision of higher education is another step forward and we should do all we can to help in this matter.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the placement of students is essential.  When a student has an aptitude for a certain subject it is well known that frequently he gets to the top.  If he is misplaced in another section he may not be so good at all.  Paragraph (e) reads:</P>
    <P>maintain a continual review of the country's needs in higher education;</P>
    <P>That is a very important consideration. Our economic survival depends to a great extent on having highly qualified technical people.  Paragraph (g) reads:</P>
    <P>conduct inquiries and initiate and publish studies on problems of higher education;</P>
    <P>That is another laudable and necessary exercise.</P>
    <P>(i)  make regulations governing the form in which each institution will present its annual budget and accounts to the authority;</P>
    <P>All the Members of the House will welcome that as a good democratic exercise.</P>
    <P>(j)  endeavour generally to further the development of higher education and to promote a knowledge of its value to the country;</P>
    <P>It is necessary to show to our people they have reached the time when they can have higher education in their own country and that a pupil can go from one institution to another and be chosen for a special course in higher education which is suited to his ability.  One of the functions of the authority will be to assist in the co-ordination of State investment in higher education and to prepare courses for such investment; to promote an appreciation of the value of higher education and research.  Research is the life-blood of our country.  It is a great pleasure to visit some of the institutions that have been set up in my <Col N="1124" /> time in this House and see the advances that have been made in the last quarter of a century by our own Government and by our own people. A change has come about in the country. The day has gone when a child would be kept at home from school for some trivial reason.  Nowadays parents are anxious that a child should have the advantage of the best education possible.  They realise that if anyone wants to get to the top he has to acquire as much knowledge as possible. The Minister says in page 3 of his speech:</P>
    <P>As will be seen from the terms of the Bill the role of An tÚdarás in relation to the provision to be made for higher education will be that of making recommendations.</P>
    <P>...Its first general report which related to the year 1968-69 contained a review of its activities and dealt with many of the immediate problems connected with higher education.</P>
    <P>This <i>ad hoc</i> body have succeeded in pinpointing their requirements for higher education.  They will be able to advise the Minister and his Department. In regard to the appointment of the members I believe the Minister should have the power to remove a person from the board.  The Minister is my colleague and since he became Minister for Education he has shown courtesy and consideration.  He is not a man who will rush in and say &ldquo;Paddy Burke should not be on that board because of some statement he made.&rdquo;  There might be people who would be acting against the national interest or who while they might be good in other fields, might not have the ability to deal with the matters it is the intention of this Bill they should deal with.</P>
    <P>I welcome the idea of student representation. The man who is in the field as a student should be able to make his own observations.  It is a good thing to see students taking an active interest in their own welfare. There was a time if a student said boo to the professor he would be out of the university or the school, as the case might be.  Times have changed and we must change with them.  If <Col N="1125" /> students go out into the street there is no harm done.  They will come back again, because they have their own way of settling down.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to see that the Minister will be advised by people from all walks of life who are fitted to give advice and who have an interest in the wellbeing of the nation irrespective of politics, creed or class.  More and more of our people are anxious to avail of higher education, whether technical or academic, and I hope that trend will continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCott" hpid="Mr. Cott Mr. Cott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cott</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, but there are one or two matters on which I should like an assurance from the Minister.  One is the appointment and composition of the proposed authority. I should like to see all institutions of higher education having representation on this new body.  Cultural, industrial and agricultural sectors will also need to be given representation.</P>
      <P>An important point which has been made by other speakers is on the question of student representation.  In my opinion there should be at least two students on the board, recommended by the Union of Students.  As we know students are becoming a powerful influence not only in the political field but in the social and other fields.  They should be given ample opportunity of airing their views.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the chairman of the board appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the authority.  If the Minister appoints the chairman there is the danger that he will appoint someone on whom he can exert considerable pressure.  I would not like, for example, to see a senior civil servant from the Department appointed as chairman.  I would prefer to see someone from outside the Department, and indeed from outside the immediate jurisdiction of the Minister, appointed in that capacity.  The chairman of the Ryan Tribunal was appointed by the Minister for Education with the disastrous result we all know, but that is outside the scope of this Bill and I do not wish to dwell on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good idea not to appoint the full complement to the authority immediately <Col N="1126" /> because as the Minister has pointed out it may be found that others deserve to be appointed at a later date.</P>
    <P>I do not think the appointment of chairman should be permanent.  The Irish Federation of University Teachers suggested a period of seven years and this seems to me to be a sensible suggestion.</P>
    <P>Section 4 states:</P>
    <P>In performing its functions, An tÚdarás shall bear constantly in mind the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture and shall endeavour to promote the attainment of those aims.</P>
    <P>I can quite see the idealism it is attempted to incorporate in this Bill but there is a danger that the authority will be over-burdened because of over-emphasis on this subject by certain Ministers for Education.  I would respectfully refer the Minister to the reservations of certain members of the Commission of Higher Education on the attitude to Irish in general in the country.  Mr. D. Buckley had this to say in the Commission's report, 1960-67,</P>
    <P>Provision of staff and facilities for teaching through Irish should be conditional upon the existence of reasonable demand for such courses on the part of students.</P>
    <P>Dr. J.J. McElligott expressed reservations that,</P>
    <P>&lsquo;Experience over the past 40 years has shown how unsuccessful have been efforts to make Irish a spoken language of general use.  These efforts, to my mind, have been responsible for more than one educational setback in as much as other and more worthwhile targets of educational policy were neglected such as commercial and scientific subjects, modern languages and cultural activities of a more varying kind, with consequent adverse effects in the field of higher education&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>He also pointed out that the UNESCO Institute of Education recommended that only about 15 to 30 minutes a day should be devoted to the second language specifically.  If we are to be honest it is generally recognised by all <Col N="1127" /> and sundry, including the Government, that Irish is the second language and over-emphasis on it certainly does have a detrimental effect in schools.  It can indeed impede development and lower standards.  For all too long it has been the badge of nationality.  I am in favour of a revival but the measures at present adopted by the Government are having no effect whatsoever in that regard.  The number of native speakers is dwindling yearly. That is why, as I say, this could be a very dangerous point particularily if the Minister for Education is very much in favour of a revival at any cost.</P>
    <P>Section I (1) (c) states:</P>
    <P>an institution which the Minister, after consultation with An tÚdarás, designates by regulations as an institution of higher education for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Federation of University Teachers that the iniative should lie with An tÚdarás to designate places of higher education.  This would avoid the Minister succumbing to political pressures.</P>
    <P>I believe a member of An tÚdarás should be removed, where good cause has been shown, on the recommendation of the chairman.  It is stated that where a member of An tÚdarás attains the age of 70 he should cease to hold office.  It would be a good thing if the age limit were lower because I am convinced, with education developing as rapidly as it is throughout the world today, that young people are in a better position to judge our needs and our potential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House very long.  The House in general welcomes this legislation which provides for the setting up of An tÚdarás which will advise and establish guidelines for long-term planning especially in relation to our university system.  We all know and appreciate the role education has played in our social and economic development.  We are all aware how much State expenditure on education during the last five to seven years has increased.  As the Higher Education Authority pointed <Col N="1128" /> out in its first report more money will be needed as time goes on.  This is coupled with the rapid changes which have taken place within the system in recent years.  The numbers attending post-primary schools have gone up rapidly.  The free education scheme was implemented and the free transport system and the raising of the school leaving age all played a part, no doubt, in increasing the number of pupils availing of post-primary education.</P>
      <P>It is our aim, and I hope it will be the general aim, to reduce the element of snobbery in education, if I may put it that way, which regrettably was present in this country as well as in many other countries.  We should like to see a broader outlook in this regard. There is no room for snobbery in education especially in the arts, science, technological and other faculties. It is edifying to see the numbers who are responding to the provision which has been made for post-primary education.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority commented on this fact and in its report issued a word of warning to all.  The authority referred to the limitation on student numbers and to the numbers of students who could not be catered for possibly because of a failure to provide adequately for future needs.  It also referred, and I think rightly, to the limitation which is imposed on the Minister in any given year in the amount of money which he may be able to extract from the Exchequer to support the educational programme in general.</P>
      <P>We are dealing now with higher education and we are referring in passing to the fact that by reason of the numbers coming forward to post-primary schools there will be an increasing demand for higher education. In a debate like this, talking about the setting up of An tÚdarás as an authority to advise the Minister, one is more or less confined in the scope of the suggestions one might like to make. One of the points which I should like to stress is the fact that, as the Higher Education Authority pointed out, accommodation is the greatest need, accommodation and better appointments within the walls of the universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> If one were to refer to the faculties or to the subjects taught, one could stress the need for an extension of the programme and one could regret the lack of facilities for some faculties.  I have in mind the practical side of life, not the academic side.  To give an example, some time ago we had a debate here about Bord Fáilte and some of us referred to the number of girls who leave school and turn their backs on domestic science.  I should like to see a degree in domestic science in our universities.  That would upgrade the subject and perhaps youngsters leaving post-primary schools might become interested in it.</P>
    <P>There are other points with which I should like to deal and which I should like to see implemented in our university system.  In general we are all agreed that, if we are to have a better university system, this must be brought about by long-term planning and by advanced advice, shall we say, and not by fire brigade tactics.  One cannot change the educational system overnight but one can mend the system which we have and one can extend its various facets and, in time, one can mould it to the needs of the community.</P>
    <P>Our university system served us quite well in the past.  We have heard a good deal of criticism of it.  One of the criticisms was, regrettably perhaps, that we over-weeningly favoured the academic side as against the technological and scientific side.  Possibly in the past the need was not so great as it is now, but the need is now pressing for this type of specialised knowledge.  If we are to produce graduates of the standard to be found in Europe perhaps, or in England or America, we will need all the support and all the help we can get from the community by way of co-operation and a stiff amount of money together with the necessary money to invest within the walls of those universities in order to create the type of institution which we would like to see here in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to say that I appreciate very much the constructive manner in which <Col N="1130" /> Deputies dealt with this Bill.  It does not follow that I agree with everything that was said but, nevertheless, I accept that their criticism was made in a constructive manner.</P>
      <P>I shall first deal with some of the points raised and then, perhaps, deal with the Bill in a more general way. Reference was made by Deputies FitzGerald and Thornley to the fact that there was a certain criticism of the members of the <i>ad hoc</i> Higher Education Authority when it was first set up because of their alleged attitude towards the merger proposals.  It is true to say that they have now more than proved themselves.  In their first report they have shown to the people of the country that they are an autonomous body, independent not only of the Minister but also of the institutions of higher education from which they come.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald referred to the Royal College of Surgeons and wondered why it was not included in the Bill.  I should like to assure him that there is no doubt but that the Royal College of Surgeons will be classed as an institution of higher education for the purposes of the Bill.  So also will the institution in Limerick and also other institutions which are constituted on similar lines.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to section 1 (1) (c) of the Bill.  They pointed out that it provides that &ldquo;institution of higher education&rdquo; means:</P>
      <P>an institution which the Minister, after consultation with An tÚdarás, designates by regulations as an institution of higher education for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They felt it would be better if the Authority were responsible for this rather than the Minister.  Of course, the fact that it is referred to in this way in the Bill does not mean that the initiative necessarily rests with the Minister. In fact, I should imagine that the initiative would come on practically all occasions from the authority but it is visualised that the designation will be done by formal regulations which would be placed before the House and for that reason obviously it is necessary that the Minister should be the one to designate the new institutions of higher <Col N="1131" /> education.  It is also well to bear in mind that where new institutions are being set up their establishment will, generally speaking, involve legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald also felt that, perhaps, the Conference of Irish Universities should have been brought into being as part of this Bill.  Without knowing what the future constitution of Irish universities will be, it would be difficult, to say the least of it, to bring in a Bill setting up a Conference of Irish universities.  The whole reform of the university system is very important. It has been suggested that I have been rather slow in bringing in legislation in relation to this matter but I feel that because of its importance and because of the fact that whatever legislation is brought in here will affect Irish education for very many years to come, it is important that we should be very careful to ensure that the legislation which we bring in here will be as effective as it is possible to make it.  Again, in relation to the conference Deputy Thornley and, I think, Deputy Desmond mentioned that they were not particularly concerned about it.  For my part I have an open mind in relation to it.  I am awaiting the recommendations of An tÚdarás in regard to it and to other matters associated with the organisation of higher education in general and university education in particular.  I shall make up my mind when I see what the HEA itself puts before me in regard to it.</P>
    <P>Deputies FitzGerald and Thornley referred to autonomy.  I have already placed on record my views in relation to autonomy.  I spoke at length on it in my reply to the Education Estimates. I do not propose to paraphrase what I said because there would always be the danger of what I say being misinterpreted&mdash;I do not say, deliberately, but there is always the danger.  I would tend to agree with Deputy FitzGerald that the definition of autonomy differed depending on who attempted to define it.  There is one definition by those inside the university and another definition by those outside university. I would agree that we should have some sympathy, perhaps, with the attitudes of university authorities in the <Col N="1132" /> sense that I suppose everybody is conservative, even the most left-wing individual, in his own particular field. At the same time, I feel it is essential that we should have a <i>via media</i> in relation to this and that we should try to approach it with an open mind.</P>
    <P>Suggestions were made that we should change the section of the Bill which relates to the membership and define academics as those who are engaged in full-time academic work.  If we did this I am afraid it is quite possible we would be limiting ourselves to an unnecessary degree.  There are professors who are not classed as full-time professors.  I am told that professors, for example, of clinical medicine are part-time and we would, by deciding that the only academics entitled to be on the Higher Education Authority must be full-time, be rather narrowing the numbers from whom we can choose.  Deputy FitzGerald mentioned that if a person were appointed at 68 he could go on for a considerable number of years.  Of course, the members of the Authority must retire at 70.</P>
    <P>There was some discussion on the question of the appointment of a chairman. What seemed to be implied was that the Minister would tend to accept what the chairman proposed in relation to the membership.  In fact, that is not so.  The chairman can give advice but the Minister does not necessarily have to follow it.  It is pretty normal procedure for the Government to nominate the chairman and I think it is important that we should be in a position to select the best qualified man for the job.  For that reason I left it open so that we could have either a full-time or a part-time chairman.  In some cases it is possible to get a very well qualified man willing to act full-time. On the other hand, there are occasions on which perhaps the most suitable person would not be able to take office on a full-time basis.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the fact that the approval of the Minister is required, especially in relation to staff appointments made by the Higher Education Authority.  I want to clarify the position. The situation is that the approval of the Minister arises only in relation to the creation of the post.  After that <Col N="1133" /> the Authority can appoint whomsoever it wishes.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the desirability of the Authority issuing a report annually.  Deputy Desmond referred to the fact that I am free to call on the Authority, under section 21, to issue such a report at any time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Thornley and Deputy FitzGerald referred to the £15 million for capital work.  It should be obvious from the reports published to date by an tÚdarás that they feel free to express whatever views they wish and they have, in fact, done so.  This shows that they are in fact an autonomous body.  They came up with £24 million in one instance as against my figure of £15 million.  That is explained in the context of new building techniques and standards and methods of costing of which the Higher Education Authority could not have been aware when they framed their estimate. I do not think there is any conflict between An tÚdarás and myself in this matter.  On the debate on my Estimate I pointed out that the new techniques and methods had resulted in my Department succeeding in reducing the estimated cost of the regional technical college by £2 million.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond asked for the deletion of the section which provides that, if a member is nominated for either the Dáil or the Seanad, he will be required to resign from the Authority. This is standard practice.  If an academic decided to contest a Seanad Election it might be suggested that, because he was a member of the Higher Education Authority, he would have an advantage over other candidates.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the powers conferred on An tÚdarás, An tÚdarás will, on the one hand, provide information and advice for the Government and, on the other hand, transmit the practical effects of the Government's decisions through the medium of their grant allocations to higher educational institutions.  It is in this way that An tÚdarás will assist in the co-ordination of State investment in higher education. In its role as a body making recommendations in relation to grant allocations and advising on developments <Col N="1134" /> generally, it is logical that it should be the body to give advice on the establishment of new institutions of higher education.  It is equally logical that it should maintain a continuous review of the demand and need for higher education.  In carrying out this review and keeping abreast of developments it is only natural that it should require a great deal of information from institutions of higher education, not only at stated intervals, but also as necessity arises.  The authority to seek this information is contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 10, it should be borne in mind that a situation could not be allowed to develop in which each institution would conduct its affairs oblivious of what was happening elsewhere.  All unnecessary duplication must be avoided.  This will be one of the functions of the Higher Education Authority.  There can be no question of one institution growing to a size at which it becomes unmanageable while others from the point of view of student numbers might be less than viable.  Furthermore, universities could not proceed without due recognition of the other institutions of third level education and the role they must fulfil.  The capacity of the nation to absorb the products of our higher educational system, while making due allowance for wastage, must be one of the prime factors determining the overall provision to be made for higher education.</P>
    <P>With regard to the constitution of An tÚdarás, the present body, with its membership of 14, has worked very well.  One of its greatest assets is that it is not constituted on a representative basis.  It can and does act in an entirely objective manner when examining the various matters coming before it.  The provision to enable the Government to increase membership to 18 is designed to enable the Government to appoint an additional member or members should the Government feel that An tÚdarás might be in need of additional expertise in a particular field.</P>
    <P>There have been some comments on section 3 with regard to general functions. All one could hope to do in a <Col N="1135" /> Bill of this kind is to have a wide statement of general functions.  These particular terms were actually suggested to me by the Higher Education Authority itself.  If we become too specific the danger is we will not know where to end.  One could fill a book with all the suggestions made as to what might be added.  Certain other suggestions which might be added to this might mean nothing in law.  This was the only way in which we could couch the general functions&mdash;the way in which we have done it.  As Deputies may see, section 3 assigns to An tÚdarás the general function of furthering the development of higher education, assisting in the co-ordination of State investment in higher education and preparing proposals for such investment and promoting an appreciation of the value of higher education.</P>
    <P>Immediately following this section, in sections 5 to 13, the specific functions and powers which An tÚdarás will exercise in relation to its efforts to attain the general aims are spelled out.  The general function expressed in section 3 will also be fulfilled by the interaction of An tÚdarás with the authorities of the various higher education institutions and with other interests and bodies concerned in a way in which all of these bodies would come to see themselves as participating in the process of defining objectives, settling priorities and formulating policies and programmes, all of which would add up to the submission of advice to An tÚdarás and the Government which would enable them in turn to make informed choices when deciding on the amount of public funds which should be devoted to higher education services.</P>
    <P>The underlining objective is to create a system under which those immediately concerned in the running of higher education institutions will be conscious of their own involvement in the process of policy making and will better appreciate the factors which lead to Government decisions affecting higher education as a whole and will recognise more clearly where their own institutions fit into the general scheme of things.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> Deputy Cott, in regard to section 4, quoted some people as saying that Ministers for Education might tend to overburden the Authority in relation to this national aim of restoring the Irish language.  I regret to say that our universities have not overburdened themselves in relation to it.  If, in fact, we have failed in our efforts to revive the language&mdash;of course, I do not admit this&mdash;then the universities must bear a considerable share of the blame.  In my view the big mistake made in the effort to revive the language was that we tended to ask the little children travelling the country roads to school to revive it while the universities, which might be expected to give the example in relation to the revival of the language which is the most important part of our national culture, did relatively little.</P>
    <P>This section should not be interpreted merely as a pious hope but as a provision that places a definite legal onus on the Authority.  It would also enable the Authority when making recommendations to give a degree of priority and special treatment to proposals connected with the advancement of Irish or teaching through Irish in institutes of higher education.  This section lays on the authority a general duty in respect of the national aim of restoring the Irish language and developing the national culture.  This function can be discharged in the same manner in which the Authority can perform the general function expressed in section 3, that is, by the interaction of the HEA with authorities of various higher education institutions and so on.</P>
    <P>This process is bound to emerge gradually and in practice it must commence with specific proposals from the institutions themselves to An tÚdarás in relation to the development of their activities to be funded by An tÚdarás. An tÚdarás could make a beginning by asking the institutions to consider how they could contribute to the aims in question and it would be hoped that among the proposals put forward there might be some which might be accorded some priority for funding in 1972/3 or 1973/4.</P>
    <P>An indication of the choice of action which would be likely to present itself can be found in the Report of the <Col N="1137" /> Commission on Higher Education, 1967 which investigated the whole problem in considerable depth.  Certain practical proposals were made there&mdash; for example, a preliminary survey to determine the number of university teachers able and willing to teach their subjects through Irish; measures to ensure an adequate supply of text books and specialist literature in Irish; schemes of financial aid for students incurring additional expense through taking courses in Irish.</P>
    <P>Recommendations were also made by Comhairle na Gaeilge which very broadly are similar in their general nature to those made by the Commission although they differ in detail. Whatever selection from these alternatives may be made it would seem that the most positive contribution which An tÚdarás could make would be to consider as sympathetically as the availability of funds allows the case that Irish studies and teaching through Irish warrants special treatment for the university departments concerned in relation perhaps to staff student ratio and research grants.</P>
    <P>As I said already, if An t-Údarás are to advise me on the development of the higher education system generally, and assist in the co-ordination of State investment in it, it seems logical that they should be the body to advise on all aspects and proposals for the establishment of new institutions of higher education.  The maintenance of a continuous review of the demand and needs for higher education was specified in the outline terms of reference of An t-Údarás.  This was decided by the Government and published in August, 1968.  In order to carry out this review effectively it was felt necessary for An tÚdarás to organise the production, the collection and the correlation of statistical material of all kinds in relation to designated higher education institutions.  It will also be necessary that An t-Údarás have full access to all information, financial and otherwise, relating to such institutions.</P>
    <P>The distinction between demand and need in the text is deliberate.  Broadly, demand in this context means the totality of qualified applicants for admission to higher education institutions. <Col N="1138" /> To meet demand fully would imply an open-door policy towards the admission of all qualified applicants to the faculties of their choice.  In some professional faculties the universities have already reached the maximum number of students for whom existing facilities can cater.  On the other hand, need in this context is the estimate of the requirements of the community for the services of graduates of various categories, due allowance being made, of course, for drop-outs owing to failure in examinations and other reasons. Need in this sense can only be determined by manpower forecasting techniques which are still to a very considerable degree imperfect.  However, as Deputies are aware, such forecasting is an integral part of economic planning and is being undertaken currently by Government Departments, for example, the Department of Education in relation to the teaching service and the Department of Labour in relation to technicians and skilled operatives.  Of course, it has to be recognised that need cannot be estimated with anything approaching absolute accuracy as it is always difficult to foresee the extent to which circumstances may change.  Nevertheless I feel that once need has been broadly assessed target outputs for graduates of various kinds can be set and expansion programmes planned to meet these targets.</P>
    <P>I suppose it could equally be said &mdash;I do not know whether Deputy Thornley would agree with me here or not&mdash;that there could also be planned reduction in outputs where it might appear they are already too high.  However, I would accept that some additional need might have to be conceded in order to cater for legitimate aspirations to acquire higher education even if this has to be done to some degree at the expense of some emigration of the products of the higher education system.</P>
    <P>One of the functions of An tÚdarás would be to endeavour to clarify these issues so that the Government might, first, be advised as to what is necessary to meet need, and secondly be furnished with the information required to make a decision whether some additional concession <Col N="1139" /> should be made to need and if so how much.  The Government's decision published in August, 1968 also included in its outline terms of reference the placement of students.  It is envisaged that An tÚdarás in their quinquennial submissions to the Minister would supply the best analysis of demand and need that can be made and that the Government's decision on such submissions will contain general policy directions as to the overall provision of student places which should be aimed at by the end of the quinquennium. Such general directions, it is expected, would include a certain order of priority in relation to science, technology, management, business studies and so on.  Of course, the validity of such choices will depend on the success of the forecasting of demand and need and identifying and giving early warning of social and economic trends.</P>
    <P>All this must imply a limitation on the admission of students to all faculties in all the universities in the not too distant future.  As I said previously, there are already limitations on the numbers of students admitted to many professional schools.  It would seem that with the number of students qualifying for admission to the university increasing all the time, and with the stimulus of the scheme of State grants for university students, subject to a means test, we are coming close to the time when admission to every university place will be competitive.</P>
    <P>I might say that this is already substantially the position in Britain.  As many Deputies will know, there is a central organisation, the Universities Central Council for Admission who handle all applications for admission to British universities centrally.  They match candidates to places by reference to their academic achievements, preferences for courses and preferences for institutions.  This is a very expensive operation and I do not visualise that at the moment we would be likely to utilise that system because the number of universities and higher education institutions which we have are limited but it might be that in our situation here it would be preferable that a <Col N="1140" /> centralised system to control admission should cover non-university third level institutions as well as universities.  In fact, there might be no alternative to operating this type of central agency.</P>
    <P>If we take sections 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 together and analyse them we can construct a model of the entire procedure which is envisaged from the submission of claims for grants from public funds by institutions of higher education, through the process of appraisal and analysis of such claims, to the point at which the final decision will be made on them.  Section 7, section 8 (1) and section 11 ensure that An tÚdarás will be supplied with and have access to all the information that they will require for the performance of their functions under this Bill.  The purpose of giving An tÚdarás power to specify the manner in which requests for State subvention shall be made and to require institutions to supply them with all relevant information is to ensure that all institutions concerned shall support their requests for funds with statistical information relating to students, staff and costs in a form which the Authority will determine.</P>
    <P>Two purposes will be served by this arrangement.  First of all, the necessary statistical information will have to be supplied as a condition for the consideration of requests for funds in every case so that the information will be available when it is required, and secondly that over a period of years it will be possible from the statistics to work out norms in relation to such matters as staff student ratios, departmental costs, administrative and technical support services, library operations, academic services such as examinations and prizes, maintenance costs and so on, against which claims for funds can be assessed.  Eventually it would be hoped that An tÚdarás would arrange that higher education authorities would submit proposals for programmes for development at intervals of five years, but of course each institution would be required to submit annually an estimate of its requirements in the following year. The term of five years I have mentioned is not in the wording of section 7 only because it is clear that in the final analysis An <Col N="1141" /> tÚdarás would be forced to gear its forward planning to the general system in the public service which operates at present, namely, a system of forecast estimates for three years ahead.</P>
    <P>On the basis of experience in Britain, it is generally believed that a five-year period would be the most suitable.  I think we could accept in relation to major developments in the field of higher education that it would be difficult to envisage new courses being organised, additional staff with specialised qualifications, and new buildings and facilities being provided within a period of three years.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should outline briefly the steps and the procedure leading to overall Government decisions on university financing.  First, there will be the determination of the current financial position of each institution to be funded by An tÚdarás in order to establish the extent to which existing assets and current income, other than income from the State, can support the activities of the institution concerned. Each institution would submit a development programme to cover a period of five years.  It would have to support this proposal with a detailed breakdown of current operational costs, a statistical breakdown of students and staff, projection of the growth of student numbers, increases in staff, and expenditure on buildings and equipment which the proposed programme would entail.</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás would examine these programmes.  It would work out a co-ordinated scheme for the development of the whole system over the five-year period, bearing in mind the need to eradicate unnecessary or uneconomic duplication and the desirability of encouraging the development of distinctive centres of excellence in each institution.  At this point claims for development of new fields of study or research would be considered and, if necessary, choices could be made between competing claims.  The entire scheme should be broken down into its various elements and an order of priority for these elements suggested. All these elements would then be costed.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of An tÚdarás <Col N="1142" /> would be submitted to the Minister for Education and, after processing in the Departments of Education and Finance, in consultation with An tÚdarás they would be submitted to the Government for a policy decision.  It is hoped it might be possible for An tÚdarás to be given a decision in general terms indicating the extent to which the recommendations were acceptable, having regard to the resources available and to other priorities.  The Government decision might cover, for example, the limit to which the overall number of university places might be increased over the five year period; the projects that might be undertaken by the various colleges and those which should be postponed; the extent of the provision for capital sums to be made in respect of the five years and the extent to which the total allocation of recurrent grants might be increased over five years.</P>
    <P>Section 10 (2) would have to be considered in conjuction with section 6 (2) to ensure overall control in relation to the number of student places to be provided while, at the same time, ensuring that no single institution would be allowed to grow too big while others remained less than viable.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 12, it is envisaged that the total of the allocations approved for any given year would be paid over to the Authority for transmission to the institutions concerned.  I think Deputies will agree with me that normal parliamentary control would demand that the amounts, whether capital or current, proposed to be allocated to each institution should be shown separately in the Book of Estimates. What will appear in the subheads in the Estimates will be the total amounts, one capital and one current, and in an appendix will be shown the amounts made available to each third level institution.</P>
    <P>When general policy in relation to the three-or five-year period has been given, An tÚdarás should revise the programme originally submitted in the light of these decisions and should submit for approval proposals showing the allocation proposed to be made to each of the institutions concerned in the first year of the period in question. In respect of each subsequent <Col N="1143" /> year further allocations would be recommended. Each proposal would be related to the allocation of the previous year and to the general policy laid down for the entire period.  When it becomes possible to operate on the quinquennial basis I have mentioned, An tÚdarás should prepare a mid-term review showing the out-turn of the programme to date and the progress made towards the original targets which had been approved.  It could recommend then any revisions of such targets as might be deemed necessary. At the end of the quinquennium there should be another review and this should be submitted with the recommended programme for the following quinquennium.</P>
    <P>With regard to An tÚdarás, it is not constituted on a representative basis. I think it would be illogical to expect a body constituted on a representative basis to be able to make recommendations on an objective and impartial manner, free from local pressures and interests.  The reservation of a minimum number of places for holders of academic posts does not mean that the members appointed in that category are to be considered as representatives of the various institutions to which they belong.  The provision is intended to show a special concern for the expression of a body of opinion, with a close personal association and continuing interest in the matters under consideration.  The Authority have not a proprietary interest in the institutions with which they will be concerned; they merely make recommendations and carry out certain executive functions.  There is much more I could say on that aspect but I shall finish on that point.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to students. I have a great respect for the work done by students.  I have met them on many occasions since I became Minister and I have always found them an excellent group of young people.  I am anxious to give them a role in the development and operation of our educational system.  As the House is aware, I have appointed a student to the governing body of each of the three constituent colleges of the <Col N="1144" /> National University of Ireland.  However, I do not believe in appointing students simply because they are students.  I will do this only when it is clear to me that they have a contribution to offer.  The nature of the tasks allotted to An tÚdarás, as well as its non-representative nature, precludes the appointment of representatives of the student body as such. However, students are not ineligible for consideration.  I have a feeling that the demand for such representation is based on a misconception.  An tÚdarás is not part of the university or the higher education structure.  It is a separate organisation set up for the specific purpose of giving independent advice to the Minister.  It is not an elected body.  The members are appointed entirely on the basis of their expertise, their experience and their qualifications for the particular assignment. Long term planning is an essential feature of the work of An tÚdarás. The term of membership, accordingly, should be reasonably long.  The proposal is five years with eligibility for reappointment for another five years. Allowance must be made for the fact that a student would need to be at least two or three years in the university before acquiring any real acquaintance with the work there.  Any proposal for the appointment of a person to represent student interests for a further period of five years would hardly be a reasonable one.</P>
    <P>Again it needs to be emphasised that an appointment to An tÚdarás is based on personal qualifications. Again I want to stress that students are not ineligible.  It is simply their lack of experience and the opportunity to have acquired the necessary knowledge to make them useful members which would be the obstacle to their appointment. The fundamental issue here in relation to the membership of An tÚdarás is that it should be adequate, useful and efficient.  An tÚdarás will be dealing mainly with financial and administrative matters and with academic questions only to the extent that they impinge on the financial and administrative matters.</P>
    <P>Students could not be expected to have the necessary expertise in this <Col N="1145" /> area of activity, but I would say this&mdash; I see no reason why an tÚdarás could not appoint students in an advisory capacity.  I have shown my goodwill towards students in the appointments I have already made, and I think that when Deputy FitzGerald advocated that students should be put on the Authority he was not all that certain what role they might fill.  As I say, I am very favourably disposed towards them, but I think that if the Authority were to appoint them in an advisory capacity this would be the best way in which they could contribute towards the development of our educational system <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Higher Education Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister For Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an unusually simple, single-provision Bill, the sole purpose of which is to provide statutory authority for the payment to Radio Telefís Éireann of grants in respect of net receipts from broadcasting licence fees during the two years ending 31st March 1972.  Section 2 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1966 authorised the payment of such grants for the period ended 31st March 1970, and the present Bill provides for a two-year extension of these financial arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from a special subsidy provision for the initial five years, the arrangements in question have existed since the establishment of the Authority. They provide for payment to Radio Telefís Éireann of the full net revenue from broadcasting licence fees, i.e. gross receipts collected by the Post Office and paid into the Exchequer less the costs of collection and any costs incurred by the Post Office in dealing with the prevention of interference in relation to the reception of broadcasting programmes.  The payments to Radio Telefís Éireann are <Col N="1146" /> made in the form of Grants-in-Aid voted by this House under a subhead of the Vote for my Department.</P>
    <P>In proposing in this Bill to provide for continuance of the financial arrangement for two years instead of five years as in previous Acts I have a number of factors in mind.  Changes of an administrative nature in the Broadcasting Acts are under consideration and I hope to introduce a further Bill during the year to deal with some of them.  My main reason, however, is that I wish to give consideration to the question of making a general review of the position of sound broadcasting and television.  It is now eleven years since the Broadcasting Authority Act of 1960 established an independent Authority to control these activities. At that time Irish television lay in the future and there was no adequate experience by which to judge how sound broadcasting would fare under independent control and with the competition of television.  All I would care to say at this stage is that I think the services have been developed successfully and have given general satisfaction to users, while, as was inevitable, encountering a healthy measure of criticism.</P>
    <P>Despite the success of the Authority's activities there is much to be said for a periodic review at intervals of 10 years of thereabouts.  Whether such a review is desirable at this stage and if so what form it should take are questions on which I have not reached a conclusion in the short period since my appointment to my present office.  But looking to developments already under way, such as the provision of Gaeltacht radio stations, the advent of communal aerials for groups of 500 houses, and the prospect in the more distant future of coloured television, to mention but a few, I consider it would be imprudent to ask the Government or the House to commit themselves at this stage to continuance of the existing financial arrangements for so long ahead as five years.  I hope to be in a position within a comparatively short period to reach a conclusion on the question of a review and with the approval of the Government to take whatever action is decided upon as most appropriate.</P>
    <P>A Supplementary Estimate for my <Col N="1147" /> Department, including provision for an increased grant-in-aid to Radio Telefís Éireann, is due to be taken very shortly. As the Estimate debate is usually considered an appropriate occasion for discussion of the affairs of the Authority and general questions affecting the television and radio services, I suggest in the interest of economising the time of the House by avoiding a debate in duplicate that Deputies may care to hold over their general comments until the Supplementary Estimate comes before them in the next few weeks.  But this is, of course, for Deputies themselves to decide and I shall endeavour to answer any questions raised.  In the hope that the course I have suggested will commend itself to Deputies I propose to confine my remarks on the Bill mainly to financial matters.  Before starting on these remarks, however, let me assure Deputies in whose minds the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; Tribunal may be uppermost that the Supplementary Estimate which they will be dealing with shortly will contain an additional sum for expenses arising out of the tribunal so they will then have the opportunity of discussing this subject if they wish to do so.</P>
    <P>Turning now to financial matters with which the Bill is solely concerned, Deputies will have seen in the annual reports and statements of accounts of the Authority which have been laid before the House each year that during most of the five-year period covered by the 1966 Act, the buoyancy of licence and advertising revenue enabled the Authority to show an overall surplus of revenue over expenditure, despite sharp increases in costs, an unchanged licence fee and a substantial loss each year on the radio service. Towards the end of the period, however, there was a general levelling-off in growth of licences, and in the fifth year the surplus was converted to a small deficit.</P>

    <P>The last mentioned deficit was caused <Col N="1148" /> by the loss of £676,029 on the sound broadcasting service, which was not fully compensated by a surplus of £654,646 on the television service.</P>
    <P>The surpluses earned in the first four years mentioned above together with drawings from depreciation provisions were ploughed back into the development and expansion of the services, and capital assets were increased from £3,116,334 at the beginning of 1965-66 to £4,796,950 at the end of 1969-70.</P>
    <P>In fact despite the capital expenditure incurred and capital assets created the Authority has not yet drawn any part of the extra sum of £1 million authorised in the Act of 1964 for capital purposes. At present its total indebtedness to the State amounts to £2,100,000 made up of £249,000 in respect of property <i>et cetera</i> transferred to the Authority at the outset, under section 32 of the Principal Act and £1,851,000 in respect of repayable Exchequer advances.</P>
    <P>When the 1966 Bill was under discussion in February, 1966 it was thought possible that the whole additional £1,000,000 might prove inadequate for the capital requirements of the following few years and that an increase in the existing limit of £3 million in repayable Exchequer advances might prove necessary.  Happily this need did not arise.  But the Authority's capital needs continue to be heavy and are estimated at not less than £2 million in the near future, including heavy expenditure on completion and equipment of the sound broadcasting building at Donnybrook, renewal of the Athlone transmitter, efforts to improve reception of television programmes in certain areas <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>The Authority is obliged by section 24 of the Principal Act so to conduct its affairs as to secure that at the earliest possible date its revenue becomes sufficient not merely to meet current expenses but also to make suitable provision with respect to capital expenditure.  In view of the heavy continuing capital needs it would be unrealistic to expect the Authority to commence repaying its indebtedness to the State in the period to which this Bill relates.  The Authority is, of course, <Col N="1149" /> paying interest on the advances from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>From July, 1970, increases of £1 in the combined licence fee and 5s in the sound broadcasting fee were approved. The amount of the Grant-in-Aid shown under Subhead L in the printed volume of Estimates in respect of licence revenue for 1970-71, namely £2,135,000, does not include the extra revenue in respect of these fee increases. A supplementary Estimate is necessary to enable this amount, estimated at £400,000 to be paid to the Authority.</P>
    <P>It is as yet too early to say what the out-turn in the current year 1970-71 will be, but it is clear that the Authority's recent financial difficulties will continue for some time ahead.  The elimination from 1st April next of cigarette advertising on television, which in the last full year before phasing out began yielded £300,000, will be costly to the Authority.</P>
    <P>Advertising receipts constitute the main source of revenue available to the Authority, accounting in the last financial year for over 60 per cent of total income.  Many people, and the Authority itself, consider this dependence on advertising excessive and disproportionate and, of course, many find the commercial interruption of programmes so irritating that they would like to see advertising dropped altogether.  The hard fact, however, is that advertising content, at present limited to 10 per cent of broadcasting time, could be reduced only by increasing the licence fee, and to cease advertising altogether would involve increasing the combined licence fee from its present level of £6 to approximately £14.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly clear that the Authority requires the payment of the net amount of revenue derived from sound and television licences and, indeed, further special efforts will be made to eliminate evasion of payment of licence fees so as to maximise revenue from this source.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>As this is the first time the present Minister has <Col N="1150" /> introduced a Bill to this House I should like to take this opportunity of wishing him every success in his ministry, which is a very difficult one and one which will become increasingly more difficult. I hope, for everyone's sake that he makes a great success of it.  As the Minister has said the Estimate is coming up tomorrow and it seems superfluous at this late hour to go into detail, when I take it we can adequately deal with it on the Estimate.</P>
      <P>If I remember correctly it was the intention under the 1960 Act that the authority would become self-supporting but this seems to be unrealistic now. I do not think it could be self-supporting even if television and radio licence fees were increased.  The only way it could become self-supporting is if the number of advertisements were increased but, as it is, these advertisements are ghastly and some of them are in very bad English.  I understand the authority does not have any control over an advertisement once it has been paid for.  Certainly I do not think we could have any more advertisements on television.  I recognise the fact that the cessation of cigarette advertising will be a tremendous financial loss to the authority.  They were courageous in accepting the fact that it was better for the health of the nation that these advertisements were taken off.</P>
      <P>The whole radio and television business will have to be looked at again because as it stands I cannot see how it could be selfsupporting.  I am glad the Minister mentioned the Seven Days' Tribunal.  I shall have a great deal to say about that tomorrow.</P>
