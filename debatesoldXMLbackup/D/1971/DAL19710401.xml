      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 2, 3, 28 and 6.  It is proposed to interrupt business between 1 p.m. and 2.30 p.m. to take No. 6. Questions at 2.30 p.m</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, in accordance with Standing Order No. 31, I addressed Question No. 8 on today's Order Paper to the Taoiseach, he being the person who has official responsibility for indicating the extent of our territorial waters.  In accordance with Standing Order No. 31 I addressed Questions 11, 12, 13 and 15, and I understand Deputy Byrne addressed Question No. 14, to the Minister for Defence, he being the person who has responsibility for those affairs in his Department as they are matters of administration for which the Minister for Defence is responsible.</P>
      <P>These questions have been altered without any prior consultation with me, in accordance with the provisions of Standing Order No. 32.  Therefore, they are irregularly set out in the Order Paper; they are addressed to a Minister who has no official responsibility in the matter and I respectfully ask, Sir, that you would have the Order Paper amended and the questions addressed to the appropriate Minister and the Taoiseach before Question Time today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, Sir, Standing Order No. 32 provides that alterations to questions may be made only after consultation with the Member responsible for the question.  This consultation has not taken place and if there has been irregularity on the part of Ministers or officials in their Departments it cannot be allowed to thwart the rights of Members of this House or their duty to address questions to the Ministers responsible.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has no responsibility in his own Department for the deployment of the defence force of this State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, this is no answer to my submission.  It is an alteration in a question&mdash;one that goes very much to the root of the question&mdash;if it is transferred from a Minister who has responsibility for the matter to a Minister who has not responsibility.  There is a clear and specific obligation under Standing Orders to consult with the Member who tables a question addressed to a particular Minister.  It is irregular to have on the Order Paper for answer by a Minister who has no responsibility for the matter a question which is the statutory responsibility of other Ministers.</P>

      <P>Long-standing practice cannot make good a bad practice or make regular a matter that is highly irregular.

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
    <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;( )  Before making any assessment under this section An tÚdarás shall first consult with each institution of higher education regarding its financial and other needs.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a case has <Col N="1965" /> been made and I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained on many occasions my reasons for not accepting this amendment.  As Deputies are aware, the section is concerned with making assessments by An tÚdarás.  I explained that on practically every occasion it would be necessary for An tÚdarás to have consultations with the various institutions.  There will be some occasions on which quite small supplementary allocations may be made by An tÚdarás, so that available funds can be channelled to where they are most needed at a particular point of time. I do not see any reason why we should tie An tÚdarás to operate at all unless it consulted with the various institutions. We should remember that one of the functions of An tÚdarás is to co-ordinate State investment in higher education.  How this could be done without consultation I do not know, but I do not think we should put An tÚdarás into a straightjacket in relation to many minor matters with which it will have to deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the Minister's reference to &ldquo;many minor matters&rdquo;.  The matters we are talking about as defined in section 10 (1) refer to the assessment of &ldquo;amounts of State financial provisions, both current and capital, which it recommends for higher education and re-rearch or for any part thereof&rdquo;.  This is not a minor matter.  The whole nub of this Bill is the function of An tÚdarás in doing just this and in so far as a recommendation or assessment relates to a particular institution it is clearly unacceptable that that institution should not even be consulted in relation to a decision that An tÚdarás makes as to what it will recommend or assess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, they are not minor matters. These financial assessments we are talking about are fundamental to any institution. If an institution is seeking financial assistance it is, of course, a matter for An tÚdarás to decide whether it merits it to the extent that it thinks.  Quite frequently it could decide negatively but at least the institution <Col N="1966" /> concerned should be informed of the thinking of An tÚdarás before the assessment is made and given an opportunity of commenting on the view which An tÚdarás has formed.  Otherwise there is a very unsatisfactory situation in which the institution puts forward its financial claims.  It hears nothing from An tÚdarás.  It does not know whether the case has been accepted or not.  It does not know whether An tÚdarás could have misunderstood some aspect of it or have come to a conclusion which is not warranted by the full facts known to the institution concerned.  The whole thing can go forward to the Government as an assessment, privately and secretly, without the institution knowing what assessment has been made of its needs or how it has been arrived at.  It could very well be that at the end of it the amount the institution receives is a great deal less than it looked for and that could be due to a failure in communication, because a single, one-way communication of a document going from the institution to An tÚdarás and never discussed between the two is clearly open to confusion and doubt.</P>
    <P>It seems essential therefore that when An tÚdarás has made up its mind as to what it thinks are the requirements put forward by a particular institution, it should inform the institution of that and receive any views the institution may have which may help to clarify its mind on the matter before proceeding to send in the assessment. The Minister seems to be adopting a contradictory line in saying he cannot conceive that it would not do this and, on the one hand, saying it is unnecessary to legislate and, on the other hand, we must not legislate because it cannot be forced to do it and it ought not to be forced to take such action in respect of minor matters.  As I do not understand what the minor matters are, as every matter here is a financial assessment of the needs of a university or other institution of higher education, I cannot accept that argument. When the Minister says &ldquo;of course they must consult&rdquo;.  I agree with that and it should be given statutory form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed that the Deputy should suggest that An <Col N="1967" /> tÚdarás not only would but could make an assessment of the needs of an institution without having consultations with the institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is suggestion this, not I.  I am suggesting it should not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy has said is that an assessment could be made by An tÚdarás secretly without the knowledge of the institution concerned and that this assessment would be sent forward to the Minister without the institution concerned having any knowledge of it.  This is splitting hairs.  How could An tÚdarás possibly make an assessment of the needs of an institution without consultation with the institution?  I have, on many occasions here, accepted amendments for a number of reasons and particularly where I felt an amendment strenthened the Bill; and also where I might not personally feel it made much difference but where at least I believed it would not do any harm.  But where I feel amendments will water down the Bill I do not intend accepting them. This amendment would put An tÚdarás in a straitjacket.  We could tie it up so that it could not move at all without consultation.  As I say, there are certain minor matters which could arise in relation to which there would be no need for a further consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give an example?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The assessment could be made at an early stage.  It could be found afterwards that some minor change was necessary, perhaps the transfer of funds inside the institutions or between institutions, and if this were a relatively small matter I do not see why there should be consultation on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being self-contradictory.  He is amazed I should suggest that an assessment should be made without consultation. He then tells me it would be quite normal to make such an assessment without consultation if it involved a minor matter of the transfer of funds between one institution and another.  If <Col N="1968" /> the Minister knows of any institution of higher education which would regard as minor the transfer of funds from it to another I would like to know the name of it.  I have never come across such a phenomenon.  The Minister says there is no question of this being done and then he proceeds to tell us the cases in which it will be done.  He can hardly expect us to accept that attitude.  Either in all cases there will be consultation&mdash;which is what the Minister appeared to be saying at first, in which case let us put it in the Bill&mdash;or there will not be consultation in all cases, in which case the Minister need not be so amazed at my suggestion that there would not be consultation in all cases.  He cannot have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I add my support to Deputy FitzGerald here?  The Minister does seem to be trying to have it both ways, saying one minute that the process of consultation is inevitable, and the next minute that it is a watering down of the Bill and the placing of the HEA in a straitjacket. How one is in a straitjacket by being asked formally to do something which it is inevitable one would do in the first place I simply do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Not to talk about a watered-down straitjacket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right, the water torture.  Would the Minister not accept that through no fault of its own the HEA started off with a certain degree of distrust among the academic community?  This partly stemmed from the narrowness of mind of many of the senior academics and, I admit, partly from the circumstances in which the HEA was set up.  However, an amendment of this kind, without in any way infringing the underlying principles of the Bill would, as the Minister has explicitly admitted in one part of his arguments, go a long way to reassure the academic community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what I have said has been misinterpreted, perhaps not deliberately, but I spoke about minor changes.  First of all, there must be consultation if an assessment is to be made.  That is common sense.  That <Col N="1969" /> is looking at it from a practical man's point of view.  Once the assessment is made, if a minor change were necessary in the assessment An tÚdarás could not make this minor change in the assessment without going back to the institution concerned.  This could concern a considerable number of institutions at various times and, perhaps because of the preparation of the Book of Estimates and so on, it would be necessary to get in touch with the Minister in a relatively short space of time.  If there was to be a constant returning for the purpose of consulting on minor matters, everything would be held up.  I am convinced that, first of all, from a practical point of view, there must be consultation and, for that reason, there is no need to put it in the Bill: secondly, if we did put it in the Bill, it would have the effect of forcing the authority to consult on any possible minor change that might be made in the original assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure that is being outlined by the Minister is one that I had not thought likely to take place.  I had pictured the authority making an assessment in respect of the year or a longer period, particularly in the case of capital funds and the Minister and the Government deciding whether to give it.  Certainly, I had not envisaged the kind of horse trading exercise which the Minister seems to envisage in that the Government would go back to the authority and say: &ldquo;We are not very happy about this.  We should give a little here and take a little from somewhere else.&rdquo;  I am somewhat disturbed to hear that this is how the Minister envisages the authority working.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The initial assessment of this, in so far as it will happen, will not stand and the Department will find themselves going back to the Higher Education Authority and arguing as to where a little extra or otherwise should be given.  It is precisely in relation to these matters that consultation would be particularly important. There would be nothing more unsatisfactory than that a university or other institution of higher education should find themselves in the position of having been consulted as to the initial assessment, knowing what had been sent in by the Higher Education Authority and then to find, subsequently, that in some horse trading behind the scenes, the authority had sold the thing down the river and had handed over to some other institution funds which they understood the Higher Education Authority believed they ought to have.  Because of this there could be a severe lack of confidence between the institutions of higher education and the Higher Education Authority.  This is all the more reason why consultation is necessary. Therefore, I press this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I am interested in this because the Deputies opposite have been pressing for a certain amount of latitude for the authority.  Section 12 deals with this aspect.  However, at this stage, if I am to interpret correctly what Deputy FitzGerald has said, they want to put them into a type of straitjacket whereby they could not make any change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I never suggested that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there should be any misunderstanding in relation to what I have said about the transferring of money from one particular institution to another, I might refer to, for example, capital which is not spent and which in the original assessment was made available for one particular institution but which was not spent by that institution.  If it was found necessary to use it in some other institution, An tÚdarás should be entitled to transfer the money, without being statutorily <Col N="1971" /> obliged to have consultations. In fact, this has been done on many occasions but the problem up to now has been that it was necessary to bring in a Supplementary Estimate in order to do so.  In a situation such as the one I have instanced, it should not be necessary for An tÚdarás to consult with the institution concerned.  It would have been obvious that the money was not needed in the institution for which it was originally allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's idea that consultation is a straitjacket is revealing.  I have heard various Fianna Fáil views on consultation at different times but none of them has ever conformed to what is my idea of consultation. This is a new one.  If a situation should arise, such as envisaged by the Minister, the secretary of An tÚdarás has only to telephone the secretary of the institution concerned and tell him that since they have not made use of their full allocation and since it is necessary to complete a building in some other area, the money should be transferred.  But, of course, this would not prejudice the claims of the institution for the next year.  It would be merely an internal book-keeping transaction.  I cannot understand how such a telephone call could be regarded as being a straitjacket except that the whole attitude of the Minister and his Department is that consultation is a straitjacket.  We have seen this in so many cases.  We have heard from the Minister and from previous Ministers proud references to the process of consultation which the Department have initiated in various places but I have never met anybody who has been engaged in consultation with the Department and who has been satisfied with the Department's concept of consultation.  That is not to say that many people in particular cases have not been satisfied with the results of what they achieved but the basic idea held by the Department in so far as consultation is concerned is not the kind of open consultation which most people envisage by that word.  Obviously, if a telephone call is to be regarded as a straitjacket, the kind of relations that the Department would <Col N="1972" /> have either with institutions or individuals would be very unsatisfactory.  It is not surprising that relations between the Department and the various bodies connected with education have been unsatisfactory.  That is not to say that much has not been achieved.  Neither is it to say that many of these bodies have not very high respect for many aspects of the Department's work. However, regarding consultation there is a basic failure on the part of the Department to understand the meaning of that word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>The instance which the Minister cites is not a very happy one.  My imagination boggles at the thought of an institute of higher education that would tell the Minister at the end of the year they had not used the grant that had been made to them.  I cannot imagine anyone being so native. Like Deputy FitzGerald, I found the Minister's remarks slightly sinister. There seemed to be an indication that the authority would consult in the first instance with the universities and in the second, third, fourth and fifth instances in which the original grants were pruned or altered, with the Minister. Far from putting the authority in a straitjacket, this amendment would enhance their status as an initiator of university policy.  I wish to place the warning on the record of the House that what I fear is that the authority would in practice be bypassed by the more astute academic politicians who will be consulted and who will get their way so that it will be only when the Book of Estimates appears, we will see the influence of certain individual academic politicians, if I may refer to them as such.  This would downgrade the dignity of the authority and their whole purpose.</P>

      <P>Certainly, I would not regard that particular type of attitude as being any different from what <Col N="1973" /> I am suggesting that the Higher Education Authority should be entitled to do.  Deputy Thornley says that his mind boggles at the idea of any institution not spending all the money made available to them.  Only yesterday we transferred a considerable sum of money&mdash;I think it was £190,000&mdash;to other institutions.</P>

      <P>Yes.  We pointed out that £220,000 which had been made available as capital to Galway University had not been utilised.  So far as my Department are concerned, we have had and will have as much consultation as possible not only in relation to this but in relation to all other aspects of education.  In recent times in this House, as well as through other media, the charge has been made that the Department do not consult.  I suppose if this is repeated often enough, it will be believed.  But the facts are as I pointed out in relation to the Development Branch of my Department yesterday that as far as that particular aspect is concerned I know of no country in which so much consultation has taken place as has taken place here.  The same of course applies to other sections of my Department.  Indeed, one of the problems I have had personally is that I have to meet so many different deputations on different matters; I consult with them in relation to aspects of my Department in which they are interested; I take note of their suggestions and if I feel that they are worthwhile suggestions I make use of them in the development of policy.  It is untrue to say that my Department do not consult&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is quite obvious to everybody that the work of the Department has been exceptional in recent times.  Indeed, I might add that were it not for the fact that a considerable number of changes were initiated in the Department itself I doubt if there would have been any changes at all. What I would like to see would be everybody involved in the development of our education system, but often we have been placed in the position in which, because changes have not been suggested from quarters from which one might expect them to be suggested, we have had to go ahead ourselves and in the process invariably involved ourselves in a considerable amount of controversy.  Most groups involved in the educational scene tend to be conservative, they do not like change, but that is not to say that when change takes place they do not accept it if they find that it is worthwhile, but in general terms people&mdash;and this does not just apply to education&mdash;do not like to see the old ways changed.  For that reason we have had to initiate various changes in the educational system which met with a considerable amount of initial opposition.</P>
      <P>I want again to say that it is not a fact that consultations do not take place between outside interests and my Department.  However, as far as I can see we are side-tracking this whole issue and splitting hairs.  I am pointing out that in relation to the main aspect of this discussion it should be quite clear to everybody that consultations must take place but I am not going to tie down An tÚdarás to having to consult on various small matters.  Again, referring to what Deputy FitzGerald said when speaking about the arrangement, it is not looking at this matter in a practical way to suggest that an assessment could be made by An tÚdarás, that An tÚdarás could then go to the Minister and say &ldquo;this is our assessment&rdquo; without having consulted the institution concerned.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to take up a <Col N="1975" /> point that the Minister made, I never of course said that the Department do not consult.  I referred to extensive consultations but the concept of consultation remains one which is not that of other people because it is consultation, very often, when the Department have made up their minds what to do and are trying to sell it to the people and whether they accept it or not it will go through.  The people who are being consulted know that is the attitude and that the thing is a waste of time.  That kind of consultation has arisen frequently in this area and it is very unsatisfactory to people who want open discussions.  The Department have not yet managed to devise a method of consultation before they come to decisions in many areas.  I appreciate the difficulties involved in this, and indeed in another context I referred to this on the Estimate yesterday.  We need to devise some new approach to these problems.</P>
      <P>In recent years we have failed to maintain the kind of open contact that there ought to be between the Executive and the Administration on the one hand and the people on the other. It is very rare to have any consultative body in which the Minister himself plays a role.  There have been one or two cases, for particular reasons, and in two of these cases the results were not very happy but the reasons were particular to those cases.  I would like to think that we could have a situation in which, where major policy issues are being discussed, consultation would mean that the Minister would sit down with his administrators, his professional staff and the interests concerned for free and open discussion, even if it takes a couple of days on a major issue, to try to see what is the right answer.  The present system is the formulation of proposals in the Department, acceptance by the Minister, and an attempt to sell them to the various interests concerned.  This, indeed, can be very frustrating.  I think we have to rethink this whole process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The feeling of everybody who is dealing with the Department is that he is dealing with a machine and that he cannot get through.  The Minister takes <Col N="1976" /> his advice from his administrators and it is not clear what direct access the professional people have to him.  Many people in touch with him feel intensively frustrated because they have not got a direct policy-making role, that anything they put up is channelled through the administrators; the educationalists outside feel that they are up against a blank wall.  There is no free and open discussion or consultation. That is what I meant and not that there is not consultation in the sense of endless discussions, but that the process of consultation does not mean the same thing in the Minister's Department as it does to people outside.  Therefore there is great frustration.</P>
    <P>The use of the word &ldquo;straitjacket&rdquo; in respect of consultation was perhaps an unconscious reflection of an attitude of mind which runs right through this business.  On the issue itself I hope that the debate on the amendment will have some effect on the way the authority operate.  I do not believe that the authority will wish to damage their relations with the bodies with which they will be dealing by making changes in assessment as originally put forward, and known to the bodies concerned, without consulting them.  We, by not amending this Bill accordingly, are making it possible for them to do that and to damage their relations with these institutions by so doing.  However, I would have enough confidence in the body as at present constituted, and indeed in any likely form, to think that because of their composition, because there will be a number of academic members anyway, who will be sensitive to opinion in the institutions in which they are, there will in fact be very close consultation, but I am not satisfied that we in this House are doing our duty when we leave open the possibility of inadequate consultations. Our job is to require that things be done by law in a satisfactory manner and not always to trust the good judgment of other people, whether they be Ministers or anybody else, that they will always, if not required to do so, act judiciously in matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>One point about which I am not too clear is the relationship between this <Col N="1977" /> body and the National Science Council when we come to the question of financing research.  Perhaps the Minister could explain the respective roles of these two bodies and in matters of research what co-ordination is proposed between them.  The National Science Council have an important function in relation to the financing of research. This impinges on academic institutions and at the same time part at least of the funds with which this authority will provide universities will be used for research, including research in the scientific field.  It seems to me that there is here a need for co-ordination.  I would not claim to know what the right way to tackle this is but I am sure the Minister must have given it considerable thought and I should like to hear how this might best be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of consultation which the Deputy has again raised I want to stress that I am personally most anxious to have consultation with all groups.  In a sense there is contradiction in what the Deputy says and the attitude he adopted yesterday in relation to the community schools situation.  What I pointed out then was that I had hoped to have full and frank discussions with the various groups closely concerned with the schools, for example, the Hierarchy, the IVEA, the heads of various religious orders, teachers or organisations and so on and that when we evolved a generally acceptable scheme we could then have it discussed publicly.  I should be quite willing to have the views of any group sufficiently interested and to make changes if I found that the views put forward by the various groups concerned were worthwhile and warranted change.  But we must have something to go on.</P>
      <P>Some outsiders appear to view consultation as agreeing to what they want. They are very quick to make public the fact that they would like to have consultation but that the Department were not willing to have consultation with them, when what they really mean is that the Department having consulted them are not willing to accept their particular viewpoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the straitjacket aspect, <Col N="1978" /> what I was concerned with here was that I was anxious not to tie down An tÚdarás in relatively minor matters. Once we put in the amendment suggested by the Deputy it would mean that they could not take any decision, even the most minor one, without having consultation.  I thought this would not be in the best interests of the whole third level educational system. In regard to the liaison between the National Science Council and An tÚdarás, the fact is that the present chairman of the National Science Council is also a member of An tÚdarás.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an interesting fact but what process of co-ordination is proposed?  That is a useful link to have but does the Minister propose to have something more formal than simply the fact that there is someone there who knows that there is something going on that requires co-ordination?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to consultation and community schools, the point I raised yesterday was a specific point.  The Minister in response to a request received sent a document to one member of the Hierarchy and when that was communicated to the rest of the Hierarchy and it got out that it had been sent to the Hierarchy, the Minister did not clarify the position.  While it was a perfectly innocent and appropriate response by the Minister to a request to send the document, when it was misrepresented and especially when the papers got the impression that the Minister had communicated with the Hierarchy as a whole on his <Col N="1979" /> own initiative and not with the secondary school managers he created a feeling of unease among secondary school managers and other educational bodies which was unnecessary.  This should have been clarified at the time.  I endeavoured myself to clarify it and the Minister confirmed my interpretation at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis but I think it is a mistake to allow such an impression to get around, because the Hierarchy's interest in education is only one of a number of interests and, in a sense, is a minority interest because the religious orders are responsible for far more schools than the Hierarchy in the secondary education sphere which is what we are talking about here, post-primary.  There is also the vocational education side where there are other interests involved rather than the Hierarchy.  It was unfortunate that in responding quite properly to a request for guidance as to what the thinking was, when this went wrong the Minister did not clarify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question of consultation involved when the Minister got that request and responded by sending the document he should have covered himself at that stage by sending it to all interests concerned. Thirdly, on the question of consultation the Minister talks of consulting various bodies and then when he has made up his mind, communicating it to the public.  I am not happy with this whole business being done behind closed doors.  All these are interests but the people most concerned with education are the parents and the pupils and I did not hear the Minister mention consulting them until a decision had been taken by him in consultation with all the other interests concerned.  In a matter as important as this, it is important that there should be public knowledge of the matter at issue and public discussion before the Government's mind is made up on the matter because, unfortunately, the whole system of government in every country seems to depend very largely on the government taking decisions and feeling that if they change these decisions they lose face.  It is a human instinct that is as true in China as <Col N="1980" /> it is here or elsewhere.  It is true at every level of society when there are institutions, whether ecclesiastical institutions, voluntary bodies, governments, or political parties.  That being so, a system of consultation which is limited to particular interests when a decision is being formulated and then put forward for public discussion when it is too late for public discussion to influence it, is an unsatisfactory procedure. I should prefer a more open system of consultation on major issues of this kind.  If it is a purely technical issue which involves the form of an examination paper or something like that, you do not need discussion in the correspondence columns of the <i>Irish Times</i> about it.  That could be settled at a more technical level although in instances like that, there could be consultation with representatives of parents and teachers, but when you have major policy issues I do not think they can be settled in the way envisaged by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we are going beyond the scope of the Bill but nevertheless I think I should say something in regard to what the Deputy has said.  While it is true that this document was sent to one particular bishop, as I pointed out yesterday, there were other areas involved and this is public knowledge.</P>

One of my principal reasons for having sent it to the Catholic Hierarchy is the fact that there were certain overall considerations with which they could deal in relation to Catholic schools.

      <P>The Deputy need not be one bit worried.  I am consulting with all concerned and they know exactly what I have in mind.  The Deputy mentioned public discussions.  We know from experience what happens in relation to public discussions when they take place on an emotional basis: things tend to be polarised.  Unless there is some firm basis for discussion I do not think we get from it the results we would like.  In relation to the question of community schools I felt we should try to get as much agreement as possible with those concerned and then the public discussions would be on a much firmer basis and we would not have got anything like the same emotion introduced into the matter as we unfortunately did.  With regard to the question of losing face the very fact that I have accepted a number of amendments here proves that I am not worried about losing face.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to waste time by covering the same ground again but I feel there is a possible problem here.  It is very hard to know what the right balance is because clearly An tÚdarás could require information of a degree of detail which would, of its nature, impinge on the reasonable autonomy of the institution and one has some fears on that score. On the other hand, I freely admit it is possible that institutions might unreasonably wish not to give information and it could therefore be important to An tÚdarás to have some power to get information.  It is very difficult to hold the balance in this case but it is worthwhile alerting An tÚdarás to sensitivities in this area.  I would not want to restrain An tÚdarás from looking for information which it really and genuinely needs and I feel there will be times when it seeks information which it ought to have to do its work but which the institutions may be reluctant to produce partly for practical reasons and I am not at all sure that something of the kind may not happen in the near future.  An tÚdarás may require information on the costing of the system, to give some impression of the relative cost of the different areas within an educational institution, as a basis of formulating policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, if we are going to have a higher educational policy while cost cannot be the determining criterion it is a relevant criterion and would be relevant to such matters as the determination of the appropriate level of fees.  It cannot however be the determining criterion because if that were the case areas of specialised knowledge would not be studied at all, <Col N="1983" /> not only in the sciences but also in the arts, because the degree of specialisation is such that the cost of teaching or research would be so high that to charge fees related to the cost would be to actively discourage studies from being carried on.</P>
    <P>There can be no question of the rigid relationship between fees on the one hand and costs on the other.  That having been accepted it is still legitimate for An tÚdarás to seek information of this kind and I can see why they need power in this matter.  I hope they will exercise this power judiciously and I hope the universities and other institutions will co-operate freely with An tÚdarás and if An tÚdarás looks for information on costings in different areas that this information will be given.  There may be practical difficulties to be overcome in some cases but I would hope a measure of close co-operation would be built up between the two bodies.  It is an area of some delicacy because either An tÚdarás or the university or other institutes of higher education could adopt unreasonable attitudes on particular points.  I hope that will not happen.  I do not think it will, but it is worth airing the issue here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  I should like to see both An tÚdarás and the various institutions acting reasonably in relation to this but I think I can allay the Deputy's fears by informing him that the format in which this information will be sought is being worked out at the moment by An tÚdarás and the various institutions and if they come to agreement on this, it will ensure that there will be a reasonable attitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have exactly the same view of this Bill as Deputy FitzGerald.  It is one thing for the Minister to tell us that a form is being worked, but what is to prevent a future Minister from saying, &ldquo;I do not agree with my predecessor, I want all information reasonable or unreasonable&rdquo;? Bureaucrats have one view <Col N="1984" /> about information especially about education and other people have a different view about what is &ldquo;reasonable information&rdquo;.  In legislation of this kind the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is extremely objectionable and I do not think it should ever be used in a Bill.</P>
      <P>As the State is spending so much money it must gather it in every way possible.  If An tÚdarás had come into existence in a different way, I might have been more inclined to agree with this kind of thing but it is composed partly of quislings.  The only people on genuine guard are the three registrars in the universities who, I take it, were put on <i>ex officio</i>.  I cannot understand why the Registrar of University College, Galway, was not put on at the time even though he was about to retire, and I have not heard that his successor was put on either.  If they are put on officially the Registrar of University College, Galway, should also be put on.  I should like to know why he was not made a member of the authority because the Registrars of Trinity College, UCD and UCC and a number of other professors were put on.  Their colleagues in the universities regard them as quislings and rightly so in my opinion.  There were other people, but one man who was put on was extremely perturbed about being put on.  For him I have a considerable regard and he, at least, brought some administrative expertise to this body, which is essentially an administrative body.  This man brought considerable experience of administration to the body.  Mark you, unless my information is incorrect, he was extremely perturbed about being put on this body.</P>
      <P>I said earlier that this body removes the universities from the Department of Finance.  Formerly they had to make their case for money to the Department of Finance; now they will have to make it to An tÚdarás. Of course, this is not the only authority. Only yesterday we were told about another new authority&mdash;an airports authority.  We have all kinds of authorities. Governments believe in different things.  This Government appear to believe in authorities.</P>

The Government employ these at very high rates indeed.  They call themselves business consultants.</P>
      <P>I will not suggest for a moment that this body is quite as bad as some of the business consultants are, but the idea is the same.  The fact is this Government do not trust anybody and, above all, they do not trust University College, Dublin, the biggest and most important university institution by far in this country.  They do not trust it.  Of course a certain type of bureaucrat is very keen on having power; but there are other bureaucrats who, being a bit on in life perhaps, do not want any power at all; they want to avoid trouble as much as possible.  But there is the other type, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years there has been considerable evidence of a decided development in the Department of Education.  I refer to the setting up of the so-called development branch. What interests me is, when you set up that kind of branch, from where do you get the staff to man it?  From where do you pull them?  Out of what hat?  From under what stone do they crawl?  It is no use thinking we are all idiots and that everybody is a fool. A body is set up choc-a-block with quislings, with the sole exception of <Col N="1986" /> the registrars, and then one proceeds to influence them through the medium of a development section of the Department of Education.  I have only got to think back on the history of the Department of Education to puzzle over the sudden change of face, a complete and absolute change.  One day the Department could do nothing at all and the next day it is able to do everything.  We will have new systems of education, new mathematics, new methods of teaching languages.</P>

      <P>I will have to move a long way to be anywhere near where the Minister is.  If the Minister would stand up now and be counted in relation to education he might make a better fist of it.  Perhaps the Minister would relate that to a particular matter; I do not mean it in that way necessarily but it could apply in relation to that matter.  Ministers have to stand up and be counted occasionally. I have no objection to being counted in a matter of this sort.  The Minister need not think he is solo from his colleagues and that he is the only person in connection with whom I object to this kind of legislation.  I object absolutely to this kind of legislation.</P>
      <P>An institution of higher education shall supply to An tÚdarás all such information...</P>

      <P>Because it is bad legislation.  I have already said that two or three times.  How often do I have to repeat it?  This kind of legislation is extremely bad.  It is the same kind of legislation as that put into Finance Bills at present: &ldquo;the Revenue Commissioners may make any order they like, and so on, under this section.&rdquo; We have had this time and time again.  I see no reason at all for it.  I have an interest in education and I see no reason why I should admit that this kind of legislation is good in an Education Bill when it is so blooming bad everywhere else.  The Minister would not expect me to do that, would he?  I do not think he would.  Would the Minister like to answer me?  Will the Minister explain why the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; was put in?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say once more that I have already informed Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Thornley that, quite possibly, their fears would be allayed by the fact that a format through the medium of which this information will be sought is being worked out between An tÚdarás, the universities and other institutions of higher education.  The Deputy suggests that some Minister who comes after me might, perhaps, change this.  The fact is the Minister is not involved in this at all.  It is an agreement which will be made between An tÚdarás and higher education institutions and, in so far as it is possible, it will be satisfactory to <Col N="1988" /> them and this, therefore, will ensure that a reasonable attitude will be adopted by both An tÚdarás and the higher education institutions in relation to information sought by An tÚdarás.</P>
      <P>It was quite shocking of Deputy O'Donovan to describe the members of the Higher Education Authority as quislings.  That was a shocking statement.</P>

I should also like to point out that there are no <i>ex officio</i> members of An tÚdarás and I am not aware of any member of An tÚdarás who is perturbed because he was nominated.  The Deputy ought to know, having been a Parliamentary Secretary in a previous Government, that you do not nominate people without first acquainting them of the fact that you would like them to become members of a particular organisation.</P>

The fact that I have said that a format is being worked out between the universities and An tÚdarás should allay any fears Deputies may have in regard to whether this matter will be approached in a reasonable manner. Deputy FitzGerald pointed out that is was equally true that the universities and other higher institutions could also act unreasonably.  I do not think that adding the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; would <Col N="1989" /> make very much difference except in so far as it would create a situation where there would be considerable contention as to what the interpretation of &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; might be.</P>

      <P>I will, indeed.  I would not have got involved in this at all but for the Minister's remark that I was alone in my attitude to this so-called body, and that I was the only person who held these views about it.  As I said on the last occasion when the universities want to do anything they will have to go to this body called An tÚdarás&mdash;I will not make the obvious comment on the last syllable of the word&mdash;and it will have to go to the Department of Education, and the Department of Education will have <Col N="1991" /> to go to the Department of Finance.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right for a man like Deputy FitzGerald who never really thought it out and who believes in GNP, a man who did not apply his mind to the realities. You can make the GNP as large as you like and have no real economic improvement for anybody.  We have this pushing away at the universities and making small boys of them.  Why did the universities develop best in Western Europe?  I cannot speak for Russia.  Their universities are exceptionally good technologically.  I do not know about them otherwise.  I read their main text book on economics on one occasion and it seemed to me that the opening part of it was full of ideology, and attacks on previous systems of education under which priests had influence, and so on. Despite all the talk we hear about the American universities, the place where universities developed was Western Europe.  Why did they develop there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My opinion of GNP may be regarded in this House as the ramblings of a fool.  What about the many people who were laughed to scorn? Thank God we are no longer burned at the state if we do not bow to the ideological gods of the moment.  The fact is that the queerest of individuals in universities have made the very finest discoveries.  They were looked on by their colleagues as being odd.  They said: &ldquo;Look at him over in the corner in a small room messing around with something.&rdquo;  We have all heard this about different people messing around with rabbits, or pieces of mechanism, or books, but they are the people who made the discoveries.  How would they get through this type of sieve?  How would they get any money?  With four or five stages to be gone through they would not have any hope of getting any support.  It is right and proper that we should knit the issue on this word <Col N="1992" />&ldquo;all&rdquo;.  It is a global word.  The section provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>as An tÚdarás may require for the purpose of performing its functions.</P>

Is any university which depends for its moneys doing this?  Is any university which depends on these moneys which in turn depend on the attitudes adopted towards the Higher Education Authority going to argue?  Is any university going to knit the issue as to whether unreasonable demands are being made on it?  I do not accept for one moment the answer given.  It is a pretty slick answer in parliament&mdash;to use the word which was used by the Minister for Finance about three times in a couple of sentences on one occasion.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, but I am doing more than that.  It was used about something this party were doing <Col N="1993" /> which is something far more important than what the party were saying.  I am not very much interested, contrary to most Irishmen who believe that one can do what one likes in Ireland so long as one says the right thing, in what is said.  I am interested in what people do.  We have seen the rights not alone of individuals but of big bodies filched away by the State in recent times.  The State cannot spend enormous amounts of money without intruding on people.  They cannot spend sums like the increase of £100 million as they did last year on current expenditure without intruding.  The section reads:</P>
      <P>all such information relative to the institution as An tÚdarás may require for the purpose of performing its functions.</P>
      <P>Suppose the institution in question wants to improve its sanitary accommodation or something like that, what kind of information will it have to give to this body?  Suppose it wants to set up a new section, what special competence have these 12 or 14 people got to decide on the matter?  Personally, I believe that there is a decided quisling element in it.  So long as these quislings are there, I will object to the very existence of this body.  I will continue to object as long as I live. The use of this kind of section means that all the authority have to do is say &ldquo;we require such information&rdquo;.  They need only quote the section.  The fact that the Minister says that they are preparing the form is not sufficient. How long does the Minister guarantee it for?  Suppose that inside the Fianna Fáil Party the Minister for Education were to be transferred to higher things&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is a certain hierarchy in them also.  I am not saying that the Minister wants a transfer. <Col N="1994" /> I am not making any institutions against the Minister, but I have not forgotten what he said about me.  We are not here to swallow whatever is being put before us whether we like it or not.  We are here to represent the people who sent us here.  There is nowhere where one represents them more than in the House on the Committee Stage of a Bill.  We are legislators. I know we engage in much nonsense. During the last week we pushed through a whole flotilla of Estimates. The Committee Stage of a Bill in the House is very important.  The Minister has not satisfied me with his arguments.

      <P>I must be very inarticulate indeed if the Minister did not understand from my description of the serious discoveries in science and learning that have been made during the century that I was speaking historically.  The Minister and his Department seem to think that everything started yesterday and that there was no such thing as education until now.  We are hearing from them as if they were saying &ldquo;There was nothing before us except nonsense.  Nobody knew anything about education or anything else until we came on the scene&rdquo;. This is the core of what the Minister has said.  I was talking about something which has been in existence for a long time and that is the tradition in the European universities.  This Bill is an intrusion.  I do not care what way the Minister defends it.  It is an intrusion on that tradition.</P>

      <P>The case the Deputy made earlier on for the exclusion of the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; did not appeal to me. Indeed, it was not a very educational point where the Deputy spoke about where some universities might be inhibited in the matter of the provision of toilets or something of that nature because of what the Deputy called this restrictive word.  Again, in the matter of the university tradition it is time that we moved away from the old concept and tradition.  We must provide for the newness of the day and get away from the day when the university was the preserve of the intellectual, educational aristocracy and minority. It is time that went.</P>

      <P>There must be a questioning voice as to how the money of sections of people in this country, who are contributing to the financing of the universities, is to be spent.  I would be utterly opposed to this continuance of autonomy that was given to the universities to spend money without having any regard to moneys that were required for the needs of the rest of the community.  I agree entirely that there should be on them, as there is on primary schools and post-primary schools, the same restriction in the matter of how they would expend the people's money.</P>
      <P>The universities are institutions which do not cater for the cross-section of our people as I would like to have them do.

      <P>I must say I share Deputy O'Donovan's nostalgia for medieval Europe although his reference to toilets makes me feel I might not have enjoyed the sanitation so much. I agree wholeheartedly that one wants to keep the State at bay in this sphere. There I am nearer in spirit to Deputy O'Donovan, though not in the letter, than I am perhaps to Deputy Tunney. In fact, one of the things we have to contribute when we go into Europe is this university autonomy we have here.  Perhaps we will help Europe to retrieve the autonomy lost in Napoleonic times.  However, that is, I am afraid, away from the section.</P>
      <P>I want to say in regard to the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; that I think it is unnecessary. If you had not got the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; the same legal power would be there to get whatever information they wanted and in putting it in it has raised Deputy O'Donovan's hackles and it might raise other people's hackles too.  I do not think it adds anything and it could be dropped. As we have not got an amendment to drop it perhaps we had better drop the discussion on it at this stage.</P>

      <P>I am worried by Deputy Tunney's remarks because his constant insistence on getting universities under control and putting them on a par with other educational institutions is the kind of thing which arouses fears which I do not think are justified basically amongst academics. There should be in this House a willingness to accept that universities are centres of excellence, places where research is carried on.  They are not simply teaching institutions.  You cannot simply allocate grants of so much a head per student as if it were simply a school.  If you do that, and if you rule out research, they cease to be universities and they will cease to do the job that is to be done.  There is a danger of pursuing the line Deputy Tunney appears to be pursuing on each occasion here.</P>

When you have a certain amount of money available for education I want the State to have some say in the amount that can be allocated to higher education primary and post-primary education.  I do not wnat it established that because somebody is an academic or because we belong to academic groups, that we, more so than anybody else, should have the right to say: &ldquo;We are academics; we say this amount of money is required; therefore you must give it to us.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Tunney took me up wrong on this. Nobody has suggested the State should not decide what money is to be given. Of course it should but there is a difference between allocating sums of money to institutions that are purely teaching institutions and where it is possible to assess the amount of money required in simple terms in relation to the amount of teaching done, the number of pupils, the number of teachers, the size of the school and so on and assessing the requirements of an institution which is carrying on activities some of which do not, and must not, serve any immediate social purpose.  There may be research going on into ancient Hebrew and if you ask me how that in the short run will serve the social interests of the people of this country or help the people in Ringsend I cannot tell you.  I am quite clear that it is vital that universities should be free to undertake this kind of research and although this will involve some waste and although you cannot control it by any rigid system, there has to be some bit of leeway here and that is precisely why we are introducing this body as a buffer between the State and the universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the one hand we cannot give universities whatever money they ask for.  This would be lunatic.  On the other hand we cannot have a situation where the Department are saying: &ldquo;You cannot do a bit of research on this&rdquo; or &ldquo;You cannot have a professor of this <Col N="2000" /> particular subject with only two pupils because this is wasteful.&rdquo;  There must be a middle course pursued.  The Bill pursues the middle course.  Our job is to make sure it does not veer too much one way or the other.</P>

Our job is to get the right wording to achieve this balance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister conveyed to me an idea of accepting imported ideas.  If we are wise we will think out our problems by ourselves. We certainly do not import ideas from a vast country such as Russia or America.  From the practical point of view it is not possible to do this. Deputy Tunney made reference to a certain amount of money but I agree with the Chair that this may be dealt with on the next section.  I suspect that the form that is being worked out is not that relating to section 12.  The normal forms worked out by Government Departments for subsidiary bodies relate to section 12.  I do not see how it would be possible to have any form that would cover all such information that An tÚdarás may require for performing its functions.  No one, not even the development section of the Department of Education, knows what its functions will be.  On the next section we can discuss in more detail the points raised by Deputy Tunney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make a broad statement which relates to this section.  From Deputy Tunney's remarks, one might imagine that there are no other bodies in this country that are not accountable. Does the Deputy not realise that we had a long discussion recently in <Col N="2001" /> Private Members' time and that the Minister for Finance agreed that this matter presented a serious problem? He was speaking about the accountability of other bodies which spend vast sums of money.  I do not think they are accountable to anybody but I shall not refer to any particular bodies although I have a few pet targets.</P>
    <P>Far be it from me to suggest that academics are reasonable people.  In fact, the recent effort to amalgamate Trinity College and UCD, which would be of benefit to both institutions, seems to have faded away completely due to the fact that academics are not reasonable.  The case I am making is that no body of men can determine what is the proper information that should be required from a university institution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What we have here are two alternative approaches to improving this section.  The Minister proposes to improve it by concentrating only on subsection (2) and by proposing an amendment to this subsection. We consider it is necessary to amend subsections (1) and (2).  I should like to speak on amendments Nos. 22 and 24 jointly and shall revert to the Minister's amendment later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 12 we propose to change the word &ldquo;amounts&rdquo; to &ldquo;a total amount&rdquo; and instead of &ldquo;institutions of higher education&rdquo; to state &ldquo;for higher education and research&rdquo;.  The exact wording is not very important. The Minister may have good reasons for suggesting that we modify it and I shall be prepared to listen to the Minister on this point.  We thought it was important that research be included. It is included implicitly if we have institutions of higher education but we considered by including it explicitly and making provision for it it might give more flexibility.  One could envisage a situation where the authority might wish to give a grant for some purpose which was to further higher education and research but which did not involve payment to an institution of higher education.  We consider this should be opened up. One could envisage a case of some study being carried out which would be of assistance to the authority in doing its work&mdash;perhaps a research study on the whole question of the organisation and running of the university&mdash;where it should be entitled <Col N="2003" /> to give a grant.  The wording we have suggested would give more leeway in that matter and I should like to hear the Minister on this point.</P>
    <P>In substituting &ldquo;a total amount&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;amounts&rdquo; we are concerned to make it clear that it is a matter for An tÚdarás alone to allocate funds which it receives from the Government.  As we envisage the procedure, the universities or institutions would submit their requirements to An tÚdarás who would examine them carefully.  No doubt An tÚdarás would prune them and then put forward to the Government an assessment of the total requirements, giving a suitable breakdown.  The Government would decide whether they could afford to give the total sum required, guided by the data furnished by An tÚdarás.  The Government either would give the full sum or, if the financial position did not permit, they would give less than the full sum.  The question of where the cuts were to be imposed as a result of the inability of the Government to furnish the full finances required would then be a matter for An tÚdarás alone. If An tÚdarás is to have any real meaning it should not be a matter for the Government to say to An tÚdarás: &ldquo;We are accepting your proposal for universities X, Y and Z but we consider university W does not deserve as much and we are cutting them.&rdquo; The purpose of setting up this body is to prevent any such situation arising and to remove the Government from the area of allocating funds to institutions.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Government's job is to allocate a total amount to An tÚdarás determined, on the one hand, by the statement of requirements put to them by An tÚdarás and, on the other hand, by the availability of finance.  The present wording &ldquo;such amounts for institutions of higher education&rdquo; carries with it the implication &mdash;which has not been clarified by the Minister's proposed amendment to subsection (2)&mdash;that the Government would allocate amounts to particular institutions.  While I cannot claim to have understood fully the Minister's explanation on the Second Stage of the procedure he intends to adopt I did not <Col N="2004" /> like the sound of it.  Perhaps if I hear more about it and understand it better I may be prepared to accept it.  What I understood him to say was that while the Government would allocate a total sum there would be shown in the Book of Estimates the amount provided for each institution.  I cannot understand this.  I can quite see that, if the Government do allocate the precise sum which is sought by An tÚdarás, it would then be possible, without any conflict on the question of the autonomy of An tÚdarás or the university institutions, for the Government to say: &ldquo;We have given the full amount asked for and this amount is the following in respect of the different institutions.&rdquo; There is no conflict there, but in the case in which&mdash;and it may well happen and happen quite frequently&mdash;the Government cannot give the full amount sought, how can the Government put into the Book of Estimates a breakdown of the amount it is providing except by showing cuts in the amounts for particular institutions requested by An tÚdarás, which would be immediately interfering with its autonomy? If the Minister is suggesting that despite that An tÚdarás would still have power to allocate the money differently, then the exercise of putting it in the Book of Estimates in the form of a footnote showing the amounts the Government intends for each institution would be pointless and misleading to the public.  If the allocation to each particular institution, as in the Book of Estimates is binding then An tÚdarás loses its autonomy.</P>
    <P>It may well be I have not understood what the Minister is saying.  It did seem to me obscure but I shall not pursue that point further at the moment because I do not want to waste time chasing a hare if the hare is not there.  The Minister may be able to satisfy me that what he intends is something different, but I merely want to explain at this stage why it was important that, whatever amendment is made to subsection (2), the wording in subsection (1) should indicate a total amount, that on each occasion when an assessment is made whether this is for a year or a period of years, a total amount would be allocated and paid to An tÚdarás in respect of that <Col N="2005" /> particular year or period of years on foot of that assessment.</P>
    <P>So much for subsection (1).  In subsection (2) the changes we have made are designed to get over the difficulty &mdash;which incidentally, is not by any means covered by the Minister's amendment&mdash;that it is clearly desirable that when capital grants are allocated to particular institutions they are used for the purposes for which they are allocated.  If I were Minister I would be understandably irked if I allocated money for a restaurant and got a students union or <i>vice versa</i>.  It is quite proper that An tÚdarás in allocating funds for capital purposes should lay down conditions as to how they are to be used.  It is equally clear to me that it would be inappropriate for An tÚdarás, the Government or anyone else, in respect of a general grant for current purposes, to say how that should be spent.  There is already an element of this in the present situation and it is extremely unsatisfactory. There is a certain breakdown, a separate provision for agriculture under a separate vote for a separate Department. We are hoping to get away from that.  There is also a separate provision about the teaching of Irish.</P>

He is right to raise the question as to whether they are going to recognise An tÚdarás if it does not recognise the State to begin with.  I hope the Minister will clarify the point.</P>
      <P>However, I am concerned at the moment that the funds that do go through An tÚdarás for general purposes should be allocated generally and not earmarked and not be subject to conditions.  It would be unacceptable to the universities or to any institutions of education that a sum having been allocated to them there should be no flexibility as to how they spend it.  For instance, having made a case that they wanted to have two extra assistant lecturers in French and one in Italian it transpires that they have miscalculated and need two in Italian and cannot get one in French and that they cannot do that themselves without going back and clearing it with the authority, that would be totally unacceptable. There is a clear distinction to be made between the capital grant and the current grant.  Our amendment makes this clear and I hope the Minister will be prepared to accept it and to integrate it with his own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>These are very important amendments and I support them unhesitatingly.  This is one of the crucial points in the entire Bill.  The Minister knows that quite sincerely I have not argued for autonomy of either the HEA or the universities to the extent that most of my academic colleagues have.  However, if the HEA is not granted a more or less decisive role in this sphere, then all we will succeed in doing is creating an even more cumbersome and detailed structure of financing higher education than exists at the moment.  You would nearly need a blackboard to illustrate this: you have the universities at the bottom with a channel of communication going up to the HEA to whom they make representations demanding certain sums of money.  Thereafter they need not be consulted in certain instances.  The HEA consults with the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Department transmit back their decisions to the HEA and the HEA, either with or without amendment&mdash;and this is one of the points Deputy FitzGerald is getting at&mdash;passes them back to the university.  Therefore unless teeth are put into the HEA here all you are doing is making the machinery still more cumbersome than before.  I am not in the least derogating the Department here but the Department must realise that the logic of setting up the HEA carries with it a readiness on its own part to surrender some of its previous functions.  I do not share the nostalgia of my colleague, Deputy O'Donovan, for the principle of direct negotiation with the Department of Education, but I would ask the Minister to state just how much power the HEA will have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald has correctly asked the question: will the Minister set the individual amounts for each institution or will the HEA do so? I would repeat that question and underline it.  The Minister's amendment to section 12 (2), which seems to be some sort of drafting amendment, does not seem to improve the substance of the Bill.  The section seems clearly to imply, as Deputy FitzGerald has said, the earmarking of current grants.  In the process of negotiation with the <Col N="2008" /> Higher Education Authority will the Minister or his Department have any say in the earmarking of specific current grants?  Deputy FitzGerald has already asked will he and his Department settle this total sum to be paid in current grants to each university. I go still further and express the expectation that the Minister himself may feel he should have some say in the internal distribution of these moneys in a specific institution.  If the Minister settles the amount and settles the internal distribution even of current expenditure, then you might as well not have a Higher Education Authority at all, because it is emasculated from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  Furthermore, in regard to the principle of earmarking current grants, Deputy FitzGerald's amendment derives, broadly speaking, from a somewhat similar amendment from the Irish Federation of University Teachers.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that very often I describe academics as fearful, suspicious and conservative people but in this instance there is some ground for their fears.  This has to be taken in the context of, for example, the Ministerial statement of the 6th July, 1968, a copy of which I have not got with me but perhaps Deputy FitzGerald will correct me if my memory is not correct. This statement contains phrases such as &ldquo;lateral expansion will only be permitted in certain departments, in certain campuses&rdquo;.  This seems clearly to carry a judgment as to what courses should be built up or otherwise in a particular area.  The most obvious instance of course is there might be the rather dubious idea that you could have a biological emphasis in TCD in which chemistry plays a subordinate role and a physics-chemistry emphasis in UCD in which biology plays a subordinate role.  This could be carried much further.  I mentioned this point on Second Reading and I make no apologies for mentioning it again.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with Deputy Tunney in that the university cannot simply be handed money and allowed to spend it as they so wish.  At the same time, I would remind him that the whole principle of paying major grants to universities only dates from about the time of the second world war.  I am on <Col N="2009" /> a balance here between what I might describe as Deputy Tunney's, in many ways correct and logical community-orientated approach to this measure and, on the other side, the slightly more traditional approach of my colleague, Deputy O'Donovan.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald in his earlier discussion which was rather wide-ranging, made a very effective point when he said that a certain element of waste is logical in a university.  It is not possible to programme a university in the same way as if one were programming, say, Bord Fáilte or Aer Lingus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>But I am not programming either Aer Lingus or Bord Fáilte.  That is not what we were talking about the other day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that, all over the world, academics face change.  Again, to echo a point made by Deputy O'Donovan, we should not borrow all our fashions from abroad.  As I said on Second Reading, it was believed ten years ago that too many economists or business study people could not be produced. Now we are picking up the technological thing as the British are beginning to realise they have overdone this. What I am saying is that one could never be absolutely certain at any point of time that a major running down of one area of teaching and a major expansion of another is wise.  A considerable period of time must elapse before this is seen and, as Deputy FitzGerald said, research into ancient Hebrew might seem to have no functional utility whatsoever.  It could be argued that the teaching of history has very little functional utility or the teaching of classics has no functional utility at all.  I would not agree with those points of view but I agree that the major orientation of overall policy&mdash;building policy and development policy by a university&mdash;falls properly within the sphere of both this authority and the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be very nervous of a situation in which some person, be he an academic or a civil servant, got the idea into his head that a certain area of teaching should be developed and some other kind, mostly found in terms <Col N="2010" /> of the humanities, should be run down because it no longer had a direct manpower relationship to the country. Once a traditional form of teaching is destroyed, it cannot be built up again. If the impression is widely generated that certain areas of teaching in each of our universities are scheduled for building up in one place and running down in another&mdash;this is necessary to a degree and I accept it&mdash;we must consider the sense of gloom that this would cast over teachers in a particular university who would have seen the end of the road for the particular area of teaching in which they are involved.</P>
    <P>If I were a chemist in TCD, I would not be very happy to know that I could not laterally expand or if I were a biochemist in UCD, I would not be very happy with the information that I could not expand my career and that, therefore, I would be stifled for the remainder of my career.</P>
    <P>How, then, are we to reconcile these two points; necessary legitimate waste on one side and social need on the other side?  This is where the distinction made by Deputy FitzGerald is correct.  The major innovations in university development are deemed to be in the area of capital development. I am not saying that we do not spend a substantial sum on college development because we do nor am I arguing that the Minister and An tÚdarás should not be in a position to say to the universities: &ldquo;Look, the Commission on Higher - Education said you were producing four times as many medical doctors as you ought to be producing. Therefore you should sit down and think about these chaps because we will not put up forever with the situation.&rdquo; I think this is perfectly correct but I would fear an area where they can actually say that the role of humanities departments should be run down.  I would also hold the slight overall fear that this could be misused by some Government in relation to the popularity of a particular department or of its head, with the Minister of An tÚdarás.  I am not for one moment suggesting that this might happen in the case of the present Minister or the present Government.</P>
    <P>These are all the points I wish to make <Col N="2011" /> at this stage.  I hope that I have not confused the Minister in the preparation of his reply to Deputy FitzGerald but the only reason I have spoken at such length on this is that it is the one matter about which I feel very strongly. I would like the Minister to tell me if he and his Department will play any role in the earmarking of current money if his original section, as amended, is passed.  I hope it will not be.  I express my total opposition to the earmarking of current expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible that the amendments to section 12 were put down because of misapprehension as to how the section will operate.  When I refer here to amounts for institutions of higher education, I am referring to the two sums that will be voted annually by Dáil Éireann. There will be a global sum by way of grant-in-aid to An tÚdarás out of which An tÚdarás will pay the current grants to these institutions.  There will be a second global sum also by way of grant-in-aid out of which An tÚdarás will recoup the institutions their expenditure on capital works for which approval will already have been given by An tÚdarás.  Therefore, when I refer to amounts, I am not referring to specific amounts for various institutions as such but to global amounts, both current and capital.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister play any part in new-style subsection (2) of section 12?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will allow me to expand on this.  These are the amounts which will appear in the appropriate subheads in the Book of Estimates but as an appendix to the relevant vote there will be shown the sums proposed for each institution and which, in total, add up to the sums provided in the subheads.  This procedure is exactly the same as the procedure adopted in Britain by the Universities Grants Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald mentioned that while it would be possible to have these individual amounts shown in the Estimate, if the Government were willing to give all the money, he asked <Col N="2012" /> how it would be possible to operate, if the Government were to say to An tÚdarás that they could not provide all the money requested.  Obviously, An tÚdarás would have to consult again and, eventually and prior to the publication of the Book of Estimates, they would come up with their final assessments.  I shall go into that in a moment in more detail.  It will be for An tÚdarás to make payments to the institutions and the amount paid to any institution will be varied by An tÚdarás by reference to any change in conditions obtaining when the matter was originally recommended.  As Deputy FitzGerald mentioned it will be essential that when An tÚdarás recommend sums for specific purposes, such as for computers, they would be enabled to ensure that these sums are spent on computers and not on some other purpose for which they were not provided.</P>
    <P>I should like also to point out that there could not be any question of An tÚdarás concerning themselves with the detailed expenditure of the day-to-day operations of institutions.  In relation to capital grants what is proposed in section 12 does not change in any way the existing procedure which is that capital grants are paid only in respect of certain expenditure on approved projects or works.  Reference was made to ear-marking in relation to recurring grants. Here again I can say that no change will be made in the present position. Both Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Thornley mentioned that there are already certain elements in the current moneys which are earmarked such as, for example, specific sums given for temporary buildings, for adaptation work, or for the equipment of laboratories, and some of these are paid only on the production of vouchers for expenditure incurred, but the great bulk of the moneys which are being paid in the recurring grant are for day-to-day expenses and these will continue to be paid in the manner in which they have been previously, in quarterly instalments.</P>
    <P>Another matter which was raised was in relation to the running down of a particular area.  We have to keep in mind that one of the functions of An tÚdarás is the need to eradicate needless <Col N="2013" /> duplication.  Of course no decisions would be made in relation to interference with any particular area without full consultation taking place between An tÚdarás and the institution concerned. As I say, we have to keep in mind in the circumstances in which we find ourselves in relation to educational facilities, which include professors, lecturers, and so on, and in our financial circumstances, to ensure as far as possible, and as far as it would be correct to do so, that there is no needless duplication. A question was also raised in relation to agriculture and Deputy FitzGerald was correct in his assessment of the situation, that the money will be channelled through An tÚdarás and they will be dealing with the Department of Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also the matter of the right of An tÚdarás to attach conditions to payment of the recurring grant.  This is included so that An tÚdarás may, in consultation with an institution, agree to fund some new activity or area of study on an experimental basis.  Such an arrangement might be associated with the development of a particular centre of excellence in the institution concerned. An tÚdarás and the institution could consult closely in such a case during a trial period of several years when the value and desirability of proceeding with the experiment could be assessed.  In regard to the method by which An tÚdarás will deal with the institutions and with the Departments I would, generally speaking, agree with Deputy FitzGerald's assessment.  The <Col N="2014" /> various institutions would make an application for finance and An tÚdarás would consult with each of them before making recommendations to the Minister. Then the Minister could, if he felt it necessary, have consultations with An tÚdarás and then, when the total amount available had been determined, it would be for An tÚdarás and the Minister to agree generally in relation to its apportionment and it would be open to An tÚdarás in regard to such apportionment to carry out any consultation with any institution which they might consider necessary.  This would be done prior to the production of the Book of Estimates and the amounts in the Appendix would then be agreed on.  The amendment which I have put down to section 12 (2) makes it possible for An tÚdarás to make some changes either internally in an individual institution or between institutions.</P>

Then, some time prior to the publication of the Book of Estimates, they will inform the Minister of their assessment of the situation and it will then be included in the Appendix to the Book of Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter. I am putting up the words for consideration. Having raised it, I can put it down on the Report Stage.  It is only a matter of putting up something for the Minister to consider.  I am not suggesting a new amendment.  I am suggesting that the Minister, since his amendment will, presumably, be carried should before the Report Stage consider these words.  If the Minister will be good enough to take a note of them I shall repeat them: &ldquo;and shall have regard primarily to the number of students pursuing studies leading to a degree in that institution.&rdquo; I put in &ldquo;degree&rdquo; because there are things such as diplomas and also in UCD there are 2,500 students attending what are called extramural lectures which, in our typically Irish fashion, are given intramurally, inside the institution. This is typical of what we do with words.  I do not think that the Minister or his officials will have any difficulty in understanding why I am suggesting these words and I am making this suggestion for an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have raised the point about the amount of money voted for different purposes.  I remember complaining some years ago to a high official in the Department of Education about the amount of money being made available to the Commerce Faculty in UCD which was the only faculty in UCD giving a full night degree.  Actually, it was subsidising other facilities at that time and was not getting a penny from the Government.  I do not see Deputy Tunney: I do not know if he did his degree in Commerce or Art but if he did it in Commerce he got no part of Government money.  Now there may be some small amount for the Faculty of Commerce but it is very small.  Here was one faculty in which the 400 or 500 students there at that stage were subsidising those being educated in other faculties to the extent of about £20,000 per year.  Let me compare that <Col N="2016" /> with what we find, on looking up the figures for this year, is the amount of money in the Vote for agriculture, £850,000, without taking recent increases into account.  That is for the Faculties of Veterinary Medicine and Agriculture where there are less than 500 students and where the first year work is done entirely in the science faculties both in UCD and TCD.  This represents an average of £1,700 per student.</P>
    <P>The Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in TCD is an absurdity resulting from some kind of ecumenical thinking by the then Taoiseach.  I reckon that every veterinary medical student in Trinity College costs up £2,500 per year in grants.  These are the students in whose fees the Minister and his officials would not allow an increase this year.  In UCD I suggest that every veterinary student costs the people of Ireland £2,000 per year.  The only place where this is equalled is in institutions run by the Department of Education such as St. Angela's Training School of Domestic Economy in Sligo.  I remember in the middle fifties when every student there was costing £1,000 per year and I should like to know what the cost is now.  It is third level education, by courtesy, but this is the only place that is comparable.  We have this complete absurdity, and worse, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in UCD is now limiting the number of students.  I know that is being done because, as in the case of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, if you keep down the numbers you can keep the income larger. Therefore, they say they cannot take more students, that they have no room for them and so on.  This is nonsense.</P>
    <P>A high official of the Department of Education to whom I spoke about this some years ago made a remark that galled me because of its ignorance. He said: &ldquo;You know they are expensive faculties.&rdquo;  In Oxford University considerable exception is taken by the scientists to the fact that moneys are still spent primarily on education in Latin and Greek in the first two years for the better students and then in classical philosophy, classical and modern philosophy, what is called the &ldquo;Greats&rdquo; degree, ancient classics for two years and then classical philosophy. <Col N="2017" /> They still produce most of the crack administrators in Britain.  Many people, and particularly engineers and so on, maintain that is why England is falling behind.  I am not convinced she is falling so much behind; I think the Minister for Finance will have a problem on hand in that connection this year.</P>
    <P>My objection to the present position is a serious one.  At one time University College, Galway, was extremely badly treated and has not yet quite come up in grants per student to UCC and TCD.  Both UCC and TCD are getting an annual grant, leaving out the Faculty of Dairy Science in UCC, of approximately £400 per student.  Except in numbers they are very similar to UCD and the average grant per student in UCD, leaving out all the people I have indicated, the extramural students and the diploma students and so on, is £250.</P>
    <P>One final point I want to make is that judging by tradition the big fellow is always the bad wolf and since UCD is as big as all the other university institutions&mdash;I think that not so long ago it was as big as all the other university institutions in this island put together and it now certainly is as big as all the university institutions in the Republic of Ireland put together&mdash; on this body, there will be the usual, &ldquo;who is afraid of the big bad wolf?&rdquo; Everybody is afraid of the big bad wolf and it is only natural for smaller people to club together.  It is outrageous that the only faculty in University College, Dublin, which gives a full night degree should have been treated in this way, except in one case mentioned by Deputy Thornley, Business Management.  Someone recently said to me, &ldquo;You know, systems analysis is just going out in America and we may expect it to arrive in Ireland any day&rdquo;, and he is absolutely right.  I am not quite sure what &ldquo;systems analysis&rdquo; means, but I suspect we did them all as part of general administration at one time.  These nice new words hoodwink the public.  Who knows the meaning of the words &ldquo;systems analysis&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the James Connolly Memorial Hospital Board (Establishment) Order, 1971 (S.I. No. 97 of 1971) be and is hereby annulled.</P>
      <P>This motion asks that statutory order S.I. No. 97 of 1971 established under the 1961 Corporate Bodies Act be rejected.  It proposes to amalgamate one local authority hospital, the James Connolly Memorial Hospital, with three voluntary hospitals, Jervis Street, the Mater and St. Laurence's. We are asking that the order be not accepted for the purpose in the first instance of having a discussion about the decision the Minister has taken and secondly in order to elicit some information about what proposals he has for the future of this new hospital.  In reply to questions.  I have asked the Minister did not give sufficient information. We feel much more information should be available to us before we take this important step.</P>
      <P>The general pattern of hospital development in this country has changed in a dramatic way in recent years in that the old voluntary system of financial support and the voluntary control of hospitals has become to a considerable extent equalled, if not superseded, by the great improvement in the quality of control of the local authority hospitals.  Throughout the country we have a very fine local authority hospital service based on the country regional hospitals and the bigger hospitals in the cities like St. Kevin's.  As local representatives we are very proud of the achievements of representatives in creating this magnificent hospital service.  I do not think anybody will doubt that as to personnel, nursing, medical, technical and para-medical personnel it is certainly as good as anything they have in the voluntary hospitals and in some cases it is better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time we are very glad indeed to see the realistic evolution of the merger idea of the voluntary and <Col N="2019" /> local authority hospitals.  There is no doubt that the voluntary hospitals have a wonderful tradition of very good level medical service, with very highly qualified medical personnel on the whole and with a very high level of both nursing and medical care.  We would not like to take away from that in the slightest.  We have the greatest admiration for it.  Even 20 years ago I was anxious to see some sort of cross-fertilisation between the voluntary hospital and the local authority hospital.  Each has something to bring to the other and the amalgam of both could be a very fine institution giving a very fine service to the public.  We have nothing at all against the principle of the merger.</P>
    <P>We are anxious about the fact that the board proposed for this hospital has nine representatives from the voluntary board, three from the Mater, three from St. Laurence's and three from Jervis Street and six from the eastern regional board&mdash;presumably these would be members of the Dublin Health Authority.  This gives a majority of three to the voluntary hospitals. Admittedly, the chairman of the board must be a member of the Eastern Health Board but in any decisions it is quite obvious that local authority representatives can be out-voted at any time.</P>
    <P>The voluntary hospitals have had to accept that the old system by which they founded their services could no longer continue.  The voluntary aspect of the so-called voluntary hospitals has gone.  They are now funded either from the Sweep funds or from taxation or rates.  They are effectively publicly paid-for institutions.  I must confess I had a certain hand in this 20 years ago when I realised the Hospitals Sweep Fund, not for this purpose specifically, but because I wanted to build many hospitals.  We liquidated £20 million, mortgaged the next £10 million, which gave us £30 million and we built many hospitals with that money.  At that time I had at the back of my mind the feeling that it would be much better if the hospitals were run and supported in a realistic way either by <Col N="2020" /> central funds or from the rates and this is where we now find ourselves.</P>
    <P>In that situation I felt the next realistic step was the acquisition of power over these institutions by public representatives with voluntary representation. The Minister's proposal is completely in conflict with that broad policy, which is a perfectly rational one because it is based on the old idea of no taxation without representation. The people paying for the service should have complete right to conduct, maintain, manage and develop their own hospitals, with support from the voluntary representatives of course, but we should have majority control over any such board.</P>
    <P>The functions of the new board under section 4 (1) are to conduct, maintain, manage and develop the James Connolly Memorial Hospital and the majority on this board will not as far as I can see be local authority representatives.  This is a retrograde step.  It is going back in time, outlook and policy from the whole process of the evolution of democratic control of our own affairs.  It is going back to the various doubtful practices which did creep into the control of many voluntary hospitals, many of them excellent. I do not wish to take away from them at all or from the work that has been done by them, but I think the scheme of maintenance in the local authority hospitals, the policy decisions taken, most of the practices carried out in relation to financing, appointments, type of patient, ratio of public to private beds, and so on, are superior in the local authority hospitals.  We are anxious to know to what extent the better features from the point of view of local authority supervision will be maintained in the new hospital.</P>
    <P>This is local authority property.  It cost, I think, something in the region of £700,000 to £1 million to build and equip; it must be worth some millions now in property, equipment, in earning potential and facility potential.  All we are getting from the voluntary side is their prestige, which we welcome, and their technical knowledge in regard to the management of hospitals, which is also welcome but there appears to me to be no <i>prima facie</i> case for handing over <Col N="2021" /> this enormously complex, costly and relatively modern hospital to any body other than a local authority body.</P>
    <P>The record of our local authority hospitals is outstanding.  I do not think there is any great difficulty in the creation of a general hospital of a very high level and I would like to cite the remarkable achievement of the Dublin Health Authority in its creation of a magnificent municipal hospital out of the decrepit and badly equipped workhouse; I refer to St. Kevin's, the standing of which in the eyes of ordinary people has risen enormously since its establishment ten or 15 years ago.  Our local representatives have shown themselves capable of doing that in the case of St. Kevin's and there is no reason why it could not be done in the case of the James Connolly Hospital as well We would be glad to know, therefore, what it was that motivated the Minister into taking this decision.  We would be glad to know what the position is in relation to the system of appointment.</P>
    <P>In the voluntary hospitals the system of appointment is completely irrational in practically all of them.  In some of the hospitals run by religious the reverend mother makes appointments. In the so-called Church of Ireland hospitals one gets the Masonic Order making appointments.  In some of them the Knights of St. Columbanus make the appointments.  In yet others a doctor has to send his <i>curricula vitae</i> around to 130 lay persons and it is they who make the appointments. There is also the possibility of the medical board making appointments. They should not have this power because they may have to appoint a competitor and, human nature being what it is, they cannot be expected to opt for the best qualified competitor in their own field.  I could give plenty of examples of that.  Will the present system of making appointments to local authority hospitals through the Local Appointments Commission continue? On the whole, we all trust the Local Appointments Commission and believe it attempts, at any rate, to make the best appointment to a particular job. Will that system continue?  Will there be some other system, a system which is not likely, in our view, to be as <Col N="2022" /> equitable as the one we have there at the moment?</P>
    <P>One of the most disturbing experiences I had as Minister for Health was when I got a letter from a constituent complaining about a voluntary hospital. I was asked to inquire and I did inquire.  I was shocked to find that I had absolutely no right of access whatever to the place.  They wrote back and politely told me to mind my own business. This was a private voluntary hospital and, as far as I was concerned, I had as much power as the average layman.  If hospitals are supported out of rates and taxes then public representatives should have a right of access, particularly where a member of the public feels aggrieved.  He may not really have cause for grievance or complaint but the right of access to the controlling body in these hospitals must be retained.  We have that at the moment in respect of this local authority hospital.  Is that likely to be retained or will there be any interference with our right of access to this hospital?  How will we safeguard our right of access?</P>
    <P>There have been at times strange business methods practised in voluntary hospitals.  May we take it that the existing methods used in relation to local authority hospitals will be maintained or is there any likelihood of the members of the board of the hospital exercising preferential treatment, for example, in the giving out of contracts and so forth?</P>
    <P>The chairman will be elected from the members appointed by the Eastern Health Board or the Dublin Health Authority.  What will happen in the case of the vice-chairman?  There is no provision in this order covering that position.  &ldquo;The chairman shall be appointed by the members of the board.&rdquo;  That means that a majority of the members will have the right to appoint a chairman.  Does the Minister think that should be permitted or should he make provision to the effect that the chairman and vice-chairman be members of the Eastern Health Board?  To what extent will these people be subject to the health authority, the people responsible for <Col N="2023" /> raising the funds by way of rates, and to what extent will they be responsible to the Minister?  Will they be at all times subject to ministerial decision?</P>
    <P>We are concerned that these people might decide to run the hospital in a most extravagant way and the ratepayers and taxpayers might be presented with bills they would consider unjustified.</P>
    <P>Under section 21 the accounting system is dealt with:</P>
    <P>The board shall cause to be kept proper accounts of all income and expenditure of the board, and of sources of such income and the subject matter of such expenditure, and of the property, credits and liabilities of the board.</P>
    <P>What exactly is meant by that?  To what extent will fees or salaries, or emoluments paid to the staff, medical or surgical, and the technical staff of one kind or another, be available for scrutiny by the Dublin Health Authority?  I see that it can be made available to the Minister.  To what extent has a Deputy looking for information a right to put down questions and inquiries into the incomes of persons who work in a hospital of this kind?</P>
    <P>I know this is a very delicate subject but this is a very magnificent hospital and there is a danger that if there is a dominant element from the voluntary hospitals on the board there would be a big temptation to alter the ratio of the private to the public patient, both in the beds and on the consultation side, on the out-patient or clinical side.  To what extent will the Minister exercise control in relation to this policy of the private patient and fees taken from private patients or fees taken from public patients?  How will he control that?</P>
    <P>He must know that at present, as a result of the activities of the voluntary insurance scheme, there has been a very steady redirection of the type of person occupying beds in many of our hospitals.  Because they cannot get paid unless the patient is in hospital, considerable pressure is exerted on the <Col N="2024" /> practitioner to admit a person.  If the Minister is worried about the number of people in his hospitals he should inquire into this question.  A number of people may find their way into hospital who need not go there if you change the basic policy of any scheme or any hospital simply because payment is made for the person who is an inpatient or who is attending a clinic, and payment is not made if it is a domiciliary visit.  I would be very interested to know what is the Minister's broad attitude in relation to the appointment system, the conditions of appointment of the various people who are appointed to the hospitals.</P>
    <P>Section 21 (6) provides:</P>
    <P>The board and the officers thereof shall, whenever so requested by the Minister, permit any person appointed by him to examine the books and accounts of the board in respect of any financial year...</P>
    <P>Will this power be available to the corporation and to the new regional board formally as of right as well as to the Minister?  At the moment it seems to me to be restricted to the Minister.  I would be glad to know whether it is intended to make this power available to the regional board.  I know it is available to them through their members, but is it available to them formally as a regional board?</P>
    <P>In making appointments to this hospital what will the procedure be?  Are the conditions and terms of appointment to be laid down?  Are they to be submitted to the Minister for approval? Will they be submitted to the Eastern Regional Board for approval?  Do they have to have the prior approval of the regional board, or the Minister, or can they go ahead and declare conditions of appointment and make appointments subject to those conditions?  I am talking, of course, particularly in relation to consultant appointments and the methods by which they are made.</P>
    <P>There is also a very regrettable policy change by many of our voluntary hospitals to which Deputy O'Connell referred the other day, that is, the extraordinary callousness shown <Col N="2025" /> by so many towards the difficulties of old people in getting admission to hospital, particularly in the terminal stages of their illness.  I saw a lady the other day of 55 years with terminal cancer and she cannot get into a voluntary hospital anywhere. our only hope now is to see whether she can get into St. Kevin's.  She has been treated in a voluntary hospital for a very long time.  However, that is only a single case.  The general finding of doctors is that people are not interested in the 60-plus type of patient.  These are the people who require help.  All of us will require help from that age on.</P>
    <P>The local authority hospitals tend to be more humane about these things on the whole.  They have got to be because we have control over them.  One has no control whatsoever over a voluntary hospital.  I should dislike very much to see the new James Connolly Memorial Hospital adopting this practice of refusing to admit old people, not because they were sick but simply because they were old.  This is a problem all over the country.  Because of the fact that so many of our people have emigrated we have many very young and very old people but that is another question.</P>
    <P>If there were a preponderance of the voluntary hospital type mentality on this board this would be one of the possible developments.  The consultant does not want the long-stay patient.  He wants to get the person in, carry out whatever treatment he has to carry out, get the patient out, and then fill the bed again.  In that way the bed is working at its optimum.  With the widespread absence of facilities for old people, the hospitals should continue to accept their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Will they be permitted to change the ratio of the public to the private beds? I presume that the right to union activities and all these things which are more freely accepted in the local authority hospitals, will be safeguarded by the union representatives and I hope there will not be any question of any interference with the right of unions to enter and expand union activities in the hospitals.</P>
    <P>We put down this motion so that we could ask the Minister to explain his <Col N="2026" /> reasons for taking this action.  Possibly he has good reasons and we would certainly like to hear them.  Section 6 (1) provides:</P>
    <P>The term of office of the first members of the board shall commence on 22nd March, 1971.</P>
    <P>Is this board already in existence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy R. Barry, our spokesman on health, has asked me to speak on this motion.  He feels that being chairman of the new board perhaps I am a little more familiar with the set-up than he might be.  No doubt the Minister will be able to answer the questions raised by Deputy Browne, some of which I certainly cannot answer.</P>
      <P>I want to say straight away that we do not agree with the motion for the annulment of the establishment order. Having listened to Deputy Dr. Browne's speech I must say that I was quite relieved.  He has expressed concern about quite a number of matters which also concern the members of the Dublin Health Authority, now the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has raised the question of the financing of this hospital.  That is something we do not know about.  I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify the position on this occasion. The Dublin Health Authority have asked this question and so far it has not been answered by the Minister.  No reply has been received from his Department. In the interim, and in order to allow progress to be made and to allow the development to get off the ground, temporary arrangements have been made which can last for one year, perhaps, whereby the Eastern Health Board will carry on on the budget already provided for the running of this hospital for the year ahead.  Because of the fact that the new hospital <Col N="2027" /> starts off with no money whatever the arrangement has been made that the Eastern Health Board will make money available a month in advance and will make payments to the hospital board a month in advance for the budget already provided for the running of the hospital in the normal way in order to enable it to carry on.  This would also give the Minister and the Department time to consider how the hospital will be financed in the future.  We hope that it will be financed directly from the Department of Health.  That is what we have asked for and that is how we hope it will be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne was concerned about the composition of the board. The members of the health authority were also concerned about this.  The discussion and arguments went on for many months.  The health authority wanted to have a majority, if anything, on the board.  This was the first submission. That was rejected by the participating hospitals.  We then looked for a 50-50 basis and that was rejected.  It was not acceptable either.  Eventually, in order to get the hospital moving and in the interests of progress the members of the health authority agreed to the present arrangement whereby each of the three participating hospitals would have three members&mdash;a total of nine&mdash;and there would be six members from the Dublin Health Authority.  The Dublin Health Authority may have been wrong in this.  The Minister must be exonerated for his part in this.  It was not a ministerial decision.  At least, it was a ministerial decision arising out of the final recommendations of the Dublin Health Authority relative to the composition of this board.  The feeling was that there was too much suspicion on both sides as to the way either side would work relative to the hospital and that in order to allay this fear the members of the health authority said: &ldquo;We will go ahead.  So long as we have the chair and six members, we are prepared to work and co-operate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear Deputy Dr. Browne saying that he himself was pleased to see this sort of marriage taking place between the voluntary <Col N="2028" /> hospitals set-up and the local authority hospitals.  I agree entirely with him in this.  For far too long we worked in isolation and for far too long the total picture was not seen.  The contribution that could be made by both the voluntary hospitals and the local authority hospitals working jointly was never really looked at.  As a result of this, there was accommodation in hospitals all over the place that was not fully utilised.  We all know the cost of providing hospital beds.  It is deplorable to think that there could be a demand in an area for additional buildings when, in fact, the beds that are already in existence are not being fully utilised.  I hope that this move will be a very successful one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne did not seem to appreciate that the board has, in fact, been set up and has had a few meetings. I was concerned when I saw the motion for the annulment of the establishment order because I felt that it might have arisen from discontent or dispute dissatisfaction on the part of the staffs.  This would have been a matter of great surprise to me because one of the first steps taken by the new board was to have the most adequate consultation with the staffs and with the unions representing the staffs.  The discussions were very satisfactory.  The staffs were fully assured that their interests would not be in any way neglected and that it was appreciated that the whole successful development of the hospital would depend on good relations with the staffs.  The concern expressed about the unions having the same access as they had had heretofore is groundless.  There is no question about that.  The attitude of the participating hospitals is similar to our own. They feel that this type of harmony must exist between the people representing the staffs and the board of the hospital.</P>
    <P>At the present time there is a question of public and private beds.  Deputy Dr. Browne will appreciate that the proposition is that there would be a move in on the basis of taking over the block of 120 beds&mdash;the only block that appears to be suitable for acute general hospital work and that the remainder of the beds available would <Col N="2029" /> be used as at present.  This will not alter the balance very much.  The intention is to add to the 120 beds by having perhaps 400 additional beds in close proximity to this block so that a first-class general hospital could be set up. I agree with Deputy Dr. Browne when he says that the site is an excellent one and is probably one of the best sites in Ireland.  It is adjacent to the city in an area which will be bigger than Cork city in 20 years time.  This would appear to be the situation on the plan that exists and can be examined.  It should be possible to set up, in as short a time as money is available for capital purposes, a first-class acute general teaching hospital in Blanchardstown. There is no better site for it.</P>
    <P>Having only had a couple of meetings and a general look at the set-up, the intention would seem to be to carry on, for the time being at any rate, the TB work which is being done at Blanchardstown and to set up a unit of 40 to 60 beds for active treatment for short-stay psychiatric patients and also to have a unit for geriatric patients as we have at present.  The complaint has been made that it is not possible in the Dublin region to get old people and terminal cases into hospital.  We have all had this experience.  If too many patients of these types are taken into a hospital the staff will not remain in the hospital.  It is only right that every hospital should play its part in taking in a percentage of this type of patient.  The work is demanding, perhaps uninteresting and unrewarding to the nursing staff.  They know that there is nothing they can do for these patients which will help them to recover and return to full health because their complaints are mainly those of old age.</P>
    <P>The firm intention is that in this hospital a substantial unit for such geriatric patients should be provided. It is felt that this is a necessary part of a teaching hospital and it is also felt that it would be desirable to have this active psychiatric unit there as well. The demand for tuberculosis beds is falling and it might be that at a later stage only one institution would be necessary as far as tuberculosis is concerned. We would all like to see that day coming.  Consideration may then be <Col N="2030" /> given to the transfer of tuberculosis work and thoracic surgery from the James Connolly Memorial Hospital to Peamount and the beds in the remainder of the hospital could easily be used for patients recovering from operations.</P>
    <P>The experience in acute hospitals in Dublin is that post-operative patients occupy expensive beds when this is quite unnecessary.  If beds were available in which they could recuperate in the normal way and did not receive as much medical attention this would relieve the beds they are occupying for other patients.  It would be an excellent thing if this type of accommodation could be provided on the campus in Blanchardstown.  A person with a fractured femur takes a long period to recover but the patient need not spend a long time in an acute hospital.  This type of patient could be accommodated in one of the buildings at Blanchardstown.</P>
    <P>There are 534 beds in this hospital. If you take approximately 120 beds from that for the theatre suite and the acute units of the hospital then you have quite a large number of beds there for the various purposes for which they will be required.  I should like to tell Deputy Dr. Browne that the work is in train for the structural alterations which are necessary in the theatre suite, the re-equipment of that suite and work on the X-Ray department is under way at the moment.  It is hoped that the participating hospitals will be able to move in there very soon.</P>
    <P>The history is well known to Deputy Dr. Browne regarding the Richmond Hospital and the other hospitals concerned. Extra accommodation is very badly needed at the Richmond Hospital for many years.  A considerable sum of money has been spent by the Department on consultants' fees with a view to building a hospital and providing the accommodation that is so badly needed.  They have not yet got the building.  In fact, the three hospitals mentioned in the establishment order are bursting at the seams.  They must get an outlet and this is the quickest possible way they can get that. If extra hospital beds are to be provided there is no place I know at <Col N="2031" /> which they can be provided as cheaply as in the James Connolly Memorial Hospital.</P>
    <P>All the services are available in this hospital.  There is an excellent site there and this must reduce the cost of providing a general hospital for which there is a great need.  Very few people realise the pace at which the population in the Dublin region is increasing. The supporting services are not being provided nearly fast enough.  Of course, it is a question of cost.  The economy of the country is not producing money fast enough to give the people the facilities they require.  I certainly think that any action by the Dublin Health Authority, by the Department or by anybody else to impede progress in the James Connolly Memorial Hospital would be a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>It was because we met with opposition in setting up this general hospital that we agreed to have this smaller proportion of public representatives on the hospital board.  I hope this will not in the long run prove a disadvantage.  I hope the interests of the people providing the money will be sufficiently safeguarded.</P>
    <P>The establishment order has left the Minister quite substantial control over appointments and over the general direction in which the hospital will work.  You can overdo control from the Department of Health.  I should hate anybody to get the impression that the voluntary hospitals have not been providing a first class service over the years.  They have and many dedicated people have spent much time and work in the running of those hospitals.  They have done their job very well and it would be wrong to give the impression that we have no faith in them.  The James Connolly Memorial Hospital brought about this marriage between the voluntary hospitals and the local authority side.  This is a very worthwhile experiment and I believe it will succeed with the co-operation of everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.P. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the Minister very long but I agree with everything Deputy Clinton said.  I am against the annulment of this order.  I understand that in 1968 <Col N="2032" /> the then Minister for Health proposed that this board would consist of three from the Dublin Health Authority and three from each of the North Dublin hospitals.  Certain negotiations took place between the health authority and the North Dublin hospitals and agreement was reached on the figures at present set out, namely, six from the Dublin Health Authority and three each from each of the North Dublin hospitals.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Dr. Browne.  I believe this board will work very well.  The nine members of the three North Dublin hospitals are all top medical men or top business men. I believe, judging by the meetings we have had already and the discussions we have had regarding this hospital, that the board will work very well.  I should like to endorse what Deputy Clinton said regarding the financing of these hospitals.  It will have 120 beds for acute surgery and it will also deal with acute psychiatric and geriatric cases.  It will also continue to fulfil its role for tuberculosis patients which I also think may decrease.  This will mean that the board may be able to reduce the number of TB beds in the years to come.</P>
      <P>I believe there is a great future for this hospital.  It is on the lines suggested in the FitzGerald Report.  It is in an area which is growing very fast. In a few years instead of its being, as it is at the moment, in green fields it will be in a built-up area.  The hospital has a great future and I look forward to seeing it carrying out its role as a teaching hospital.  I would urge the Minister not to annul the order and I should like to hear his comments on the various points raised by Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Clinton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the whole, the debate has been very constructive.  Although Deputy Dr. Browne has expressed certain objections to the method of administration in Blanchardstown Hospital, he has approved the general concept of co-ordination between the local health board hospitals and the voluntary hospitals.  I should like to thank Deputy Clinton and Deputy Dockrell for answering quite a number of questions in advance for me on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2033" /> The concept of providing general hospital beds in Blanchardstown is suggested in the FitzGerald Report and my predecessor and I have approved of this.  It is desirable that when voluntary hospitals combine to co-operate with the health authority in the provision of medical and surgical services we should do all we can to encourage such a project.  It is very important that we should break down the traditional barriers between voluntary hospitals and health board hospitals.  We should do our utmost to end the sense of isolation which is bred in many cases of dedicated service and super-individualism by surgeons, consultants and boards.  We should eliminate this sense of isolation between voluntary hospitals themselves and between such hospitals and health board hospitals.  We should eliminate rivalries between hospitals which are naturally and frequently born of ambition to provide the most modern service and treatment and we should do our utmost to prevent wasteful overlapping of services.</P>
    <P>I have frequently stated in this House and at public functions that specialisation is growing to such a point that we shall not be able to afford it unless we have co-ordination and integration between the voluntary hospitals and the health board system. Secondly, we shall not be able to afford it because unless we survey the patient-bed requirement on a long-term basis we shall be unable to get the super-specialists. They must be convinced that they have a useful workload and a profitable career ahead and that the patients will come to them on a basis whereby they can provide the best possible service and that they will have sufficient para-medical services to help them.  Thirdly, if we want to provide the best service we need specialist services and, therefore, we need this concept of co-ordination and integration.</P>
    <P>I am sure that within a week some other Minister for Health in some country wealthier than ours, where government intervention may be slightly greater and where there may be a higher degree of social welfare benefits, will say that he does not know how he is going to pay for hospital services. In order to provide a good service <Col N="2034" /> we must have this growth of co-ordination and integration.</P>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Dr. Browne, I am not a socialist.  I am a pragmatic believer in a combination of government intervention and private enterprise.  If anyone wishes to call this socialism they may do so.  As a pragmatic, I believe that as a society grows more complex it is inevitable that there must be an increasing amount of intervention and supervision of control of many of the operations of private enterprise; this has happened in every country, even in the United States which might be regarded as the super-private enterprise nation.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in making hard and fast rules on matters such as the staff proportion in running a hospital service as in this instance.  I believe that representatives from the voluntary hospitals will act in a responsible way.  They will realise that they are in a majority but that if they act in such a way that they are not operating in the public interest inevitably the entire operation will come to an end.  In this event there would have to be some amendment of the order and a reconsideration of the matter.</P>
    <P>Equally, the health board representatives, although they are in a minority, if they are people of common sense, personality and dedication and if they make use of their experience in serving on the Dublin Health Authority, their influence on the board will not relate to their numerical strength.  Their influence will relate to their capacity to ensure that the board operates in a proper manner and that there will be full co-operation with the voluntary representatives.  I realise it is easy to make such a generalisation.  I have been in public life for many years and I have seen many examples of boards working together where the proportion in relation to particular interests may have seemed to be overloaded in one direction within the board but the people concerned worked very well together.  I can also conceive of a board with equal representation on both sides making a ghastly mess if the people themselves are not dedicated and responsible individuals.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputy Browne to accept the <Col N="2035" /> proposition that this does not set any particular precedent in the future in relation to boards running a combination of health board and voluntary hospitals.  It is bringing together three hospitals with great individualistic traditions, each concerned with general medical and surgical services but also concerned with specialities.  It is a hospital in which can be found consultants of the highest calibre, many of whom have achieved eminence throughout Europe.  I am pleased that they are co-ordinating together with the health authority so that we may go ahead with the first project suggested in the FitzGerald Report, namely, the formation and building of a great general hospital on the north side of Dublin.</P>
    <P>We have heard from Deputy Clinton about the tremendous development plans for the north side of Dublin.  I am told that around the Blanchardstown area there will be an increase in the population of some 100,000.  With the development of road plans, the Blanchardstown area will become more easily accessible, both for east and west.</P>
    <P>So far as controls are concerned, Deputy Dr. Browne can be sure that the same ministerial overall control of hospitals will apply to this board. Naturally, I must have control of the total capital spent for the development of hospitals in the country.  We have control in regard to the authorisation of senior staff in voluntary hospitals. If voluntary hospitals wish to appoint senior staff that do not appear to us to be related to the general measures of co-ordination and integration and to the functions of the hospital we tell the voluntary hospitals that if they choose to appoint such staff they cannot be paid out of the pool but must be paid from the private revenues of the hospital.  Then there are certain powers which the Minister has, and Deputy Dr. Browne is far too experienced in political life for me to need to read all the clauses in the statutory instrument which give the Minister some overall power in relation to the running of this board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2036" /> In so far as the accounts are concerned, the arrangement made at the moment is based on an agreement signed by the Dublin Health Authority which is being forwarded to the James Connolly Memorial Hospital Board dealing with the accounts.  The board must provide a statement of expenses. These will be examined by the Eastern Health Board and if found in order will be paid.  At the same time, because voluntary hospitals are involved, the officers of my Department who are concerned in examining in general the accounts of hospitals through the Hospitals Commission will naturally examine the accounts of this board, particularly in its early stages, in order to ensure that everything is being done in such a way as to avoid unnecessary extravagance.  When the Regional Hospital Board's proposals come before the Dáil we propose that the voluntary hospital finances and the budget should be examined by the Dublin Regional Hospital Board.  They will naturally be anxious to examine the accounts of this board because the work of the Hospitals Commission will devolve upon them in examining voluntary hospital budgets and ensuring that the cost is as low as possible consistent with good treatment. The regional hospital boards will also be dealing with work study for which there will be available officers of my Department and private consultants if required, and they will also be doing the overall planning of the hospital system for the regional hospital board area.  Therefore, they will have a measure of supervision over this new board's activities when it comes into operation.  Section 22 (2) of the statutory instrument enables me to require the giving of information in regard to the performance of the functions of the board and will give me reasonable power of making inquiries in the event of there being some allegations of gross mistreatment of a patient. Contracts will undoubtedly be, as Deputy Clinton will agree, by open competition.  We have made no provision for the vice-chairman.  It is a matter for the board to decide on their vice-chairman.</P>

      <P>No.  In regard to the allocation of public and private beds, I would naturally expect the board to consider the public interest and we would naturally be looking at the general picture when the new beds become available.  As Deputy Clinton said, we are happy to have 120 beds made available in the first stages.  We would naturally ask, if the Government are providing the money for this, how many of them would be private or public, and the Deputy can be assured that there will be no undue attention paid to the private patients as compared with the attention given to those who receive middle income or medical card service.  As Deputy Clinton also said, union activity will naturally be permitted.  On the question of the method of appointment, in the first instance, I understand the board will ask some of the existing high-class staff in the three voluntary hospitals to staff the Blanchardstown Hospital.  I am quite sure Deputy Clinton will agree with me that in regard to major appointments to be made at a later date, there being three hospitals involved and the health authority, they would make some provision for selection whereby the impartiality would be as evident as in the case of the Local Appointments Commission.  I would ask the Deputy if that is not the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Clinton for being helpful in the information he has given us in regard to <Col N="2038" /> the development of this hospital.  I am very glad to see such a development. The redevelopment of these beds has been long overdue.  I am delighted to see they are going to be made available to the public in a useful capacity because they have been grossly underused for a long time.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister satisfied us in relation to the general principle under which he is working and his <i>rationale</i> for working in this particular way.  The reality must be faced that it is we who are the people in possession. We are the people with the property. We are the people with the wealth.  We have a considerable amount of technical expert knowledge and surgical, medical and nursing personnel.  Whatever is available in this hospital, we, the public representatives, through our own activities in our parties over the years, have created this enormous, valuable and extremely efficient asset in the James Connolly Memorial Hospital.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that financially the voluntary hospitals are bankrupt.  These people are coming to us because they cannot survive without us.  To the extent that I never agreed with the principle of the voluntary hospitals I am not reluctant to see this development, and to the extent that I was able to bring it about I am rather glad that I did.  However, it is a complete reversal in any democratic society to go back to the idea of unrepresentative governing bodies.  It is turning the clock back to the nineteenth century.  It is going back to the idea of the rotten boroughs, the bought seats in parliament, the property representation and university seats, all that kind of vocational approach to the organisation of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever our faults are as public representatives, whatever our faults are in all our local authorities, we have the great merit of having been elected to carry out these various functions, the control of finance and the provision of services of one kind or another.  The general public wants us there, warts and all.  There is a very important principle involved in this.  It could be all of the things that the Minister, as well as Deputies Clinton and Dockrell, hope it will be.  I sincerely hope they are right.  However, this is a reversal of <Col N="2039" /> the basic principle of the process of the evolution of the democratic idea of public representation rather than landlordism and the domination of one class by another.  We should have made it clear to them that they can have no survival outside of some sort of amalgation with us.  I was faced with this sort of situation 20 years ago.  At that time the Meath Hospital faced financial difficulties.  Representatives of that hospital asked me if I would help them. I told them that I would but on my conditions and the conditions were that of 13 representatives, six were voluntary people while the remaining seven were local representatives.  It is bad that we should be making this kind of proposal now.  I dislike it in particular because I suspect it is a precedent which may be adopted by the Minister in any subsequent situation of this kind.</P>
    <P>I am concerned particularly with the situation regarding St. Kevin's Hospital. This is a magnificent little municipal hospital and should be retained as such. There is no reason why the appointments system should be changed from the one on which this House decided. It is quite clear that this system&mdash;the Local Appointments Commission&mdash;is as nearly equitable a system as there is.  It is a system that we ourselves created. It is the system that is used for all appointments throughout the local authority service and it is infinitely more capable of thorough investigation and of surviving such investigation than is the system adopted in virtually any of the other branches of activity in our community.  We have nothing to be ashamed of either in relation to our appointments system or in relation to the other methods by which we run our public institutions&mdash;contracts and so on.</P>
    <P>While the voluntary hospitals have, in many cases, done wonderful work, we all know that a number of undesirable practices have crept into the activities of voluntary hospitals.  It is my belief, as it is the general belief of this party, that the public patient is not given the same quality of service in a hospital in which there is a certain proportion of private, as opposed to public, patients.  Many years ago I accepted the right of the <Col N="2040" /> private patient, as a principle, for the appointment of new consultant staff. I did it, 20 years ago, in a situation in which there were very few young doctors who were anxious to join the local authority service.  I did it very deliberately to attract them in because salaries were very low at the time and, therefore, remuneration was very important.  However, I did it only as a transition development.  I should like to see the evolution of the salaried doctor who is paid a good salary, a salary that would be in keeping with his extensive and costly training.  It would be his job, then, to look after everybody who needed his help and not those patients who happened to be rich or those who happened to be poor as the case may be.  That is the only way in which the same standard of care for all patients in our hospitals will be ensured.  We have established that in our fever and tuberculosis hospitals and in most of our local authority hospitals.  I should like to see the disappearance of the private bed in local authority hospitals and, for the future, a simple salaried service for doctors.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary principle here is that the person who really needs help will be under the conditions under which the amalgamation will take place.  If ICI, for instance, wished to take over a small chemical firm or if, say, Guinness wished to take over a small brewery, the majority of the members of the board would not be members of the small brewery or chemical firm but members of ICI or Guinness.  This is completely a reversed procedure.  There is a sense of inferiority in that in some way or other these people know more about these things than we know.  There is an extraordinary lack of faith both on the part of the Government and Fine Gael in the quality of local authority representatives.  All of the local authority representatives, including Deputies Clinton and Dockrell who, as councillors developed, in particular, the Dublin health service, and there are the rural Deputies who helped to develop the county hospital services. All of these people deserve the highest credit because they have created a service which is as good as and, in <Col N="2041" /> many cases better than, the local authority services.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why we should go into this sort of situation on our hands and knees.  It is these other people who are looking for help, not us.  We shall be glad of their help, if they wish to give it, but let them give it on our terms.  It has been seen already in relation to a number of the regional boards, that many of the professional people who have an inbred contempt for local authority representatives and for the whole political process and who disagree&mdash;not all of them but quite a number of them&mdash;with the whole concept of democratic government, are already trying to get rid of the elected representatives who act in their official capacity as chairmen and so on.  This particular board leaves itself wide open to this sort of situation even in relation to the strange omission of any definite position for a vice-chairman.  Quite obviously, the voluntary people can combine against local authority people so that the vice-chairman will be one of them.</P>
    <P>We are astonished that this development should have taken place.  There is no reason why the James Connolly Hospital could not have been converted by the Dublin Health Authority into an active, general medical hospital, giving a top quality service.  I know that, as an organisation, it is not perfect but it has already shown it is capable of providing a first-class service by converting an old workhouse which I remember very well&mdash;a place that was disgusting and disgraceful in which to keep any human beings&mdash; into the very fine municipal hospital which we have and which has a very high reputation in the city of Dublin. Why should our public representatives go in, in a minority situation, to this new James Connolly Hospital board?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider the whole question.  There is nothing to stop the co-ordination and integration of our services.  That is more than welcome, more than necessary and <Col N="2042" /> is long overdue.  Some of these voluntary hospitals, through no fault of their own, because of their small size and because of the tremendous cost, as the Minister said, of high quality specialist services these days, have no right to exist at all because, through no fault of their own, they give a substandard service, and there must be amalgamation, and there must be integration and there must be take-overs and there must be co-ordination, but I do not think that we should sell out our rights, as representatives of a local authority in Dublin, or anywhere else, to voluntary hospitals which in their day served their purpose and played a good role in the life of the community. We are now moving into the seventies, into the eighties and into the nineties and they belonged to the 19th century and the early part of this century.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised the question of the socialist and the pragmatic.  This is the conflict all along the line, this appalling subservient deference to the family firm, or professional people, or the landlord in society, or the small minority who have dominated our lives over all the years.  In practically every aspect of our lives, in industry, medicine, education, care of the aged&mdash;and this is not an advanced or radical society&mdash;the local authorities through their representatives have shown in the Dáil that they are infinitely more humanitarian, infinitely more concerned for the needs of their community and of society no matter what they are&mdash; providing employment, caring for old people, the sick, the mentally handicapped or housing people or whatever it may be.  We have a record second to none and for that reason we are opposed to this retrograde decision to hand over this very valuable local authority property to these three voluntary hospitals and their representatives and we completely deprecate the underlying principle which is involved in this decision.</P>

      <P>Any garda can conduct prosecutions in court and special appointment for a particular prosecution does not arise.  Up to the time of this accident the garda in question had conducted some 200 prosecutions.  As full time observer on the district patrol car since 1968 he had investigated a great number of road traffic accidents, the exact number of which is not available. The one in question here was the only one which resulted in a fatality.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General's instructions were transmitted on the 19th November, 1969.</P>

Will the Taoiseach not further agree that there has been a grave miscarriage of justice in this case where a widow with 13 young children will not be compensated for the loss of the car or any personal property.  Will the Taoiseach not further admit that the charge presented was inadequate to cover the offence committed in view of the fact that there were four independent witnesses to swear that this car was travelling at a very fast speed, passed out another car, continued on the wrong side of the road for 30 or 40 yards, mounted the footpath where the other man had pulled in?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to answer some of the points raised by the Deputy.  Firstly, the garda was, in fact, asked to conduct the case on the morning that the case was before the court because the solicitor who would otherwise have conducted the case was engaged in another court.  Secondly, whether or not he asked questions made no material contribution to the result in that the person charged was convicted of the specific charge that was presented.  Thirdly, as for the inadequacy of the prosecution itself, I have no observations to offer on that other than to say that the case was prepared in the usual way in the Attorney General's office and presented to the Attorney General, who approved the terms of the prosecution as the prosecution was brought. Fourthly, as to the miscarriage of justice and its relationship to the position <Col N="2046" /> of the widow and her children, the result of this case has nothing whatever to do with the financial position of the widow and her children because irrespective of the outcome of the district court prosecutions it is open to the widow to bring a case in the civil court for damages in respect of the loss of her husband.  To sum up: the person charged was found guilty of the charge presented; the garda was competent to present the case and if the widow has a case in civil law she is entitled to bring it.</P>

The incident in question happened in July, 1969.  A prosecution followed in January, 1970.</P>

      <P>The position is that the accident happened in July, 1969, and a prosecution took place in January, 1970.  After the prosecution, a son of the deceased man wrote to me and was given the unusual facility of going through the entire list of statements in the Attorney General's Office in the presence of the Attorney General's assistant.  He continued with his campaign of an injustice being done but not until September, 1970, did he raise for the first time this allegation that has now been taken up by Deputy L'Estrange that the solicitor involved was drunk.  The fact was the solicitor was in court, but he had three other cases on that day, including two remand cases and, when the case was called, the district justice who presided insisted that the garda present prosecute the case.  The garda did so.  There were five witnesses called and a conviction was recorded.  I think I need say no more at this stage.  I do not want to be chasing all Deputy L'Estrange's other allegations about political influence.  I did not know the man at the time he made this charge and I do not know who he is now, or who the defendant is.</P>

Has the Minister got available to him the name of the port of departure of that vessel?

      <P>The Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1951&mdash;Statutory Instrument 410 of 1951&mdash;which introduced new scales of pensions for retiring gardaí provided that members serving on the date of the order had the option referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The income tax payable by gardaí in receipt of pensions at the higher rate is, of course, in the normal way, greater than that payable by those in receipt of pensions at the lower rate.</P>
      <P>The lump sum of gratuity payable to those members who elect to take the pension at the lower rate is not regarded as being in the nature of income and, therefore, is not chargeable to income tax.  I do not propose taking the steps suggested by the Deputy to increase the income tax payable in this type of case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out, however, that tax would, in the normal way, be payable on any income realised from the investment of the lump sum.

      <P>The number of cattle dressed for warbles in 1965 was 4.4 million.  In 1970, as the Deputy knows, there was no national warble fly eradication scheme but, in addition to the 0.8 million cattle dressed by my Department in the spring and summer under the Warble Fly (Notification and Treatment) Order, 1967, there were, according to my information, 1.4 million cattle dressed under the voluntary dressing arrangements operated in the autumn by the AL bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department adopted a rigid line in the matter of the purchase of the drugs necessary for the eradication of warble fly on what I consider to be perfectly legitimate grounds.  The application of these drugs, apart from the control it gives of warble fly, also controls other matters, such as cattle lice.  If there was no warble fly infection in an animals it is still profitable for the herd-owner to spend 4s per annum for lice eradication for cattle that are kept over the winter. Furthermore, it would be questionable to devote £1 million of the taxpayers' money for the purchase of animal medicines when there are crying demands for expenditure of money in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and in other sectors also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of a levy collection or a surplus does not arise as such.  The position is that when CBF was established early in 1969 the Government provided for its financing by an abatement of ¼d per lb in the level of carcase beef export support payments here as compared with the level of deficiency payments made on fat cattle in Britain.  It is expected that the cumulative amount represented by this abatement will have been paid to CBF within the next year or so.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen the statement mentioned by the Deputy.  The Irish subsidiary of the company named is liable, under the terms of the lease granted to it on 30th July, 1963, to pay royalties on the basis of graded percentages of profits.  Apart from this, the company's operation provides considerable benefits to the economy in the form of export earnings and employment as well as funds for further mineral exploration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mine commenced production at the end of 1965 and has been trading since the beginning of 1966.  As the operating company is a private concern I am precluded from giving information about its business apart from information which is published by the company itself.  A recent statement by the company to the press indicates that the value of total concentrate production for export since the mine opened is £27,325,000.  According to the company's last available annual report total employment at 31st December, 1969 was 339.  For the reason already <Col N="2082" /> stated, I am precluded from giving particulars of royalties paid by individual companies.  Particulars, including royalty rates, of all leases of State minerals and of receipts under the Minerals Development Acts 1940 and 1960 from royalties and fees are contained in the reports laid before the Oireachtas in accordance with the requirements of the Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister, like the rest of us, is aware of the grave discontent on both sides of the rents question, the property owners and the unfortunate people renting rooms.  In order to help out in this grave and critical situation would the Minister consider establishing some form of rent tribunal to investigate each of these cases so that people on either side will have redress?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy has in mind a tribunal something on the lines of that established in Britain in <Col N="2083" /> 1965.  While that idea has, possibly, certain attractions, there would be doubt as to whether the establishment of such a non-judicial tribunal would be constitutional.  There is that problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult for me to answer Deputy Ryan's point without the benefit of some legal advice but it would seem to me that if there is such a covenant in a lease&mdash;and I do not know whether such covenants are frequent&mdash;they may well be void as being against public policy.  It seems to be a remarkably unpleasant type of covenant to include in a lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

If the Minister is not aware of this, would he not consider holding an investigation to acquaint himself fully with the disastrous position prevailing in Dublin and the tremendous problem facing young married couples who have absolutely no place to go, who are completely unaware of rules and regulations and legal formalities and who are forced <Col N="2084" /> to go into the first room they can get?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the very point that was made by Deputy Moore in his supplementary questions.  I am aware that there are difficulties of this kind and, as I pointed out here before on this point, a great many of the rooms and flats for which very high rents are being charged at present may well be subject to the control of the Rent Acts. Unfortunately many of the tenants or potential tenants, when they go to look at them, are not aware of their rights in that respect, and they should avail themselves of the advice that would be given to them on this point if they had any doubt in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's well-known and intense pre-occupation with rights in relation to property, building and so on, would he not consider that there is an equally strong obligation on him to protect the rights particularly of young married couples who in many parts of this city and throughout the country are paying rents for a room and a kitchen, not of £4 to £6 per week but £6 to £8 even £9 per week?  Such families have no hope whatever of saving to buy a house.  Furthermore they have almost no protection under the law.  Therefore would the Minister at least institute some tribunal along the lines of the 1965 British Act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Cronin) Gerry Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cronin)</NameTxt>
      <P>A special allowance is an annual sum of such amount as, when added to an applicant's assessable yearly means, will not equal or exceed the &ldquo;appropriate <Col N="2085" /> annual sum&rdquo; laid down in the Army Pensions Acts.  An investigation of this applicant's yearly means showed that he has a contributory old age pension of £8.50 per week of which £1.55 per week is assessable as means, and a retirement pension of £1.87 per week from Córas Iompair Éireann which is assessable in full.  The appropriate annual sum applicable in the case is £180.00 and the special allowance of £1.50 per annum is, therefore, the maximum permissible under the terms of the Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>

Does the Minister realise that a pension of £1 10s or £1.50 per annum for services rendered to this State is less than three new pence per week and that it is nothing less than an insult to offer this person such an amount?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy has distorted the position in so far as that provision is made to bridge a gap between assessable means and the appropriate sum.  In this case the Act is being applied correctly.  If the applicant had no means, he would get his full special allowance of £180.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me reply briefly to Deputy O'Donovan.  He asked me to consider the addition to my amendment of the following words: &ldquo;and shall have regard primarily to the numbers of students following courses leading to a degree&rdquo;.  This, I think, arises from a complaint which the Deputy has voiced here on many occasions in regard to UCD but this is a matter which would obviously have to be discussed in the context of the various institutions of higher education.  I have already pointed out that the amount of money made available will be channelled through An tÚdarás and will appear in my Vote.</P>
      <P>It is also important to remember that one vital factor in relation to this suggestion is the differences in the cost of courses, which Deputy FitzGerald mentioned.  Courses in science and engineering are far more costly than courses in arts or commerce and no amount of theory can get away from that fact.  Therefore, the number of students is only one criterion to be taken into account.  Apart from this, it is also a fact that it is only the manner of the payments and the conditions attaching to them which are involved in this subsection.  Assessments relate more to section 10.  However, Deputies can take it that these are matters which would of necessity have to be taken into consideration in any discussions which will take place between An tÚdarás and the various institutions of higher education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard the Minister's remarks earlier on the subject I have been thinking about how the amendments, in his name and in our names, could be modified to produce something acceptable to both sides.  It seems to me that there is a very real issue here about the conditions being applied to grants other than grants for capital purposes.  This could be met if, in due course, the <Col N="2094" /> Minister would be prepared to consider an amendment to his amendment &mdash;and I am not saying that this meets all our points but this particular point might be met&mdash;under which, instead of the words &ldquo;the amounts&rdquo; in the second line of his amendment, one substituted &ldquo;a grant-in-aid for capital purposes&rdquo;.  The Minister told us that in the ordinary way there will be two grants-in-aid each year, one current and one capital.  I suppose in special circumstances there might be a supplementary one, if one does not want to confine them to two in any given year, but in the ordinary way there will be a clear distinction between grants-in-aid for capital purposes and for current purposes.  If that is the intention our point could be met quite neatly, making amendment 24 unnecessary but not, I submit, amendment 22, if he would agree to make that change.  I do not think that anything he has said refutes our case and while conditions of this kind are appropriate and indeed necessary in cases of capital grants they would be inappropriate in regard to current grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He did make some suggestion about particular circumstances in which in relation to current expenditure the authority might wish to make money available for experimental purposes to try out some new project or some new subject.  That may be so but that does not mean that they have to have the legal power to impose conditions.  Of course, in the ordinary to and fro of discussions between the authority and the universities if a suggestion comes up for some experiment of this kind this would influence the authority in the money to be provided, and of course informally the authority and the university could reach agreement that if some additional money is provided in the grant-in-aid it could be used for this particular purpose to see how the proposal worked out.  However, I do not think that to allow for that rather minor case, which can be dealt with informally, it is in any way desirable to allow the power to impose conditions in current grants-in-aid.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister if on Report Stage he would consider an amendment along these lines.  The exact wording does not matter.  I have <Col N="2095" /> made a suggestion as to how it might be done neatly within the Minister's own amendment but there may be some defect in my wording, or he may want to do it some other way.  At this stage I want to be clear that he would be willing in principle to look into the question of narrowing down the power to impose conditions to cases where it is a grant for capital purposes.</P>
    <P>On amendment 22, having heard the Minister I see the reason why the word &ldquo;amounts&rdquo; is in the plural in so far as even within a single year there will be two amounts at least, capital and current, and that seems to be a valid reason for not pressing my amendment. The trouble is that if this word is left in the plural and if you follow it with the words which are there at the moment, which the Minister proposes to leave unchanged, you do leave a position in which the Minister could be allocating money to particular institutions.</P>
    <P>One good reason for my suggested change in the wording is that you will get over that.  I would be happy to leave it in the form of &ldquo;such amounts for higher education and research&rdquo; but in the light of what the Minister has said about these grants-in-aid he may wish to specify that these would in fact be grants-in-aid.  The word &ldquo;amounts&rdquo; may be a bit vague if it is intended that they are to be grants-in-aid. However, I would like to hear the Minister on my main point before I say anything more.</P>

      <P>In my view there could not be any question of relating section 12 (2) to capital sums only.  It is quite obvious that it would have to be related to capital sums but we must also recognise that under the present practice there is some earmarking done in relation to current grants and I have not heard any argument which would make me change my mind in relation to the question of having some ear-marking in regard to certain types of recurring grants.  I mentioned some of them earlier, apart altogether from the ones mentioned by the Deputy.  I mentioned specific sums being made available for temporary buildings, for <Col N="2096" /> adaptation purchases, for equipping laboratories, and so on.  I felt I had covered the Deputy's main objections when I clearly indicated what &ldquo;amounts&rdquo; meant, that it did not in fact mean amounts for individual institutions but rather two global amounts.  This, as the Deputy is aware, would be the way in which moneys would be made available and shown in the Book of Estimates under the Vote by way of grants-in-aid for capital and current expenditure.  I feel we should go on these lines and show the global amount for current and the global amount for capital.  As I said, I did feel I had covered the difficulties that the Deputy obviously saw in this when he put down his amendments.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of institutions of higher education these words appear all through the Bill and in fact the only purpose for which these two global sums can be voted by An tÚdarás would be to make grants to institutions of higher education designated in the Act, that is the universities, and other institutions designated by the Minister by regulation.  Therefore, the reference to institutions cannot be deleted.  I feel it is unnecessary to include &ldquo;and research&rdquo; when institutions of higher education are specified in the text.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy FitzGerald heartily if not wholly.  I do not think his amendment No. 22 is particularly relevant.  If the Minister accepts his amendment to the Minister's own amendment No. 23, I think the issue of whether research is specifically carried on in an institution is not particularly important and to argue that the Minister is only entitled to detail the total amount he provides for higher education is to limit the Minister's powers a great deal too far. I certainly completely endorse Deputy FitzGerald's amended version of the Minister's amendment No. 23.  Deputy FitzGerald has gone at least 50 per cent of the way to meet the Minister. The Minister says that it is a statement of intention on his part, that there are certain kinds of current moneys for what he has in mind when he speaks of control of current expenditure. <Col N="2097" /> When this Bill becomes an Act it will not specify certain kinds of current expenditure.  I do not think the Minister has met Deputy FitzGerald's misgivings which I fully share and that is that to provide for the authority to have the power to detail the earmarked grants in relation to current expenditure creates a dangerous precedent in relation to the university.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not totally answer my question as to whether he himself would be involved in the earmarking of grants within the total grant given to a specific institution.  The HEA will come to him with a bill and we cannot be so naîve as not to believe that the first thing the Minister and the Department will ask is that the bill should be itemised.  In turn they will express a desire to influence the manner in which it is itemised.  In this way it seems that instead of giving a relative degree of authority to the HEA here we are changing the existing manner of paying grants to universities.  We are not keeping it, as far as the Minister is concerned.  We are doubling the process of earmarking which goes on, earmarking by the Minister's Department and earmarking by the HEA without any necessary statutory requirement for consultation with the university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has totally failed to convince me here that a successor of his could not drive a coach and four through this and extend State control of the day-to-day financing of teaching in a university as opposed to major capital grants&mdash;extend control over that to a point which would be something tantamount to the manner in which the German universities collapsed into subservience in the late 'Thirties, or to the way in which the University of Milan has functioned as a body representative of specific governmental points of view.  I am sorry to have to tell the Minister that he has not convinced me.  While I would say to Deputy FitzGerald that I do not think amendment No. 22 is particularly important I think the amendment he has put down to the Minister's amendment is extremely important and if the Minister is obdurate in resisting either Deputy FitzGerald's original amendment <Col N="2098" /> No. 24 or his suggestion that the Minister should consider his revised amendment to amendment No. 23 on the Report Stage, I shall personally press Deputy FitzGerald as hard as possible to push his point of view to the ultimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of Deputy Thornley's support.  It may be that on this particular point the best way of handling this from a practical point of view may be to press it on the Report Stage because it seems, on reflection, a neater method of coping with the problem to accept the Minister's amendment which goes some little distance and meets part of the objection to the HEA itself on this subject and then seek to amend the Minister's amendment by the addition of these words rather than to press my own amendment which may not be as well drafted as the Minister's.  Probably the best solution is to accept the Minister's amendment and seek to amend it on Report Stage.  I should like Deputy Thornley and the Minister to give further consideration to amendment No. 22 or to some amendment to subsection (1).</P>
      <P>As we now see the picture emerging it is more disturbing than I thought. I and other Deputies thought the Minister would come in and give a variety of assurances that nothing of the kind was intended.  He might or might not accept the amendment as is the way of Ministers but at least I expected to get forthright assurances.  What I have got instead is an increasingly explicit account of the method of control which would, as Deputy Thornley said, duplicate the existing mechanism and involve a degree of interference with the autonomy of both the authority and the universities which I find totally unacceptable.  As I see it, it will work as follows: universities or institutions of higher education put forward proposals to the authority; the authority considers these, &ldquo;vets&rdquo; them, cuts them possibly, co-ordinates them and sends them forward to the Minister. The Minister on some occasions, at least in the light of the stringency we now face, may be unable to provide the full sum and instead of going back at that stage and saying to the authority:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2099" />&ldquo;Instead of £4,900,000, we can give you £4,200,000&rdquo; and leaving it at that, the Minister now clearly proposes&mdash; and he has perhaps inadvertently come rather clean on this one&mdash;a haggling process.  He goes back to the authority and says &ldquo;We do not think we can agree on this.  Come back to us and tell us what you propose to do.&rdquo; Instead of the authority being left free to determine this matter when the Minister has taken his decision as to the total sum he can afford, each individual item is to be haggled over so that in the Book of Estimates the figure can be put down and they are tied down to that.  The Minister says it will only go in when agreed with the HEA but we have no assurance that if the HEA refuse to accept the Minister's proposed distribution of the total sum he is going to give that he will not still put it in the Book of Estimates and tie their hands.  That process is completely objectionable.</P>
    <P>I was clear originally that the intention was to give this body the authority to determine how the money should be allocated, and it is an evasion for the Minister to say &ldquo;Yes, they have the authority but they must come back and tell me so that I can put it in the Book of Estimates.&rdquo;  It may well be that agreement will not be reached on the matter and that the authority, in the time available, which may not be adequate for all the consultation required, may be unable to make up its mind.  What happens then?  Will the Minister put something into the Book of Estimates regardless of the authority? What guarantee have we that he will not?  I think that whole process is quite wrong.  I should like the Minister to reconsider that and assure us that what is intended&mdash;indeed if he cannot he will have to find some way of rewording the whole section to cover this&mdash;is that the authority will make a submission to him indicating the reasons why they want this sum of money, indicating the amount required for each institution and the reasons for it and the Minister will then say whether he can or cannot give it.  If he cannot give it the authority will have to sit down and think out with the university&mdash;not with the Minister <Col N="2100" /> who has no further function in the matter&mdash;what it is going to do.</P>
    <P>There is no point in having an authority if the Minister is going to argue with the authority as to how much is to go to each body.  The whole purpose of the authority is to take this out of the Minister's Department.  It seems that the Minister's Department have not understood at all the intentions of the recommendation made on this matter or, perhaps, they have understood them too well and are trying in this way to take control?  Why burden us with an authority at this stage if it is to be done this way?  If the Minister's Department is to remain involved in the allocation of sums to individual bodies as at present there is no point in having the authority. This is the nub of the matter.</P>
    <P>It is not confined to that because the Minister visualises a further stage of control.  Having insisted that the authority must clearly specify the amount for each body so that he can put it in the Book of Estimates and this must be agreed with the Department first, then he expects the authority to go back to the university and earmark grants to them for specific purposes.  If there is one principle that we must stand by it is that there shall not be earmarking of grants for current purposes. The autonomy of the university or the institution depends on its ability to run its own internal affairs within the limits of finance that the Government can make available.  It makes its case, it explains what it spent last year, why costs have gone up, why it needs more staff, why running costs have increased and puts in its claim for more money.  If the Government cannot give it the full amount and it has to make economies, it is for it to decide where the economies are to be made.  If the Government do give it the money and it finds that its needs are marginally different in some areas, more staff are required in one area and less in another in the course of a year, it must be entitled to the flexibility which it enjoys in most respects at the moment.  What the Minister envisages is something that goes far beyond anything we have now.  There is at present in that sense virtually no earmarking. Except for the segregating of agriculture, <Col N="2101" /> veterinary medicine and a grant of a couple of thousand pounds for the teaching of Irish, the great bulk of university expenditure is not earmarked at present.</P>
    <P>Even though a case is made by the university authority for money they may not get the full amount.  The Minister may indicate, although he often does not do so, the reasons why he has not given the full amount which would indicate what expenditure he thought was less desirable.  Even when he does that, it in no way binds the university or college; they are free to use the money they have as they think best.  What is now proposed, according to the Minister, is a much tighter control in which ear-marking which arises at the moment for historical reasons in agriculture, veterinary medicine and the teaching of Irish is going to be wiped out in those areas, but is going to be reintroduced for some other unspecified purpose.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not given any indication why this is to be done.</P>
    <P>If there is to be one global grant as he has told us, and we are glad of his assurance, where does this earmarking come in?  What kind of earmarking of current expenditure has the Minister in mind?  What new developments has he in mind?  The most that happens at present is that the college may apply for additional money for, among other purposes, salary increases.  The Minister may say he does not accept the need for the salary increase, in which event the college will, if it does not get the money and it cannot afford to give it, have to give it out of its own fee resources.  In one instance the fees of one college were raised for the specific purpose of making such an adjustment which the Minister was not prepared to provide money for.  This was an assertion of the autonomy of the college, which was both valuable and salutary in the circumstances.  That is the nearest to earmarking we get at present, apart from the special historical cases I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>What has the Minister in mind?  This is a most sinister development and it is something which I had no idea was intended.  I thought it was an oversight not to have realised the desirability of excluding current expenditure from the <Col N="2102" /> process of earmarking.  I am disturbed to find far from being an oversight it is intended.  I am doubly disturbed to find that not only has the authority been given the power and is to be expected to earmark current grants, but that the Department itself is to negotiate with the HEA over the question of where they are to cut back and this is to be incorporated quite improperly in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>In the light of what I have said I should like the Minister to reconsider the position.  I would ask the House to forgive me if I have spoken with some warmth on this subject.  I am disturbed about the revelations in the debate.  I had thought a different intention was here.  Indeed I had tried to allay misgivings on the part of my colleagues in university by suggesting to them that the Minister did not have these intentitons.  I am a little disconcerted to find I was wrong.  He appears to have some intentions of a kind I had not anticipated.</P>

      <P>The essential thing about section 12 (1) is that the amounts referred to there are two global ones and not amounts for each institution. I think that clarifies one aspect of it. Let me repeat what I said this morning as to the methods by which An tÚdarás, the institutions and the Department will operate.  First of all each institution will make its application to An tÚdarás in an agreed form.  An <Col N="2103" /> tÚdarás will then have discussions and consultations with each of the institutions concerned.  It will then make its recommendations to the Minister and more than likely have discussions with him.  When the capital and the current amounts which the Government will find possible to make available have been determined An tÚdarás will be notified.  It will then be for An tÚdarás to have further discussions with the institutions wherever such may be necessary in order to make whatever changes in priority they think essential. When these discussions have been completed An tÚdarás will notify the Minister as to the amounts it proposes for each institution.</P>

      <P>When An tÚdarás is notified of the actual amount of moneys available they, in consultation with the institutions of higher education will decide what changes are necessary and what the priorities are. They will notify the Minister of the amounts for each institution and the Minister will put this as an appendix in the Book of Estimates.  It is on this the main argument hinges because it has been suggested here, and I do not know why, because I certainly did not suggest it, that after An tÚdarás has been notified of the amount which is, in fact, available, not only will they have to have discussions with the institutions concerned as to priorities and so on, but they will have to come back and ask the Minister's approval for the particular priorities.  This will not be so.  The fact is that they will simply notify the Minister of the amounts for each institution and any democratic assembly is at least entitled to that information.</P>

      <P>I apologise for not being here when the debate was resumed, but I do not think I have lost any time.  I was speaking about a senior official in the Department of Education who spoke to me about the expense of the faculties.  One could not have a greater amount of rubbish talked about education than about the expense of faculties.  A faculty is as expensive as the university likes to make it.  In fact, newcomers with new ideas want to make a different faculty the most expensive faculty from what was the most expensive faculty the previous decade.  The Minister has spoken about an appendix to the Estimate.  This is all nonsense.  There is no such thing as an appendix to an Estimate.  The Estimate is two-part and, as I say, there is no such thing as an appendix to an Estimate and an appendix to the Education Estimate will not be worth the paper it is printed on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me deal now with what the Minister said.  He said there would be no change made in the present position. But the whole essence of the thing <Col N="2105" /> is that there is a fundamental change in the present position.  I understand there are more than university colleges in third level education and I am told my amendment may require some change.  It can be changed.  It is only a matter of words.  What will the position be?  Let me tell the Minister what the position will be in regard to higher education.  First, there is An tÚdarás, accepting the Minister's pronunciation of it.  University College will have to go to An tÚdarás.  An tÚdarás will have to go to the Department of Education and the Department of Education will have to go to the Department of Finance and, since there is bound to be disagreement, it will all have to go ultimately to the Government.  Up to recently all that was required was discussion between a university college and the Department of Finance.  As I say, there is bound to be disagreement in the new situation and one will have to go through one, two, three, four and, if you include Dáil Éireann, five media.  There will be five steps where heretofore there were only two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this as deplorable. Take the best example we have of semi-State bodies, the Electricity Supply Board.  What does it have to do?  It comes to this House and gets a global sum voted.  Some years back, when it was under severe pressure, we had no less a person than An Tánaiste giving out the pay about the operations of the ESB tribunal.  He was going to abolish it but the whole thing, of course, ended up in a bottle of smoke. The ESB gets its money and yesterday the Minister for Transport and Power told us he will have a new Bill for the ESB soon.  As I say, it gets a global sum.  Is the ESB more reliable in relation to its work than universities are in relation to their work?  It is in that aspect I am essentially interested. Then you have Bord Fáilte which, quite justifiably, is under a good deal of criticism because of excessive expenditure by way of grants to hotels in the west.  You have the air companies. Recently they bought two white elephants. <Col N="2106" /> It is all very well to talk.  There is no question as to what this kind of thing means.  All these bodies that I have listed are not accountable to anyone. The accounts of the universities are, in fact, audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  They are laid before the House but the accounts of these other bodies are not audited on behalf of the State.  These bodies operate in a different way.  They are allowed their day-to-day expenditure, without any limit being placed on it, within the global sum voted by Dáil Éireann, whatever it may be.  It may be £20 million or £50 million&mdash;one can say any sum nowadays, but there was a time when there would be a good deal of discussion about £1 million. Now it can be £50 million and nobody bats an eyelid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be clear about this.  I do not owe that much to university authorities that I should defend them in this fashion but I believe in what I am saying. There is no use pretending that higher education is not in a different category.  We have had all kinds of messing about with it.  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald talked about research this morning and he was quite right in what he said.  We have all kinds of institutes being set up.  They are like the business consultants.  We have the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, the Institute of Public Administration, the Institute of Business Management and the Institute of Economic and Social Research.  I have complained about the operations of some of these.  The proper place for research is in the universities. There is, too, that massive operation, An Foras Talúntais.  When the Faculty of Agriculture got an enormous amount of money at one stage in relation to its operations it was given no research work to do.  Then An Foras Talúntais was set up and it is now spending £2 million a year.  It was built up too suddenly.  You cannot get research people at the drop of a hat.  It is easy to get a traveller, an agent, who is good at talking to people.  That is not what is involved in serious research.  The attitude of the Government has been to set up institutions superior to universities. All right, but the Minister should accept my suggestion that, in relation <Col N="2107" /> to grants to universities, the primary consideration should be the number of students pursuing studies leading to a degree.</P>
    <P>There are other third level educational bodies.  It is a matter of verbiage. There is no difficulty in dealing with these because it is only a matter of words.  I have no objection to the Minister's amendment provided he is prepared to put into it something to the effect I have suggested and, if he is not prepared to promise to do that on the Report Stage, I shall certainly put down an amendment.</P>

      <P>After all, allowing for the fact that we are dealing with third level education, in this context we must take into account the fact that the setting up of An tÚdarás is a first time exercise.  I am in thorough agreement with the Minister when he says that he does not want to tie An tÚdarás in a straitjacket, as it were. Neither does he want to interfere unduly in the affairs of the universities. Today in third level education we have institutions other than universities and I think it is reasonable to provide certain <Col N="2108" /> safeguards in the Bill setting up this system.  One of the safeguards which I think should be in any Bill dealing with any semi-statutory corporation is that this House should be aware of the amount of money expended by any such corporation.</P>

      <P>I am not estopped by any tradition of trying to tie down the autonomy of State bodies from expressing my views on universities. Having heard what the Minister had to say, and having heard Deputy Carter following him, it seems to me that a hare has been started which we need to stop before it confuses everybody. It has been suggested that there is some analogy between the presentation in an appendix to the Book of Estimates of the amounts to be given to each of these bodies and the procedures adopted in respect of other bodies. There is no such analogy.  There is no precedent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my understanding from my work on that Committee that since there was some decision by or advice from a select committee in England in 1896, it has been the practice of Parliament in this country and in Britain, with no exception&mdash;except the single exception of the case we are now investigating&mdash; not to look behind the grant-in-aid. When a grant-in-aid is given to a body if it is a State body it may have a statutory obligation to furnish to Parliament a report on its activities. That is a different matter.  There is no question of a grant-in-aid as such being investigated or broken down in the Book of Estimates.  The only exception to that is the case of the authority given by this House last December to the Committee of Public Accounts to investigate what happened to the £100,000.  I should hate to think that our energetic activities in that sphere would be taken as a precedent for what we are now talking about.  It would make me wonder whether I <Col N="2110" /> was engaged on the right job at all if I thought that was to be the result.</P>
      <P>I am quite clear that when money is given by way of grant-in-aid, if it is given to a State body, Parliament has the right to require from that body a statement about what it does with the money, and so we do require, and so we have just got from the Industrial Development Authority a magnificent report&mdash;apart from the dates on the cover&mdash;setting out in enormous detail to whom every penny was paid.  We are entitled to have that in due course from the body in its annual report. I would be very unhappy if An tÚdarás managed to present reports to this House which failed to tell us to whom it gave the money.  I should regard it as my duty as a Member of this House to demand that it should give us that information.  That is quite a different matter from putting it in the Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>Putting it in the Book of Estimates involves a complete departure from the principle that grants-in-aid are not matters behind which Parliament looks.  You are putting An tÚdarás into a position different from that of any other body, with less automony than any other State body in this country, if you require it before it can hand out money to anybody to notify the Government and have it put in the Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>Quite apart from the question of principle involved, there is the practical question.  The procedure the Minister proposes is one which, working backwards from the date on which the money has to be paid out, would involve so many stages that it would be necessary for the universities to state their requirements so far in advance of the year to which the requirements related that the chances of their making an accurate estimate would be greatly diminished.  Already we are being pushed back and back to an earlier date because of the inability of the public administration to do its job speedily enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it is, we are asked in June, I think, to submit our requirements for a year beginning nine months later. With the procedure the Minister is suggesting <Col N="2111" /> just when does he think this process would have to start?  He is asking something which is quite impossible. The more stages he puts into this thing the more impracticable it becomes. There may be an opportunity for him to reconsider this proposal for a couple of weeks because I do not think we will reach a conclusion on this matter in the remaining three minutes tonight.  I should like him to think it over and to consider seriously the arguments I am putting.  Why should he pick on An tÚdarás alone among State bodies to apply to it this peculiar procedure that it must state before the Book of Estimates is prepared in December of each year what it intends to do with the money it will not get for another four months? Why of all State bodies is the autonomy of this body to be undermined in this way when no other State body, or indeed private body, to which a grant-in-aid is made is required to furnish such information?  We have a number of grant-giving State bodies which get grants-in-aid and disburse them: Córas Tráchtála which does this job to some degree, and Bord Fáilte. I already mentioned the IDA.  There are a number of others in different spheres.  In no case are they asked to furnish information for the Book of Estimates four months before the year begins as to what they will do with the money they have not yet got.</P>
    <P>The proposal is one which is neither practicable, involving such a long slow procedure as to invalidate the whole process of forward estimating, nor is it desirable in terms of the autonomy of this body.  The Minister has helped the debate along by explaining his thinking. It may be that I have picked him up wrongly from time to time.  I am a little relieved to hear his description of the procedure and that what is involved will not require continual to-ing and fro-ing between the Department and An tÚdarás.  I still do not accept that an obligation can be put on An tÚdarás to furnish to the Minister a breakdown of the expenditure before the Book of Estimates is prepared.</P>
    <P>If we think back on the stages <Col N="2112" /> involved in this we see that it would be necessary for the universities to furnish the information before the beginning of the financial year in which the money is to be spent.  Having An tÚdarás at all and then having this to-ing and fro-ing backwards and forwards will certainly add three months at least to the present timing which involves the whole process starting in June.  I should like the Minister to consider these matters over the Easter Recess and I trust that when he is not considering them he will be enjoying himself.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Boarding of Irish Vessels.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no dispute about the national desirability of maintaining friendly relations between Ireland and Britain but these relations will be difficult to maintain and much more difficult to cultivate if the dignity and sovereignty of Ireland is to be repeatedly affronted by the forcible boarding of Irish vessels at sea, either on the high seas or in the territorial waters of any country, or in sea lanes which are international or in what are, beyond all doubt or dispute, the territorial waters of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I express that view at the outset because of the necessity of repudiating the mischievous suggestion of the Minister for Transport and Power earlier today that our protests in this matter were in conflict with the Fine Gael resolution last week which called for the repudiation of the use of force for the purpose of achieving Irish unity.  There is no conflict whatever between asserting before the world our right that our ships proceeding on inoffensive passage should not be subjected to stoppage and interference by <Col N="2113" /> a foreign power, and our desire that the unity of Ireland would come about through the goodwill of all our people as a matter of conviction.</P>
    <P>Our approach to this is not affected by any feelings of Anglophobia.  Our attitude would be precisely the same if it were a forcible Russian, American, German or Chinese boarding of an Irish vessel.  A vessel of any country which sails under the flag of that country is entitled to the full protection of the flag's State.  It would appear in the light of interference which has already occurred that we are not giving to ships sailing under the Irish Flag the protection to which they are entitled.  Three minesweepers have recently been delivered which enable us now, after years of neglect on the part of the Government, to provide for ships proceeding towards Irish ports the protection necessary against unlawful interference by a foreign power.  It was in the light of this realisation that we now have the means which we did not have last November to protect our ships that we asked the Minister for Defence for an indication that we were now deploying some of our naval force to protect Irish ships from the kind of interference to which they have been subjected by the British Navy.  If, as the Minister today suggested, we should be doing all in our power, as we in Fine Gael certainly believe we should, to prevent arms being imported into the North of Ireland through this country, we have available to us every means to stop that.  Those means would include the searching of ships when they arrive in Irish ports.  If the British authorities are sincere in their anxiety to prevent the use of Irish ports for the importation of arms illegally they would clearly have an obligation, where they suspect that arms are being imported illegally, to inform the Irish authorities who, in turn, could inspect the ships and take whatever action was necessary to prevent the illegal importation of arms.  If I understand the Minister correctly today and last November, he seems to share the claim of the British authorities that they can take steps to stop the illegal importation of arms through Irish ports on Irish ships.  I say, with all respect, that <Col N="2114" /> it is no function of the British Navy to stop the importation of arms, whether illegal or lawful, into Irish ports.  That is a matter for the sovereign Irish Government and it is no function of the British authorities to assume that arms proceeding towards the South of Ireland are being illegally imported or that their ultimate destination is the North of Ireland.  This is a question of asserting the absolute sovereignty of Ireland and the right of ships flying the Irish Flag to proceed on their courses without the offensive interference to which they have been subjected by the British authorities.  If the British authorities suggest that they have received information which leads them to believe that some Irish shipping line or lines have been used for the illegal importation of arms they may take such steps are are legally available to them to stop such arms being used in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I believe that the British authorities should carefully examine any suggestions which have been made about Greenore Ferries being used for the illegal importation of arms into the North of Ireland.  Greenore ferries is a very small concern but it is an independent concern successfully operating a legitimate business and providing a very necessary service for industry in the east and north-east of our country, including many industries in Northern Ireland.  If the British authorities have received complaints about Greenore Ferries it seems to me that these complaints are highly suspect.  What is the source of these complaints?  On three occasions a vessel belonging to Greenore Ferries has been searched by the British Navy, apparently as a result of mischievious complaints lodged with the British authorities.  On each occasion it has been found that there was no justification for the complaint.  The members of the Seamen's Union of Ireland who operate on Irish flagships between Irish and British ports are understandably very perturbed and annoyed by what has taken place. These people share with the rest of us the desire that Ireland be united through agreement, but they resent deeply the fact that they have been subjected to this cloud of suspicion that <Col N="2115" /> they are engaged in unlawful activities when all the attempts to date to prove so have been negatived by the fact that, when the ships were searched, they were found not to contain arms.</P>
    <P>We think that the time has now come not to rely any longer upon diplomatic protest.  We were informed last November that our Government had made a demarche to the British authorities.  We were urged not to make too loud a complaint in our Parliament lest, by doing so, it would make it difficult for the British authorities to adopt the right course.  I completely understand the difficulties which face any country once there is a public issue made of any particular stand which they take.  We held our peace. We were prepared last November to accept the <i>bona fides</i> of our own Government and of the British Government to achieve a formula which would prevent any further incidents of a like nature occurring.  We were led to expect from the inactivity of the last four or five months that a suitable arrangement had been arrived at.  Now it appears that all that has been rendered at nought.  It leads one, therefore, to ask the question whether this recent gross intervention with Irish shipping is a gesture towards the right wing of unionism in the North of Ireland?  Is this an exercise by the Westminster Government to placate Northern unionists, to show them that once more the British lion will whip the Irish Republicans?</P>
    <P>It is a sinister event that this further forcible boarding of an Irish vessel should occur in the same week as there appear to be unhealthy trends towards the right wing in the north of Ireland. If my remarks cause embarrassment, if resentment is felt by the British authorities at my remarks, on their head be the consequences for their own action.  This is a sovereign independent Parliament which has not only a right but a duty to assert the sovereignty of Irish soil and Irish vessels.  Those vessels are entitled to the full protection of the military forces of this State.</P>
    <P>Among the questions which I asked today, which were not answered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whom I <Col N="2116" /> take it was answering not because he had any individual responsibility but was acting on behalf of the Minister for Defence, was the one which asked him to specify the rights which this State had to detain, arrest, imprison and punish members of the armed forces of another country who bear arms and enter without leave on the territory of, or a vessel belonging to, this country.  That was one of the many questions which were not answered to-day. Is it not time that it was answered and that we took steps, if necessary, to put armed forces aboard Irish vessels which are being subjected to this illegal intervention by British forces and that we arrested and, if necessary, interned, troops who forcibly enter on Irish vessels or Irish soil?</P>
    <P>None of what the Minister said has any bearing on our desire to achieve the unity of Ireland through peaceful means.  If there is a difficulty, if there is a problem, if there are pressures in the north of Ireland we are not responsible for them.  It is no excuse to say that there are diplomatic difficulties and one must have regard to the delicacy of the situation, one must avoid doing anything to make the situation any more complicated.  Our sovereignty is absolute in this matter and we must not forget this forcible trespass or even accidental trespass which has occurred.</P>
    <P>We appreciate that there have been several crossings of the border between the Republic and the north of Ireland.  Through accident those crossings have taken place and we have suffered them, accepting the difficulties which may exist where you have not got clearly defined boundaries but it seems to me that as we have now so many incidents of forcible boarding of Irish vessels we can no longer tolerate as forgiveable accidents the crossings of the land boundaries by British forces in uniform and armed.  This may require a very serious and expensive deployment of our naval forces and our land forces on the high seas and on our own territory but we must assert, unless we are prepared to accept an inferior position, our right to complete sovereignty over our waters, to complete sovereignty of our vessels <Col N="2117" /> flying under the Irish Flag and to complete sovereignty of our land territory.</P>
    <P>There are several remedies available to the British authorities, without causing us any offence, if they have reason to believe that ships lying between Britain and Ireland are carrying arms. They could seize the vessels in British ports.  As I understand it they have not done so.  If they have reason to believe that the vessels are being met on the high seas by other vessels and there loaded with guns and ammunition they can follow the ships plying between British and Irish ports to make sure this does not occur.</P>
    <P>This may be an expensive procedure but this is a matter for the British Royal Navy and the British taxpayer to bear.  No matter how expensive or inconvenient it may be it does not justify them in saying: &ldquo;It is too expensive&rdquo; and that they can then affront a friendly country by making forcible boardings of their ships, either on the high seas or in our territorial waters. It is a clear principle of international law that ships are entitled to proceed on innocent passage on the shipping lanes of the world even if they entered into what are claimed to be the territorial waters of a particular country. The British action is illegal and is unfriendly and we think that the reasonable, diplomatic approaches which we have been making in this matter are clearly being ignored and that a time has now come to express ourselves in a far more definite way, not as an exercise of gun diplomacy, such as the Minister suggested today, but for the purpose of asserting our sovereignty, on which we will allow nobody to trample.</P>
    <P>At its best the British action is an action of folly because it promotes distaste and distrust in Ireland of British conduct and British utterances.  May I make the sincere plea to the British authorities to desist forthwith and accept that the Parliament of Ireland has expressed its denunciation of the use of force to achieve Irish unity and to accept that resolution in good faith and accepting it, if they believe there is any reason to suspect that ships are being used for the illegal importation of arms, then to convey the information <Col N="2118" /> to our authorities who I feel certain will make sure that no Irish vessel, no Irish plane, no Irish port, no Irish vehicle or no Irish hand will be permitted to send arms for illegal use for the purpose of achieving Irish unity or for the purpose of provoking any section of the community in the north of Ireland against the other.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, while it may seem to be a small thing, the owners of the vessels which have been interfered with and delayed, are entitled to compensation. It is quite an expensive procedure to delay a ship for an hour at sea.  The sailors are entitled to be paid for their hours at sea.  This requires the crew to be properly paid for the delays which take place.  The running of the engines of a ship is quite an expensive business and it is no small matter in a crossing of about 20 miles if a ship is delayed for an hour.  I appreciate that apparently the owners have not yet made any claim but we should encourage them to make this claim and the Government should ensure that the British authorities pay compensation in respect of the delays which have already taken place.</P>
    <P>We have complete regard for the delicacy of the situation but we do not think that this means that we must not take any action.  Action is called for not only on the diplomatic but, if necessary, on the naval and military levels.  We look to the Government to take this action so that we will not have to suffer any longer the frustration and indignity to which we have been subjected in the last six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to place on record, and to this extent I am in accord with the views expressed by Deputy Ryan and Deputy Desmond, that we regard the British action in connection with the three boats that have been boarded as extremely unwise.  It is the view of the Government that the action was unwise and unpalatable and in the present <Col N="2119" /> delicate, sensitive situation in this island is not helpful.  Having regard to the problems that exist one would think that at all levels in the two islands they should be sought to be resolved by moderate and sensible policies.  Our view of the recent incident is that it does not contribute towards a solution. We need highly sensitive policies to secure the unity all recognise as essential for peace in Ireland&mdash;a unity of hearts and minds and the elimination of sectarianism, hatred and prejudice. These involve deep human emotions and can only be settled in a sensitive way.</P>
      <P>The action in the instances referred to by Deputy Ryan can only be described as insensitive and not contributing to but, in fact, harming the type of development that sensible and moderate people in Ireland and the Governments in both islands would like to see.  To that extent I go the whole way with Deputy Ryan and Deputy Desmond and everyone in this House would share that view.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I should like to emphasise that if there has been a lack of sensitivity on the part of the British authorities in their handling of this matter there is no point in adding to that by showing a similar lack on our part.  Members of this House and leaders of public opinion in Ireland must appreciate at this point that the whole question is highly delicate and can only be handled by the elected Government of the Irish people in a careful manner with the British Government. We have taken up the matter with the British Government.  We have impressed on them the dangerous nature of the kind of thing exemplified by the action taken in regard to the <i>Owenro,</i> which further inflames public opinion here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While making our views known and emphasising that this kind of action does not help, to put it mildly, I do not think it would help either if Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas should overreact in the matter.  The best approach is to leave it to the Government charged with the responsibility to handle the matter as best they can.  At <Col N="2120" /> times this may involve a &ldquo;velvet glove&rdquo; approach.</P>
    <P>I do not have to emphasise the danger posed to Irish unity by the availability of illegal arms in any part of Ireland.  To that extent the Irish and British Governments have a common interest to secure that, as far as possible, illegal arms do not come into Ireland, north or south, and that arms in Ireland are clearly under the control of the civil administration.  In this respect I am glad to see that the Northern Prime Minister, Mr. Brian Faulkner, has issued an appeal for the handing up of guns, whether licensed or not, in the next ten days.  This is an indication at least that some element of commonsense has entered the mind of the administration in that part of Ireland.  Further steps in the same direction would be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of our territorial waters, as the House is aware, there is a view that the waters around our island are our territorial waters.  Such a matter could be submitted to an international court but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <P>We should try.  We might win.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;fundamentally the Government regard this issue as political rather than legal and do not think it should be approached in a legalistic manner.  At all times we must bear in mind that anything we do is in the interest of securing Irish unity and that there is a common view that importation of illegal arms must be prevented.  Every effort must be made by the Government here and at West-minster to ensure that illegal importation of arms is prevented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry if Deputy Ryan regards my earlier remarks at Question Time as mischievous.  They were not intended to be.  They were intended to emphasise simply that it is the policy of all parties in this House that the ultimate unity of Ireland cannot be secured by the use of force and that there is a rejection by all parties here of the use of force as a means of achieving Irish unity.  This has been the unanimous decision of this House. <Col N="2121" /> Events in the past two years in Ireland have themselves emphasised the fact that the illegal importation and use of arms, or force of any kind, can only exacerbate the situation and lead to further sectarianism.  The moderate views of the great silent majority of Ireland, north and south, tend not to be heard when violent words are used and violent methods adopted.  All reasonable people in Ireland, in Britain and throughout the world have got that message very clearly over the past few years.  Therefore, out of the evil deeds of the past few years good has come in the sense that there is now a totally committed rejection by reasonable people everywhere of force as a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2122" /> I share the views expressed by Deputy Ryan and Deputy Desmond that it is most unwise to use gunboat diplomacy.  We, in all political parties in this House, have, since the troubles started two years ago, adopted an attitude of cooling the situation.  The Government have done it.  The Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party have done it.  It would be very wise if the British Government, in regard to the actions of any of their administrative arms also adopted the same attitude. This, above all, is what we need in handling these situations in our island today.</P>
