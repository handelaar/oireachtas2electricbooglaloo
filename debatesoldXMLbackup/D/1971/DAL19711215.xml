      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned last night I was speaking about the wasted years since the <i>First Programme of Economic Expansion</i> was introduced ten years ago and the fact that during those ten years the Government sat idly by and have done <Col N="2025" /> very little to prepare our prime industry, agriculture, for our entry into the EEC and for the competitive period that lies ahead.  They are trying to do now in a very short time what they should have been doing for the past ten years.  We have panic measures now.  The unfortunate thing is that it is a bit late in the day.</P>
      <P>Last night I spoke about the fact that agriculture is short of money. I believe the major problem about investment in agriculture at the present time is the fact that the machinery for investment in this industry on the scale needed does not exist at the moment. Even if we were able to hand to every farmer a cheque for the amount of capital needed to improve his operation to a point where he could make an adequate living from it the capital would only be of very limited value to him since he is not organised to make proper use of it nor indeed have most farmers had the opportunity to acquire the necessary specialised technical knowledge to make the most of their land and any working capital made available to them.  The Government, and the Government alone, are to blame for this.  The Parliamentary Secretary may smile.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should not talk like that. Remember all the Parliamentary Secretary said about Deputy Neil Blaney and all Deputy Neil Blaney said about the Parliamentary Secretary.  Do not talk about this party.  Since the Parliamentary Secretary's party lost seven members they have become more united and stronger than ever.  Words have certainly lost their meaning where Fianna Fáil are concerned and we would want the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i> to find out the meaning of unity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry for getting Deputy L'Estrange off the rails.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil are off the rails in Donegal.  To come back to my argument, the Government are to blame, but organisations like Macra na Feirme, the NFA and the Country Women's Association have done excellent work making technical knowledge available to the farmers and preparing them for the competition that lies ahead.  There is at the moment an enormous gulf between those in Government, who allegedly seek to help agriculture, and the individual farmer on whom the success of any scheme must ultimately depend. There is a tendency for civil servants and policymakers in Dublin to become cut off from the actual problems of the farmers.  These people become involved in administration and they tend to lose touch with reality.  This is the reason for their failure to involve farmers sufficiently in policy-making and radical changes in traditional procedures.  The agricultural advisory services try to bridge the gap by giving the farmer practical help in improving his methods of operation and his technical know-how, <i>et cetera,</i> but these services do not operate with a long-term objective in view.  They are designed primarily to solve problems on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
      <P>It is a pity there is no grand design or proper long-term programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2027" /> Indeed, I believe that, if the Department of Agriculture get any more control of the advisory services, it will be a bad day for agriculture and for the Irish farmer.  In any national programme for investment in agriculture on a scale those engaged in agriculture believe necessary it is essential that such a programme should begin with a sound scheme of organisation to ensure that investment is effective.  Any such scheme will have no hope of success unless it has the confidence and support of the farmers themselves and their organisations. Local enthusiasm and initiative are vital for the success of any programme of agricultural investment. Such initiative and enthusiasm can be stimulated only by delegating real responsibility to local level, giving the farmers, their advisers and their organisations authority to take decisions about development and to take control of the funds needed for that development.  As I said last night, excessive central control of routine decisions in matters such as grants has had the effect of stifling local initiative in many fields apart altogether from agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Why leave out the local agricultural committees from the list?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke about them last night.  I approve of them.  We believe in the setting up of a rural development authority to implement a proper programme.  That is our policy.  We believe this authority should be financed with long-term capital provided by the Exchequer. From what I have seen in the papers recently I believe substantial additional capital would be available from the World Bank.  This would ease the strain on our own resources. The rural development authority would take over the operational functions of the Department of Agriculture, the advisory services, and so on.  The Department could then concentrate on a national policy rather than on the detailed day-to-day implementation of that policy.  The authority we envisage is similar to the <Col N="2028" /> authority envisaged in the Devlin Report.  Indeed, the Minister for Lands is in favour of this; as far as he is concerned, he is prepared to see his Department amalgamated with the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The authority we envisage would operate on two levels.  There would be a national board representative of the farmers' organisations and of the committees of agriculture.  These committees have done valuable work and we should continue to make full use of them.  The people should be concerned at all levels in national policy and in the general control of the authority's organisation.  Secondly, there could be county organisations which would be branches of the rural development authority, run by officials of that authority and representative of all the farmers in the county and of the committees of agriculture.  This authority would combine the role of farmers' bank, agricultural advisory services and all the other services dealing with agriculture, with the officials jointly responsible for planning. That type of co-operation and co-ordination is urgently needed. Harmonious working with the farmers in the development of their farms and the provision of finance to carry out plans, which should be drawn up immediately, are also urgently needed. The Agricultural Credit Corporation have provided capital to allow farmers to purchase extra stock and land in order to improve their holdings and make their farms more viable.</P>
      <P>I want, however, to object to the use of political influence.  I know of a case in my own county where two nurses bought land and paid, to put it mildly, too much for it.  They did not have the capital to pay for it and they applied to the Agricultural Credit Corporation but were turned down immediately because they did not already have land and they were not associated with it.  However as a result of political pressure the Agricultural Credit Corporation were told to give those two people the money immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Between now and the time we enter the Common Market finance should be given to develop an overall farm development programme. Such loans could be repaid in the same way as land annuities and be a charge on the land rather than a personal liability on the farmer.  This would overcome the understandable reluctance of many farmers to incur large personal debts in order to finance farm development.  Farmers are conservative in this regard and are not inclined to go out and borrow large sums of money.</P>
      <P>Only something like 14 per cent of our land is mortgaged either to get money from the Agricultural Credit Corporation or from the banks, whereas in the EEC countries land is mortgaged to the extent of 45 to 47 per cent, according to the figures I have.  We have a long way to go before we have anything like the amount of money borrowed to service land that the farmers in the EEC have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2030" /> We need a long-term agricultural credit policy to replace the stop-go policy which has operated in recent years so that farmers may borrow at a realistic rate of interest and plan their programme on a long-term basis.  Much prominence is given by Government spokesmen and, indeed, by others to the millions of pounds spent on agriculture. This is done to confuse the public into thinking that £70 million, £80 million or £90 million, whatever the figure is, is money which the State puts directly into the pockets of farmers, but nothing could be further from the truth as a breakdown will show.  Out of this sum the salaries of Ministers and officials in the Department as well as the staff connected with the industry, including professors in the Agricultural Institute, in the universities, <i>et cetera,</i> have to be paid, as well as the subsidy on lime, much of which goes to CIE in transport costs, the running of the Botanic Gardens and the Zoo, as well as a hidden subsidy to people in England for eating our butter.  It is very unfair to try to fool the people and it is wrong to drive a wedge between the city people and the agricultural community by pretending the latter are getting something to which they are not entitled.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is under-capitalised.  Some experts say we need £1,000 million over the next ten years.  We certainly need a programme to spend £100 million on agriculture.  If we are to provide more employment in agriculture and in our factories the agricultural industry must have a massive injection of capital.  It is said the World Bank will give us a loan of £100 million although it is true they refused to give us a loan recently. I have been told this was because the Government did not have a proper programme for agricultural development for the next ten years.  If we have a well-defined programme for agricultural development the World Bank will be prepared to give us a loan.  Where is this grand plan?  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are too conservative and lack initiative.  The latest person to advocate the £100 million project is Seán Healy, General Secretary of the NFA.</P>

      <P>What is £100 million here or there anyhow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1957 it cost £105 million to run the country but now that it is costing £700 million it seems that £100 million here or there does not matter to Fianna Fáil, but £100 million can make a tremendous difference if it is put into productive channels.  At a meeting in Limerick Seán Healy advocated the proposal for the injection of £100 million into the agricultural bloodstream.  The agricultural industry is the foundation of the country's economy and if people on the land are prosperous the nation as a whole will be prosperous.  We all know there is a grave disparity between investment in agriculture and investment in industry. If investment in agriculture is left to the Government it is unlikely to exceed £10 million to £15 million in 1972 compared with £95 million to £100 million which it is reckoned will be invested in industry.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 1st December, 1971, Mr. Michael J. Walsh, agricultural adviser to the World Bank, is quoted in an article headed, &ldquo;Agriculture, Star of Investment&rdquo; as saying, and I quote:</P>
      <P>Irish agriculture was being starved of finance and an investment of £1,000 million was needed to enable the industry to develop its full potential, said Mr. Michael J. Walsh agricultural adviser to the World Bank when he delivered a paper to the 25th Annual Conference of the Irish Grasslands and Animal Production Association in Dublin last week-end.</P>
      <P>This is the type of programme an imaginative Minister and Government would be anxious to support especially when recommended by a World Bank adviser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is agreed by all that the present production from 12 million acres is disappointing.  We have almost 11 million acres of grassland, the best in the world, despite what may have been said in the past by people in the Parliamentary Secretary's party, and on that acreage we are carrying only <Col N="2032" /> 1.7 million cows, 200,000 heifers, 1.1 million beef cattle for sale and 2.8 million other cattle making a total of 5.8 million cattle.  If agriculture were properly financed and we had this injection; if we had a proper plan and programme, if the land were properly fertilised and limed and properly developed and the right lead given by the Government it is reckoned that we could have five million cows, one million heifers, one million culled cows and 3.5 million beef cattle of roughly ten hundredweight for sale each year. This would amount to an output of £1,490 million per year compared with the present output of about £470 million, both figures being adjusted to Common Market prices.  This would mean an increase of £1,020 million. According to the experts&mdash;I am no expert&mdash;this rate of expansion is well within the biological limits of livestock population growth.  Our farmers could and would meet the challenge, given proper leadership and back-up services.</P>
    <P>In this article Mr. Walsh also stated, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of December 1st:</P>
    <P>172,000 farm workers would be needed to produce this level of output; 100,000 of those would be employed on dairy farms, 43,750 on beef farms, 3,000 on sow farms, 3,000 on pig-fattening farms, 13,000 on tillage farms and 10,000 on contract work.  This however did not include those employed on poultry farms, in intensive horticulture, bee keeping and mountain grazing.</P>
    <P>There is a great plan and we may ask what are the Government doing about it.  This is the type of programme in which the Government should now be involved in order to prepare farmers and all working on the land to reap the full benefit of our entry to EEC.</P>
    <P>If this money were obtained from the World Bank no doubt there would be accusations of feather-bedding and coddling the farmers but it is the Government's duty to mould public opinion and to head off such ill-informed statements which would help to bedevil an already widely misunderstood situation.  In the past the situation was misunderstood because of the Government's own desire when for <Col N="2033" /> political reasons the Parliamentary Secretary's friends were using the jack-boot on the farmers and dividing the farmers from the city-dwellers in order to gain votes.  It is our duty to get across the message that agriculture needs a huge injection of capital to make it more efficient and competitive in the EEC.  From that injection the majority of those who do not work on the land but who live in cities and towns would benefit.  If Irish farming is to be developed on the lines and the scale necessary to ensure realisation of its potential in the enlarged EEC the expenditure of the money needed for that development will mean, as the article said, the provision of more employment and the generation of more money in non-farming areas.</P>
    <P>We are all interested in providing full employment in our own country and therefore we should all be interested in this project.  If we get the £1,000 million or £100 million over ten years, as has been advocated by Mr. Walsh, agriculture will have to purchase much new equipment such as bulk milk carriers, tankers, trucks, jeeps, tractors, silage harvesters, silos, milking parlours and other farm buildings, drainage equipment, fertilisers, creamery equipment, pig houses, paint, medicines, feeding stuffs and compounds. It will need educational facilities, electrical installations, water supplies, the building of new houses, servicing of roads and many other things with a high employment content for non-farm workers in factories, workshops, crafts, the manual labour sectors and so on.  Not alone will the farmers benefit but the whole nation can benefit if the Government have the courage to produce a long-term programme for agriculture.</P>
    <P>In addition, servicing industries, large and small businesses in cities, towns and villages would benefit enormously by such an injection resulting in expanded employment for people in many categories.  Any expansion or development in agriculture almost automatically expands employment in factories and sectors concerned with processing agricultural produce such as creameries, powdered milk and chocolate crumb factories, and factories handling beet sugar, vegetables, <Col N="2034" /> cheese, animal foods, meat, pork and bacon.  All those represent activities accounting for thousands of workers and, with a proper capital injection, thousands more could be employed. Other areas would also benefit.  Therefore, it is vitally important that the Government should as quickly as possible formulate a plan, get the money and get everybody concerned in farm organisations to give full co-operation so as to get this valuable programme under way.</P>
    <P>There is widespread recognition that a vast amount of research needs to be carried out with regard to many aspects of Irish agriculture.  It is essential that this research be co-ordinated in order to avoid duplication and to ensure that the resources devoted to it contribute fully to achieving a long-term development plan for agriculture.  At the moment, An Foras Talúntais, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the universities carry out work that comes under the heading of agricultural research.  We should give overall responsibility for this work to An Foras Talúntais and we should transfer to them such operations of the Department as come within this sector.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are committed to membership to the EEC at the earliest possible date.  The value of membership for Irish agriculture will be tremendous. The agricultural policy of the EEC aims at securing for farmers economic prices for their produce.  These prices are obtained not by subsidies from the Exchequer but by maintaining market prices at a level sufficiently high to eliminate the needs for subsidies.  This would mean that for the first time the British consumers would be obliged to pay the full value for our agricultural exports.  However, if we are to benefit fully from membership of the EEC we must begin now to design our own policy with EEC price levels and systems in mind.  Unfortunately, valuable time has been lost because of the in-fighting that has taken place within Fianna Fáil in the last year and also the fighting that took place between the previous Minister for Agriculture and the farmers' organisations.</P>
    <P>The total amount of money available at the moment for direct subsidisation <Col N="2035" /> or support of agricultural prices is limited severely.  Therefore, it is essential that this limited sum be deployed to the best advantage, namely to give maximum incomes to farmers receiving the minimum amount of subsidy.  In turn, this requires that the money be used to support those projects that offer the best future in Irish conditions.  It is essential that the Government policy on agricultural prices be closely related to the long-term development plan which I have outlined.  The Government have no such plan and this is to be regretted.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the farmers are the best source of guidance for the Government in determining how the funds available can be best used to benefit our farmers.  The Government should take immediate steps to establish a national agricultural council to advise them on national policy with regard to agriculture.  This council could match the National Industrial Economic Council which was established under the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> to advise the Government on industrial policy.  That programme envisaged that agriculture should have the same opportunities and consultations on national policy as industry.  However, the Government have failed to set up this council.  The NFA and the various farmers' organisations are prepared to co-operate and they have said so on numerous occasions.  I cannot understand why the Government will not set up a national agricultural council.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask why this council has not been established and why the Government are not prepared to co-operate in this matter with the farmers' organisations.  The latter have done valuable work during the years and their advice should be sought.  If the Government considered it necessary to set up an industrial council, what is wrong with co-operating with our principal agricultural organisations regarding agriculture, which is our main industry.  I am not casting aspersions on officials of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, but the farmers who are living on the land know more about agriculture and the <Col N="2036" /> plight of that industry than anybody else in the country.  The farmers' organisations can give the Minister valuable advice on how to take agriculture out of the doldrums.</P>
    <P>Recently I asked the Minister for Agriculture about the number of times he has had discussions with the NFA, the number of occasions on which officials of his Department received the NFA in the last three years, and whether it was his intention to set up an agricultural council, on which farmers' organisations would have a majority, in order to advise the Minister and his Department.  The Minister stated that he had discussions with the NFA on 18 occasions since he became Minister and that his officials had discussions with the NFA at 29 separate meetings in the past three years.  The Minister stated that the Government's position with regard to consultations with farmers' organisations was explained by his predecessor when he replied to a question on 5th February, 1970.  The Minister further stated that the Government were prepared to consider any proposals which these organisations might wish to put forward for the establishment of effective consultative machinery.</P>
    <P>This is not the kind of answer that should be given by a Government supposedly in earnest about helping agriculture.  The Ministers are paid substantially and it is their duty to give a lead and to say that they are prepared to put the same trust in farmers as they do in industry.  The Government should state that they are prepared to set up an agricultural council immediately and to give the majority voice to the farmers.  The Government have been standing idly by for too long; it is time for them to establish this council and put it into operation immediately.  No time should be lost in setting up this council.  There is no use talking about it for two, three, four or five years.  In 1965 in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> it was stated that this council was to be set up.  That was almost seven years ago.  On 5th February, 1970, the Minister told me it was intended to set it up.  So far nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2037" /> The terms of reference of this national agricultural council should be to advise the Government on agricultural marketing, planning, programming and policy.  In addition we should set up more marketing boards where they are needed for our main agricultural commodities.  Those boards should be controlled by representatives of the farming organisations, or at least they should have a majority say on them. Boards without authority are of very little use.  In line with practice in other countries, these boards should be given responsibility for marketing our agricultural produce.  Above all, they should have power to establish standards and grades for what we are producing and selling at home and abroad.  They should also be given power to enforce them.</P>
    <P>Unscrupulous get-rich-quick merchants have given our agricultural experts and our agricultural produce a bad name in the past.  Boards had not got the authority to establish standards and they did not seem to have authority to take action against those unscrupulous people.  They should also have authority to impose conditions for limitation on exports of the products for which they are responsible and, where necessary, they should engage directly in marketing.  They should go out to secure markets for those products for which they are responsible.  They should also represent the interests of this sector of the community to the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the evidence of continuing progress and prosperity in agriculture is a tribute to the skill and hard work of our farmers and reflects the soundness of the Government's policy in relation to agriculture. There is no sign of progress and prosperity in agriculture but I will refer to that later when I am dealing with the report on western farming.  When he said it reflects the soundness of the Government's policy in relation to agriculture the Minister was talking through his hat because we have had no Government policy on agriculture over the past ten years.  We have had nothing but switches and changes from milk to tillage and from tillage to milk and, when the farmers were in the milk <Col N="2038" /> industry, we had the introduction of the two-tier price system to try to stifle production, and then a change again to beef.  Two or three years ago there was a policy of arresting farmers and jailing them when they looked for their God-given rights.</P>
    <P>The year 1972 may be heavy with destiny for the people of this country. Political decisions taken next year in the referendum with regard to our entry into the EEC will decide our fate and perhaps the character of our people for generations to come.  The decisions of Belgium, France, Holland, West Germany, Italy and Luxembourg&mdash; those nations with a population of 180 million people approximately&mdash;to form the EEC in 1957 was of the greatest significance and affected not only the future economic and political development of the member countries but also their trading and economic relations with the other countries of Western Europe and the world at large.</P>
    <P>If we are successful in entering the EEC and become a member we will have access to a market of 250 million people.  In the EEC there is no room for slackers or for a lack of enterprise. There will be no easy-going or shilly-shally methods.  Neither will unfilled orders, irregular supplies or haphazard delivery be sufficient.  Unfortunately we have had that experience in the past. All concerned will want to wake up because that will not get us anywhere in the future.  Sentiment will play no part and neither will an out-dated and introspective nationalism.  Most responsible opinion is that there is a clear case for our participation in the EEC. Farm policy is the main interest of Ireland in going into Europe.  If the people on the land are wealthy the whole nation will be wealthy.</P>
    <P>We have 12 million acres of fertile arable soil.  We have a population of 2.8 million.  We have very little underground wealth such as coal, steel or ore&mdash;we have some which is being developed and all credit to those who are developing it&mdash;but, since we have very little such wealth, in the last analysis the standard of living of everybody depends upon what the farmer and his worker can get from the land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and export profitably abroad.  That statement has been quite true for the past 30 or 40 years and it is also quite true today. It has been recognised that if the farmers are wealthy&mdash;if the money comes in it will be spent&mdash;the rest of the nation will be reasonably wealthy also.</P>
      <P>We have been told that there are alternatives to entering the EEC.  I have listened to people spelling out those alternatives and I have read some of their articles.  I believe that no good case has been made so far for any alternative.  As I see it there is a choice for us between isolation with cattle, sheep, pigs, milk, butter, cheese which no country will buy from us at an economic price, and integration into the EEC where we will be cherished equally with the other countries and will be able to make our voice heard.</P>
      <P>While warning farmers against any premature optimism, as if a golden age were soon to dawn for Irish agriculture, I see no reason why Irish agriculture should not succeed.  If agriculture succeeds and prospers the whole nation will succeed and profit also.  Irish agriculture has always had to compete without protection for most agricultural produce on the British market against the countries of Europe and, indeed, the countries of the whole world.  The farmers, I think, need not fear.  They survived the economic war and many other wars.  While they may not have the technical skills and know-how that we would like them to have, and they may not be as well prepared as we would like them to be, at the same time they are skilled and they know their job reasonably well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They can produce more cheaply than most farmers in Europe.  They are not afraid of competition and, certainly, they are not afraid of hard work.  Our policy towards the Common Market is conditioned by our traditional trade ties with England which is our greatest market.  They take two-thirds of our exports while half of our imports come from them. No matter what may be said by those who are against our entering the Community, <Col N="2040" /> if Britain joins it is essential that we join also.  One of the provisions of the Rome Treaty is that each member country must erect a tariff wall against all non-member countries. The relevant tariffs are set out in list F of the Treaty.  These are 16 per cent on cattle and pigs, 20 per cent on carcase meat, 24 per cent on butter and up to 80 per cent on sugar.  It is imperative that before being asked to vote in the referendum, our farmers are fully aware of these facts.</P>
    <P>Our Government were right in applying for membership at the same time as Great Britain applied so that the negotiations can be conducted simultaneously in respect of both countries.  It is very likely now that Britain will be accepted, but if, for any reason, she should not join, we could not afford then to join either because if we were in and Britain were not, we would have to impose tariffs against Britain and this would result in their imposing tariffs on our agricultural produce.  We must remember what happened when, during the economic war, Britain imposed tariffs on our cattle.  There was a large increase in unemployment here and the standard of living of the Irish farmers was the lowest in the world.  It is recognised, even by Fianna Fáil, that free access to the British market is vital to our agricultural industry and to the nation as a whole.  Therefore, should Britain join and we stay out, the future for us would be very bleak and we could have a situation that would be worse than the economic war.</P>
    <P>I would not go along at all with those who say pessimistically that if we join the EEC, our farmers will be reduced to 36,000 in number.  If we have proper programming, proper planning and a proper investment of either £100 million or the £1,000 million that has been advocated by Mr. Walsh, not only should we be able to maintain those engaged on the land now but, as Mr. Walsh has pointed out, we should be able to create employment for the 70,000 who are now out of work.  The increase of between 40 and 47 per cent that we would get for our agricultural produce would benefit the entire nation.</P>
    <P>The western regional officer of the <Col N="2041" /> Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, Mr. John J. Scully, issued yesterday a report of a study he has conducted on the question of low farm incomes. For the purpose of this study the West of Ireland was regarded as embracing the 12 counties of Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Kerry, Leitrim, Roscommon, Longford, Mayo, Monaghan, Sligo, Galway and west Cork.  We are told that this is the low income region and comprises approximately half the total land area of the Republic and that it contains more than 60 per cent of all farms of five acres or more in the country. Anybody reading this report must agree that it is very depressing.  It tells us that the farm population is now typically an ageing one; that almost 56 per cent of the farmers are more than 60 years of age; that only 19 per cent of farmers are less than 40 years of age and that the greater proportion of elderly farmers operate farms of 30 acres or less.  It tells us also that approximately 35 per cent of the farmers are unmarried so that, in many cases, there is nobody to take over these farms.</P>
    <P>I agree that the counties not included in the survey are relatively better off than those 12 but, at the same time, the difference is not very great.  In relation to the educational status of farmers, the report tells us that more than 93 per cent of them terminate their education at primary level. That is something that each of us must be ashamed of.  In the competitive years that lie ahead, the farmers must have a good education so that they can become more efficient and are equipped to adopt technical skills and know-how.  Not only do we want to hold our own in the years ahead but we should aim at becoming the top agricultural nation in Europe.  That should be the aim of the present Minister and of the Government generally. It should be the aim also of the farmers' organisations.  We have the land and we have the people who are prepared to work that land but we must have a lead from the Government and we are not getting that lead at present.</P>
    <P>On the 17th February, 1971, I asked the Taoiseach how many people were <Col N="2042" /> employed on the land in the years 1956 and 1966 to 1970.  The figures were alarming and were as follows: 1956, 430,000; 1966, 333,500; 1967, 322,000; 1968, 313,000; 1969, 303,000 and in 1970, 291,000.  In other words, during the 14 year period, 1956 to 1970, 139,000 people were driven from the land.  If we could say that they had been put into jobs in this country there would be some sense or reason in it but unfortunately they were not.  The majority of them had to pack up, close the doors of their little homes, turn the keys and emigrate to England.  That is something of which we should all be ashamed and that is why we need a programme and an investment in the land of Ireland and in the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday, 17th February, 1971, I asked the Taoiseach the total numbers of farmers in this State in 1956, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969 and 1970.  I got the reply:</P>
    <P>The estimated number of farmers in the State which are available for census of population years only were 235,331 in 1951, 210,331 in 1961 and 200,625 in 1966.  The last census of population was taken in 1966.</P>
    <P>Therefore, during that term also we had 34,706 fewer farmers in the State. We talk about cherishing all our children equally.  The Minister must admit that the farmers for a number of years have been crushed by increasing rates and increasing overhead expenses and they have not got corresponding price increases with the result that they have had to leave the land.</P>
    <P>I pointed out last night that in reply to another question I asked in the Dáil earlier in the year I was informed that farmers represented 27 per cent of the people of this country, that they were responsible directly or indirectly for 75 per cent of our exports but that they were only getting 17.5 per cent of the national income.  Surely the Minister must hang his head in shame when he realises the 27 per cent of our primary producers are only getting 17 per cent of the national income, and those are the people who are creating the wealth while the non-productive sections of our community are getting a far larger <Col N="2043" /> share.  The farmers are not looking for a far larger share but they are certainly looking for their just demands. They have not got them in the past. They will not be content with what has happened to them in the past.</P>
    <P>Over 10,000 people a year are leaving the land.  These tend to be the young, the ambitious and those who are least likely to accept low living standards and limited opportunities but who, at the same time, have most to contribute to the building up of a healthy rural community.  They are the cream of our society.  They are the people we can ill afford to lose.  I agree that many of our farms are so small and so infertile that no conceivable level of commodity prices would provide potential owners in the 1970s with an acceptable standard of living. I certainly believe that to be true in the case of farms of under 20 or 25 acres.</P>
    <P>I think the ideal of everyone in this House has always been that the vigorous rural family has always been the basis of our community.  This can only continue to be the case if the rural community can provide a family with an acceptable standard of living and adequate outlets for its talents and ambitions.  The conclusion is inescapable. A major reorganisation of the structure of Irish agriculture is necessary to ensure this and to reverse the present unhealthy trend towards the elimination of the farm family. Whether the Minister admits it or not, that is what is happening at present, and that is what will continue to happen, unless the Government change their policy, provide the plan I mentioned earlier and put an injection into agriculture.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Cunningham who questioned me last night about there being fewer people on the land in Europe.  We admit that.  That has happened, but in Europe, when they left the land, they got employment in industry, the vast majority of them in their own countries.  That did not happen here.  Since this Government came to power over 1,250,000 people have had to emigrate.  Our total work force has declined from 1,228,000 in 1946 to <Col N="2044" /> 1,055,000 at present.  Those are figures given to me by the Taoiseach and they cannot be denied.  We have 173,000 fewer people at work today than in 1946.  The people driven out of agriculture, the youth, the cream of our country, instead of getting employment in industry have had to emigrate to England and have helped to build up England when they should have been trying to build up our own country. Almost 40 per cent of those born here since the State was established have emigrated permanently.  That is something that every Minister and every Government should be ashamed of.  I think Ireland is the only country in the world with a declining population.  To be fair, it has increased over the past five years but very little.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>It also increased from 1946 to 1951.  Those are the only two terms in the last 100 years in which it has increased.  Our population has dropped by 6 per cent in the 50 years since we got native government while the population of the world has increased by 85 per cent.  This is a disgrace in an agricultural country where we have 12 million acres of land and only 2.8 million people, that is five acres of land for every person in the country.  That is because of bad Government and inefficient handling of our major industry.  Despite all the promises of the politicians of the past our population has decreased by 6 per cent.  It is a most disturbing fact that of our population the group aged 20 to 45 has declined more rapidly in the past 50 years than in the preceding 50 years and it has declined more in the past 20 years than any time since the famine.</P>
      <P>If anybody contradicts that I can give the figures.  As the survey pointed out the population structure in agriculture as a result of emigration is heavily loaded with young and old people.  Out of every 1,000 people in agriculture there are only about 350 aged between 20 and 65 years.  Those are alarming figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is due to the neglect by the Government, the Minister and past Ministers of our principal industry.  It is true to say that all parties in this <Col N="2045" /> House stand for the maximum number of farmers living on the land and earning thereon as good a living as is enjoyed by other sections of the community.  We want for our principal producers parity with the urban sections. As I have already pointed out, ten years ago there was a gap of £3 per week between the incomes of those engaged on the land and of those engaged in industry.  That gap is now almost £7 per week, which is unfair to those living on the land.</P>
    <P>In no other aspect of national life is a clear statement of long-term Government policy more urgently needed than in respect of agriculture.  Failure by successive Fianna Fáil Governments and successive Fianna Fáil Ministers to formulate a long-term plan for Irish agriculture has, more than any other single factor, been responsible for the failure to deal adequately with the nation's chronic social and economic problems and to arrest the social and economic disintegration of large areas of the country, especially large areas of the west.  If there had been proper regional policy and proper planning over the years we would not be in the plight we are in today.  This has been pointed out on numerous occasions to the present Government.  They refused to take action, for some reason that I cannot understand.  It has been pointed out by this party, by members of the Labour Party and, indeed, by members of the Fianna Fáil Party that they were not satisfied with the agricultural policy and they suggested that a bold and imaginative agricultural policy required to be implemented but the Government&mdash;for political reasons which I would be ruled out of order for mentioning&mdash;have stood idly by for the past couple of years, have been wrangling among themselves, and our major industry has been allowed to get into the position it is in today.</P>
    <P>The world is changing rapidly.  Old ways are giving place to new.  The young people, especially farmers' sons, are not prepared to put up with the hardship that their parents endured. They are demanding new systems and change and they are entitled to that. The proposal to augment the incomes of small farmers by leaving them on <Col N="2046" /> their small farms and providing them with part-time employment in industry, tourism, forestry, is an excellent one but it is taking too long to get off the ground.  We have advocated this policy for years.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party policy document advocated it.  The Minister for Lands, Deputy Seán Flanagan, advocated it years ago and got a standing ovation at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  What has happened?  Why have the Government done nothing about that?  Why are they standing idly by?  It is two years since the Minister for Lands advocated this policy.  It is a good policy.  He was complimented by the newspapers and by various political parties who also had advocated that policy prior to that. So far, nothing has been done about it. No one in Government or in a Department directly involved in Government administration has the right to prevent change or to halt progress.  This was a proposal for change in the right direction.</P>

      <P>Progress has been halted.  He is responsible to this extent that the Minister for Lands claimed that it should be done by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. When we discuss agriculture we talk about the small farmer.  Any plan to keep him on the land and to provide him with outside employment is a good plan and it is the duty of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to argue in the Cabinet that this be done and to fight for it.  These farmers have lived all their lives on the land and are rearing their families and they are entitled to a fair deal.  If the land cannot provide them with an adequate living they should be provided with a few days work.  To that extent it would come within the ambit of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be the duty of any Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to get the best possible deal for those engaged in agriculture. The plan was worth studying.  It was a good plan proposed by another Minister.  The plan has fallen through. That is a pity.  Those who propose change should be listened to and their views should be given very careful consideration.  It is in the national interest that small farmers should be left on their holdings if they do not want to surrender them voluntarily and they should be given the opportunity to obtain outside part-time employment. This would benefit the farmers and also the nation.</P>
      <P>According to statistics published yesterday some persons engaged in agriculture are earning less than £400 per annum.  This certainly comes within the ambit of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  Many of these small farmers are little better than slaves; they are second-class citizens.  They deserve better and are entitled to more from the nation. Admittedly there is a huge problem facing the Minister.  In 1969, there were 353,000 farmers in Ireland.  There were 31,000 farmers in the province of Leinster with less than 30 acres of land; 31,000 in Munster with from five to 30 acres; and in Connacht, 49,000; and in Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan, 25,000.  Out of a total of 353,000 engaged in agriculture there are 136,725 who can be considered as being uneconomic holders who are earning, according to the statistics we received recently, less than £550 to £600 per annum.</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister must agree that something must be done to make those farms viable.  We appreciate that when we enter the EEC farm incomes will increase enormously and this will go a long way to making those small farms viable.  In the meantime many of those farmers are at destitution level.  While farm labourers are earning between £700 and £800 a year, many small farmers in the west are earning less than £400 a year.  They do not live like this by choice.  They have to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2048" /> Profits from a 50-acre farm have been proved to be between £500 and £600.  We can accept that when we enter EEC these incomes will increase by 47 per cent, giving the farmers incomes of between £750 and £800 a year.  If an Irish Government were to make this improvement in their standard of living it would take £100 million or an increase of 15 per cent in the turnover tax.  Even then, the incomes of people on 30-acre farms would still only keep them above destitution level.  That is the reason why earlier on&mdash;I was ruled out of order and I do not intend to pursue it &mdash;I advocated the provision of alternative employment for such farmers and that I urged the Government, in cases where farmers without dependants die, to acquire their land and give it to other farmers who would then become viable.</P>
    <P>Efforts like this must be made if we are to halt the flight from the land and to stem emigration.  Nobody who has been born and reared on the land wants to leave his home locality.  That is only natural.  If farmers were able to make incomes which would, in turn, enable them to pay proper wages to labourers there would be an immediate improvement in the population of rural areas.  As I have said, people would not leave to live among people in other countries if there was hope for them at home.</P>
    <P>In July last the Minister said that it had not been an easy year for the sheep industry.  He gave figures to show that there had been a slight increase in prices but he was telling only half the truth.  Prices for sheep were as good if not better 12 or 13 years ago.  Wool prices were 6s to 7s per pound 12 years ago and last year they were nearer to 2s.  Those engaged in the sheep rearing business have had a very hard time and I cannot understand how many of them remained in it.  The Minister introduced a subsidy scheme for hogget ewes and the figure should be increased further if we are to get back to anything like normal sheep numbers.  The Minister spoke of an increase of 76,000 and 84,000 in sheep numbers in a two year period. They are misleading figures and I <Col N="2049" /> suggest the Minister should get his officials to prepare real figures.  There has been a slight increase in the past two years but we have almost a million fewer sheep than we had six years ago.</P>
    <P>We have been told that cattle numbers have increased.  The Government claim credit for it but we must remember that we on this side of the House for many years have been stressing the great importance of the cattle trade but were cried down from the opposite side.  They cried down James Dillon when he spoke of the importance of the bullock, the grass and the cow. They now realise the importance of our cattle exports and they know that if we did not export we would die.  It would have been better if they had appreciated that 40 years ago when their preaching did so much harm to the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about Bord na gCapall which was established in 1970.  The Minister then pointed out its wide range of functions, including the establishment of a national equitation centre and the breeding and export of non-thoroughbred horses.  I wish to point out that, without any help from the Government, those engaged in the bloodstock industry have put the name of Ireland on the international map.  Our horses have won international fame in flat racing and jumping.  The people concerned with the industry, without any help from the Government, bought some of the finest sires in the world. We have sent horses to America where they have beaten the cream of the world.</P>
    <P>Our jumping teams in the past brought honour to the country.  I do not know what has happened in the past few years.  Is it that we have allowed our best horses to be sold?  We have been beaten by the English, the Italians and the Germans with horses bred in Ireland.  There are people who claim that we have as good horses here but that we have not got the training. I think it is a combination of the horses, the training, the skill devoted to training and the feeding of the horses that counts and I do hope that the setting up of this board will result <Col N="2050" /> in our regaining the position we held in the past.</P>
    <P>Our Army teams in the past were selected from the officers and I do not see why they should be confined to officers.  There are privates in the Army who are natural horsemen and who would make excellent jockeys and this field should be thrown wide open to the best.</P>

      <P>I think so.  He has set up this board for the training of horses which is responsible to the Minister, but I will leave it at that and obey your ruling, Sir.</P>
      <P>I dealt briefly last night with the dead meat trade and I do not propose to go into it any further, except to mention that in some of the papers this morning I was misquoted.  It is a £50 million trade and not, as stated, a £15 million trade, but I suppose the error was due to difficulty of hearing.  That £50 million trade, according to reports in the papers, may now be in jeopardy. It is claimed by these people that a number of their factories are on the verge of closure and the trade is experiencing its worst ever year, because of, as they say&mdash;I am not sure of this and the Minister will know more about it than I&mdash;present Government policy on exports.  They have made that claim and they sought an interview with the Minister.  I think he has met a deputation and has heard their claim that a large number of their skilled butchers may have to be paid off before Christmas unless there is a change of policy.  I hope there will be a change of policy in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to rates on agricultural land, the Minister, a couple of years ago, introduced a scheme providing that farms under £20 valuation would be derated.  That figure needs to be increased to at least £30 because many small farmers are being crippled by high rates, and especially farmers who have land from the Land Commission. Between the annuity and the rates, there is placed upon some of these people a burden of £10 to £15 a week, and small farmers with 30 and 40 acres of <Col N="2051" /> land and with small families are being crippled, and many are in dire hardship. The Government should take a new look at this whole problem because rates on agricultural land constitute a burden which many farmers, and especially small farmers, are unable to bear.</P>
    <P>With regard to cereals imports, I got the figures for the total imports for the past five years and I think it a pity that more encouragement is not given to the growing of these cereals here. We should not have to import cereals in an agricultural country, where we have the land, the farmers, the machinery and, I think, the mills to deal with them.  What is wrong I do not know, but I think that all encouragement possible should be given in this direction.</P>
    <P>I did intend to deal with the levy on wheat, but Deputy Foley dealt with it at length, and I would not have anything to add to what he said.</P>
    <P>With regard to agricultural exports, one thing should be remembered.  If we could increase&mdash;this is why it is so necessary and so important to have a huge injection of money into agriculture immediately&mdash;our agricultural exports by £100 million next year, we would have at least £90 million to £93 million net profit coming in.  It might be necessary to import materials to the extent of £7 million to £10 million in the form of fertilisers and machinery for the extra production, but we could have £93 million net profit coming in for every £100 million exported.  That is most important.  If we export £100 million worth of industrial goods, because we have to import the raw material, we would be lucky if we had £25 million to £35 million net profit.  We want to see our agricultural exports and our industrial exports going hand in hand because one is complementary to the other and one helps the other.</P>
    <P>The farmer is entitled to a fair return for his work and he is not getting it.  I believe that the principle of semi-parity with urban and industrial incomes must be accepted.  The farmers ask for no more and will be satisfied with no less. They helped to provide the luxuries in <Col N="2052" /> this country in the past and they will do with the necessaries no longer; this is all they were getting when they were providing the luxuries for other people.</P>
    <P>With regard to increased production, the Government and the Minister should realise that the bogey of the farmer in the past was that every time he increased production he was invariably met with falling prices.  This was due to the fact that the Government failed to plan&mdash;there was no proper stability.  It happened time after time with eggs, turkeys, fowl, sheep and even cattle, and certainly with milk. The farmer experienced this discouraging state of affairs so often in the past that he is now chary of producing more than he believes he can sell.  Matters will be different in the future when we are in the EEC and it is the duty of the Government to get that across to the farmers, for whom the bogey in the past was that if they increased production, the bottom fell out of the market. It should be got across to them that in the EEC we will have a market of 250 million people and that there will be a market for what they produce, no matter what they produce.</P>
    <P>This brake on Irish farming enterprise can and must be relaxed, and this should be pointed out to the farmer, that it is about to be relaxed, because we all want to get the full benefit of the agricultural potential which is there for each and every one of us in the EEC.  As I see it, in the EEC greater production will carry with it greater reward.  It is most important to get that across to the producers and the farmers.  On our success in getting this across to the farmers will depend whether the farmers can go forward hopefully or drop back into disillusionment. We do not want to see them falling back into disillusionment, and it is, therefore, the duty of the Government to get this propaganda across immediately. We must remember that our rivals, the Dutch, the Danes, the Scottish and the English, are not wasting any time.  They are improving their bulls, fat cattle, milch cows, sheep and pigs.</P>
    <P>I want to be quite fair to our officials in that regard.  They have done good work recently, but at the same time if <Col N="2053" /> we are to hold our own, we must be up and doing and not trailing behind anybody.  We must not waste, and cannot afford to waste, any time.  We should be out in front and we cannot afford to be lackadaisical in any respect because now, for the first time in our history, we have the markets and we can promise the farmers that when we are in the EEC there will be stability, with the fair and good prices for which they have been looking for so long.  We must aim at producing better livestock, livestock as good as that produced by our rivals, and we should aim at doing that in as short a time as possible.  I say too that the Minister, the Department and the farmers' organisations must be up and doing, must put their hands to the plough. They must go forward steadily and fearlessly because a great responsibility rests upon them in the future.</P>
    <P>We are facing this challenge of intense competition in this market.  The farmers can face up to it&mdash;it is their duty&mdash;but they are looking for the lead and unfortunately the lead has not been forthcoming from the Fianna Fáil Government up to now.  Fianna Fáil Ministers have deluded themselves by thinking that warning people to have restraint in present circumstances so that we can increase output is in some way a policy for increasing production. All the exhortations in the world will not increase production of exports if a wrongly-conceived policy is being administered.  The Government did not prepare for our opportunities in the EEC.  They had no proper programme. They had no plan for the future.  They took a gambler's chance that we would be admitted to the Common Market in 1963.  When that failed they had no alternative plan ready.  That is why we have chaos today.  We need hard work if Ireland is to prosper.  We need a lead from the top.  The farmers have been betrayed and have often become disillusioned in the past.  They cannot afford the kind of progress envisaged by Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil policies have been a failure.  There have been promises of some profits in the future. That is no use.  People cannot live on promises alone.  There is a future for us if the Government grasp it now.</P>
    <P>Our object should be to maintain as <Col N="2054" /> many people as possible on the land with an acceptable standard of living. We should try to expand the rural community.  An acceptable standard of living is one comparable to that enjoyed by workers in other occupations after making reasonable allowances for the non-monetary compensations in agriculture and for the extra burdens and responsibilities.  Farmers should have reasonable cash incomes.  Every farmer wants a reasonable cash income and is entitled to it.  Farmers should have outlets for their ambitions.  There should be specialisation and expansion. Enough has not been done.  Farmers must have the normal amenities of modern living such as utilities, communication, and proper housing.  They are also entitled to a satisfactory social environment.  Farmers have not got these things in rural Ireland today. Many of our villages are decaying because agriculture is not prospering as it should.</P>
    <P>Young people in the rural community are unlikely to accept farming as a career except in suitable circumstances. If the young do not make a career of farming agriculture cannot succeed.  The youth with their brains, ability, ideas and ideals are essential for future progress in agriculture.  This is quite evident from the migration pattern.  The young and the more enterprising leave and the old and the unambitious are left behind.  The attractions of other careers will increase, not diminish.  When we enter the EEC there will be attractions for the farmers.  It is the duty of the Government to explain that to the young people.  Modern farming is a highly challenging career.  It requires average intelligence.  We have heard that 93 per cent of our farmers have received only primary education.  That is a disgrace.  Modern farming requires average intelligence, initiative, enthusiasm and commitment in order to achieve success.  People with those qualities will not accept farming as a career without an adequate return in income, opportunity and satisfaction.</P>
    <P>Realistic farming policy in the future must accept these facts.  If people are to remain on the land and <Col N="2055" /> be successful marketing security is essential.  Farmers must be assured of outlets for their products and minimum economic prices.  For the first time in our history we shall have that assurance on entry to the EEC.  It is the duty of the Government to explain that point and to arrange for an adequate injection of capital into agriculture so that the farmers can gain the maximum benefit.  If the farmers gain maximum benefit the whole nation will gain and we can provide our people with productive employment instead of allowing them to be exported to Britain with our cattle.  Success can only be achieved by long-term Government planning.  Farmers will have to adapt and an injection of £100 million is necessary.  A figure of £1,000 million was mentioned by the World Bank adviser as an investment in agriculture over the next ten years.  The Government can achieve great security by the use of the most sophisticated techniques for identifying the long-term opportunities for Irish farming.  It is obvious that beef, mutton and milk will be needed.  Very little forecasting is needed to show that there will be a market for these commodities when we enter the EEC.  There should be agricultural subsidies to encourage activities with the best prospects.  We have a year or two to prepare.  Many of our present subsidies will cease when we enter the EEC.  Farmers are always interested in long-term price guarantees and appropriate market price support mechanism.  They will have those guarantees and appropriate markets.  Planning will be possible for years ahead.</P>
    <P>The underlying problem of agriculture can only be solved by a bold and imaginative long-term development programme such as I mentioned earlier, by the injection of this huge sum of money and the drawing up of a proper programme by the Minister and his officials.  An essential starting point for such a programme must be a clear and unambiguous commitment by the Government and the nation as a whole to a full scale development of our agricultural industry.  I hope the Government now get down to this job.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2056" /> A large part of the farmer's discontent at present arises from the fact that no such commitment exists.  The nation is suffering because of this. Instead of a coherent, dynamic development plan we have a mixum-gatherum bag of services and subsidies given grudgingly like public assistance to the farmers.  They are sops thrown out to them.  Farmers are not interested in this.  They are interested in stability and the future of this country.  We have the farming community begging for a few pence out of the Budget each year and Ministers cynically doling it out. Their interest is concentrated more on its short-term vote-buying value than its contribution to the further development of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>We have had this on many occasions in the past.  When there is a general election in the offing they can give an extra couple of pence to farmers.  Now that there is a referendum in the offing they will give another few pence and will do something for the farmers. Some wit said if we had a general election or a couple of by-elections every year then the farmers might get something worthwhile from the Government. This is not what the farmers want.  They want a plan so that they can plan ahead.  Most farmers are hard working members of the community and they work much longer than a 40-hour week.  It is a seven day week from dawn to dusk for them and at the end of it the small farmer's wages are below what the lowest paid workers receive.  More than half the farmers, as I already pointed out, are only getting £600 to £650 a year.  If farmers were given technical assistance, adequate capital and fully organised markets there would be an enormous increase in output.  I am firmly convinced if farmers were given a lead, if they were given an attractive opportunity to participate in a long-term development programme for agriculture, they would respond to it with all the enthusiasm, energy and hard work that is necessary to develop what is our greatest national asset, the land.  In order to do this farmers must be given the same chance as those in industry.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out earlier, at least £92 <Col N="2057" /> million extra will be injected into industry this year but unless there is a change there will only be £10 million to £15 million injected into agriculture. No agricultural development plan can succeed without the enthusiasm, support and participation of farmers in the operating of that programme.  The time has come for the Minister to draw up a proper programme for our agricultural industry.  I believe the co-operation of all concerned in this industry is urgently needed.  This can be got if the Minister sets up a national agricultural advisory council immediately. The Minister should set up this council before Christmas in the interests of farmers as well as in his own interests.  Now is the time to move, tomorrow may be too late.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House too long because it has been delayed long enough already.  This debate is the most important debate before the House as a rule but it is especially so in the context of our EEC entry because agriculture will play a vital and important role as far as the Irish people are concerned. Deputy L'Estrange was right to stress the importance of investment in agriculture because, especially in the context of EEC membership, this form of investment will be the most productive form of investment and it will certainly be in the national interest to have all available money invested in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Capital investment in dairy farming resulting in increased production of high quality products will give better return for capital than most other forms of investment.  Current EEC prices for food items which we produce are approximately 60 per cent higher than the corresponding prices here.  Our farming potential of 10½ million acres of hay and pasture, plus feed and by-products available from the area under roots and green crops, is estimated by the experts at the National Dairy Research Centre at Moore Park as being 10,000,000 cows, that is a stock rate of one cow per acre.  Recent information from there suggests that this estimate is actually on the conservative side rather than being exaggerated.  If capital at <Col N="2058" /> attractive terms is made available we should be able to increase our present 1.7 million cows to 5,000,000 cows plus 3,000,000 beef cattle.  The total production from that agricultural industry at Common Market prices would be four times our present figure of £318 million.  The labour requirements on Irish farms for this projected level of output would be 170,000 people.  If output is not increased our agricultural industry will be able to support only 68,000 workers, that is 104,000 less than it could with proper investment.</P>
    <P>This has enormous economic and social consequences and it is something we should not ignore.  Rather, we should explore every avenue to ensure that this form of investment is made.  The extra investment needed to finance such a policy would be approximately £100 million annually for a ten year period.  This may sound a very large sum.  It is a pretty large figure but we must remember that the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture this year is over £105 million. Very few realise that investment in agriculture benefits not alone the farmer but the entire community because all living is based on the agricultural complex initially.  Increased agricultural production stimulates industrial activity in the production of the necessary machinery, fertilisers, feeding stuffs and so on, to say nothing of the food processing industry. With the elimination of the British farm subsidies for the fattening of stores our exports in future will be of processed meat rather than of store cattle.  We should now be gearing ourselves to meet this new trend because it will play a very important part in our future development.</P>
    <P>To reach the best possible decisions there will have to be greater investment in agricultural research and education. Such research and education will benefit the national economy in that it will provide the information necessary to enable legislators and others to identify the most efficient and effective means for framing policy.  The research workers at Moore Park have given a lead to Irish farmers.  They have shown clearly that stocking rates better than <Col N="2059" /> one cow per acre can be achieved.  The efficient production of high quality milk, as well as the development of new and improved food products, has also been demonstrated by the research workers at Moore Park.</P>
    <P>I should like a far greater exchange of information and ideas between the different food processing industries and our fruit scientists.  There is a complete lack of dialogue at the moment.  Both sides could benefit from dialogue.  If we want to establish markets in Europe we will have to find out now what the European consumer wants and keep up-to-date on changing tastes and preferences. If market research information is made available to these people, and they treat that research in the most scientific way they can, I believe we will be able to compete in the European market.  The Minister should set up immediately a marketing research agency for the food industry generally so that the increased production will be sold on the most profitable European markets.</P>
    <P>The most urgent need in the dairying industry is improved co-operative leadership, especially in the smaller societies.  There are far too many small manufacturing plants and the price of milk can vary by as much as one shilling per gallon between the best and the worst.  The lack of co-operation between the different co-ops is a national disgrace.  Why are co-operative leaders so divided?  Is it for the good of the milk producer or is it for selfish reasons of their own?  Why have they not presented a united front in the interests of the Irish farmer whom they should represent?  Why have foreign manufacturing concerns with different objectives sprung up all around the dairying industry?</P>
    <P>The Cork Marts have provided an outstanding example of what can be done by Irishmen.  This has been a very profitable scheme from the point of view of the Irish farmer.  The manager must take the maximum credit for setting up this tremendous organisation. He has shown the way clearly in which Irishmen can achieve their objectives and do the job just as well as anybody else if they go about it in the right way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2060" /> The so-called gentlemen's agreement between the co-ops under which a supplier may not deliver milk to a neighbouring co-op, even though that might mean an increase in income of up to £20 per cow, is, to say the least of it, unfair.  If the Fair Trade Commission examined the situation could they, I wonder, come to any other conclusion except that this is an unfair practice? To a small farmer with 50 cows this practice could mean the loss of £1,000 per annum in income.</P>
    <P>There should be an incentive for winter milk production so that expensive buildings and equipment will be kept in production all the year round.  This would mean keeping workers employed during the winter.  It would also alleviate the seasonal variation in the supply of milk with resultant difficulty in manufacturing certain milk products at certain times of the year.  I have on other occasions here raised the question of payment for milk on a fat-plus-protein basis.  It is a pity we cannot see our way to introducing this much more equitable system of payment.  A farmer is penalised for fat content when he sells his pigs.  He is paid for the fat content in his milk.  Nutritionally protein is more important than fat and consumers are becoming increasingly conscious of the nutritional quality of their food.</P>
    <P>I believe AI stations should progeny test for proteins as well as fat.  A new programme for breeding for milk with a higher protein content should start immediately.  There are enough automated methods available for a rapid estimation of both fat and protein content.</P>
    <P>Effective marketing of dairy products on the home market will have to be undertaken.  We are doing a very good job on the export market but we have neglected the home market to some extent.  Bord Bainne, with their experience and because of their success on the export market, is the obvious organisation to undertake this task.  It is hard to understand why our market has not been utilised to the fullest extent remembering that we have dumped dairy products at substantial loss to the Exchequer anywhere <Col N="2061" /> we could.  If a proper sales campaign were carried out and the products presented properly we could, I believe, sell much more of our dairy products at home.  As I say, Bord Bainne is the organisation to undertake this enterprise.  It is very important, too, that the home market should be used as a basis for research to find out what people want on the European market because tastes do not differ that much.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission hold a vast amount of land which for no apparent reason they are not making available to the agricultural industry.  They hold on to land for many years after its acquisition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very relevant in relation to our proposed entry to the EEC because land should be progressively farmed and the maximum benefits gained from the proper utilisation of this land.</P>
      <P>Unless we educate farmers about the benefits of entry into the EEC the tremendous opportunities being offered to us will be negatived.  I do not agree with Deputy L'Estrange that our farmers feel betrayed and disillusioned. If one can judge from the price of land at the moment&mdash;Deputy Barry would be a good man to assess how land is going&mdash;farmers are prepared to pay a high price for land because they see a great future for agriculture and realise that they can most profitably invest their money in buying up available land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to urge the Minister and his Department to assist us in establishing a pork processing <Col N="2062" /> unit in west Cork.  It will give employment to 300 people; it will have contracts with farmers for the supply of pigs at definite prices and both workers and farmers will gain tremendously from this enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. I agree with Deputy Crowley that as we approach entry into the EEC the position of farming should be discussed. The Minister might differ with me about the best way to do this but over the past week certain plans and reports have been presented which are well worthy of study.  The first report I should like to mention is one which has become known as the Maher plan. The Minister must take serious note of it.  I am sure the Minister has studied it and seen the good and bad points in it but I want to impress on him that there is a very important suggestion contained in this plan and we should take cognisance of it when discussing the Agricultural Estimate.  I do not know if the Minister will agree that £200 million can be found to inject into agriculture in order to prepare us for entry to the EEC and likewise I do not know if it will be possible to find a small proportion of that annually to inject into agriculture but the plain fact is that unless and until this is done our agricultural industry will not be able to gear itself for EEC conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the referendum which will take place in either March or April the people will be asked whether or not they want to go into Europe and they will be required to answer, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Unless we present a better case from this House, I am afraid we could easily find the people saying, &ldquo;No&rdquo;. That would be a wrong decision and for that reason I want to impress on the Minister how important it is for him and his Department to convince the farmers that things will not be as bad for them as Dr. Mansholt has led them to believe.  The small farmers are fearful of our entry into the EEC but unless it can be got across to them that things will not be as bad as they now believe they will be I fear they will say &ldquo;No&rdquo; on referendum day.  In my view it would be disastrous for the country if the people did say &ldquo;No&rdquo; despite the fact that Britain will enter.  I want <Col N="2063" /> to exhort people to think deeply about the pros and cons of entry.  If the Government want to convince people of the benefits to be derived from entry to the EEC, they must present their case in a clearer and more concise way in order that people can make up their minds beforehand.</P>
    <P>I know something about the value and the price of land and about the letting of land.  As one who is dealing with the letting of land, I want to issue this warning to the Minister.  From my experience so far this year I can say that the letting value of land for grain and tillage will be considerably reduced. I leave it to the Minister and his Department to decide whether this is a good or a bad thing.  Farmers have found it is not profitable to grow wheat and barley.  Unless the price of barley is raised considerably this year barley will not be grown and this will mean that the feeding material will not be there when we need it later in 1972.  It is obvious to me as someone who knows something about the letting of land and the general demand for it and the way it works that there is a big change here.  I am fearful of the results in that our grain acreage and feeding from grain would be considerably reduced this year.</P>
    <P>I stood up only to make the point particularly in regard to the plan produced last week by the NFA.  Whether it be called the Maher Plan, the Healy Plan, the Crowley Plan or the Barry Plan makes no difference but it contains something vitally important to the agricultural community.  It needs study, but, in my view, there is much in it that is constructive not only for farm organisations and farming generally but for the country as a whole.  For that reason I ask the Minister to give it special consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> While I do not propose to delay the House very long I regard this Estimate as the most important one coming before the House and I consider that I would fail in my duty if I did not make my contribution on it.  Time was and, so far as some people are concerned, <Col N="2064" /> still is, when agriculture was regarded as an operation which goes on exclusively on farms, sowing, planting, reaping, rearing cattle, milking cows.  The kernel of the operation is carried on on the farm, but, in the age in which we live, we must apply a wider vision to the agricultural industry and regard it as extending from the input industries such as the fertiliser and foodstuff industries right through to the marketing operations which dispose of the products of agriculture and bring the farmer the reward he has so well earned.</P>
      <P>It is in regard to marketing in the context of our entry into Europe that I should like to speak.  We must now approach agriculture as if we were in Europe because, although a very clear case has not been made by the Government for entering EEC and although there is much uncertainty, doubt and even ignorance in the country as to what is involved, I believe the case is so overwhelmingly in favour of entering that the people will answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the Referendum and that we shall go into Europe.  But there is much work to be done by the Government in presenting clearly the case for entering.  I take this opportunity of warning the Government again that unless they make that case absolutely clear there is a danger, as Deputy Barry said, that the people, through ignorance, will not know where they stand and might stay away from the polls or decide to preserve the <i>status quo.</i>  I and my party think that would be disastrous for the country and particularly for the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we go into Europe we shall have a market, estimated at 250 million, available to our agricultural community and our farmers but it will be up to us to get our share of that vast market for all our agricultural commodities. Recently, I heard a discussion on horticulture and I got the impression from people who know the facts that marketing in horticulture is pretty bad.  As a result, I made further inquiries and I find there is much to be desired in our marketing systems in general in the field of agriculture.  That brought my mind back to my first years in this building in the early '60s when <Col N="2065" /> there was a discussion on agriculture. The late Dr. Ryan, who was then Minister for Finance, said that everything seemed to go well with agriculture all the way until we came to marketing and that everything then seemed to break down.  I think that is a fair synopsis of his statement which can be found either on the records of this House or of Seanad Éireann about ten years ago.</P>
    <P>We knew that to be the position then and I fear we have not done as much in the past ten years towards improving and perfecting our marketing machinery as we should have done.  I remember distinctly that, at that time, a sum of £250,000, which was regarded as sizeable then, was provided to find markets abroad.  I remember question after question being asked and the Government being prodded as to how much was being spent and, speaking from memory, I think the records will show that £250,000 was never spent.  In the language of the Tánaiste only a nugatory amount of it was spent.</P>
    <P>Not much is gained by going back and blaming the Government for not having done more about our marketing system.  I heard somebody else say not very long ago that we had only one year left to get ready for Europe.  That is a shocking indictment of the Government if there is a good deal to be done in that year, and it appears there is.  I say that because entry into Europe has not been sprung upon us; it is something with which we have lived for the past ten years.</P>
    <P>It cannot be denied that the Minister's predecessors and the former leader of Fianna Fáil, the late Seán Lemass, expected that Ireland would have been in the EEC on 1st January, 1964, and we were proceeding accordingly. Now if we are not ready to go into Europe because our farmers have not the necessary technical knowledge, because we have not the kind of cattle or pigs that will be required, or because our marketing system is not as effective as it should be, it is a shocking indictment of the Government. They have had control of the country for a considerable number of years; <Col N="2066" /> they have been negotiating our entry into Europe for the past ten years, but during that time they have had a stop/go policy with regard to agriculture.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Government placed considerable emphasis on milk production.  Farmers were encouraged to go into this sector of the industry and the taxpayers subsidised them to do this.  After a comparatively short time there was a complete change of policy; the farmers were encouraged to go into beef production and, again, the taxpayers subsidised them.  It appears that now the emphasis is being placed on milk production and it may be that it was not wise to have encouraged farmers to get out of this industry. It is unfortunate that we have had this uncertainty in agriculture during ten most important years.  They were vital years because during this time we were planning to get into Europe but we had no consistent policy with regard to agriculture.  In addition, during the past five or six years we have had four different Ministers in this important ministry.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to use his influence with the Government to get them to deal adequately with agriculture.  For the five years immediately after our entry into Europe we will be depending to a major extent on the success of our farmers in that vast market.  We may gear our industries as best we can to cope with competition in Europe; if there are redundancies in industry I hope that the affected concerns will be replaced by other industries and that industrialists from outside the Common Market may come here to establish industries to compete in the Common Market.  However, this will take some considerable time.</P>
    <P>The readymade product we have to sell is agriculture.  We have been told that we have one year before entry. A crash programme should be commenced so that we can cushion this country against the shock of entry. Although I am in favour of entry into Europe, I have no doubt that such a violent change will produce a considerable shock.  The people will depend on the Minister to ensure that in the years <Col N="2067" /> immediately after entry their livelihood will be maintained and they will get a satisfactory return for their efforts.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate that we have one very valuable raw material, namely our grass, which is of better quality than in any Common Market country. We should utilise this valuable asset to the maximum extent.  Perhaps a member of Fine Gael may be forgiven for paying tribute to the former Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Dillon.  He was ridiculed as a &ldquo;Minister for Grass&rdquo; but it appears that this commodity will be one of our greatest assets in Europe.  The Minister and those in charge of agriculture are shouldering a heavy responsibility because this country will rely to a major extent on agriculture in the early years of our entry into Europe.</P>
    <P>I represent the Cavan constituency and, naturally, I am concerned about milk.  I was disappointed about the abolition of the two-tier system.  A farmer who produces 7,000 gallons will get the same consideration as a farmer producing 70,000 gallons.  The farmers of Cavan and Monaghan are very disappointed about this decision. I realise that considerations about entry into Europe were taken into account in this matter but we will not be entering the EEC until January, 1973, at the earliest, and the two-tier system should continue in operation until we enter the Community.</P>
    <P>When State money is used to help any sector in agriculture, special consideration should be given to the small farmer.  When we enter Europe the two-tier system may not be possible and this is one of the arguments the anti-Common Market people will use with the small farmers.  The Minister will have to answer that argument.  I should like the Minister to let me know if I am correct in thinking that a form of regional farming or help is permissible within the structure of the Common Market.  If that is so, the country should be regionalised and a special case should be made for the small farmers.  I do not believe it is necessary to drive the small farmer off the land. I had been thinking on these lines myself before the Minister for Lands <Col N="2068" /> a couple of years ago advocated part-time farming.  Part-time farming is the ideal solution and I would urge the Minister to try to devise a system of regional farming under which the small man would get special consideration, in or out of the Common Market.  If that can be done within the framework of the Common Market, and if that is made clear to the small farmer, it will do much to restore his confidence and to abolish his fear of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>With regard to the price of milk I deplore the fact that the two-tier system has been abolished because this hits the small man and involves a loss to him compared with the big man. That is the type of fear that is being built up in the minds of small farmers.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I believe in giving credit where I consider credit is due.  When I speak about the Agricultural Credit Corporation I speak about it in relation to my own constituency. Their policy of lending the full cost of an adjoining farm to a purchaser in order to bring his own farm up to an economic standard is sound.  That policy has been operated by the Agricultural Credit Corporation over the past few years.  It is a much quicker way of bringing farms up to an economic size than doing it through the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Of necessity the Land Commission are a slow-moving body.  They take time to acquire land.  They hold it for a considerable time while looking around for suitable people to fit into a scheme.  Through no fault of their own, or perhaps through their own fault, they are a frustrating type of organisation because of delays.  I advise people every time to go to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, get a loan, buy the adjoining farm and bring up their farms to a more economic level.  So far as the small counties are concerned, the Agricultural Credit Corporation are doing a first-class job and I compliment them on it.</P>
    <P>I want to speak now about the farm improvements section of the Department. Grants in respect of certain buildings have not been increased for a considerable <Col N="2069" /> time.  I know they have been increased for some buildings and not for others.  The specific point I want to make in relation to this scheme affects my own constituency naturally.  Some farmers I know installed water in their farmyards up to two or three years ago.  They draw the water from a well in which the county council have some interest.  They do not own it.  They put a lid on it and built the walls inside it, or did something with it, and they claim to have a right over it.  Because they will not give something in the nature of a guarantee that water will always be available, the Department will not give the unfortunate farmers the grant.</P>
    <P>Why cannot the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Department of Local Government get together and solve this problem?  I raised it here in the House when Deputy Blaney was Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and he told me that my complaint was peculiar to County Cavan.  I told the people in Cavan that and they made inquiries from other counties and I was told it is Departmental policy that unless there is unqualified licence to take water from wells indefinitely grants are not given.  I appeal to the Minister, and through him to the officers of the Department who are dealing with this, to use a bit of common sense.  These grants are being held up in a couple of dozen cases at least in County Cavan.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that because very few people are using the well, bar a calamity of some description or another, within the foreseeable future there will be an adequate source of supply for the farmyards concerned. That should be enough.  Common sense should be used and, if an inspector comes down and has a look at the well and is satisfied that it will serve the farmyard for a goodly number of years, the grant should be paid.  I invite the Minister to check up on the number of schemes that are held up in County Cavan and to see to it that the grants are paid.  I feel very strongly about this. The people concerned have a genuine grievance.</P>
    <P>There are some complaints about <Col N="2070" /> delays in the second inspection under the beef cattle incentive scheme. Whether this is due to shortage of staff in the Department I do not know, but I do know that people are complaining that they cannot sell their stock because of undue delays in carrying out the second inspection.  The unit&mdash; and I understand that the unit is a cow and a calf&mdash;must be there at each of the two inspections.  Otherwise the grant will not be paid.  Some of the inspections are held up for a considerable time with the result that hardship is inflicted.  It is probably due to shortage of staff and, if so, the Minister should take the necessary steps.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should have made when I was talking about the farm improvements scheme.  I would ask the Minister to have some consideration given to the question of lanes leading to farms.  Perhaps this is more properly a matter for the Department of Local Government or for the county councils but at the moment they have a big backlog of work and, in any case, they deal only with lanes which serve a number of houses while the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries deal only with lanes which serve one house.  There should be flexibility so that there could be an alleviation of the hardship caused to farmers who live on these lanes.  I would suggest that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries would take care of a lane which, although it might serve only one residence, would serve two or three farms.  Also, the Department should give a grant in addition to the grant given by the Department of Local Government, for the improvement of these lanes and, thereby, make life a little more bearable for the people who must use them.  Although this matter is some what outside the scope of this Estimate, I mention it in an effort to get the Minister to widen the farm improvement scheme.  I do not think that legislation for this purpose would be necessary.  This problem is evident in particular in County Cavan and I should not be surprised if it manifests itself also in the Parliamentary Secretary's constituency.  I hope the Minister will make every effort to have these accommodation lanes improved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>When this debate was beginning, I mentioned that it was likely it would cover a wide area.  That has been the case.  The discussion ranged from the processing of pigs to the prospects for the farming community within the EEC.  It was interesting during the debate to not the sharp divergence of the opinions expressed by Deputies, especially Deputies on the benches opposite.</P>
      <P>I suppose it was inevitable that the substance of the debate concerned the imminent prospect of our entry to the EEC.  Although I said at the outset that there would be a more appropriate time for going into details in relation to the EEC, that is when the White Paper is available, the matter has been referred to in almost every contribution that we have had during the debate.  A lot of the comment was speculative.  Most of it was ill-informed while, at the same time, much of it was constructive.  Many Deputies would seem to be unaware that they were supplied with a booklet concerning Irish agriculture in the EEC.  This booklet, which was issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs, is in very concise and easily understood terms.  It sets out the main implications for our farm industry as that industry will be affected by membership of the EEC.  I am not suggesting that it is, by any means, an exhaustive or detailed work of research but it sketches in easily understood language the main considerations so far as agriculture is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the divergence of opinions from the benches opposite, Deputies L'Estrange, Fitzpatrick and others foresaw that the prospects for our farmers would be increased substantially by our joining the EEC. This might be contrasted with what Deputy Treacy said.  I think I am quoting him fairly accurately when I say that, when speaking of the Mansholt proposals, he describes these proposals as the death knell for our small farmers.  However, Deputy Treacy did not attempt to substantiate that statement in any way because, of course, this is not the case.  On the <Col N="2072" /> contrary, the prospects that entry to the EEC hold for us will prove to be a lifeline for many of our smaller farmers.</P>
    <P>Since the Mansholt recommendations were referred to almost continuously during the debate, it is no harm to consider some of them.  Of course the Council of Ministers in Brussels have not reached any final conclusion on the Mansholt proposals and until such time as they do, it is not certain how their decisions are likely to affect us. The basic aim of the Mansholt proposals is not in question.  Simply, it is to create the kind of structural conditions in agriculture whereby the incomes and living conditions of farmers would be comparable to those in other sectors of employment.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies spoke of what has come to be known as the flight from the land.  If they were not speaking in ignorance, they certainly were speaking in a condition of failure to recall the sort of living that many of our small farmers have had in past decades. Deputy L'Estrange was forthright enough in dealing with this question this morning when he said that there are large numbers of very small holdings that cannot provide for their owners an acceptable standard of living.  He said and, rightly so in my opinion, that the standards that had to be accepted in the past will not be accepted by the young people of today. Another factor in this structural question in agriculture is the age structure of our farming community and the fact that many of our farmers, as well as being rather elderly, are unmarried.</P>
    <P>This inevitably brings up the question of succession when such people pass on.  The use that this land could be put to is dealt with not only by Mansholt but also in the Scully Report which has just been published.  It is quite clear that there is no basic inconsistency whatever between the aims and objectives of Mansholt and those of our Government for structural reform. Indeed it can be said that the measures we have been taking here to create viable farm units, for example the small farm incentive bonus scheme, the land settlement operations operated <Col N="2073" /> by the Land Commission, and the special assistance given to western farmers are very much in line with the thinking in the Mansholt proposals.</P>
    <P>The Mansholt Plan itself, of course, has gone through several mutations in the three years since it was first enunciated. One of the most significant changes has been the departure from the idea that the viability of an individual farm could be determined by a particular acreage or size of farm or the number of cows.  As they now stand the only standard of viability in the Mansholt proposals is that the farm eventually would be made capable of providing a decent income for its occupier, comparable with that available in other occupations.  I do not think any sensible person would quarrel with that.  There may be, and I am sure there are, people who do not themselves live in the country, who have other lucrative means of getting a living, people who like to look upon farmers as quaint, picturesque people with a rather low standard of living. They have a nostalgic wish for this status of our farming people to continue. It is not my wish, nor is it the intention of the Government, that large numbers of our farmers should be maintained at this subsistence level of farming.  Every assistance that can be given to small farming units that have potential will be given to them.</P>
    <P>As they stand at present the Mansholt proposals envisage a selective system of aids directed towards the modernisation of what are called development farms.  These would be farms which could show a potential viability on the basis of a six-year farm development plan, somewhat in the same way as we operate our own small farms scheme. The form of aid envisaged for the most part is by way of interest rebate on borrowings.  One question which we are considering is the extent to which our capital grants system of aids may be regarded as an equivalent.  Once the basic principles of the Mansholt plan are agreed upon, member states, whether they be new or old, will be allowed a fair measure of discretion in the detailed implementation of their plans and in particular in the way in which they handle the financial aids <Col N="2074" /> to suit the different regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>The idea that the development farms be given priority in the allocation of land available from vacated farms and the proposal to offer older farmers a pension if they wish to give up farming, which are other basic features of the Mansholt approach to reform, are in conformity with our own practice and their extension should not give rise to any particular difficulty.  Any land becoming available that is needed for structural reform and the enlargement of small holdings can be pre-empted for that purpose and this requirement will take precedence over the demands for other purposes or any rights of foreigners.  Deputy Treacy was particularly anxious on this score and there is no basis for his anxiety.</P>
    <P>It is most important to note that it is fundamental to the Mansholt proposals that there is no element at all of compulsion in them.  Nobody will be forced to give up farming and no farmer, whether he is big or small, will be deprived of the benefits of the greatly improved prices which will follow our entry to the EEC.  We should remember that regional development policy is fundamental to the EEC approach and it will mean special assistance in the economic and industrial development of our rural areas.  It will facilitate part-time farming and also give the people the benefit of higher prices.  There are certain areas of our country at present where this can be seen working on, as it were, a pilot basis.  There are certain industrial areas with rural hinterlands where we can see before our eyes, working in practice, the engagement in industry of smallholders and at the same time, and parallel to it, the fact that they derive additional income for themselves from their smallholdings, they invest more in them because they are in a better position to do it and, most importantly, they continue to live on their own farms and in their own localities, in their own parishes.  For the maintenance of the structure of a rural community this is most important.</P>
    <P>The Mansholt proposals again provide that small but potentially viable farmers will get increased incentives to expand and modernise through the <Col N="2075" /> purchase or leasing of additional land, capital for development and various other assistance.  Also farmers who do not want to enter into a development programme can continue to benefit from the higher prices, or, if they wish, they can opt to sell their land for use in the enlargement programme of other holdings in return for a lump sum or an annual pension or possibly a combination of both.  In this connection I should like to take up a point that was raised specifically by Deputy Murphy.  This was his anxiety about the effects of assistance given on the social welfare status of farmers.  It is important to refer to this because it reflects a widespread misconception about the position of small farmers in relation to Common Market regulations.  I think he was afraid that small farmers who now get social welfare payments might lose them under Common Market regulations.  This is not so.  The Common Market agricultural policy is not concerned with social welfare payments.  It is concerned basically with giving farmers a better living, better prices and more efficient production.  The member States of the Community will be free to tailor their structural programmes to suit the requirements of their own farmers.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies talked about driving people off the land.  This is nonsense. The remarkable thing is that, in a couple of cases anyway, the contributors to the debate, who made this point about driving people from the land, at the same time maintained that our entry into Europe would have the most striking benefit for our farmers.  The two things are quite contrary to each other.  In any event, there is no question of driving anybody anywhere.  It should be plain to anybody who studies the basic proposals that our purpose is to maintain the greatest number of people on the land, giving them a decent standard of living and giving them also special means to attain it.  This talk about driving people off the land is just plain nonsense.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Community will put a great many small farmers, who, <Col N="2076" /> up to now, have not been able to make the grade in a much stronger position. They will be in a far better position than they have been up to now because of market limitations and the effects these limitations have had on the prices they got for their products. I got the impression from the debate that some Deputies regretted the passing of the tier price system for milk and that they felt that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries was vacillating in its price support policy.  Of course, this is not the case at all.  The abolition of the tier system does mean that larger producers are getting something extra but this does not imply in any way that medium and small producers, who are the vast bulk of our dairy producers, are not also benefiting and benefiting very substantially.</P>
    <P>The multi-tier system, as most Deputies who study these things know, was introduced at a time when it was pretty well impossible to sell dairy produce and subsidisation of the resultant export losses became an increasingly large burden on the Exchequer. At that stage the multi-tier system was introduced in an effort to direct some of our milk, not into the production of manufactured dairy products, but into the production of beef. It was complementary to the introduction of the beef cattle incentive scheme which was very successful and which has been taken up, from recollection, by 50,000 or 60,000 herd owners, and at the same time it is very significant that the drop in milk production was negligible.</P>
    <P>The criticism of the multi-tier system usually ignored the fact that in the 1970-71 milk year 84 per cent of all milk supplied to creameries fell within the first tier, the tier up to 10,000 gallons and, therefore, enjoyed the highest level of support.  In fact, the first two tiers, that is, from 0-10,000 gallons and from 10,000-30,000 gallons together accounted for 98.7 per cent of all milk supplied to creameries for manufacturing.  I was asked to speculate some months ago by some Deputy at Question Time as to what would be the likely out-turn of the creamery milk supply and I said it would be in the region of about 520 million <Col N="2077" /> gallons.  In fact, I was wrong.  It is in the neighbourhood of 530 million gallons. This is a record figure and well in advance of any year prior to the introduction of the multi-tier system.</P>
    <P>There is the additional fact that a good many milk suppliers&mdash;about one in seven I think; I am not certain&mdash; opted for the beef incentive scheme. Nevertheless, because of the very much improved conditions now existing in the world markets and the need there is for us to bring our milk support price arrangements more into conformity with the EEC regulations, the changes in our system of support for milk prices which started on 1st December of this year have brought the end of the multi-tier system.  It is not practicable to translate the measure of price support for creamery milk which prevailed under the old system into those which will affect prices in the new system.  The two new pence increase projected in average milk prices in 1972 is derived from an estimate of average milk prices expected to be paid by creameries to producers in the coming year with the average prices actually paid in 1970-71.  This is, broadly speaking the way it goes. The former price support system provided up to five new pence a gallon Exchequer milk price allowance plus one new penny a gallon quality milk allowance for milk up to a quality standard that is to say, a total of up to six new pence for quality milk.  The new arrangement provides 5p through the butter price and 2p through the skim milk support price, that is to say a total of 7p.  As compared with some 70 per cent of milk supplies that receive the quality 1p allowance in 1971, the full 1p will now be incorporated in the butter price covering all milk, an increase of 0.3p.  The scheme for quality milk will still be continued, of course.</P>
    <P>Added to that, the abolition of the tiering price allowance will have an overall average effect of about 0.2p. Bord Bainne were enabled to reduce their levy by 0.5p.  All these amount to 2p of an overall average increase in 1972 as compared with this year. The actual increase for any individual <Col N="2078" /> farmer, of course, has in the past depended on the efficiency of his creamery and his own efficiency and on the control exercised over costs and the pattern of distribution for both quality and creamery milk allowances which applied in his case under the old system.  It is natural to expect that big integrated plants with a capacity for producing a range of diversified products to meet extra demands as they arise and operating at low unit costs, will be able to pay, as they have been in the past, appreciably better prices than creameries operating on a small scale.</P>
    <P>This underlines again the pressing need for the co-operative movement especially to press ahead with the rationalisation of their organisation as rapidly as possible.  Deputy Creed identified this need for rationalisation and was very much in favour of it because, quite obviously, he is very familiar with it, seeing clearly the benefits derivable to farmers from its rapid implementation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crowley said to people in the co-operative movement that they should think very carefully whether their objectives were that the benefits of rationalisation should go to milk producers or whether they were motivated by some other reasons.  I do not want to comment on that except to repeat that uneconomic units will in the end mean that people who supply those units will have to take a smaller price than they need to for their products.</P>
    <P>I think I have made my attitude to the Dairy Disposal Company creameries clear on more than one occasion. The future of those creameries has always depended, and depends still, on the progress made by local suppliers' interests in developing a co-operative movement to a point where they will be able to take over the whole operation. As I said in my opening statement, no Minister or Department can push rationalisation on the co-operative movement because it is totally independent.  The people involved in it own their projects, but I should like to say that the Dairy Disposal Company are quite ready to fall in with any programme of rationalisation that <Col N="2079" /> is in any way reasonable, and I forecast considerable progress in this respect.</P>
    <P>The beef cattle incentive scheme was introduced to provide encouragement for the expansion of beef cattle herds. It was in recognition of the fact that, though market conditions in the dairying side of the cattle industry were very bad at the time of its introduction, it was still necessary for us to press on with the rapid expansion of our cattle herds and this was the reason for the beef cattle incentive scheme. It achieved its objectives.  The great majority of the participants in the scheme were not creamery milk suppliers but about one in seven were creamery milk producers who moved out of milk and into the beef cattle scheme.</P>
    <P>The dairy market will probably be much more attractive in EEC conditions than it has been, especially in the last couple of years, and I think it is reasonable to expect this to improve further because in the last couple of weeks the price of springers and cows has jumped very dramatically by up to £30 a head.  This indicates the confidence of dairy farmers in the future of the milk industry.  The removal of the tier system is partially associated with this.  What amounted to a restraint on the production of milk can now go because of the far brighter prospects we see before us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy inquired about a proposed milk processing plant in Tipperary town.  I understand the position about that is that in June, 1965, a proposal by a number of co-operative creameries in west Tipperary and east Limerick, in conjunction with the Dairy Disposal Company and a British milk processing company, to set up a cheese factory in Tipperary town was approved in principle for a licence by the Minister on condition that the local creamery structure would be appropriately rationalised. Subsequently the British concern withdrew from the proposal and it has not been proceeded with.  Since then, there has not been any concrete proposal for the setting up of a milk processing factory in the area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2080" /> I was asked by Deputy Creed and others about the position in regard to the sale of Dairy Disposal Company creameries at Coachford, Terelton and Tipperary.  Negotiations between the Dairy Disposal Company and Ballyclough for the transfer of the Coachford/Terelton creamery groups to the society have recently resulted in an agreement about the price and negotiations between the Dairy Disposal Company and Tipperary Co-op for the transfer of the company's Tipperary undertaking have also resulted in a price agreement.  In both cases, the necessary further arrangements to conclude the deals are in train.  I want to repeat that the Dairy Disposal Company are willing to co-operate in schemes of rationalisation and this will include the sale of units of co-operative groups as part of the rationalisation programme.</P>

      <P>A number of points were raised about the artificial insemination <Col N="2081" /> service which is being used at present by 61 per cent of our cow herd. It has been suggested that our technical efficiency in this matter is below the standard which it ought to attain.  This is not borne out by the relevant statistics, which show that the conception rate here compares very favourably with that of other countries in Europe or elsewhere.  The quality of bulls going to the AI stations is the best available, but this is not the only factor in improving milk yields, which can be radically increased by improvements in feeding, management and pasture husbandry, and by early calving, in addition to the use of high class AI bulls. AI will produce the highest quality beef animals, provided they are properly fed and managed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy and others referred to the prospects in the EEC for pig production. Pig production in the EEC is based on free competition, subject to the equalisation of the rules of the game, the conditions of competition, and especially the price of feed.  In the transition stage, the effective difference in feed prices between countries will be ironed out by charging compensatory payments.  At present the EEC Commission intervenes to moderate undue swings in the pig cycle.  As eligibility for special assistance in the EEC will depend, not on acreage but on competence and ability to reach certain income standards, there is no reason why small farmers in this country should not get into pig production on an efficient scale and benefit from the assistance and opportunities that will be available, in the same way as large numbers of them are expanding their pig production enterprises with assistance under the small farm incentive bonus scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Dr. Mansholt was here recently, he confirmed that pig prices in the EEC are quite significantly higher than they are here.  Against this, feed prices could probably be expected to increase.  There will be very useful export opportunities open to us, but to seize them will call for more efficiency at all levels, from production to marketing.  I think the question of the efficiency of our processing industry was raised and I will come to it <Col N="2082" /> later.  It should be plain to us all that if there is any bottleneck in the way of inefficiency anywhere along the line, it will react eventually against the primary producer and it is our business to eliminate in so far as we can any such bottlenecks and this means that the processing industry must be modernised as quickly as possible.  We have, as Deputies know, embarked upon a rationalisation scheme and as Deputy Creed said&mdash;I think I quote him verbatim&mdash;the producer pays for the inefficiency of the bacon industry. Conversely, if he is doing that it is part of his business to get the inefficiency out of the bacon industry in order to ensure that his benefit from his business will be better because it is the primary producer the Department are mainly concerned with.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell, if I heard him correctly, suggested that the bacon quota had not been filled in the past couple of years.  In the multilateral understanding on the supply of bacon to the United Kingdom market, Ireland's quota for each of the years 1969-70 and 1970-71 was 28,180 tons. While the official trade statistics show our exports to the United Kingdom were 28,073 tons in 1969-70 and 26,812 tons in 1970-71, the Pigs and Bacon Commission have stated that they supplied 28,154 tons in 1969-70 and 28,567 tons in 1970-71.  It is well to clarify the possible misunderstanding of the figures.  In the allocation of quotas for the current year, 1971-72 our quota was maintained at 28,180 tons.  All other countries exporting bacon to the United Kingdom suffered a reduction of last year's quotas, and the United Kingdom's home production has been increasing appreciably as a result of increased pig prices, pig price guarantees and increased support payments to the British bacon curers under the bacon industry stabilisation scheme.</P>
    <P>I made inquiries as a result of suggestions made by Deputies about the hogget ewe scheme and the suggestions made that this scheme was being abused by way of farmers selling hoggets for slaughter after they had drawn the subsidy.  The inspection <Col N="2083" /> period for subsidy is mid-July to the end of August.  This makes sure that in the vast majority of cases hogget ewes that qualify for subsidy will be retained for breeding, because a farmer intending to sell would sell earlier in the year when prices were higher. Evidence that hoggets are being retained for breeding is provided by the census figures which show that an increase of about 80,000 in the number of sheep occurred in each of the last two years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney spoke about the horse breeding industry.  It was suggested that there should be a greater incentive to encourage the breeding of Irish draught horses.  I attended a symposium recently about the horse industry where I heard people with an intimate knowledge of that trade expressing widely divergent opinions about it.  This problem has been assigned to Bord na gCapall as one of their statutory functions.  They give advice on breeding policy.  They have been considering the question of the breeding of the Irish draught horse.</P>
    <P>Deputy Malone referred to the allocation of herd numbers under a scheme of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  This matter was raised by way of Parliamentary Question on 1st July last.  I explained then that herd numbers are allocated for the purpose of assisting bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication. Numbers are given where herds are managed as independent units and where there is no danger of herds mixing with other herds.  Where these requirements are fulfilled there is no problem about giving separate herd numbers.  Legislation at present provides for the payment by the Department of the market value of cattle affected by brucellosis in the areas where the brucellosis eradication scheme is in operation.  The majority of herd owners who have had reactors have accepted the Department's valuation.  It is generally accepted that the Department played the game fairly in this regard.  Difficulty is experienced in places like County Meath by some dairy men where herds <Col N="2084" /> have been placed under restrictions for comparatively long periods.  I am reviewing the procedures in such cases with a view to alleviating the position of people in that predicament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bear that in mind.  Deputy Bruton spoke about the ceiling put on prices by the Department. This ceiling is reviewed from time to time in the light of market trends.  It only operates in the case of exceptionally good animals.  It does not affect the ordinary reactor.  The ceiling prices are generous.  Most people are satisfied with them.  It would not be wise as a matter of general policy to do what Deputy Bruton suggests and to take away the ceiling altogether because one of the considerations is that this would be very expensive.  Because of the importance of the brucellosis eradication scheme we cannot allow any loopholes through which the full effect of the drive against brucellosis would be dissipated in any way.  I am not suggesting that we want to economise on the compensation paid by the Department but it should be subject to the rather wide control which we have at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a real problem.  It has been suggested that the heifer vaccination scheme should be made compulsory.  I do not think this is desirable, but it would be feasible only if it applied to all heifers even those which it was never intended to use for breeding purposes.  I think it would be wasteful.  It does not recommend itself to me when I consider the most thrifty use that can be made of the moneys at our disposal for the eradication of brucellosis.  We rely on the good sense of the farmers to select the heifers which are suitable for breeding and to have them vaccinated. The fact that they are doing this is shown by the figures.  Over a quarter of a million heifers have been vaccinated in two and a half years since the scheme came into operation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright asked whether there would be some difficulty about the export of cattle, taking brucellosis into consideration.  The likelihood is that there will be a differentiation between animals for slaughter and animals for feeding.  There may have to be a preexport test on the cattle going for slaughter.</P>
      <P>One of our more knowledgable Deputies spoke about the incidence of liver fluke.  Most Deputies will be aware that there are several drugs on the market at the present time.  Some of them are very good for the treatment of liver fluke and are not subject to any statutory control.  It is a matter for the firms producing them to decide the channels through which they will be distributed.  The main consideration in regard to the treatment of liver fluke is that it be done at the right time and that the dosage rate for animals be the correct dosage because apart from its being wasteful, it could in certain circumstances be dangerous to animals as well.  However, I think most farmers are aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Foley spoke about the imports of inferior wheat offals.  Up to approximately 90,000 tons a year are authorised and they usually come from <Col N="2086" /> north or west Africa.  There have been reports of inferior quality material coming from these places.  Compounders now have the facility to import other material in substitution for wheat offals.  This has reduced the volume of bad, inferior quality materials.  In fact, over the past couple of years the price paid for wheat offals has reduced the incentive to import. The Department's inspectors keep a check on imports as far as they can. Some imports of pollard are necessary because of its high protein content and it is used, as Deputies know, in the preparation of pig rations.  The home-produced pollard is confined to compounding firms associated with flour mills; other compounders have to be facilitated as well.  Deputy Foley and Deputy Malone asked the perennial question about grain prices.  I know the need there is to announce the 1972 prices as soon as possible, and I hope to do it quite soon.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finn referred to the price of wool in recent years.  I think Deputy Finn and everybody else realises that the big factor in the fall in wool prices in recent years has been the impact of manmade fibres on the textile trade.  It is not a problem that is peculiar to this country.  It is also true to say that in recent weeks the price being paid for wool, while it is certainly nothing to shout about, was somewhat better than it had been, say, two or three months ago.  In my own case, if I may be permitted to mention it, I delayed, through negligence more than anything else, in selling my wool and I found that while the price was not wildly exciting, it was better than I expected.  I am not attempting to suggest, as has been mentioned here this morning, that there has been a decline in wool prices.  This is something we have got to live with.  If Deputies would look at the garments they are wearing at the present time they will find that the intrusion of synthetic fibres of one kind or another into this market has depressed the price of the natural product.</P>
    <P>Last April a register of wool buyers was set up under the Wool Marketing Act, and only registered buyers can now legally buy wool.  The principal requirement of registration is that a <Col N="2087" /> buyer must have premises that measure up to the standards laid down by the regulations.  Most of the buyers in Counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon who applied for registration were registered.  Where registration was refused it was principally because people had unsuitable premises or, as in one or two cases, no premises at all.</P>
    <P>In this regard, a premises used for the intake and grading of wool must have a minimum area of 750 square feet.  The regulations containing this requirement were made on the advice of An Chomhairle Olla.  Some buyers did not apply for registration at all. Most of these were small, sporadic operators and, as I said, a few of them had no premises of any kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Paddy Burke, Deputy Tully and others referred to the prospects for the tomato industry in the EEC.  The present quantitative controls on the import of tomatoes will have to go when this country enters the EEC.  It is expected that the present customs duties of 2½p per lb full and 1.67p per lb preferential, which apply to tomatoes imported during the period from 1st June to 31st October, will continue to operate but that the period of their application can be extended to cover the period from 1st April to 31st October.  These duties would, however, fall to be removed in five equal yearly instalments.</P>
    <P>The survey team on the glass house industry, as a result of whose report the glass house grant scheme was introduced, had as their terms of reference:</P>
    <P>To formulate measures of adjustment or adaptation to the conditions likely to be met with in international trade, especially if this country should become a member of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>The expansion of the industry has, therefore, been geared to face free trade conditions.  The industry has in fact been getting on well in the export trade and 3,900 tons of tomatoes got £806,000 in the UK this year as compared with 1,900 tons in 1968.  Much of our production is now concentrated in large units.  We should certainly be able to hold our own in the home and export market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2088" /> Deputy Tully complained that Irish producers were having difficulty in getting a reasonable price for their fruit and vegetables due to the importation of foreign goods.  I would like to tell him that import controls are operated in such a way as to ensure that home producers are given every opportunity of distributing their produce before the admission of bulk supplies from abroad.  I might add that the price being paid for apples this year is the highest for a number of years.  There has been little or no difficulty in disposing of marketable produce.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the problem at present being faced by Erin Foods and their producers. Naturally I am very concerned indeed about this reduction in the company contracts for 1972.  The whole situation is at present under examination jointly by the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies inquired about the prospects for beet growers in the EEC.  Our sugar quota in the EEC is at present being negotiated with the Community.  Needless to say we are trying to get the best possible quota we can for this country.  A meeting is being held in the Department of Agriculture today with representatives of the Sugar Company and the BVA to discuss the position. I do not think it would be appropriate for me to say anything further while the negotiations are in progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say anything about the prospects for soft fruits in the EEC and the possibility of control on importation of soft fruits which could increase as a result of our membership?  Is there any prospect for the soft fruit industry in the EEC?</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy would find no difficulty in getting around that.  Deputy Tully spoke about delays in jobs under the Land Project and Deputy Esmonde also had a question about this recently.  There has been a considerable increase in recent years in the amount of land drainage and reclamation work carried out by farmers with the assistance of the land project scheme.  There has been a considerable increase in the expenditure under those schemes as suggested by Deputy Flanagan last night.  Applications for grant-aided schemes under the project are dealt with strictly in the order they come in. There is some time lag between the time of reception of the application and the time of approval of the scheme.  I know there is a rather long delay in Wexford and one reason is that the number of applications is so great that we have had to take certain steps to reduce the waiting period.  It is a tribute to the industry and the resourcefulness of the farmers in that county that they avail of the scheme to such a remarkable degree.  We are trying to reduce the waiting period in this country as well as in other counties.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the less delay between the receipt of the application and the approval of the scheme the better but I ask the Deputy to recognise that the resources the land project have are limited and that they are at full stretch at the moment.  I do not think, taking all things into consideration, <Col N="2090" /> that there is any great need for anxiety except in certain counties where the demand is remarkably different from that in other places.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan expressed his satisfaction with the land project and listening to him last night I got the impression that he felt any kind of land should be available for grants under the land project scheme. There are very important considerations that have to be taken into account.  It would not, for instance, be very reasonable &mdash; in fact, it would be immoral &mdash; to spend large sums of money on draining extremely poor marginal land, particularly if one were conscious of the fact that the same amount of money might be spent to far greater advantage on land that was potentially productive.  Possibly I misunderstood Deputy Flanagan, but this is how I interpreted his line of thinking. As in many other fields, the end question for the Department is getting the best possible value one possibly can extract for the money invested.  If one drains land which will be relatively unproductive, or totally unproductive, that is a waste of money.  I do not think it would be justifiable to spend money on such unproductive lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell spoke about certain defects in the advisory services. We must do everything we can not only to maintain the effectiveness of these most important services but to improve them as quickly and as effectively as we can to fit ourselves to the rapidly changing circumstances in agriculture.  We are in a period of transition, as I said earlier, of a most revolutionary kind.  I think it was <Col N="2091" /> Deputy L'Estrange who referred to the educational status of some of our farmers.  He was either quoting from the Scully Report or quoting a commentary on that report.  What he said underlines the need there is to provide the best possible advisory services for our farmers, especially for those with the educational limitations under which some of us labour, through no fault of our own.</P>
    <P>In the last year two new agricultural colleges have been opened, one in Rockwell, Tipperary, and the other in Kildalton, Kilkenny.  This is a Department of Agriculture college which will specialise to some extent in horticulture. Its situation makes it particularly appropriate for use as a horticultural school.</P>
    <P>The ready availability of agricultural advisers to farmers is absolutely basic and essential.  The headquarters of the advisory service is decided by the county committee of agriculture, acting probably on the advice of the CAO.  Most advisers are within easy reach by telephone and, much more so than in former years, they are based locally and can easily be contacted. There is also close co-ordination between the local adviser, the linkman between the farmer and the advisory service, and the specialist advisers in the Department and An Foras Talúntais. Advisers can get in touch with An Foras Talúntais or the departmental specialists any time they want to. There are frequent and comprehensive seminars and courses held for advisers on all aspects of farming, especially farming practised in particular areas, and they have available to them the kind of specialised training they require. The work of the adviser in the west would, for instance, be quite different from that of an adviser in the dairying areas in the south or in the tillage areas of the east.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell and others very properly expressed dissatisfaction with temporary appointments.  I agree we should get away from these temporary appointments as quickly as possible. The committees can do a good deal and I think they are doing it.  To an increasing degree they are adopting the method of selection board for appointment. <Col N="2092" /> That is an improvement certainly on the old system of canvassing.  Everyone will agree we should get away from the latter system as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the official report an outline of the Community's preferential trade agreements with non-member countries together with a list of its non-preferential trade agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Community is opening negotiations for trade agreements with the EFTA countries which have not applied for membership, namely, Austria, Finland, Iceland, Portugal, Switzerland and Sweden.  Trade negotiations are currently in progress <Col N="2093" /> with Japan and the Community has decided to open negotiations also with Cyprus, Brazil and Uruguay.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Outline of the EEC's Preferential Trading Agreements with Non-Member Countries:</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Community's preferential trading agreements with non-member countries fall into two main groups.</P>
    <P> (a)  <i>Association agreements with developing African States:</i> The EEC Treaty provides for the association with the Community of the following non-European countries and territories having special relationships with member States:</P>
    <P>Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Congo-Kinshasa, Dahomey, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Somali, Togo, Upper Volta.</P>
    <P>Under the Convention providing for the association agreements, these countries have access duty free to the Community market for most industrial goods and extensive preferences for non-industrial products.  In return the countries concerned grant tariff reductions to imports from the member States of the Community.  There is provision also for financial aid from the Community to the African States. The current Convention (the Second Yaoundé Convention) expires on 31 January, 1975 and it is envisaged that it will be re-negotiated.  There is a similar Convention, the Arusha Convention, providing for association between the Community and Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.</P>
    <P>(b)  <i>Association Agreements or Trade Agreements with Mediterranean States:</i></P>
    <P> (1)  <i>Greece:</i> The association agreement between the Community and Greece is designed to achieve a customs union between the parties.  All Greek industrial goods will be November, 1974 be free of duties and quantitative restrictions on entry into the Community.  Community industrial goods will have access to Greece free of duty and quantitative restriction by 1984.  In the case of a limited number of industrial goods, Greece will give <Col N="2094" /> the Community duty-free access by the end of 1974.  There are also reciprocal tariff preferences in trade between the parties in certain agricultural products.</P>
    <P>(2)  <i>Israel:</i> Under the trade agreement with Israel which operates for five years from October, 1970, the Community is reducing by up to 50 per cent its duties on the majority of Israeli industrial goods and by 40 per cent its duties on Israeli citrus fruit. Israel is reducing by up to 30 per cent her duties on a wide range of Community goods.</P>
    <P>(3)  <i>Malta:</i> The Community's association agreement with Malta provides that Community duties on imports from Malta will be reduced by 70 per cent in 1976 and that quantitative restrictions on Maltese goods will be eliminated. Malta's duties on most Community goods will be reduced by 35 per cent over the period 1971 to 1975.</P>
    <P>(4)  <i>Morocco and Tunisia:</i> The association agreements with Morocco and Tunisia give most of the industrial goods of these countries access to the Community free of duty and quantitative restrictions, while a wide range of Community industrial goods and certain agricultural products have access duty free or at preferential rates to these countries.</P>
    <P>(5)  <i>Spain:</i> The preferential agreement between Spain and the Community, which runs from 1970 to 1976, provides that by 1973 most Spanish industrial goods will benefit from a 30 per cent to a 70 per cent reduction in Community duties while duties on citrus fruits will be reduced by 40 per cent.  Community industrial goods will by the end of 1976 enjoy tariff reductions ranging from 30 per cent to 70 per cent on importation into Spain. There are certain concessions for Community agricultural products entering Spain.</P>
    <P>(6)  <i>Turkey:</i> The association agreement with Turkey, which is designed to achieve a customs union in due course, provides that as from 1 September, 1971, all Turkish industrial products, with certain exceptions in the textile sectors, are free of duty and quantitative restrictions on importation into the Community.  Turkish duties <Col N="2095" /> and quantitative restrictions on Community goods are to be dismantled by 1986.  Turkish agricultural products will also benefit from tariff concessions. This agreement also provides for the grant of financial aid to Turkey. </P>

      <P>The decision to apply for membership was made in 1961 but negotiations broke down.  Our application was reactivated in 1967 and a renewed examination was carried out then and again 18 months ago.  Each time we have reactivated our application there has been a re-examination of the possibilities and options open.  The possibilities of any agreement would only become obvious after negotiating. A detailed announcement of what we could obtain would only be possible when negotiations were complete.  The impossibility of participating in the common agricultural policy was made quite clear to us by the Community <Col N="2098" /> so that any trade agreement which would allow free trade access to the Community would not give the farming community the benefits contained in the common agricultural policy.  We would not have any opportunity of participating in decision making on trade or other matters in the Community. These two considerations served to decide the Government that the national interest lay in membership.</P>

The Development Plan acknowledges that the port is to be the subject of detailed long-term plans to be prepared by the Port and Docks Board.

    <P>The proposals at present before my Department do not envisage any major transfer of machinery out of the Carlow plant.  The production of celery would, however, be rationalised and would be concentrated at Skibbereen and Glencolumbcille.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>On 6th December, the owner in question, accompanied by two other persons, called to the quarantine premises and requested admittance.  The veterinary officer in charge refused admittance to the group, but he indicated that he was prepared to have the horse they were interested in brought to the entrance gate so that it could be looked at from outside the quarantine premises. This compromise did not seem to be attractive to the owner at that time, but it was availed of by him later that day.</P>
      <P>I think it well that I should point out that the quarantining of imported animals is designed to protect this country against the introduction of serious animal diseases from abroad, and no right whatever can attach to owners to visit their animals in quarantine.  I must reserve full discretion to grant or refuse facilities in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>

Now we have a case where an owner was refused permission to see his horse in the company of two <Col N="2110" /> leading breeders from France.  In view of the fact that there was some controversy regarding the standard of the quarters made available for the horses, would the Minister state what insurance facilities were in force at the time, whether there was any neglect involved, and whether the insurance company would pay if anything happened to the horse?</P>

It is only the association agreements, excluding that with Malta, that can be regarded as providing for free trade.  These are the agreements made with (1) the Associated African and Malagasy States (2) the East African Community, (3) the countries known as the Community's &ldquo;Overseas Countries and Territories&rdquo;, (4) Greece, and (5) Turkey.  None of these agreements premanently excludes any industrial products from free trade with the Community.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Tuesday, 30th November, in which reference was made to a training camp said to be operated by an illegal organisation somewhere in the north-west of the country.  If so, I would point out that the article refers, in fact, to a farmhouse and does not at any point say or imply that the gardaí were aware that training activities were being carried on there.  On the contrary, the article makes the point that there was nothing externally to distinguish the house from other houses, and it furthermore itself adverts to the possibility that the use of that particular house in the way described was a special propaganda exercise designed to mislead the reporter rather than a regular occurrence.  On the other hand, I have at no time sought to deny that this kind of training activity does go on to some extent in the manner described, that is to say, indoors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have repeatedly stated that the instructions to the Garda Síochána&mdash;<Col N="2115" /> instructions which are constantly repeated and re-emphasised&mdash;are that all possible efforts within the limits of their resources are to be made to prevent illegal activity of this or any other similar kind.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the House is aware that the Government have gone to the extent of specially promoting legislation, which was passed by this House and by the Seanad virtually without a dissenting voice, whereby the maximum penalty for possession of military-type weapons was substantially increased.</P>

When I say in my reply that I have at no time sought to deny that this kind of training activity does go on to some extent in the manner described, I want to make it clear&mdash;and I have said this on a number of occasions in this House&mdash;that it goes on in very small groups, indoors, in an isolated house.  The gardaí are satisfied that on no occasion are there more than five or six people together and that this training, such as it is, lasts for a very short period.</P>

I cannot guarantee the accuracy of that figure. About a week or so ago a considerable number of raids were made by the Garda on houses in Border areas. Seven of these raids were successful in the sense that they produced military equipment of one kind or another.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan)</i> asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that due to the interference by his Department in the day to day running of the taxing masters' offices in the Four Courts without any consultation with the taxing masters, the work of these offices has been completely disrupted and is at a standstill with consequent inconvenience to the legal profession and general public; if he will take steps to ensure that proper provision is made for the smooth running of these offices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misinformed. The action taken in this matter was the taking-over of accommodation previously used by a taxingmaster because the accommodation was urgently needed for another purpose in the public interest, namely, the provision of a courtroom for the Circuit Court.  This in turn was necessary because an additional Circuit Court judge had to be appointed to help to reduce the serious arrears that had accumulated in the Dublin circuit, especially in criminal cases, with resulting unfairness to accused persons and damage to the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is asserted in the question that there was no consultation with the taxing masters.  A similar assertion was made in certain newspaper reports.  It is without foundation.  There were discussions with the taxing masters several weeks previously and further discussions some ten days before action was taken.  Efforts to secure agreement failed and clear and adequate notice was then given that the accommodation was needed and would have to be taken over.  The proposal was that the taxing master directly concerned, who as the person longer in office would have a choice, should move into the accommodation being occupied by the other taxing master and that the latter would move elsewhere.  It was only in relation to this latter accommodation that any question of suitability arose and then only in regard to its location and not its size or suitability in other respects.  Offers made to discuss alternatives to what was offered and to <Col N="2119" /> discuss the mechanics of a change-over were completely rejected.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that any court official has the right to remain on in a particular room which is urgently needed for an important public purpose especially when other accommodation, the suitability of which is not seriously at issue, is made available to him.  If the Government are to be held responsible for the provision of accommodation, they have a corresponding right&mdash;indeed, it is not so much a right as a duty to the tax-payer &mdash; to see that available accommodation is rearranged where that is reasonably possible and where it meets a serious public need.</P>
    <P>As regards the allegation that the work of the taxing master's office has been brought to a standstill, my information is that the work is now proceeding again.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is the Minister aware that the taxing masters, who are judicial or quasijudicial officials, and who are appointed by the Government and discharge their duties under the general supervision of the Chief Justice, were consulted on 9th November about the possibility of re-arranging their accommodation by a senior official of the Minister's Department, that no agreement was reached on that day, that the matter was left completely in mid-air and that nothing further was heard by these judicial officers until 22nd November when they reported for duty and the senior taxing master found his office crudely but permanently barricaded with timber nailed across the door?  On consulting the Chief Justice on that day they were instructed not to continue to discharge their duties until proper facilities were made available to them.  Will the Minister agree that there were no real consultations? If this is the type of consultation that goes on between officers of the Minister's Department and other bodies, including the Garda Síochána, it is no wonder that we have chaos in the Garda Síochána and in other bodies operating under the Minister's Department.</P>

He found a freshly painted arrow indicating to him and others that his accommodation had been changed.  Is this the kind of bureaucratic muscle-men treatment that the courts are to get from the Minister's Department?  Just because a senior civil servant did not get his way he apparently ordered a group of workmen to go in over the week-end and physically bar entrance to the court of the taxing master concerned, and physically remove his personal effects and chattels to another room.</P>

Recent developments have made it desirable to stress the onus on them to be particularly concerned about its success.</P>
      <P>It clearly would be unwise to assume that the Agreement is not going to come under serious pressure from time to time.  Moreover, there seems to be a tendency, especially in areas where basic pay claims are not currently being processed, to seek improvements in other conditions of employment. Improvements of this kind may seem easier to justify than straight pay increases but often result in greater increases in costs, especially in the longer term.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, necessary that public sector employers should continue to exercise constant vigilance in regard to pay and other conditions of employment and that they should try to be consistent in their approach to claims for improvement.  May I repeat that my Department and the Department of Labour will be only too willing to discuss any questions with you, if called upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to stress again that it is essential that all claims should be processed in the context of the Agreement and that the clauses of the Agreement dealing with special circumstances <Col N="2130" /> (especially clauses 6 and 7) should be restricted to exceptional cases.  It is essential that the Agreement be operated in the right spirit if its ultimate aim of substantially moderating inflationary pressures is to be realised.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to proposals which are received from time to time relating to special annual allowances, ex-gratia payments, expense allowances, etc. and to emphasise that restraint on the general remuneration front could be considerably undermined if a trend towards special payments such as these continues unabated.  It is, accordingly, desirable that, at a time like the present, local authorities should look very closely indeed at this question of such payments especially at the higher levels with a view to eliminating the submission of related proposals as far as possible.  Any suggestion even of laxity in this or other sensitive areas can do damage&mdash;out of all proportion to the money involved&mdash;to the cause of restraint. I know I can count on your co-operation here.</P>

    <P>Dear Manager</P>
    <P>The aims which the Employer-Labour Conference National Agreement sets itself, viz., a substantial moderation in the rate of increase of costs and prices, greater efficiency and industrial peace, go to the heart of our economic and social problems.</P>
    <P>I should therefore like to take this opportunity, while it is still, as it were, being &ldquo;run-in&rdquo;, to stress the importance which the Government attaches to the Agreement proving successful. This, of course, puts a specially heavy responsibility on public sector employers since representatives of State-sponsored bodies and of Local Authorities and the State in their capacity as employers have subscribed to the Agreement.  We must avoid any action which might endanger the <Col N="2131" /> Agreement by an unjustifiably lax interpretation of its clauses.  Such action would be all the more indefensible since the Agreement itself provides special machinery to handle questions of interpretation.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the kind of problem I have in mind, I might mention two specific areas of possible difficulty.  It would, for instance, be destructive of the purpose of the Agreement&mdash;and remove a whole category of claims from the strike restraint provisions&mdash; if employers were to take the view that some claims could be dealt with outside the Agreement.  The aim should be that all claims should be processed in the context of the Agreement&mdash; whether under its general pay clause or under clauses dealing with special cases.</P>
    <P>Again, the anomalies clause of the Agreement needs particularly cautious handling.  Unless it is restricted to exceptional cases, it also could defeat the purpose of the Agreement.  The Agreement provides for determination by the Labour Court of claims &ldquo;to remove genuine anomalies in pay between different groups of employees whose rates of pay in the past have been related&rdquo;.  In any significant cases of doubt it would be well to avail of this provision and so help to secure even interpretation in this difficult area.</P>
    <P>Of course the Agreement is also liable to be undermined from without &mdash;by groups who contend that, since they were not parties to the Agreement themselves, it does not affect them and that they may, therefore, legitimately expect to negotiate better terms.  It is vital that public sector employers should reject any such contentions. The Agreement is a national one, achieved only after a major effort, and must, if it is to survive, determine the approach of employers to all groups of workers, whether these groups were parties to it or not.</P>
    <P>These are only examples of the kind of problem that may arise during the course of the Agreement.  There will, no doubt be many others, some at least of which will be of interest to the public sector generally.  My Department, and indeed, the Department of <Col N="2132" /> Labour, will be only too willing to discuss any such problems with your organisation if called upon.</P>

    <P>A Chara</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Local Government to enclose for your information a copy of Confidential Circular 2/71 received from the Department of Finance relating to the Employer-Labour Conference National Agreement.  The Minister requests your co-operation in achieving the objectives of the Agreement and it would, accordingly, be appreciated if you would ensure, in relation to the local authorities under your control, that full account is taken of both the terms of the Agreement and the contents of above Circular in any negotiations (in progress or arising) on the revision of the remuneration of officers or employees of those authorities.  Your attention is directed, in particular, to Paragraph 3 of the Circular and to the necessity for local authorities to satisfy themselves that any pay provisions related to movements in outside rates are fully within the terms of the above Agreement.</P>
    <P>A copy of the National Agreement is attached.</P>

      <i>Confidential Circular 2/71</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Employer-Labour Conference National Agreement</i>
    </P>
    <P>A Chara</P>
    <P>1 I am directed by the Minister for Finance to refer to this Department's minute of 19 Deireadh Fómhair, 1970, regarding controls on prices and incomes. You will be aware that, in the <Col N="2133" /> light of the National Agreement negotiated at the Employer-Labour Conference (copy attached) the Government decided to withdraw the Prices and Incomes Bill in the expectation that the Agreement would in fact contribute not only to greater industrial peace but to bringing about a significant reduction in the rate of inflation. It is essential therefore, that the State, which is party to the Agreement, should give no grounds for any complaint that, in its capacity as employer, it is departing from the restraint which it would expect other employers, in view of the terms and spirit of the Agreement, to exercise. This is particularly important in the case of those Clauses under which it would be possible for management and union to effect settlements without recourse to the Labour Court (or other established body such as an arbitration board).  It should be borne in mind that the Agreement itself (Clause 11) provides machinery for determining questions of interpretation.</P>
    <P>2 Clause 1 of the Agreement sets out the general objectives of the Agreement.  Clauses 3 and 4 deal with the making of new agreements when current agreements on pay and conditions expire and set out the upper limits to be observed in new agreements. There are provisions in Clause 5 to cover cases where 12th round claims have not been settled and in Clause 6 to cover cases where genuine anomalies in pay exist between related groups.  Clause 7 embraces terms and conditions of employment other than basic pay.  Procedures in cases of dispute are covered in Clause 10.</P>
    <P>3 The Minister asks for your co-operation in the achievement of the objectives of the Agreement and, in particular, I am to request that in dealing with <i>all</i> claims for improvements in wages or conditions of employment regard be had to the terms of the Agreement.  In cases where Departments at present have delegated authority to vary pay rates in accordance with movements in outside rates, it will now be necessary for them not only to get sight of the formal settlement under which the outside rates have moved but to satisfy themselves <Col N="2134" /> that the settlement is fully within the terms of the Employer-Labour Conference Agreement.</P>
    <P>4 The Employer-Labour Conference Agreement in no way obviates the necessity for seeking Department of Finance sanction where this is necessary under existing arrangements and when sanction is being sought, Departments should have particular regard to the considerations set out in the first paragraph of this Circular and, in addition, should indicate the Clause in the Agreement under which they intend to process the claim.</P>
    <P>5 The Minister will be glad if the contents of this Circular are brought to the notice of all officers in your Department who would be directly concerned and if you would draw the attention of State-sponsored bodies under the aegis of your Department specifically to the considerations outlined in paragraph 1 and 3 above and seek their co-operation.</P>

      <P>I want to mention references by Deputy O'Donnell and possibly one or two other Deputies to the effect that the nature of the agricultural research being carried out by An Foras Talúntais was of a too academic and esoteric kind and not sufficiently in line with the practical needs of farming generally.  I want to say straight away that I do not accept this viewpoint at all.  In fact, I can think of several instances of the institute's work being adopted.  One that occurs to me especially, apart from machinery research carried out by the institute in Carlow and the recommendations that are made by the institute to farmers, directly and indirectly, through their advisory services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>We were talking about the type of research that is carried out by the institute and the criticism of this made during the course of the debate.  I have personal experience of and have seen the results of the work of An Foras Talúntais applied in practice on farms in my own constituency and throughout the country generally.  The instances that I was citing were the frequent recourse of farmers in the matter of advice.  I know personally about this in respect of farm machinery, the application of farm machinery, its suitability for use in given conditions, the research that the institute have done in the matter of animal housing and animal breeding. <Col N="2141" /> All these things are of a highly practical kind.  I do not accept the contention that the nature of the research carried out by An Foras Talúntais is too academic and too airy fairy.  I think the institute have their feet firmly on the ground and one of the reasons for this is the fact that the board of the institute itself and the programmes that they carry out are subject to the scrutiny of practical farmers and agricultural advisers and special evaluation panels drawn from farming, business, the universities and departmental circles.  I think the criticism levelled at the institute is hardly justified.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton spoke about the Small Farm Incentive Bonus Scheme and suggested that something should be done to get more people into the scheme.  As I announced when introducing the Estimate, the total bonus grant available under the scheme will be increased to £500 for new participants accepted from 1st January next. This is a very substantial increase and it should act as a very strong incentive to enterprising small farmers to participate in the scheme.  It is noticeable that some counties have been accepting the scheme and have latched on to it far more readily than others.  I hope the advisory staffs in all counties will see that the increase in the grant now gives them a fresh opportunity to sell the advantages of the scheme to more and more farmers.</P>
      <P>I should think also that the terms of the scheme, which have been more or less unchanged since 1968, need to be reviewed, and we are doing that in conjunction with the change in the grant, with the objective of bringing the scheme up to date.  It has been demonstrated pretty satisfactorily that it is a very worthwhile scheme.  Deputies generally, and quite properly, were concerned to see that as many smaller farmers as possible should be made viable and should be enabled to extract the maximum value from their farms and this is one obvious way in which it can be done.</P>

    <P>The £700 gross margin figure, which is a central feature, is not by any means as restrictive as it might appear <Col N="2142" /> to be on the surface.  It is calculated by reference to standards based on the years 1965 to 1967.  Because prices have changed so much since then, it is equivalent now to £1,000 or more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is like Wanderly Wagon.  I was discussing the small farm incentive scheme and was about to say that the requirements of the scheme in the matter of bookkeeping are not very great.  Deputy Enright spoke very rightly of the necessity to encourage farmers to keep accounts.  The accounts that are required of farmers under the scheme are an integral part of it and are set to operate to the farmer's advantage.  Deputy McLaughlin said small farmers who took part in the incentive scheme and thereby increased their incomes should not be deprived of unemployment assistance.  The annual amount in the west is calculated for unemployment benefit purposes on the rateable valuation of holdings and therefore increased income arising from the scheme does not affect farmers' eligibility for unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>Deputies referred to the question of capital and of credit for agriculture. The arrangements for the extension of credit facilities which I announced in my opening statement should meet all demands for credit.  We keep in close contact with the ACC and they assure us that the increased facilities will meet fully all requirements for this financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ACC expect considerably larger demands on their resources next year. At present we are discussing with them how these will be financed.  The Government envisage substantial extra requirements for investment in modernisation and expansion and credit for this purpose for approved projects will be available from the ACC.  Apart from the ACC and local credit sources, the commercial banks play a major part in providing credit.  The possible needs of farmers are reviewed jointly by the commercial banks and the Central Bank.  On the matter of lending, commercial <Col N="2144" /> agencies must naturally, in the last analysis, have regard to the credit worthiness of the borrower and for the schemes he puts up.  In general, preference is given to borrowing for productive purposes and this includes efficient agricultural production and marketing.</P>
    <P>With better markets and better grassland projects, the volume of investment in agriculture has been rising steadily. As I have already said, it is running at the rate of £60 million a year.  With our price and incentive policies, we have been steering this investment principally into well-balanced production of livestock and milk.  Everybody knows the potential for great expansion is there.  This was evident as the debate proceeded.  After many years of under-exploitation, resulting from international marketing conditions which made the development of our grassland much more of a chancy proposition because we could not then look forward to an escape from the closely controlled cheap food market with which we had to be content at that time, the rate of investment will accelerate as we approach EEC entry and in the next few years farmers themselves, operating as the businessmen they are, for profit, will invest a lot of their own money which should be coming in increasing volume from the markets as well as finance from normal credit sources. This, of course, will require from the Government well-selected guidance and support policies which will be provided in the future as they have been in the past.</P>
    <P>Reverting for a moment to our priorities here, we are all aware of the pro-positions underlined by the Scully Report and others that there is need to direct support to the area where it is needed most, that is to the small holding that is capable of being made into an economic holding that will guarantee a decent living to its occupier.  Because of the rather peculiar structure of our rural population, with a high age average and a high rate of celibacy, rearrangement may be on a different basis in the future.  It should be possible to devise a scheme that will enable vigorous, enterprising young men to stay on the land.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with a few particular <Col N="2145" /> points raised by individual Deputies. I think I detected in Deputy Creed's speech a note of anxiety about pig co-operatives.  I understand him to refer to the large fattening units that have been growing throughout the country in recent times.  I am not a bit afraid of this development.  I think that when it is based on a true co-operative basis, this is the best and most economic way for the smaller farmers to derive a profit from their pigs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy expressed the same kind of anxiety&mdash;I have heard him refer to this type of enterprise as &ldquo;the big combines&rdquo;.  There may be one or two very large operators who have experimented in pig production on a large factory basis, but I think that the experience in Britain and elsewhere, where the really big operators in other lines of business, people from industry have decided to embark on large pig projects, is that they have run into pitfalls which were unexpected. I was talking to people whose business it is to do research into these matters in Great Britain recently and I gather that the optimum number, and probably the maximum practical number, of sows that can be kept without serious risk of disease would run from 40 to 60.  Once you get over the 40 number, your risk of disease rises in a geometric progression.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not referring to the co-operatives made up of the small farming community, and this argument with regard to sows is not a valid argument because you can have different units of sows up to ten or 20 in numbers.  What I was referring to was fattening co-ops in which millers and professional people were involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I misunderstood the Deputy, but he will accept that there is this anxiety about any large project for the fattening of pigs from the bonham stage, the eight weeks stage upwards.  I do not share this anxiety when it is controlled by the farmers themselves, from co-operatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor do I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I <Col N="2146" /> see, on the contrary this as the best method by which the smaller sow owners can get the best possible profit from their small projects, and I think, speaking as a countryman and a farmer, that people should aim at a minimum of ten sows, but one thing which insures the smaller producer against possible investment by people outside agriculture in this business to whom Deputy Creed has referred is that the disease problem becomes unmanageable, once you start rising to the 40 sows size.  In fact, I learned somewhat to my relief that it is not such an attractive proposition for the really big non-farming operator to squeeze out the small man as it might seem to be on the face of it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy in the course of a rather long contribution to this debate, spoke of pigs as a valuable sideline. This may be so in the case of some farmers, possibly of medium size, whose main operation would be a dairy one, or possibly tillage&mdash;pigs can then possibly be a profitable sideline&mdash; but I would imagine that in the future people ought not to view the production of pigs, whether the keeping of breeding stock or their fattening, as a sideline but as a main enterprise.  I submit this as a personal opinion.  I have seen it in action in a pig co-operative in my constituency where the the target was a minimum of ten sows per farm, and I have seen it provide very satisfactory results for the participants who bred the pigs and brought them to the weaner stage whereupon they moved into the central fattening station and partook of the profits they derived from that.  It is a question of deriving the optimum use of the feed input, of having the best environmental control over the animals in the course of their fattening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Treacy expressed anxiety about the possibility of redundancies in the event of creamery mergers, what has come to be called the rationalisation of the creamery industry.  The odd thing about it is&mdash;and I have seen this again in practice&mdash;that especially in the position in which we will be in the future, in a situation where the gallonage and throughput will be rising fairly dramatically, as I would expect and hope, the possibility of redundancies <Col N="2147" /> in federated or amalgamated creameries is remote enough, and in the case I am referring to, of which I have personal knowledge, it was practically nil.  I know that it is a matter of some anxiety to workers in the creamery industry and a matter which, I know, is considered with great care by co-operatives who are contemplating mergers, but as I say, we can look forward with confidence to an expanding dairy industry and therefore you can contain your existing labour force with a rapidly increasing efficiency of operation and throughput of material.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy was under a misapprehension, it would appear from what he said, that butter is not subsidised in the home market.  Of course it is, and this is contained in the support which butter gets in the home market in the price support given to milk producers, which results in a quite considerable support for the home consumer, and it is worth while noting that the recent increase of 2½p in the price of the pound of butter to the retail customer did not produce any reaction at all.  In fact, the housewives' association expressed their understanding of the necessity there was for the producer getting his just reward in the face of rising costs, especially since the price of butter did not increase since 1966.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen devoted a considerable amount of his speech to the importance of agricultural education, to which I have already referred.  We all agree, I am sure, that it is certain that if the young men coming into farming in the future &mdash; my sons and the sons of other farmers&mdash;have not got the type of specialised agricultural training which is provided in the existing agricultural schools, which are, I am happy to say, being expanded and I look forward to them expanding still further, their chances of success in farming will be very seriously threatened.  This rather casual approach to rural life and farming generally will not suffice in future.  The young men in the industry in the future will need to be well-trained and to have a good knowledge of accountancy, elementary physics, chemistry and biology.  They <Col N="2148" /> will not need to have Ph.Ds in any of these subjects but a basic knowledge of them will be of vital importance.</P>
    <P>Co-operative group farming was mentioned.  This is one of Deputy O'Donnell's pet subjects.  Some people think that the Irish cannot co-operate. Deputy Cooney said that we are be devilled to some extent by our history. We must jettison some of our fears which developed during the long fight for the possession of the land itself.  We who grew up on the land and live by farming know the problems.  There must be some change from this total independence of farmers, especially on the part of farmers with small acreage. There must be a pooling of resources. Anyone contemplating the formation of working groups must realise that such groups could not be too well-informed. Certain recognised patterns of co-operation should be worked out in advance before any scheme is actually put into operation.</P>
    <P>People refer to the numbers of tractors and the quantities of farm machinery in use.  There is no real deficiency.  There is enough machinery in the country but it is being under-used. Tractors and other machinery are so expensive nowadays that it is necessary for people to extract the maximum use from them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney referred also to the need for the control of pollution from farm buildings.  We have all seen examples of this in recent times.  I have asked my Department to examine this particular problem in view of the rapid establishment of silage pit throughout the country.  Water supplies have been contaminated and fish in our rivers have been destroyed by the effluent produced by silage pits.  The farmers in this House are well aware of the dangers.  We must admit that we have been rather careless in the siting of our silage pits and the provision of adequate methods for the collection and disposal of the effluent from the silage.  This effluent is very dangerous to fish-life and water supplies.  Special attention must be paid to this point.  Means of controlling effluent will have to be introduced in any scheme forwarded to the Department for approval.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney referred to the mortality <Col N="2149" /> rates among livestock.  As a result of the progress we have been making in one area we have animal mortality.  I refer to bloat.  Bloat occurs most frequently on well-managed pasture, especially pasture which has been fertilised by nitrogenous fertilisers in the early part of the year.  Expert stockmanship is not exercised and it is possible to have three, four or five valuable cattle affected overnight by bloat. Mortality among sheep, especially mountain sheep, from vermin and predatory animals and malnutrition is higher than it ought to be.  The lambing percentages of mountain flocks are not satisfactory.  We are considering means by which these particular problems can be tackled.  Most good stockmen know how to control bloat, stomach worms and liver fluke.  The dissemination of knowledge about these diseases and the action to be taken are under review.</P>
    <P>Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> said that enough was not being done about marketing.  Deputy O. J. Flanagan dealt with this subject at some length last night.  Deputy O. J. Flanagan complained that our dairy products were not being pushed as rigorously as they might be.  He spoke of a trader in Jackson Heights, New York, who had a big exhibition of Irish products which everybody wanted to buy and of our failure in connection with marketing on that occasion.  There was not a follow-up to what the Deputy referred to as &ldquo;this breakthrough&rdquo;.  It is not fair to criticise Bord Bainne who have done an excellent job, especially in the British market.  The rapid rise in the eyes of the British consumer of the Kerrygold brand of goods&mdash;both cheese and butters&mdash;is obvious to all.  In latter years there has been an improvement in the marketing of butter and particularly in the market of lactic butter in the north of England.  The problem is not acute.  The problem now is to produce sufficient goods.</P>
    <P>Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> referred to the &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; policy in regard to milk.  We have already dealt with that subject.  In the last few years Bord Bainne found themselves obliged to sell butter and other products at disastrously low prices and it was therefore <Col N="2150" /> necessary to apply some restraint to the conversion of milk into butter and to divert production to beef.  It was quite an achievement in the very difficult marketing conditions to maintain the rapid rise in the size of our national herds of cattle all that time. He said the farmers in Cavan were disappointed about the recent increase in the price of milk.  I find it very difficult to understand this because I believe that some creameries in that area are talking about paying their suppliers 17p per gallon in the coming season.  This is a very substantial increase on the rate that has been paid up till now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that.  Deputy Hogan wondered if there was a danger that we would sell off our breeding stock.  This danger is diminishing because as market returns in the last couple of weeks have shown, already farmers are evincing a very acute anticipation of the increasing value of heifers and springers, and the price of that kind of animals has risen dramatically in the last couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>I assume Deputy Clinton's question is related to the situation that now arises as a result of the new pricing arrangement for creamery milk.  I have already mentioned the special factors which necessitated those arrangements. Other factors, however, enter into the question of prices payable to liquid milk producers, and we have these under consideration at the present time.</P>
      <P>As regards the scheme of grants for milk coolers, this was introduced specifically to assist small scale creamery suppliers to improve the quality of their milk.  In the case of producers for liquid sale, however, the cost involved in maintaining high quality standards required by law are taken into account in the price they receive.  As I say, the reaction of the new arrangements for creamery milk on liquid milk are being examined by the Department.  I think I have dealt with most of the main points raised.</P>

      <P>Any departure from the tier system of payment necessitates that the 1.3 per cent over 30,000 gallons would proportionately get more for that quantity of their milk over 30,000 gallons than they had been getting.  Any creamery supplier, however, will get the full increase of <Col N="2152" /> 1p as well as the benefit of the reduction in the Bord Bainne levy, which is about 0.5p.  As well as the 1p, he will get the benefit of the inclusion in his price of the quality bonus which henceforth will be operated by the individual creameries which he is supplying.  The creameries themselves will operate the quality bonus, presumably on a price differential basis. Presumably it will pay them better now to pay a premium price for quality milk.</P>

This is why I am so anxious that the small and relatively uneconomic creameries should get together.  The sooner they <Col N="2153" /> integrate the better for their own suppliers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he dealt at length with all the points raised.  The most important point which I have not heard him deal with is the availability or non-availability of credit as far as the farming community are concerned.  I heard him say that we could look forward to an expanding dairying industry but until such time as credit is made available the industry cannot expand.  Furthermore, and much more important in my opinion, we cannot make the necessary preparations which we should be making at this stage for our entry into the EEC because credit is not available.  Farming organisations, the Agricultural Institute and other people who are very close to the grass roots in agriculture are demanding that as much as £1,000 million credit should be made available to the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must realise that even if there were £1,000 million available, which as somebody said is a hefty sum, this would not accelerate in any way the gestation period of a cow or a sheep.  The objective that we must aim at is the retention of as many breeding cattle as we can.  This cannot be done merely by subsidising the purchase of such cattle across the board.  The result that you would get form that kind of operation would be merely the inflation of <Col N="2154" /> the price of such cattle but it would not make them any more numerous. As far as the availability of credit to farmers is concerned I am assured by the ACC that the two increases of capital they have received for loans to farmers will be sufficient to meet the demand that will be made on them in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking from memory now but I think the amount available to the ACC last April was about £6½ million and it is now £13 million.  I do not think any worthwhile project put up by an individual farmer or an agricultural undertaking to the ACC will be turned down for lack of capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the ACC are concerned I want to assure the Minister that I have seen a number of cases that in my opinion would be well worthy of a loan which have been refused by the corporation because the people asking for the loan were already in debt for some small amount.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation are the greatest people in the world to give loans to people who do not want them but the people who are in need of a loan to increase their cow numbers or modernise their farmyards find that the credit is not available to them, that they cannot get it.  This has done more damage to the farming community than anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must appreciate that the last determinant in this is the creditworthiness of the man and the project he has.  I do not share the Deputy's apprehension that a good man with a good scheme, if he approaches the ACC, will not get credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>He will get it provided he is not already in debt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is in debt there must be some reason for it.  If he is creditworthy he will get the credit.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that there is the type of person who will try for a loan from the ACC but he may not be competent enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2155" /> He may not have any clearly defined project to put before the ACC and say: &ldquo;This is a scheme I worked out with my agricultural adviser.  I want £5,000 to put it into operation.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about a case where there is a planned project put up by the agricultural instructor in the area and submitted to the ACC but it has been refused because the applicant was already in debt for a small amount.  The agricultural instructor drew up the plans but the credit was refused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Cronin) Gerry Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cronin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £19,165,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1972, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain services administered by that <Col N="2156" /> Office; for the pay and expenses of the Defence Forces; and for payment of a grant-in-aid. </P>
    <P>The Estimate for Defence is for a sum of £19,165,000.  By way of comparison, the total amount voted for the financial year 1970-71 was £18,788,010. Deputies are aware that already in July of this year a Supplementary Estimate was agreed to enable the Government to make £10,000 available to the Irish Red Cross Society as part of our contribution towards the international efforts for the relief of distress in India and in East Pakistan.  A further Supplementary Estimate will be introduced later this year.  Final figures and costings are not yet available, but I can say at this stage that it will be of the order of £3,000,000.  It will include substantial provision for new and increased equipments and for an increase in the strength of the permanent Defence Force.  Satisfactory progress is being made in the implementation of these programmes.</P>
    <P>The duties of the permanent Defence Force have been exceptionally heavy for some time past.  Duties in aid of the civil power arising from the situation in the Six Counties have become more onerous.  Special security duties, including Border patrols, are making increasing demands on manpower and equipment.  Fortunately, An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil are available to shoulder some of the burden; so also is the First Line Reserve, of which 170 members are at present on full-time service.  Morale is good, recruitment is satisfactory and the strength of the permanent Defence Force is higher now than at any time in the past decade.  The Defence Forces have demonstrated that the high standards of dedication, discipline and efficiency they have always displayed are being well maintained.  It is with pleasure and pride that I acknowledge the efficient and zealous manner in which all components of the Defence Forces carry out their duties in the present difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>While, as I have just said, recruitment is satisfactory, I am arranging for an intensive recruiting campaign through the Press and television, beginning <Col N="2157" /> about February next.  Deputies can also lend a hand by encouraging young men to offer their services.  As Deputies are aware, the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the FCA as a component of the Defence Forces was celebrated recently.  The force is making a vital contribution to our defence needs, which is particularly appreciated at this difficult time.  I ask the members to keep up the good work and to strive for even greater proficiency as soldiers. I ask them, too, to be steadfast in their active membership.</P>
    <P>At present an infantry group of approximately 390 officers and men is serving as a contingent of the United Nations peace-keeping force in Cyprus. A total of over 8,800 all ranks have now done duty there.  The group does not include an armoured car element and the armoured cars which were in Cyprus have been brought back.  I was satisfied that this could be done without detriment to the safety and security of our contingent.</P>
    <P>The Secretary-General of the United Nations in a report dated 30th November, 1971, to the Security Council has stated that the overall discipline and bearing of the officers and men of the United Nations Force in Cyprus have continued to be of a high order and reflect credit on the contingent commanders, their staffs and the armed forces of the contributing countries. He also pays tribute to them for continuing to carry out with exemplary efficiency and devotion the important task assigned to them.  This confirms the impression I gained during my visit to Cyprus in October, 1970.  The morale and health of the troops there continue to be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The present position about the recovery of the extra and extraordinary expenses arising from participation in the Cyprus operation is that claims amounting to £2.94 million have been made on the United Nations; £2.37 million has been refunded leaving a balance of £0.57 million outstanding. That is not satisfactory and strong pressure is being put on the United Nations to effect a substantial improvement in the position.</P>
    <P>Twenty-one officers are serving with <Col N="2158" /> the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East; 13 of them are in the Suez Canal sector and the remainder at Damascus, Tiberias and Jerusalem.  Deputies are aware of the tense situation existing in this area.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of pride for every one of us that this country is making a worthwhile contribution to the United Nations missions in Cyprus and the Middle East and that our Army is playing a significant part in these peace-keeping operations.</P>
    <P>The benefits, however, are not all one-way.  The experience and training gained by our soldiers in the course of these operations are a very valuable asset and make the effort well worthwhile. There is, too the benefit to morale that overseas service brings.  I may say that these troops could be brought home at very short notice if circumstances should ever dictate such a course.</P>
    <P>In dealing with last year's Estimates, I mentioned the increase in Army pay and other benefits following on a special review.  Recently, following a further review, a total of 63 officer appointments has been upgraded.  This should result in a considerable improvement in career prospects for officers generally.</P>
    <P>During 1971 to date helicopters took part in 16 missions involving air/sea rescue and 33 ambulance missions conveying emergency medical cases, such as brain injury and spinal injury patients, to Dublin hospitals for special treatment.</P>
    <P>The three existing machines have proved very suitable and so far they have enabled the Air Corps to meet all emergency calls.  However, the demands made on them have been increasing.  The periods during which they are out of service for maintenance purposes have also been increasing with their age.</P>
    <P>There is a provision of £100,000 in the Estimate, Subhead O2, for the purchase of a fourth helicopter, and a contract for the purchase has been placed, delivery to be in March, 1972.</P>
    <P>Interested parties sometimes plead for the establishment of additional helicopter <Col N="2159" /> centres, particularly near the western and southern coasts, for air/sea rescue and other operations.  However, the cost of setting up and maintaining even one further centre would be very great and I feel that the expenditure could not be justified having regard to the marginal advantages it would give compared with the existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>We have seen during the past year the inauguration of a new phase in the Naval Service with the introduction of three minesweepers.  Work on the construction of the all-weather fishery protection vessel is proceeding on schedule and I expect it to be delivered early in the next financial year.</P>
    <P>With the acquisition of the new vessels, it became necessary during the year to secure additional personnel for the Naval Service.  A special recruiting campaign for the service resulted in the enlistment of 84 recruits.  The number of recruits continuing to come forward is satisfactory, but the position in regard to executive branch officers is not so satisfactory.  Two competitions for Naval cadets have already been held in 1971, but the results were disappointing. Efforts are being made to obtain qualified officers on a temporary basis.</P>
    <P>The university training of Army cadets and young officers continues in a satisfactory manner.  The 14 cadets appointed in 1968 who commenced their university degree courses in October, 1969, have all passed their first and second year university examinations in the faculties of Arts (7), Science (4), Commerce (2) and Engineering (1).</P>
    <P>Fifteen cadets of the 1969 class commenced their first year at university in October, 1970, pursuing courses in Arts (4), Commerce (4), Science (7); 12 of them are continuing at university.</P>
    <P>Cadets are commissioned after two years service and all those I have just mentioned are now officers.</P>
    <P>A further 28 cadets, of the 1970 class, commenced their university studies in October this year and are pursuing courses in arts (12), commerce <Col N="2160" /> (12), science (1) and engineering (3).</P>
    <P>Thus we have a total of 54 Army students at University College, Galway, at present.</P>
    <P>Up to now the students have been accommodated temporarily in existing buildings at Dún Uí Mhaoilíosa.  However, their number is expected to increase in the coming years and the existing accommodation at the barracks will no longer be sufficient to cater for them.  A provision of £40,000 is included in the Estimate for the first stage of a new building at Dún Uí Mhaoilíosa to provide additional accommodation.</P>
    <P>Cadets and officers attending University College, Galway, receive their normal pay and allowances.  Their tuition expenses, including fees and books, are paid by my Department. By any standard a cadetship is an extremely attractive proposition for any young man of character and ability seeking a career in the public service.  Nevertheless, the Army has been unable to attract the numbers required and this results in an insufficiency of young officers.  Consideration is being given to this problem and it may be necessary to vary the minimum educational standard for entry, which for the past few competitions was matriculation or equivalent. The ideal of a university education for every young officer may not be fully realisable in the short term.</P>
    <P>In introducing the 1970-71 Supplementary Estimate for Defence I gave the House information in relation to the scheme whereby NCOs and privates of the Permanent Defence Force are given an opportunity of attending courses of one year's duration at vocational schools with a view to their obtaining the day group certificate. I am glad to say that these courses continue to be popular and in October, 1971, 85 men commenced courses at five centres.</P>
    <P>The special arrangements, initiated in 1970, whereby men may undertake a two-year course leading to the leaving certificate continue in operation. This year a total of 43 men enrolled for the course at six centres.</P>
    <P>The training of apprentices at the <Col N="2161" /> Army apprentice school, Naas, and at the Air Corps apprentice school, Baldonnel, continues.  Following discussions with representatives of AnCO in connection with the operation of the apprentice school at Baldonnel, two additional vocational teachers have been appointed with a view to raising the standard of instruction at the school.  Close liaison with AnCO is maintained in the running of both apprentice schools; 37 apprentices were recruited for the Air Corps school and 53 for the Army apprentice school as a result of the competitions held in 1971.</P>
    <P>The sleeping accommodation at present available for the apprentices at the Army apprentice school, Naas, is not satisfactory and I am taking steps to have the position remedied as quickly as possible.  A sum of £42,500 to enable a start to be made in the erection of new billets at the school is included in the Estimate.  I hope to have the first stage of the work undertaken this year and to have the project completed next year.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that we have for some time past been providing courses of training at the military college for personnel of the Zambia army.  A second group of officer cadets from that country completed their training in June last.  A third class of ten cadets arrived in March this year and a further ten arrived recently.  The costs of running these training courses are met by the Government of Zambia.</P>
    <P>This year full Army equitation teams competed at Wiesbaden and at Fontainbleau. In addition Army horses and riders competed as part of mixed military/civilian teams at six English and continental shows.  Close liaison has been established between my Department and Bord na gCapall and consideration is at present being given to making facilities at the Army Equitation School available to the board for the training of a number of civilian riders and horses.  The question of arranging for the trainer employed by Bord na gCapall to train riders and horses of the Army Equitation School is also under consideration.</P>
    <P>Since 1969 the Army have been doing <Col N="2162" /> a splendid humanitarian job in looking after refugees from Northern Ireland.  The peak figure in 1969 was 720 and in 1970 it was 1,558.  All these were housed and fed by the Army.</P>
    <P>The situation took a dramatic turn for the worse in the second week of August, 1971, when refugees began to arrive over the Border in unprecedented numbers.  On the night of 12th August alone 2,825 were received into Gormanston Camp.  The military staff there, with assistance from Civil Defence and Red Cross personnel, made heroic efforts to attend to the needs of this great number.  What was lacking in physical comforts that night was more than made up for by the humanity, friendship and security these distressed people experienced at Gormanston.</P>
    <P>The capacity of Army refugee centres at Gormanston, Finner, Kilworth, Coolmoney, Kildare, Kilkenny, Waterford and Tralee was soon exceeded.  It then became necessary to call on local authorities, in exercise of their civil defence functions, to provide accommodation and food for appreciable numbers of refugees.  The request met with a ready response.  It was school holiday time and religious leaders and communities, in addition to various other organisations and individuals, very generously placed their facilities and services at the disposal of local authorities for the purpose of caring for refugees.  The Garda Síochána also helped out by accommodating 600 at the training depot in Templemore.  Local authorities, with their Civil Defence services, in Counties Dublin, Meath, Longford, Sligo, Cavan, Leitrim, Laois, Tipperary and Cork were involved in providing accommodation for and looking after refugees.  At the peak period 2,695 were being catered for by the Army and 2,714 otherwise.</P>
    <P>Thus, the handling of this major influx of refugees was achieved by a combination of military and Civil Defence resources, aided by the Irish Red Cross Society and practical goodwill and sympathy on all sides.  We owe a deep debt of gratitude to all who helped directly or indirectly.  I should mention particularly the Defence Forces and the local authorities <Col N="2163" /> and their Civil Defence organisations. Our sincere thanks are also due to religious leaders and religious communities, regional health boards and the Irish Red Cross Society.</P>
    <P>The refugees soon began to return to the North and by mid-September it was possible to close down all the refugee centres run by local authorities and concentrate the remaining people in a few Army camps.  At present there is only one refugee centre open, that at Kilworth Camp, where there are approximately 200 refugees.</P>
    <P>The worthy part played by Civil Defence in helping to cope with the refugee problem is one more illustration of the peace-time value of that organisation.  As Deputies know, however, the primary aim of Civil Defence is to mitigate the effects of war on the civilian population.  It is essentially a citizen's service based on the principle of self-help, and practically every country in the world to-day has an organisation of this kind as part of its national defence.  Should the necessity ever arise &mdash; and we all hope and pray that it never will &mdash; Civil Defence would provide considerable protection for the people against the hazards that could threaten their lives and property and perhaps the very existence of the nation.  Unless and until we live in a disarmed world, the responsibility remains to provide a Civil Defence service.</P>
    <P>Civil Defence is organised on what, to my mind, is the very sensible principle of making full use of such agencies of Government and local and other public authorities as have peace-time functions analogous to the functions that would have to be discharged by Civil Defence in an emergency.  On the ground Civil Defence is under the control of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The organisation have as members people of all ages from 17 to 70, of both sexes, of every occupation, religion and social class.  The spirit of voluntary service amongst members is high and the example which they have set in preparing themselves for the relief of human suffering and the welfare of their fellow countrymen is most encouraging indeed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2164" /> Significant steps have been taken in regard to Civil Defence preparations. In addition to the recruitment and training of volunteer helpers, plans have been made to enhance the individual's ability to survive nuclear hazards.  Methods of warning him of the imminence of danger have been established, as well as of monitoring dangerous radiation and of instructing him in ways to protect himself against it.  County and regional control centres are being set up from which Civil Defence operations would be directed and co-ordinated.  Once again I would like to stress the importance of the Civil Defence householders' handbook which should be in every home and carefully preserved.  I would also commend to every householder the short 20-minute Civil Defence film <i>Dangerous Dust</i> which is being shown free to the public in local halls around the country.</P>
    <P>I would like to express my gratitude to the members of Civil Defence and my appreciation of the co-operation which exists between the Civil Defence organisation and the voluntary aid societies, the Irish Red Cross Society, the Order of Malta and the St. John Ambulance Brigade.  It has always been the ideal that there should be the fullest possible involvement of the members of the voluntary aid societies &mdash;wherever these exist locally&mdash;in Civil Defence casualty plans.</P>
    <P>The Irish Red Cross Society continue to assist in the care of the 200 or so refugees being maintained at present by the Army in Kilworth Camp.  Generous public subscriptions to the society's relief funds have enabled them to provide valuable ancillary facilities for the refugees, such as clothing, baby foods, travel expenses and pocket money.</P>
    <P>The society in co-operation with the International Committee of the Red Cross have assisted in the alleviation of distress abroad by the prompt dispatch of aid.  The £10,000 voted in July as additional grant-in-aid was disbursed through the League of Red Cross Societies for the relief of distress in India and in Pakistan.  The society also made available further sums totalling £13,000 to the league, as well as dispatching <Col N="2165" /> blankets and medical supplies valued at over £5,000 to the Indian Red Cross Society.  I thank the society for their good work.</P>
    <P>A sad event during the year was the untimely death last July of Major-General Patrick Delaney, chief of staff. This was made all the more tragic by reason of the fact that he had been in office only since the 1st April.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.  Our deepest sympathy goes out to his widow and family.</P>
    <P>As regards Army pensions, the Estimate is for a net sum of £4,299,000, an increase of £185,110 on last year's vote.  This net figure does not include provision for some important new concessions arising from this year's Budget.  The first of these is the award to widows of military service pensioners of an annual allowance equal to one-half of the late husband's pension as at 1st October, 1971, with a minimum allowance of £52.20 a year. As a direct consequence of this, the minimum military service pension has also been raised to £52.20 a year.  The cost of these concessions is expected to be about £280,000 in a full year. Deputies, I am sure, would like to know that as on the 22nd November approximately 2,100 widows had been awarded allowances and of these 2,000 had received the initial payment.  The remaining 100 will receive payment this week.  There were on the same date some 110 cases in course of investigation and those qualified in this group will be paid their entitlement as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Further, as announced in the Budget statement, military service pensions, special allowances, disability pensions and allowances, and pensions and retired pay of former members of the Permanent Defence Force were increased from the 1st October last.  The increases were to bring the pensions, <i>et cetera</i>, up to the levels appropriate to pay rates generally in force on the 1st June, 1969 and were broadly of the order of 10.5 per cent.  The cost of these Budget concessions this year will be met from the Vote for Increases in Pensions.  In a full year the cost will be £550,000.</P>
    <P>There are two items in this year's <Col N="2166" /> Estimate to which I wish to call special attention.  The provision of free travel for veterans of the War of Independence has proved to be a facility which is being availed of to a much greater extent than was envisaged. Because of the popularity of the scheme, and because of increases in the charges by CIE, the cost of free travel this year will require a Supplementary Estimate of some £260,000.  This brings the cost of free travel this year to £320,000.  Secondly, the past year saw some very significant improvements in benefits under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes. This House approved of the relevant Statutory Instrument last December. The principal beneficiaries are married officers retiring on reaching the age limit or within five years of it, and married long-service soldiers discharged on pension.  The improvements resulted in more men taking their discharge than would otherwise be the case.  This, of course, is not a bad thing as it assists towards the maintenance of a balanced age and career structure.  However, a Supplementary Estimate of £124,000 will be required later to meet the short-fall in the provision of £1,723,500 for the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I would like to make a few general remarks on defence expenditure.  I mentioned earlier that this year's outgoing will run to about £22 million, a fairly significant sum in terms of our economy.  We have often been accused of spending too little on the Defence Forces and of neglecting this basic institution of the State.  In fact this has become almost an obsession with some commentators and writers on defence topics.  In passing, may I say that I welcome this concern with defence even if I would wish the subject to be approached in a more balanced and deliberative way and without preconceived notions.</P>
    <P>Defence is one of many State services that have to be maintained from the limited and hard-won revenue. What is allocated to each service is determined by a difficult, even painful, balancing process, in the knowledge that if more is given to one, the others must do with less &mdash; unless, of course, <Col N="2167" /> extra revenue can be procured.  Money is really the nub of the matter, and these critical decisions are taken by Ministers and, in the final analysis, by the Government.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the past, I believe that in the current situation it is prudent to strengthen the Defence Forces. What we want to ensure is that the security forces will be strong enough to deter and defeat any violent attack, no matter from what quarter, on the institutions of this State and its democratic way of life.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to say more at this stage.  I shall of course do my best to give Deputies any further information they require.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>I do so in order to give the Members of the House the widest possible scope to discuss this Estimate at an extremely critical time in our history, a time when the security of the State and the role of the Army have never been more important.</P>
      <P>The very serious and tragic situation which exists in Northern Ireland has placed and continues to place a very great strain on our very limited Army and in my view places a very serious responsibility on the Minister and the Government to increase as a matter of urgency the strength of the Army to the point where it will be equal to the task.  I am not thinking only of the present situation in Northern Ireland but I have in mind the possibility of an over-spill of violence and also that we must surely be coming near the point where the British Government will see the light and be convinced that there is no solution to the present Northern Ireland problem that does not involve the unification of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not the only person convinced of this; there is ample evidence of it. First, the former British premier is now thinking along these lines.  But when we reach that point many problems will arise.  In my view it must happen in this way, and I think this is acknowledged <Col N="2168" /> by all, that when the British begin to move out of Northern Ireland and when they announce, as I believe inevitably they must, that they are going to phase themselves out over a period of five, seven or ten years, we shall then have placed on our shoulders the additional responsibility of defending the North of Ireland and of dealing with irresponsible elements from whatever source they may come.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister is taking his responsibility seriously.  Today he has spoken like a Minister for Defence in cuckoo land who is completely unaware of the dangers so evident to everybody else.  We are dealing here with an Estimate in the first instance of £19 million approximately, approximately the same as the amount on Defence last year.  The Minister then talks about an additional £3 million for equipment.  He does not say what sort of equipment.  For the past two years at least I have been drawing attention to the weakness of our Army and its deplorable under-strength, and the Minister's failure to take serious steps to bring it up to the required strength can only be described as irresponsible. It may not be the Minister's fault; perhaps he is not getting Government backing but he must carry the responsibility since he is Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>In referring to the Army being under strength I am not referring only to the number of serving personnel but I am including several other weaknesses.  I am talking about the need for more and better equipment, more and better transport, more armoured cars, more armoured personnel carriers and more transport of all sorts and sizes.  I went into this in some detail on last year's Estimate and I mentioned that the youngest truck at the Curragh was 15 years old.  Since then some trucks have been purchased and, to that extent, the position can be said to have been improved but to buy a few trucks to replace trucks that are 20 years old will not settle this matter.  We must bring our Army up to date.  We are living in critical and dangerous times but it does not seem to be appreciated that it is not possible to equip the Army adequately when the money available <Col N="2169" /> is limited.  Our people serving in the armed forces are humiliated continuously because they are underequipped and are unprepared for what is expected of them.</P>
    <P>When will we have a policy for the Army?  I have asked people serving in the Army what was the defence policy but they have told me they never heard of it.  I wonder if the Minister is aware of a defence policy?  People in the Army are seriously concerned about the role of the Army.  They want someone to define for them the duties they are supposed to carry out and the limits of their responsibilities.  Not only are the Army &mdash; comprising 8,000 to 9,000 men &mdash; expected to carry out the ordinary routine duties they have performed for many years; they are expected to do Border duty and they are expected to guard vital installations in addition to their normal work.  There has been no increase in strength and there has been no significant improvement as regards equipping the Army.</P>
    <P>Some people imagine that when weaknesses in various sectors of the Army are exposed the people responsible for drawing attention to those weaknesses are acting irresponsibly.  I am reluctant to expose such weaknesses but there is a greater evil, namely, the danger of exposing the country to extreme danger and leaving ourselves in the position that we are not prepared to take on responsibilities to meet situations that are likely to confront us.</P>
    <P>We are about to enter the EEC but there has been no mention of this matter in the Minister's speech.  No reference has been made to the implications of our entry into the Community. These are serious matters and the people would like to know what the Government intend to do.  If and when we join the EEC, what will it mean for the Army?  Will it mean standardisation of equipment, an interchange of knowledge, ideas and tactics?  We know that the terms of entry into the EEC do not entail a commitment to defence, but we accept that the least we would be expected to do would be to defend our own territory.  I hope that a small and poor country such as Ireland would not be expected to take on a greater defence commitment.  However, I should like to hear the Minister's views on <Col N="2170" /> this matter and to give us an assurance that this is the case.  The question of who would be our ally in the case of an attack from outside is of interest to many people.</P>
    <P>Year after year we talk about the same things and we make complaints about the same defects when we discuss the Estimate for this Department. Recently one newspaper called the discussions on this Estimate as the annual occasion for &ldquo;codswallop&rdquo;.  This is Army language, but perhaps the criticism is justified when one considers that so few improvements have been made even though complaints have been made.  Admittedly more money is being spent but this does little more than make up for the increase in costs and prices.  There is little upgrading as a result of the increased expenditure.</P>
    <P>Have we a more efficient and well-equipped Army?  These matters are important and many people would be interested to know the answers.  The Minister appears to be complacent and happy about the success of recruitment for the Army.  He is happier than anyone else in the community about the adequacy of the Army and its equipment.</P>
    <P>What we want, and what the news media are demanding, will cost a substantial amount of money but what must we pay for security?  I believe the people are more prepared than ever before to pay a substantial price for this kind of security.  When the chips are down we see that we depend on the Army.  This is the time when we should be courageous about expenditure.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to admit that improving Army equipment will cost money. We are told that one armoured car costs in the region of £40,000.  Recently there was a critical article on this matter in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> but I think it is worthy of consideration on this Estimate.  While the Minister made a critical comment in his speech on commentators he did not deal with the subject matter raised by them.  In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> dated 21st November, 1971, Joe McAnthony stated:</P>
    <P>There is growing bewilderment in the Defence Forces about recent announcements, <Col N="2171" /> some official and others Government-inspired, which suggested, among other things, that a mid-October meeting of Ministers and high-ranking officers had decided as a matter of grave urgency that there would have to be increased spending on the Army.</P>
    <P>That is fair enough.  They are entitled to have this meeting and to make these decisions.  Is this, in fact, the money mentioned by the Minister this afternoon in introducing his Estimate? Is this the £3 million approximately referred to by the Minister? It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The confusion on this matter must now be increased for, apart from 2,000 FN rifles, the Army has not ordered a single item of new equipment since the alleged meeting was supposed to have taken place and, despite statements by both An Taoiseach, Mr. Lynch, and the Minister for Defence, Mr. Cronin, which give the impression that the Army is to get a new look, we can now say that all of the money to be raised by Supplementary Estimate for the Defence Forces will go to pay for equipment already ordered earlier in the year as part of what might be termed normal military expenditure and which the Army has indicated to the Government would be inadequate for its needs in view of the Northern crisis.</P>
    <P>I suppose these statements could create a wrong impression if the Minister can tell us today that in addition to this Estimate a further Supplementary Estimate will be put before us for £3 million.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>The story of just what the Army has ordered and the wide discrepancy between it and what seems to be Department of Defence inspired stories makes interesting reading. For instance, on 2nd September, when feeling over the Hackball's Cross incident and internment ran high, the <i>Irish Press</i> ran a highly publicised story which said that the Government had decided to buy more than 50 armoured vehicles for £1 million in France and that these <Col N="2172" /> would form the Army's first armoured regiment.  The details contained in the story suggest that it came from either a Department of Defence or Government source.</P>
    <P>Fifty armoured vehicles for £1 million would seem to very good value if we remember that one costs £40,000.  It would appear to me that the expenditure would be more likely to be £2 million for 50 armoured vehicles.</P>
    <P>In various papers every day publicity is given to the Army.  This should be welcomed because for far too long the Army was ignored by far too many people, and the Press are included in that comment.  Attention is now being focused on the Army and this is good. I have said here by way of criticism, speaking on the Estimate for the Department of Defence, that there was no channel through which Members of the House could communicate freely with serving personnel.  When one gets a letter it is not signed.  It has to be anonymous.  The regulations in that regard have not been changed. Apparently there is now some new regulation under which the gentlemen of the Press are free to discuss facts about the Army, as they are described, with Army officers, and are free to give their version of them and their own comments.</P>
    <P>I have said publicly before that all of us should know more about what is happening in the Army.  All of us should have greater access to what is happening in the Army.  We would then be in a position to make reasonable comments here.  Serving personnel should not have to meet Members of the Opposition in holes and corners. They should not be afraid to be seen talking to us.  Unfortunately that is the situation at present.  I should like to hear the Minister saying that this should not be he case and that people should not be labelled if they are seen talking to Opposition Members of this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be satisfied with recruitment.  He seems to think that the numbers in the Army are satisfactory enough.  At the same time he tells us that he is starting off on a special recruitment campaign.  Why has <Col N="2173" /> he left it until now to embark on this campaign?  Has it not been obvious to everyone for the past two years that there was a great responsibility on the Government to increase the strength of the Army and that most of the problems that exist in the Army, and most of the complaints one hears from Army personnel, arise from the inadequate numbers to cover the enormous field that the Army is expected to cover at present.  Of course it is not able to cover it.  It is not able to undertake adequately the enormous number of tasks and responsibilities now placed on it.</P>
    <P>What is being done to make the Army as a career more attractive?  The Minister mentioned a number of things but I think these attractions are at the same level as they were for some years past.  No additional effort is being made. This is not good enough in the times in which we are living.  The education programme mentioned by the Minister &mdash;university education and vocational education &mdash; is the greatest attraction to bring young people into the Army for a short time.  It should be expanded.  It should be possible to make it attractive for young people to go into the Army for three or four years and get a qualification, or even to achieve a standard which will enable them to leave the Army and get a qualification while on the reserve for a further three or four years, perhaps.</P>
    <P>An immense amount of work could be done to ensure that more people will come into the Army.  The Minister complained about the number of recruits he was able to get through the competition for cadetships in the present year.  This must suggest that something is wrong.  It is not the standard of education.  It is the career itself.  This is what should be examined.  Surely if the advantages were there they would be availed of.  The number of young men in the country with a good leaving certificate who cannot get a job is quite staggering.  Why cannot we get a greater percentage of those people into the Army?  There must be obvious reasons and there must be obvious discomforts that are not being attended to.  Therefore they are not joining the Army.  No doubt they hear from people in the <Col N="2174" /> Army what conditions are like.  The Minister did not refer to that at all in introducing his Estimate.  He did not mention any improvement in living conditions for married or single personnel.</P>
    <P>Nowadays more and more people are getting married at a young age. Married people can re-enter the Army but married men are not taken in as recruits.  People marry now at 18 years of age and many are married before they are 22.  Surely these should be acceptable people in the Army.</P>
    <P>I have been examining the performance of the Department of Defence during the past 15 years in respect of accommodation and I have found that they have been providing houses at the rate of ten per year.  There is no figure given for obsolescence or loss of accommodation during that period. There is a serious problem in this respect in the Army and it is a problem that is not being dealt with by local government.  The living conditions for both married and single men at the various barracks are not good enough.  They have not been upgraded in the same way as has outside accommodation and people nowadays are accustomed to comforts that were not available 20 or 30 years ago but in the various Army establishments there has been very little improvement during the past 100 years.  This is a shocking criticism to have to make, but it is an obvious reason why men are not joining the Army.</P>
    <P>Rates of pay and other conditions have improved.  Rates of pay in particular have been improved.  While I do not know how they compare with rates elsewhere, I do not think it is on that score that people are reluctant to join.  One aspect in which I am very interested is the educational programme that appears to be only beginning now in the Army.  This programme is not developing as it should. As there is more mechanisation and as equipment generally becomes more sophisticated, a much greater percentage of people serving in the Army would have to be qualified technically if they are to play a useful part in the future of the Army.  In regard to the one-year day course, so far as I can <Col N="2175" /> see this is only for the purpose of raising the educational standards of personnel so that resettlement at a later date will be easier.  What is needed is a course comparable to the three-year vocational group certificate course even if this means that some fellows, if they have the basic education required, would have to start studying for this course at 17 or 18 years of age.  They could then go into the various industries where they would be enabled to complete their particular qualifications even if they were to be kept on reserve if necessary.</P>
    <P>The average age of Army personnel is increasing.  This is a serious matter because if there is very important work to be done at any time it is not likely to be done by an army whose men are elderly.  The conditions that have to be endured on Border duty and the various other tasks call for the services of young men although we all know that it is necessary to have the benefit of experienced men.  Such experience is indispensable but, nevertheless, there must be a constant flow of young people.</P>
    <P>It should not be beyond the power and the imagination of those really interested in the Army to devise ways and means of inducing people, profitably, into the Army.  The tie-up in the Army should be as short as possible. I think that a three year stay would induce more people have to join because young people have no wish to commit themselves for a longer period than that.  In fact, sometimes a period of three years might seem very long to them.  However, after they join they usually become interested in their work and there is always the possibility that they will remain.</P>
    <P>The work being done in the Army Apprentice Schools at Naas and Baldonnel is excellent and these produce first-class personnel but we should have an expansion of the activities of these schools.  The Minister referred to the fact that two additional teachers have been appointed to Baldonnel for the purpose of upgrading standards there.  I interviewed the applicants for these positions and I was impressed very much by the quality of the candidates <Col N="2176" /> who came forward.  Two excellent people have been appointed.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why we should not have a more rapid expansion of this type of activity in the Army.  If we improved living conditions in the Army and if there was a proper promotion structure and also a reduction of the work load, I have no doubt that recruitment would be much easier and that there would be sufficient personnel in the Army.  However, what are we to regard as being sufficient personnel? The Minister has not told us.  Neither has he told us what are the tasks and responsibilities of the Army or what is expected of them.  He has not told us either what would be regarded as a reasonable number of people, equipped properly, who would be capable of undertaking these tasks and discharging them in a reasonable way. These questions must be answered.</P>
    <P>There are several other matters which must be mentioned in the course of this debate.  One of these has been mentioned by the Minister but not referred to by him at any length, that is, fishery protection.  The Minister said in passing that three minesweepers had been purchased but he did not tell us whether these were yet at sea, whether they are fully manned and equipped and what they are capable of in relation to fishery protection.  Earlier in the year we were told that there was one all-weather vessel being built by Verholme of Cork and that this was due for delivery in March.  I wonder whether this will be delivered on schedule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will we then have four vessels at sea engaged in fishery protection? Some of us had the opportunity of going for a trip on the minesweepers. One thing that occurred to me was that they were very exposed.  I am not very good at describing the various parts of a vessel of this kind but on the upper deck, from which there is a certain amount of navigation to be done, they were completely open to the elements. I asked, by way of Parliamentary Question, what were the prospects of having these three vessels enclosed and <Col N="2177" /> made more comfortable for the crew members.  I am referring now to the <i>Gráinne, Banba, and Fodhla.</i>  Are these three vessels, plus the all-weather vessel that is being produced in Verholme, properly manned and equipped, capable of giving adequate fishery protection?  Some people have considerable doubt about this.  I should like to hear the Minister telling the House what he thinks.  Not so long ago we had no vessel at sea.  This must be regarded as an improvement but I understand that these vessels are quite slow and that many trawlers can outpace them.  I suppose this is a serious defect.  I do not think they are anything like as well able to go to sea in bad weather as the old vessels we had, when they were seaworthy.  They are a compromise because of a shortage of money and because the three we had suddenly collapsed and we could not, perhaps, wait until proper vessels were provided.</P>
      <P>A new complication has been introduced by the settlement arrived at in relation to EEC fisheries where we have a 12 mile limit for a certain area of the coast and only a six-mile limit for another area of the coast for certain fish.  To ensure that when boats come inside the 12 mile limit they are not fishing for shell fish is an additional complication.  Many people believe that three vessels are quite inadquate and that something like twice that number would be required.  It is surprising that the Minister for Defence should come into the House and not give us any rundown on the present situation because it is a matter of concern to many people in the House.</P>
      <P>I was not in the House when there was a question answered on the recent incident in Drogheda.  It is a matter of regret, because it concerns so many people in the country, that the Minister was not apparently in a position to inform the House adequately what exactly happened there or how it was possible to disarm the FCA unit in Drogheda on the occasion in question. This probably arises from the inadequacy of numbers in the Army to give the cover and protection that is required and carry out their normal duties at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2178" /> The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Morale is good, recruitment is satisfactory and the strength of the permanent Defence Force is higher now than at any time in the past decade.</P>
    <P>Higher by how much?  How satisfactory is morale?  I do not think it is satisfactory.  I think there is a great deal of dissatisfaction in the Army because of the lack of definition of responsibility and the lack of appreciation of the load that is being placed on far too few people in the Army.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that he is going to embark on an intensive recruiting campaign through the Press and television beginning about February next. Why has this campaign been postponed until February?  Is it just a question of advertising in the newspapers and trying to glamourise the situation?  Is it not far more important to look at the defects inside the Army, look at the reasons why they are not coming in, tell them what will be done about them in the future and try to induce them to come in by whatever means we think would be attractive.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the Naval Service.  I do not know whether he mentioned An Slua Muirí but there is a great deal of dissatisfaction here.  I do not know what they are expected to do or how capable they are of doing what they are expected to do.  My own feeling is that they have not got the equipment and there is nobody taking any particular interest in them.  They will inevitably fall to pieces unless some interest is taken in them and unless they are given a job to do and the equipment to do it.  Again we should know what is the cost of doing that.  I believe it would cost at least £1 million, if not more, to enable An Slua Muirí to become a force of significance and to continue in existence.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>A special recruiting campaign for the service resulted in the enlistment of 84 recruits.</P>
    <P>This is for the Naval Service.  How many are required in a Naval Service? How many are in it at the moment? How likely are we to get the number of people we need?  He said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2179" /> Two competitions for Naval cadets have already been held in 1971, but the results were disappointing.</P>
    <P>Why were they disappointing?  Has there been an examination of the reasons and what are we going to do about them?  There must be answers. There are more unemployed people in the country than there have been for a very long time and leaving certificates are ten a penny.  A substantial number of people come to every public representative saying that they have leaving certificates and can get nothing.</P>
    <P>We talk about the fact that we have an insufficiency of young officers and that we are anxious to do something about this.  Then we have a newspaper coming out and saying that we are top heavy with those type of people.  It is headed: &ldquo;Too many chiefs and too few Indians.&rdquo;  This may appear to be the case but I think it is a good thing to have too many chiefs in the present situation where the Army is so very much under strength.  Unless there are sufficient officers and sufficient NCOs to train any influx of new recruits that you get you certainly cannot expand an army.  If we had to suddenly call up the FCA in substantial numbers we could not possible train them unless we had enough officers and enough NCOs.  Incidentally, is there any reason why more NCOs could not be brought into officer rank?  Last year I think there were 35 commissioned.  Is it not possible to increase the number?  One admirable way of remedying the shortage of officers in the Army would be if there were more opportunities for people to be promoted from the ranks. If that were the case recruitment would be improved.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a list of persons who were enrolled in the various courses in Naas and Baldonnel.  The only disappointing feature is that the numbers are remaining static or are not increasing to the desired extent. Of course there has been no expansion of accommodation or improvement of equipment.  These are the reasons why we are not doing a better job.  The limited number provided for are excellent people and will be of enormous benefit to the economy in civilian employment <Col N="2180" /> after their service in the Army.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Army Equitation School and said that this year full Army equitation teams competed at Wiesbaden and at Fontainbleau and that, in addition, Army horses and riders competed as part of mixed military/civilian teams at six English and Continental shows.  What is not mentioned is whether the situation is satisfactory or not.  As far as anybody can see, it is not satisfactory and the results are most disappointing. We should hear some of the reasons why they were so disappointing.</P>
    <P>In the past the Army Equitation School was something of which we could be extremely proud.  That is not the position now.  There is a good deal of money being spent on horses and I was glad to see that McKee Barracks has been opened up to civilians for participation and that fuller use is being made of the facilities there. This is something for which the Minister should be commended.  I am glad that close liaison has been established between the Department and Bord na gCapall.  Bord na gCapall have received considerable criticism.  I hope that as a result of the combination of forces here a better job will be done in the equitation school.</P>
    <P>During the year I addressed a question to the Minister to ask him if he would consider opening the equitation school to all ranks and the Minister said that he would not.  That the Minister could arrive at the conclusion that the leaving certificate is a necessary qualification for an Army rider is something I could not understand.  One of our most famous teams included a man from the ranks.  It is a great pity that is not permitted.  The quality of the team could be improved by opening it up to the various ranks and not confining it to commissioned officers.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the helicopter service and to the fact that it is doing an excellent job.  With this we all agree.  With the limited number of helicopters that we have, a very good job is being done.  The Minister mentioned that the periods during which the helicopters are out of service <Col N="2181" /> for maintenance purposes have been increasing with their age.  He said that there is provision for the purchase of a fourth helicopter.</P>
    <P>The Minister made no reference whatever to the Air Corps in general or the policy in relation to the Air Corps.  What is the intention in regard to the Air Corps?  Reports appearing in the newspapers would indicate that the situation is becoming more hopeless every day and that most of the planes are no longer airworthy and that the corps is almost at disappearing level.  Does the Minister consider that the Air Corps is unnecessary?  If not, what is being done to bring it up to recognised strength?  Is there any policy in regard to the strength of the Air Corps?  Is the corps to remain in existence?  No money has been spent on it and there is no indication in the Minister's speech that it is the Minister's policy to spend any money on it. I do not know how necessary the Air Corps is &mdash; I am not an expert in these matters &mdash; but I would imagine that it would be extremely desirable to have a small, well-equipped air corps at all times and that such a corps would be a very necessary part of the Army.  I am not talking about an enormous force because that is something that we cannot afford.  If for nothing more than to train pilots in Baldonnel, a task which our Air Corps has always done excellently, it is well worth while to maintain an air corps.  I realise of course that it has other very important functions to fulfil.</P>
    <P>We should be told something more about the various units of the Army and the intentions of the Minister and the Government in relation to them. Are they to be completely run down or are they to be maintained at adequate strength?  What is the present position? There is no clear indication in the Minister's speech or from reports that we are able to get as to what exactly is the position in regard to various units of the Army.</P>
    <P>A newspaper suggested that Members of the House get up and talk about what will happen to Private So-and-So whose pension was cut because his service was a number of days short of the requisite qualifying period.  I do not <Col N="2182" /> think these matters are unimportant. They are extremely important.  Grievances beget discontent and this discontent affects recruitment.  Every public representative has a right to be concerned about small irritants that beget dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>I spoke at Question Time the other day about the methods of taxing Army personnel and of a situation in which a man with three children who had £19 a week was paying £5 a week for a house and who was called on suddenly to pay £6 a week tax.  The Minister has promised that this will be changed. I hope we never have a recurrence of this situation.</P>
    <P>There is the same sort of confusion about Army widows' pensions.  Most Deputies continually find there is confusion in regard to widows of persons who had military service pension or special allowance.  At the time when the pension was being made available some of us on this side of the House foresaw that this confusion would develop.  In some cases persons did not apply for special allowance, because they were too proud, until they became too poor and then they applied but were deprived. The Minister should reconsider this matter.  The only reason why persons got a special allowance was that they made an important contribution at the relevant time.  There are not many of them left.  All of these people should be included in the pension scheme.</P>
    <P>I also dealt with the free travel allowance.  I had a case where an extremely active old man, a veteran of the struggle for independence, got some little employment which necessitated his travelling earlier in the morning and later in the evening than the hours laid down in the Act.  For this reason it was decided that he could not be included in free travel scheme.  Surely there should be some provision for dealing with a special case of this kind. Surely it was the intention when we passed this legislation that that type of person would not be eliminated simply because of some little regulation or condition.</P>
    <P>I am just dealing at random with things that occur to me.  Going back for a moment to the FCA, the records <Col N="2183" /> indicate there is quite a number of people in the force, something like 20,000.  I wonder what is the effective number or if there has been a recent check on it.  What are the attendances and how available are those members and how adequately trained?  Is there any programme to change and to improve the amount of training they get? It is the opinion of all that the amount of continuous training is insufficient to equip the FCA for any serious task. We have had ample evidence in recent times that soldiering is a serious business, something that people cannot play at, and something will have to be done if the FCA are to get sufficient basic training to do the job as it should be done.  The Minister should comment on this when he is replying.  He should tell us if he envisages any improvements in the periods of training and whether he considers the present situation satisfactory.</P>
    <P>We had in existence and we used to be told something about an early warning system.  Is this system still in existence?  If so what is it doing?  It is extremely important that we should know.  The Minister spoke at some length about Civil Defence, but it is hampered without an early warning system.  I am afraid this has been neglected.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the lack of information generally and about the fact that the defence of the country and the security of the State are the responsibility and the equal concern of all and that therefore it should not be a plaything of party politics.  There must accordingly be something to be said for the setting up of some sort of defence committee that could visit freely Army establishments and consider the whole situation, not only visiting establishments but discussing problems and talking about future planning and a future programme for the Army.  Very little thought is being give from month to month and year to year to the Army.  It is time that some group sat down and seriously considered what are the tasks to be undertaken, what are the responsibilities, what are the normal methods for doing the work, how will the Army <Col N="2184" /> in the future be equipped if they are to undertake these responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Concerning the making of a career in the Army, it is important that people joining should have some idea that an interest would be taken in them when they are leaving the Army &mdash;that adequate settlement or resettlement arrangements would be made for them.  I realise that a start has been made on this but I do not think it is adequate.  It is more a voluntary arrangement than anything else, where it exists.  A group are set up in a particular camp, they take an interest, make contact with local industries and with people generally who are in a position to give employment and let them know they have people suitable to fill certain posts as they arise in the near future.  People joining the Army must be given an idea that when they leave they will not be redundant, that they will have a place to go into.</P>
    <P>Take the position of a commandant who has to retire at the age of 55 years.  Surely there should be some arrangement whereby that man, who most likely has a family at the most expensive stage of rearing, could be brought into the Civil Service side of Army administration.  Surely there is such a job for such a man.  He has been doing that work during his career and he could be given such a position, at a much reduced rate, of course.  In addition to his pension it would give him an income similar to what he had before retirement.</P>
    <P>Are the Army up to adequate strength?  Judging by the responsibilities we expect them to undertake and the enormous duties they are now carrying out, I think the strength of the Army would need to be doubled. If they are doubled and if things improve, as we all hope and pray they will, there must be then a peacetime role for the Army.  Far too little consideration has been given to this.  I can think of many ways in which the Army could be used in peacetime to the benefit of the nation as a whole and I am sure the Minister is aware of similar opportunities when the Army are not required as they are at the present time.</P>
    <P>I have spoken here before about the <Col N="2185" /> utilisation of Baldonnel Airport.  Here we have a first class airport and I suggest it should be used partly for ordinary commercial purposes and partly as an Army airport.  On numerous occasions we have had Dublin Airport fogbound and no fog whatever at Baldonnel.  Planes have had to return to England or to go to some other airport.  There have been occasions when both Shannon and Dublin Airports have been fogbound, with no fog at Baldonnel.</P>
    <P>There has been a very important trend towards the use of Army facilities for the benefit of people outside. There is evidence of this in the Equitation School and at the Curragh where swimming pool facilities and recreational facilities generally have been used both by the community outside and by Army personnel.  A working party were in existence for some time and I wonder if they are still there.  If so, what are they doing?  The Minister did not mention this but I have never heard they were disbanded.  The Minister should tell us if they are in existence and if so what they are considering at the moment &mdash; are they planning for the future or are they attempting to define the role of the Army of the future?</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister, in the course of dealing with the whole question of the Army, did not tell us whether any additional houses had been provided and what had been done to upgrade accommodation generally. This is something which is extremely important and it is something which all of us would like to know was progressing and progressing at a much faster pace than we have had for a long time.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is not taking his responsibilities seriously enough in the circumstances of the present time, circumstances in which we can be confronted any day with an overspill of violence from the North of Ireland and with the problems with which we would all wish to be confronted, if and when reunification is about to take place.  I think it is something which is going to come quite suddenly in the end and much faster than many people believe is possible at present.</P>

      <P>For many years in this <Col N="2186" /> House, the Defence Estimate was treated as something which was not terribly important and, usually, on looking around the benches, one found nobody except the Minister and the group of ex-Army Deputies who wanted to make their points, many of them remembering what happened when they were members of the Army. Looking around here today, I see that even they have disappeared and we now have only three or four people interested enough to come in to listen to the debate.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Clinton, who made an excellent speech, and I am rather surprised and disappointed, as he is, that a lot more information is not contained in the Minister's brief. Can I assume from the type of information which is given in the brief that the Minister considers that the best idea is to have a low-key speech which will play down the Estimate and give the impression that everything is going along grand, that there is no reason at all why anybody should get excited about what is happening in the Army or outside the Army?  This does appear, as I see it, to be the general idea and if it is, it is a pity. I am not just repeating a cliché when I say that at present one of the big problems in this country, and will be in 1972, is defence.  I think that anybody who underestimates the position, who thinks that if we have not got much of an Army it does not matter a whole lot and we are saving money, should have his head examined.  For that reason I feel that if the Estimate were for a very much larger sum, there would be no complaint from the Members of the House if the facts were explained to them, as I think they should be explained to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the £3 million extra referred to here as being brought in for increased equipment, I think the Minister has fiddled around a bit with the figures, if he will forgive my saying so, because the figure of £3 million was released, was then substituted by £2 million by somebody else claiming to speak for the Government and was subsequently increased again to £3 million.  It was supposed to be for a tremendous amount of new equipment to be ordered now and it was then <Col N="2187" /> disclosed by the Minister, in reply to questions as to details of how it was being spent, that it is being spent on necessary items ordered earlier this year.  Maybe I am being unfair to the Minister and to those in charge of the Army, and I must apologise if I am, but if I do not make a very big mistake, equipment is not alone very short but some of the equipment in use is positively dangerous.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the Defence Forces during the war, and at that time we were making do with old material, old equipment and old armaments, most of which had been handed down from the Defence Forces in the State for many years, with some little bought abroad.  Then we had the windfall of Dunkirk and the British had a lot of old stuff which they were not prepared to use in war conditions, and we got it.  This was new to us, being more advanced than anything we had got.  Some of the ammunition was not exactly safe, and in fact it was nearly as dangerous to us as it was to a possible enemy, but there was nothing else we could do &mdash; at least we had the stuff and we practised with it and it could be used if necessary.  Recently I saw that an explosion occurred with some of the same equipment we had in the early and mid-40s and if that is true, it is a little bit of a scandal.  It may not be true, but this is the story I have got.  I feel that we should have upgraded the equipment and ammunition the Army is using because an Army without ammunition, without modern equipment, is only playing with defence.</P>
    <P>The suggestion which some people are making is that the Defence Forces are strong enough &mdash; we have an Army and the FCA, and therefore we should not worry very much about defence. These people should rethink the position.  On a number of occasions I attempted to find out what the actual strength of the Army was.  I do not know whether the Minister played football before he came into the House or not, but he certainly defended very well.  Every time an effort was made to pin him down, he was a most elusive sort of individual, and it was impossible to find out if the position was as one <Col N="2188" /> suspected it was.  He gave the figures very freely, but it was almost impossible to find out whether or not the figures we got were figures which had been compiled in such a way that it was almost impossible to see what strength the Army had.</P>
    <P>Maybe that is all right; maybe that is the object of the exercise.  If it was, it succeeded very well because I still do not know what the actual strength of the Army is, in spite of questions which I put down &mdash; Regular Army, Reserve and FCA, formerly the Second Line Reserve.  I am under the impression, and I would like the Minister to correct me when he is replying, that the regular Army, counting all, both chiefs and Indians, the whole lot &mdash; officers, NCOs and men &mdash; cannot be very much more than about 3,000.  The Reserve consists, in the main, of people who have been in a long time ago.  The number of people who went out of the Army over the last ten or 15 years and on to the Reserve is, I understand, relatively small.</P>
    <P>Then, we have the FCA, and one thing which rather annoyed me recently &mdash;maybe I looked at it from a wrong angle &mdash; was the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the forming of the FCA. I think the Minister will agree with me when I point out that the FCA as such were not formed 25 years ago.  You simply changed the name from Local Defence Force to FCA, and in doing that, I think you were casting a slur on the people who had served right through the war years, or towards the end particularly when the LDF was formed and they resented the fact that you were writing them off and saying that as from today, the FCA have been formed and 25 years afterwards those who were in the FCA were referred to as having been in it within that period and everybody else was written off.  I have met a number of older folk who pointed out to me that they had had service and they considered that they were now being cut off completely. They wanted nothing from the State but recognition, and I personally think it was a mistake to give the impression to those who did not know that the force started 25 years ago this year.</P>
    <P>I believe an effort should be made <Col N="2189" /> to build up the Army.  I am all for the suggestion that the regular soldier who has been promoted to NCO rank and who has the necessary qualifications should be promoted to officer rank.  I believe that no matter what cracks are made about the chiefs and the Indians it is necessary to have a cadre of experienced officers around which a Defence Force can be built if and when the time comes.  Unless the Minister is prepared to face up to this he is not doing his job as Minister for Defence.  It is important to get people who know a little more about soldiers than many of the young people who pass through our hands and who will never be more than sergeants.  I have seen instructors of various grades who were excellent men but for one reason or another never went higher than that.  These men should be promoted. This was done in a fairly general way from among the volunteers in the mid-1930s.  These men became officers of the emergency Army.  There were thousands of young men like myself who hated Fianna Fáil but who still became members of the Army under a Fianna Fáil Minister because we believed in the necessity of defending the country.  Politics did not enter into it.</P>
    <P>At present there is a feeling that there is no point in joining the Army when one would be left to sweep out the billets or only be a room orderly unless one belongs to a local cumann and gets a good recommendation on entering the Army.  This is the general feeling among young men.  Every effort should be made to point out that that is not so.  The Army can promote young men and an Army career is a reasonably good job.  Army pay must keep pace with civilian pay.  The Army is a good career for young people who should be interested in the defence of their country.</P>
    <P>Nowadays you do not hear of district justices letting off young blackguards when they appear before them, on condition that they go to England or join the Army.  Such people are not wanted in any army.  Soldiers have a standing.  Whether we are for or against violence there is a standing which the <Col N="2190" /> men who wear the uniform for the purpose of defending their country should have.  There is an army spirit in other countries and our soldiers have it when the necessity exists for it.  They do not seem to get much respect in peace time.  That may be the fault of our society.  We do not understand the situation.  The more publicity which can be given to this the better it will be for the people in the Army in the future and for the people who are trying to recruit men now.</P>
    <P>We have complained before about Army uniforms.  Uniforms have been improved.  The Minister told me that he cannot do much about the boots because they serve a useful purpose. I suppose they served the same purpose 50 years ago and nothing much can be done about them.  Anything done to improve conditions helps those who wish to join the Army.  An effort should be made to improve the billets, living accommodation generally and food.  There have been improvements but they have not been as great as one would expect.  A start was made but it was not sustained.  There are many places where they have not got what one would expect in a modern home.  A member of the Defence Forces should expect in the barracks in peace time almost the same conditions as he would expect in his own modern home. The situation at Gormanstown where the men have to go to an outdoor toilet during the night is undesirable. Proper facilities should be provided. Deputies will have no objection to supplying the money.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The duties of the permanent Defence Force have been exceptionally heavy for some time past. Duties in aid of the civil power arising from the situation in the Six Counties have become more onerous. Special security duties, including Border patrols, are making increasing demands on manpower and equipment.</P>
    <P>The FCA have been doing a good job. With very little experience they have stepped in and with out-of-date equipment have made it possible to continue the defence of the country.  Without them this work could not have been <Col N="2191" /> done.  We cannot thank sufficiently the men who spend portion of their time off from work on the defence of their country.  We do not pay them much cash.  These facts cannot be repeated too often.</P>
    <P>It is about time that somebody told the gentlemen in Stormont when they complain about what is happening along the Border that there are thousands of British troops around Belfast and Derry terrorising the inhabitants and that these soldiers could be very well employed patrolling the Border.  If the British are not satisfied with the position they should be told that it is their job to patrol the Border. It is no good trying to give the impression that we are doing the best we can on this side of the Border.  This is not our job.  They are the people who are complaining and if they are not satisfied thousands of their troops who are blackguarding the civilian population in the North should patrol the Border. It is about time they realised that if they want the job done they should do it themselves.  The time is coming when the Taoiseach may request the United Nations to patrol our side of the Border.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton commented that the end of Partition may be nearer than any of us think.  An end could come to Partition quickly enough because the ordinary man in the street in Britain must be tired of the antics of the Britishers in the North.  It is possible that a decision could be taken that they can no longer afford the luxury of subsidising armed thugs in trying to pander to a certain group in the North. Some people are complaining about not being able to get television programmes from UTV or BBC 2.  The other night there were a number of these gentlemen talking about the situation &mdash; and these men are considered senior politicians &mdash; and it became quite clear after a while that they feared very much that they were coming close to a situation where it would not be a question of their withdrawing from the Commonwealth but, as one gentleman could see it, of being kicked out of it. Then one of them suggested that rather than come into the Republic they would opt for UDI.  I wish them luck, <Col N="2192" /> but if they did opt for UDI, it is quite possible we might need a United Nations force on the Border.  In any case in regard to putting our own people in jeopardy by posting them along the Border in an effort to protect the activities of these people on the far side of the Border, it is about time those concerned were told that it is not our job.  If this was brought home to them they might adopt a different attitude.  If they were up all day patrolling the Border they might find it less easy to stay up all night raiding Nationalist homes in Derry, Belfast, Newry and places like that.</P>
    <P>I was appalled at the apparent lack of action by the Minister for Defence when a member of the Irish Defence Forces, on a casual visit to Belfast, was locked up for a considerable period.  As soon as the Department of Defence discovered that he was locked up, the highest diplomatic representations should have been made to ensure that he was released and returned across the Border.  In my opinion, a member of the Irish Army is a very important person, whether he is a private or a colonel, and this should be brought home to the people in the North.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister had his tongue in his cheek when he said that recruitment was satisfactory.  He is an honest man and he must know as well as any of us here who take an interest in Army affairs that it could not be much more unsatisfactory.  Is it not true that as fast as people are being recruited others are leaving; that the strength of the Army has not been growing because (1) soldiers are leaving the Army after long service; and (2) young people cannot be persuaded to join?</P>
    <P>I know a number of married men who left the Army and who having left the shelter of that life &mdash; it might be surprising that somebody who has been in the Army for a long number of years should give it that description &mdash; found after a short time that the civilian world was not all milk and honey.  They attempted to re-enlist but some stupid regulation which was put in for the purpose of saving money, prevented trained soldiers, relatively young men, from re-enlisting.  It is cheaper to enlist young recruits than to re-engage <Col N="2193" /> married men who are entitled to a married allowance and perhaps children's allowances in respect of six, seven or eight children, but there is an enormous difference in the calibre of the two categories.  It is wrong that efforts should be made to prevent these people from re-enlisting when they discover they have made a mistake and want to serve for another three, four or maybe ten years.</P>
    <P>In regard to the United Nations peace-keeping force in Cyprus, on a number of occasions I have made the comment, which I now repeat, that I do not think in present circumstances they should be there.  We have done our share and nobody could blame the Irish nation if it is decided that this is the last group that will be sent there until things become normal in the thirty-two counties.  It is taking a tremendous risk sending out soldiers who must be the best, or almost the best, we have when they are more needed at home.  It is difficult to persuade the man who is doing 24-hour on and off guard duty that the strength of the Army is adequate and that there is no reason for bringing home the personnel who are serving in Cyprus.  Each group that went out there did a great job, as in the Congo, but I would say we have been over-generous in this. The fact that the United Nations do not appear to be anxious to pay for their services, since more than £500,000 is due to this country, is another strong reason for recalling our troops, but it would not be the main reason.  The main reason, I would claim, is that they are needed much more here.</P>
    <P>While our troops are there, however, might I make this suggestion to the Minister?  I understand that originally Irish planes flew our troops abroad.  Then there was a row over the cost and subsequently the contract was given to a foreign airline who flew them out at a cheaper cost. If this is true, I think it is wrong. Irish planes should fly our troops abroad; even if it costs a little more, the money is coming back into the economy.  It is a question of spoiling the ship for a hap'worth of tar, saving a few thousand dollars by hiring foreign aircraft and allowing all the <Col N="2194" /> money to go out of the country.</P>
    <P>It would be no harm if more frequent visits were paid by members of the Government or their representatives to those troops.  I understand that the other nations&mdash;maybe they are richer than we are &mdash; do this.  If troops are stationed away from home it must be heartening for them to see that somebody is interested in their welfare.  I do not know what conditions are like there for our troops, but I presume they are as good as those for other troops.  Somebody said an all-party committee should pay a visit there, but if that cannot be done, then why not have the Minister or somebody representing him go out there occasionally to show that these people are still remembered here during their few months out of the country?</P>
    <P>While other nations have been sending out the wives and families of troops on visits to Cyprus, not alone do we not do that but if people want to go out they are charged the full fare from Dublin to London.  From London out to Cyprus they pay a reduced fare because they are the wives and families of serving soldiers.  Would it not be possible to give some reduction to some token group who might like to go out there and see their men-folk. It is a very nice place even at Christmastime.  I heard Deputy Tunney talking about free telephone calls.  A free visit from some of their friends might be more acceptable to the troops, but at the very least the reduced fare which operates from London to Nicosia should operate from Dublin to London as well.  This would be appreciated and I am throwing out the suggestion to the Minister for what it is worth.</P>
    <P>He says 8,800 all ranks have done duty there.  I have not counted them, but that is not quite correct.  A number of them have travelled more than once.  I am quite sure the Minister is aware that there is a certain amount of jealousy among the ranks over who went and who did not go.  The fellow who had not gone at all felt he was being done down when somebody who had been there once or twice before was being sent again.  They are keeping up a very good tradition and along <Col N="2195" /> with the men who are on the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East they are doing a great job.  I again ask if they are required more here than they are there.  The Minister should decide before the end of 1971 that he will build up an Army which requires all the serving people he can get here in order to start it.</P>
    <P>Some years ago it was quite common to see groups of soldiers in this city or in the various towns they were stationed in, but it is not possible now.  The Army have got so small that they are either, as some of them said recently, coming off duty or going on duty and they find very little free time to engage in anything else.  I suggested before that during the war great efforts were made on the sporting field by Army teams.  This was encouraged by the Army and a fellow who could play some game if he did not get promotion he got some kind of a cushy job.  He did not have to do as much duty as anybody else, but it had the effect of building up a team spirit.  I suggested a greater effort should be made to try to look after sport in the Army.  There were some wonderful teams in the city and I believe an effort should be made to try this again. This might possibly encourage young men to join the Army.</P>
    <P>In addition to that there was the question of the Army band.  We still have an Army band.  It has not been scrapped like the Garda band.  There should be more Army bands of various types.  During the war and before it almost every battalion had its own band.  We had pipe bands and brass and reed bands.  There is no reason why the Army should not go into this in a big way in an effort to revive those bands.</P>
    <P>I made a plea on a previous occasion that an effort should be made to teach men in the Army some type of trade.  One of the boring things about Army life is that unless there is something going on to which the men can give their attention there is nothing to do except play cards.  Playing cards can become a rather expensive way of passing the time and there is also <Col N="2196" /> the position if somebody gets into the habit of just doing that he is not very well suited for civilian life afterwards. It is either that or fatigues.  You do not get any choice in regard to fatigues, but they are almost as bad for morale as card playing.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Clinton said earlier an effort should be made to draw up a programme which could be followed. It should not be the case of going on parade in an Army camp at 9 o'clock, keeping out of the way of whoever is in charge, not appearing again until after lunch, going on parade again and wondering how soon 4.30 would come until you got out of the place.  This is the routine which has to be followed by so many people because there is not anything else to do.  There are many interesting things to be done if there was some planning put into it. The Minister could use the time at his disposal, or get some of his excellent staff, to prepare something like this.</P>
    <P>I was rather amused by the reference in the Minister's brief to the helicopters. When the Army first bought them a Minister for Defence solemnly announced they could not be spread around the country as it was necessary to have what he called a nest of helicopters, consisting of three and to have one operative you must have three. Like the late Thady Lynch and the fishery protection vessels I fear before very long they will start cannibalising them and we will finish up with one because that is what happened the fishery protection vessels.  However, the helicopters seem to have survived.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the Army planes.  I wonder if a limited number of planes and far more helicopters might not, in fact, be better than the type of planes that we have.  I accused the Taoiseach last week of laughing at the Army planes in Gormanston Camp.  Maybe I was unfair to him but I felt the phrase he used suggested he did not think much of them and he did not expect anybody else would either.  Deputy Byrne referred to the British planes which had flown over the area to take aerial photographs and I suggested since Gormanston military camp was there with a number of first-class planes possibly that might <Col N="2197" /> be the reason.  The Taoiseach wanted to know if I was suggesting they were trying to find out what kind of planes we had, and did they not know the old type of planes we had there.  I suppose they did, but that is not the fault of the people who fly them.  It is the fault of the Government.  If we are supposed to have an air force then we should have one.</P>
    <P>I know aeroplanes cost a lot of money, but I suggest that we should have a small number of effective, modern planes and in addition have helicopters which can be used for so many things and which would in my opinion be very useful if we needed them in defence here.  We do not have long distances to fly to bomb enemy cities or anything like that so bomber planes would be out of it.  Gormanston Camp, during the war, had an extraordinary selection of planes landing there.  Some of them flew down, landed and flew off again when they were permitted. Deputy Clinton spoke about Baldonnel being the ideal place to use if Dublin Airport was closed by fog but it might not be a bad idea if a little money was spent on the airport at Gormanston.  It is very often open, because of its peculiar situation near the sea, when other airports are closed down by fog.  It could be used on such occasions.  I am glad to see that the Minister is buying a fourth helicopter and I suggest he might try to scrape up the money to buy more than one.</P>
    <P>I do not want to comment too much on the Naval Service because I do not know much about it.  However, I understand that the new vessels which we have got are not suitable for going out in rough weather and they are so slow that the poacher who is poaching within the extended limit can easily get away, that in fact the poacher who allows himself to be caught by one of our new fishery protection vessels deserves to be caught.  This is the description which has been given of them and I am afraid it is not very complimentary. Possibly when the new vessel which is being built is put into service the situation might change.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to university training of Army cadets and young officers and he said that this training <Col N="2198" /> continues in a satisfactory manner.  I am interested in the figures given by the Minister: Faculty of Arts, seven; Faculty of Science, four; Faculty of Commerce, two and Faculty of Engineering, one.  Those were the figures in 1969.  In 1970 the figures are: Faculty of Arts, four; Faculty of Commerce, four; Faculty of Science, seven. The Minister also tells us that a further 28 cadets of the 1970 class commenced their university studies in October this year; 12 are pursuing courses in Arts, 12 in Commerce, one in Science and three in Engineering.  Do the cadets make a choice as to the Faculty they will pursue?  The Arts Faculty is somewhat overcrowded &mdash; that is possibly the understatement of the year&mdash;and the Commerce Faculty is pretty close behind it.  If these young people intend to stay in the Army there is not much use in training them in something they will not need.  Training should be for the purpose of equipping them for something which will be useful if they stay in the Army.  The same is true if they do not intend to make the Army their career.  The Faculties they are pursuing are not ones which are very saleable in this country at the moment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the training of NCOs and privates in vocational schools, again this is a good idea.  I would, however, prefer that they should be trained in something which will be useful to them as part of their Army career.  Some years ago I was in Teheran.  The Shah had the reputation of doing things with which some people disagreed.  He introduced a system with regard to army officers.  Most of the people were illiterate and he arranged for army officers to teach in schools as part of their initial training. He had the right idea.  During the day the children were taught and the parents came along at night.  Within two or three years an almost illiterate nation had been turned into a semi-literate nation or something even better.  I do not suggest the same necessity arises here, but the Shah certainly had the right way of thinking. The Minister might usefully study this whole question of education in the Army and find out whether or not the idea of allowing a limited number to take outside education courses is <Col N="2199" /> the right way of doing things.  Would it not be better if they were taught within the Army?  Side by side with teaching them the arts of war they could be taught the arts of peace. That would pay a rich dividend.  I give the idea to the Minister for nothing.</P>
    <P>In the apprentice school the standards are very strict.  I know a very keen young man who was rejected because, it was alleged, he had a cast in one eye.  Afterwards the doctor explained to me that he had what was, in his opinion, a lazy eye.  This young man went out into civilian life and did extremely well.  I always regretted that he was not allowed to do well in the Army.  There was really nothing wrong with his sight.  He wanted to train as a fitter.  I think he could have done the job just as well in the Army as he eventually did it outside.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the sleeping accommodation is not satisfactory.  A sum of £42,500 has been provided but so far, the Minister says, nothing has been done but a start will soon be made on new billets.  Why was a start not made before this?  This is something which should have got priority.</P>
    <P>We saw the cadets from Zambia marching down O'Connell Street.  They have to be trained and, provided the training does not cost us anything, there is no objection to it.</P>
    <P>For the first time we have an overall figure of 5,409 refugees.  I am sorry there are still 200 refugees in Kilworth in Cork.  We must not allow people to become permanent refugees.  If they do not intend to go back, then an effort should be made to take them out of the camp and place them in houses.  It is mainly women and young children who are living in these unnatural conditions and it is not a comfortable living no matter what people may do for them.  An Army camp is not suitable for families.  Every effort should be made to get as many as possible housed in towns throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am glad Gormanston was used as a transit camp only.  It is one of the most uncomfortable camps in the country. During my time in it in the early <Col N="2200" /> forties it was a very uncomfortable place.  It has not improved with age. Because it was so close to the Border it did attract a number of people, some from this city, indeed, who developed northern accents in order to get in there for a short period.  It is not an ideal place for refugees and I am glad it was used as a transit camp only.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite right in thanking the various organisations which helped.  I am sure should a similar situation arise in the future &mdash; I hope it will not &mdash; these organisations will be just as willing to help.</P>
    <P>The Civil Defence officers are local authority officers as well and that tended to create a situation in which the organisations fitted very well into each other.  That might not have been possible had there been no liaison between them.  The man in charge of Civil Defence in my area, Jerry Dwyer, did a fantastic job.  He was up night and day and the harder the work the more he seemed to enjoy it.  I believe his colleagues were the same.  The Red Cross, the Order of Malta and the St. John Ambulance Brigade all did trojan work.  The local residents were very generous when called on.</P>
    <P>The Civil Defence, like the FCA, is a peculiar organisation in that on paper it looks as though it has a tremendous strength but in actual fact its strength is not so great.  On a number of occasions I have preached the gospel that nothing is too good for those who are seriously helping to keep either of those organisations in existence but it is a pity there are so many hangers-on. Somebody who has been trained in Civil Defence can be brought back should the occasion arise, provided he retains his training, and be of use. In relation to the FCA I am not so happy about training people in the use of Army equipment, whether it is old or new, and then allowing them to leave the force still carrving that expertise in their minds.  This is a danger to the country and something which should be guarded against if at all possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the Drogheda incident.  There is an inquiry going on and I know therefore that the <Col N="2201" /> Minister cannot be expected to comment on it.  When FCA men are training inside a building it is no way to guard the building by putting somebody on guard either inside or outside the building with instructions to halt people but no instructions about what to do if the people do not halt.  I am quite sure there is not an FCA man in the country who would know what to do if in fact two or three men rushed the post he was defending.  He would be very slow to fire a weapon at these men. I am not blaming FCA men for that but definite orders must be given as to how sentries are to react.  Definite orders will also have to be given to all those who carry arms under any circumstances. It is entirely wrong to blame them or regular Army sentries who are on duty for something they were not prepared for or could not be prepared for.  If they had shot two or three people, or all of them, as they very well could have, there would have been an outcry and they would have been the first to be blamed.  The Minister has got to think very deeply about this.  He must ensure that all Army personnel, whether they be regular Army or FCA, have strict instructions on when to carry arms and how to carry arms.  If official drilling is going on sentries should be placed in a position where they will be useful and not placed in a position where they are the first target with not a hope if something should start.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the officer.  I do not know who the officer was but I wonder what any of us would have done if we were in his position when a photographer set off a flashbulb in his face while taking a picture after the incident had occurred.  The officer concerned probably reacted in the same way as any of us would have done.  I know the pressmen concerned are decent reasonable people and I am sure they would be the first to agree now that the officer's reaction was not an attack on them; nobody was going to shoot them or anything like that, it was simply a natural reaction in a tense situation.  It is a pity so many people are inclined to treat the incident in Drogheda as a bit of a joke and think the people concerned in it were not very efficient or effective.  I should love <Col N="2202" /> to know what any of these experts would have done if they were in the position in which those men found themselves.  Would they have fired a shot in a crowded hut with the risk of killing more than one person or would they have done what these men did, decided that the position was hopeless and therefore allowed the guns to be taken from them?  It is a matter about which the Army Council and the Minister for Defence will have to make up their minds and very definite orders will have to be given because that sort of thing injures the morale of the Army more so than anything else.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the death of the late Chief of Staff, Major-General Patrick Delaney.  His loss is felt in the Army.  It is a pity he should have had such an untimely end.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton referred to Army pensions in detail and the Minister also referred to them in certain detail. There are two things wrong with them: one is that the pensions in general are too small and the other is that the tests applied before an Army pension or a widow's pension is given are too stringent.  It is a shocking thing that people who have given long service to the State should have to produce evidence that they could not be reasonably expected to have in their possession in order to qualify for a very small amount of money.  This is causing a great deal of annoyance and it should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister said, in relation to free travel:</P>
    <P>Because of the popularity of the scheme, and because of increases in the charges by CIE, the cost of free travel this year will require a Supplementary Estimate of some £260,000.  This brings the cost of free travel this year to £320,000.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister mean that the original cost was only £60,000 because that, in fact, is what he is saying?  I believe a mistake must have been made.  It is not very important, it is a relatively small amount of money, but if it is wrong the Minister might like to correct it when he is replying.</P>
    <P>With regard to free travel I understand the pensioner can travel with his <Col N="2203" /> wife on his ticket but if the pensioner is sick or unable to travel the wife cannot get free travel without him.  I said on another Estimate that wives have to do what happens here occasionally when there is a very tight vote taking place &mdash; bring their husbands along on stretchers if they want to avail of free travel.  This is ridiculous.  Free travel should be made available for the pensioner and his wife.  The Department fear that he may die and she may use the travel voucher but surely as the widow of a pensioner she should be entitled to use it for a period?  I suggest the Minister should try to find some way around this.  A number of people have complained to me that they wanted to go here or there to do business for their husbands who were ill but as their husbands were unable to travel with them they could not travel alone because they could not afford the fare.  Who can afford CIE fares at the present time?</P>
    <P>Everyone has been complaining about the cratering of Border roads by British troops.  One of the main reasons for complaint is that by cratering Border roads farmers who live on one side of the Border and have land on the other side of the Border find they may have to go five or six miles to a place which was originally 100 yards from their homes.  I live very close to Gormanston Camp.  There are two gates to it, a front gate and a back gate. For as long as I can remember the front gate was open all night, there were military police on it, and the back gate was open until 12 o'clock and either a military policeman or a barrack policeman went on that gate. There are civilians who have lived all their lives in the camp and naturally some of them have land, friends and business outside the camp.  Six weeks ago somebody decided the back gate should be closed at 4.30 p.m. and as a special concession it was decided to close it at 5 o'clock.  This means that people who want to get to their land or to do business outside or visit one of the houses situated near the back gate have to go half a mile down to the front gate and three miles around to the back gate and when they are finished return the same distance.  If it <Col N="2204" /> is a question of a shortage of personnel I am sure someone could be found to do the 5 o'clock to 12 o'clock stint each week on the back gate.  I suggest to the Minister that this is something that leaves a bad taste.  There is no reason why it should happen.  The Minister should, without waiting for anybody else, say that if during the emergency it was safe to leave that gate open until 12 o'clock it should still be safe to do so.  I do not want to go any further with it.  I am sorry I had to raise it here: I had hoped to have a reply about this matter before the Estimate came up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton commented on the role of the Army in EEC conditions. As the Minister is aware, we are opposing EEC entry.  Despite that we hear again and again from the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and others that there are no defence commitments in joining EEC.  The Taoiseach in Paris on one occasion and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other Ministers in this House and outside on numerous occasions made the comment and repeated it parrot-like that a Europe worth joining was a Europe worth defending.  If that does not mean that if we enter Europe we are prepared to enter into defence commitments, would the Minister please explain what exactly it means?  I believe the Government firmly intend, if asked to enter into defence commitments, despite the fact that we have been traditionally neutral, to enter into such commitments and guarantee to take part in the defence of Europe.  If we do so we will become embroiled in any future war.  Not only that, but since it is impossible at present to get an army to defend this country, the only method by which troops could be supplied in a big way for the defence of Europe would be by conscription. I should like the Minister to think over that because it appears to have been glossed over by many people except that when it suits, the saying &ldquo;a Europe worth joining is worth defending&rdquo; is trotted out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton referred to something else about which I feel very strongly.  I do not believe members of the Defence Forces should be <Col N="2205" /> allowed to take an active part in politics if the Government feel they should not do so but it is ridiculous that a member of the Defence Forces is not allowed to make a complaint or an inquiry to a politician.  We all have to conform to the stupid assumption that the complaint has been made otherwise than by the soldier while nobody knows exactly what happened except the soldier himself.  A certain amount of political freedom might be granted.  I joined the Army during the last war despite the fact that I bitterly opposed Fianna Fáil as a Labour supporter but it did not stop me or thousands of others from being loyal members of the Defence Forces.  The Minister should think over this because I understand quite a number of soldiers do take part in political activities and might as well do so legally. Trying to cover things up is a mistake.</P>
    <P>There should be much greater liaison between the Army and the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen.  While ONE have been given a certain amount of recognition, successive Ministers for Defence have shied away from going close to ONE.  They are an organisation of national ex-servicemen and within their ranks are members of every political party.  Deputy Dowling and I were vice-presidents of ONE at one time until we became too busy and had to drop out.  In the organisation are people of all shades of political opinion and of all creeds and classes.  I believe they are doing a good job in looking after, as best they can, those who leave the Army, particularly those who are not doing well. It would be a good thing if they could get more recognition.  The Minister may not be aware that a number of ONE branches exist in Northern Ireland and the people who come from the North have proved themselves, if anybody doubts it, just as Irish as we are.  They also proved this during the war by joining the Irish Army.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to tax deductions. I suggest to Deputy Clinton that the man he spoke about who had £6 per week deducted from his income was one of those who decided last April that he did not want any tax <Col N="2206" /> deductions made.  If his tax deductions in April were £3 a week and no tax was deducted for six months, at the end of that period until the end of the tax year deductions naturally would be £6 a week.  Some people have asked to have the Army and other State employees put on PAYE.  I will repeat what I said here before and which was misreported by somebody who did not get the drift of it in the Press Gallery &mdash;they are usually very accurate.  The State employees who are paying tax are paying on last year's income; if they go on PAYE they will pay on this year's income.  I did not say civil servants were getting away without paying tax, as was reported in some papers.  If they were paying tax on this year's income their last increase in 1970 would be taxable whereas it is not taxable because they are being taxed on the previous year's income. For that reason it should not be difficult for the Department of Defence or for any other State Department to make arrangements at the beginning of the tax year and to tell an employee: &ldquo;You earned £X in the last 12 months and therefore your tax for the next 12 months will be so much.&rdquo; This can and should be done.  It would save people from themselves. It would save the fellow who thinks he is getting away with it by not paying anything for six months and then cursing when he is caught in the last few months of the year for the whole amount.  This happens many of them and then they come to Deputy Clinton and myself and, I am sure, to every other Deputy, complaining that the Department are terribly unfair in taking a lot of money off them.  I have shown why it is being taken off and it could be very easily avoided if the Minister made the necessary arrangements, as I have suggested, making it compulsory that at least the same amount should be deducted this year from the very start as was deducted in the previous year.</P>
    <P>I consider that the Army in this country, as in every other country, are doing an excellent job.  In times of war or emergency everybody thinks the Army are great but in peacetime soldiers do not get the respect they deserve.  The general public should <Col N="2207" /> have more respect for the Army.  The system which operated before in this city and which has died out, whereby a uniformed soldier would not be turned away from the door as I understand has happened, but would be allowed in at a reduced rate or perhaps free to certain functions, should be restored.  Soldiers should be treated as the special people they are, the people defending the State.</P>
    <P>If our &ldquo;friends&rdquo; across the Border, or if Mr. Heath or Sir Alec Douglas Home are worried about people crossing the Border, let them take their thousands of troops out of Belfast and Derry and put them along the Border.  They are the people who created the Border, we did not create it.  If they are worried about it they should make their own arrangements to look after the Border.  If they did that they would have less time to persecute and act in the manner in which they have been acting against the ordinary people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been very helpful to other Deputies and myself who have brought problems to his notice.  I know that the examination that he is carrying out will result in a much improved Force.  It is the duty of Deputies to have a long hard look at our Defence Forces.  The Estimate for this Department is important but frequently it is overlooked by many Deputies.  However, many of us wish to do something to help those people who have given valuable service to our country.  All of us are proud of the part played by Irish soldiers in the Congo, Cyprus and other areas.  It is a proud boast of people who have served abroad that they did their duty in the interests of peace and justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many defects in the Defence Forces that need to be remedied. I understand there will be a recruiting campaign in the future but I hope it will not be a repetition of that conducted in the past.  The last campaign was a disaster; it was badly-timed, coming up to the holiday period when people were not inclined to leave their homes.  Use should be made of military <Col N="2208" /> bands and the equipment at the disposal of the Army should be displayed to the young people; the campaign should not be confined to an advertisement in the newspapers or a silly advertisement on television.  During the Emergency there was considerable success with recruitment and at that time use was made of the military bands which paraded through towns. I hope the new campaign will be well thought out and will not repeat the mistakes of the past.</P>
    <P>New recruits will expect to have reasonable conditions when they enter the services.  In this city the accommodation available is not all that it should be and I hope this matter will be rectified at an early date.  The matter of uniforms is important.  If one walks down O'Connell Street nowadays, one seldom sees a soldier in uniform. Is it because he is ashamed of the shabby uniform?  Attention should be given to this matter; the soldier should not be issued with the same type of uniform as in the past.  People who come from good homes expect a reasonable degree of comfort in the Army.  Some of the barracks have adequate accommodation; in the newer barracks cubicles have been erected&mdash; as has happened at Kickham Barracks in Clonmel and in other barracks.</P>
    <P>The situation in relation to peacetime work is different to that obtaining in times of war.  There tends to be a greater gap between the officers and the NCOs in peacetime than when soldiers are abroad on service.  When they are abroad there is a greater sense of co-operation and comradeship and it is desirable that this should continue when members of the Force return to this country.  However, this kind of understanding is not always evident in peacetime.  The personnel who have served abrod are conscious of this and they hope if there is a return to peacetime soldiering with no overseas service the same type of co-operation will be maintained.</P>
    <P>The problems of the soldiers are varied.  I am mainly concerned about the NCOs because I think the officers are able to look after themselves, although I am conscious of some of their problems.  Suggestions have been made <Col N="2209" /> from time to time for the betterment of the service but when they are made by the NCOs they are seldom heeded; unless the suggestion comes from someone at the top it is disregarded.  We should bring about a situation whereby suggestions and complaints made by NCOs will receive attention.  Many of the NCOs have had long service; they have been through the Emergency period and have continued in the Army since that time.  Many of the improvements suggested would not have cost anything but the suggestions were disregarded.  Some kind of committee should be set up in which the NCOs could participate.  We speak about involvement in industry and management but there is pressing need for such involvement in the Army. NCOs and officers serve on sports committees but not on any committee that might affect the lives of the soldiers.  There are many intelligent men in the Army, men who have given long service, and their suggestions and advice should be heeded.  This might result in improving the lot of the ordinary soldier.</P>
    <P>We know that the personnel who served in Cyprus and in the Congo have done a wonderful job.  Their standard of morale and conduct is very high.  When we see other forces such as the British forces carrying out the type of atrocities that we have seen on our fellow countrymen in the North we can make comparisons and see how civilised our people are in comparison with the occupation forces that occupy some portions of the country in the guise of security forces.  We hope we know that our people will never try to ape the type of campaign that we have seen waged so close to us by foreign soldiers.</P>
    <P>We have learned many vital lessons from overseas service.  There are still investigations to be made in relation to the adjustments that have to be made.  Overseas service has provided a very large fund of knowledge on many matters that were overlooked here in the past and has given us a greater insight into many problems of peacetime and wartime service.  I hope the lessons will not be lost.  I hope that before the personnel who have been <Col N="2210" /> overseas are released from service they will have an opportunity to properly document their experiences and ensure that the Army will benefit from the views and suggestions not only of the officers but also of the NCOs and men who have served so wisely and so well.</P>
    <P>Fatigue duties have been mentioned. A soldier is a soldier and that is his job just as a tradesman in an industry does a particular job.  Making dish cloths out of soldiers by having them on permanent fatigue duties is something that must be terminated.  People have been on permanent fatigue duties from the time they entered the service just because somebody disliked them or wanted to divert individuals away from a particular line.  It is deplorable that at this stage we should be concerned about fatigue duties for soldiers. They have a very real job to do.  With the development of different types of equipment they should be fully occupied in learning and in being instructed in these developments.  Fatigue duty must be cut out.  If there are menial jobs in the barracks there are many civilians, many ex-servicemen, on the labour exchange who could be called in.  There are too many people leaving the armed services and ending up occupying menial jobs such as petrol pump attendants.  In the barracks, in this House, as Deputy Tully said, and in all the Government services there are many jobs which should be and must be retained for people who have given the best years of their lives to the armed services, the Garda Síochána or other services.  There must be a special place for them.  All over the world there is specially reserved employment for ex-servicemen.  As Deputy Tully said what better place to start than Leinster House.  If the Government will not give a lead in reserving employment in military posts, in the Houses of the Oireachtas and elsewhere for ex-servicemen we cannot expect outside employers to do it.  I consider it proper that some jobs should be reserved.  In Britain and elsewhere there are many jobs reserved for ex-servicemen.  They have quite a number of disabled ex-servicemen.  We are fortunate that we have not.  Some <Col N="2211" /> of the jobs are menial with small pay but the pay plus their disability benefit brings them up to the normal income level.  We should have a pool of employment available to ex-servicemen. It is regrettable that so many men leave the service and end up as petrol pump attendants and even worse.</P>
    <P>The day of the officer's orderly in the Army has gone, the day when soldiers had to scrub the officers' floors and in some cases wash the napkins for the colonel's wife.  A soldier is a soldier.  All this nonsense about officers' orderlies polishing floors and washing napkins is disgusting.  We should get rid of this type of duty. Fatigue duty is a tag attached to a variety of duties which includes washing cars which belong to other people.  A soldier should be respected and he should be relieved of the disgusting type of carry-on that is a throwback to other armies.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government must make up their minds in relation to new barracks.  It is ridiculous that in the centre of this city we have possibly half a dozen barracks.  We are not keeping up with the modern development.  One bomb or one raid could throw our entire service out of gear.  We need barracks removed from the city with bomb proof services.  One on the north and one on the south side would be desirable.  I slept in Collins Barracks.  It is a barracks similar to many others I have slept in with cold rooms and very bad accommodation. Our soldiers deserve better than this.  The Minister and the Government must decide to build something new that will provide a degree of comfort, something that will enable the military commanders to exercise a greater measure of confidence in relation to the movement of personnel. This is a factor at present.  The blocking off of two roads can dislocate the entire armed services.  This is a ridiculous situation.  The time is past for using the crutches we have in this city.</P>
    <P>The vast portion of land that is occupied by Cathal Brugha Barracks could be made available for housing. <Col N="2212" /> it would be an ideal housing site and one that any local authority or any developer would be glad to acquire.  The price that it would fetch on the market would probably be sufficient for the development of a modern military barracks.  There is not much point in spending vast amounts of money on a system of piecemeal repairs.  Anyone visiting the Curragh can see there the dilapidated condition in which much of the accommodation is, but nobody appears to be concerned to any great extent with the problem.</P>
    <P>In so far as the present location of barracks are concerned, the hazards are high and the Government must put off no longer the development of military barracks on both the north and south sides of the city.  They must give consideration also to the Curragh Camp.  I do not think that the Curragh, as a military post, is as important, at this stage, as some people seem to think.  I would not be against the reconstruction of some barracks. Kickham Barracks in Clonmel, which were burned down during the Civil War period, were rebuilt by the Army Corps of Engineers.  I spent a couple of years in those barracks during the war and when I visited the barracks recently I saw evidence of the great improvements that have been carried out there.  There is a corps of men in the Army who are capable of carrying out major developments such as those carried out at Kickham Barracks.  I hope that priority will be given to accommodation, to the disposal of military barracks and to the erection of new barracks.</P>
    <P>I shall deal now with the question of married quarters.  Some of these are a disgrace, particularly those at McKee Barracks.  If we are to have married quarters at all, the accommodation offered must be decent.  I have the greatest sympathy for the unfortunate people who have to live in the outmoded accommodation that is available. Another feature of this accommodation that is undesirable is that it is behind the barrack walls.  The provision of married quarters should be a matter to be provided for in the capital budget.  It should be divorced from this particular Estimate.  Also, the Department <Col N="2213" /> of Local Government, who are concerned with housing people generally, should consider the question of married quarters because it is not fair that by virtue of being a soldier a man is denied the right to a proper home. I would suggest, therefore, that married quarters be built outside the barrack precincts and that they be the responsibility of some body other than the Army.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the difficulty experienced by the Army in relation to overholders.  These people have served the country well and they cannot be left on the side of the road with no hope of accommodation.  Many of these people have been moved during the years from military post to military post and they now find that there is no hope of them being rehoused.  Usually their families are grown up and have gone away and, so, they are not given priority on a waiting list.  In some cases they are rehoused on compassionate grounds by local authorities, but that is a matter that is left to the discretion of the local authorities.  It would be much better to abolish married quarters altogether rather than to continue offering the type of accommodation that is available.  This accommodation is not suitable in any way for family life.  An effort has been made at the Curragh to recondition many of the old married quarters but, perhaps, the situation there is different to that in the city.  While there have been some improvements at Connolly Barracks, there are married quarters at McDonagh Barracks that are appalling.  Many farmers have sheds for their dogs that are bigger than the dwellings in which some people at McDonagh Barracks are being accommodated.  People who have served the nation well must not be expected to live in second-rate accommodation.</P>
    <P>In some of the barracks there is a real problem involved, for instance, in keeping paper on the walls.  The devices I have seen used by some soldiers for this purpose were ingenious but in spite of their efforts the paper would not stay on the particular type of walls in their quarters.  There are stone floors in the dwellings but surely we have gone past that stage.  Much discontent <Col N="2214" /> is bred by bad married quarters and not in the barracks.  A soldier will tolerate a lot, but his wife and family, particularly if they are moving from large good accommodation to small cramped accommodation, will soon see the defects.</P>
    <P>The re-housing of personnel is very important.  When a soldier has about ten or 11 years to serve there should be personnel in the service to brief him properly.  He should realise at that stage that, when he has finished his Army service of 21 or possibly 30 years, he will have to face the conditions at the end of the line.  He should ask himself does he want to end up in married quarters as an over-holder? If he does not, he should know that there are certain grants available from local authorities to help him to purchase his own house.  In fact, the Army should assist him to purchase his own house.  He should be made fully aware of all the advantages that are available to personnel at a stage when he is in a better position to decide on purchasing his own home.  This type of advisory service is necessary and desirable.</P>
    <P>I understand that certain officers have been assigned to this type of work in recent times and to this type of social planning.  There should be some type of educational service to make the private soldier or the NCO fully aware of the situation while he still has about ten years to think ahead and to assess his future properly.  I was speaking in this House last night to an over-holder, a person who has served for 31 years, and who has been thrown overboard by the local authority. He was feeling very resentful.  The corporation told him they would do nothing for him because his family is too small.  If this person had been confronted with this problem ten or 15 years ago when he had his family to assist him, and if he had been properly advised, he would now be in his own home and would be independent of the local authorities and the Army. By virtue of the fact that he is an over-holder he is occupying a unit of accommodation that somebody wants, bad as it is.  I would not suggest for a moment that these people should be fired out, but people who have given <Col N="2215" /> long service should get some consideration.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consult with the Minister for Local Government and work out some system in the various centres; in Clonmel, Mullingar, Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway. There are not so many local authorities involved.  Land is available.  I do not see why this matter cannot be solved in a very short time.  We have had the development in Ballymun and St. Michael's estate and we know how speedily a development like the one in St. Michael's estate or in Sarah Place can be carried out to provide good homes for people.  The nation should make available land and money to ensure that this problem is solved. These are slums just as Keogh Square was a slum, and the other areas which were demolished.  These are substandard buildings and some of them are worse than the buildings were in the areas that have been abolished.  I hope the Minister will give me an assurance that something positive will be done.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest that if land is available adjacent to a barracks there is no reason why the Army Corps of Engineers could not build houses on it for Army personnel.  There are skilled technicians, carpenters, plasterers and bricklayers in the Army Corps of Engineers. They have rebuilt barracks. They worked on St. Bricin's Hospital and they did other jobs.  There is no reason why they could not build houses.  This would give them an opportunity to develop their talents further. Bricklaying, plastering and plumbing are limited in the everyday life of a soldier.  There are many men in the various sections of the Army Corps of Engineers who would be glad of the opportunity to devote some weeks or months to perfecting their knowledge and to acquiring further knowledge of house-building and up-to-date development.  Some of these tradesmen feel that they have not got the opportunity to keep abreast of developments in the house-building industry. When they reach the end of the line they feel that their effectiveness is limited.  For that reason their skills and their crafts should be utilised. This would fulfil the twofold <Col N="2216" /> purpose of getting houses built at no very great cost to the Army and of housing the personnel.</P>
    <P>The question of the re-settlement of ex-servicemen is very important.  While serving, the NCO or the man is said to be the backbone of the Army but when he puts on his &ldquo;Martin Henry&rdquo; and is pushed outside the gate, he is completely forgotten as an individual. We must follow the man into civilian life.  We should have a director of technology or somebody like that to advise the soldier about his retirement at least ten years before he retires. We talk about the re-training of personnel for industry, but what about the soldier who has spent so many years serving the nation and serving the cause of peace and justice in the Congo and Cyprus and elsewhere? What happens to him when he reaches the labour market?  Some of these people are completely unskilled and, therefore, the labour market is very limited.  If a man has no skill and is entering the labour market today, he must find himself at the bottom of the queue, and many soldiers find themselves at the bottom of the queue after long years of service.</P>
    <P>There should be somebody to say: &ldquo;We will give you a skill.  We will give you something in addition that you will have when you leave the service.  There is a variety of jobs which we can train you for.  Which do you want?&rdquo;  It could even be driving. If the opportunity were there many of them would avail of it.  We have a responsibility to these people, a very major responsibility.  If a situation developed here in which the armed forces were called into action we would have a great understanding of and a great sympathy for these men while the fight was on, as Deputy Tully said. It is the same in every country, but when the war is over the position is different.  This applies everywhere although some countries have given greater thought to the re-settlement of Army personnel than others.</P>
    <P>We have AnCO and we have the apprenticeship training school in Naas. That training school should be further developed so that it could take in personnel who have obtained a limited <Col N="2217" /> amount of knowledge from courses in vocational schools or elsewhere.  It could be expanded to provide a &ldquo;brushing up&rdquo; service for people with some knowledge of engineering or woodwork who want to develop their knowledge before going on to the labour market.</P>
    <P>I am glad to know that contacts have been made with AnCO to ensure that re-settlement is possible.  There is a large number of people serving in the forces and the opportunities to attend courses are limited and generally go to very selected personnel.  An advice and guidance service should be instituted which would help in the preparation of men for civilian life.  Many of the men that I served with have made the grade, others did not and I have seen them coming out in recent times and being told that they are too old for employment.  It is pitiful that these men should have to search for employment. We find the local authority saying to such men that they are too old at 40. In regard to one skilled man the Dublin Corporation say they will not employ him because he is over 40.  It is not right that ex-servicemen who have served the nation for 30 years should be deprived of employment with a local authority.  It is a shame that any local authority or any State or semi-State organisation should indicate that a man who has served the nation so well for so many years is too old at 40 for employment in their organisations. That matter must be corrected.  Men who have served the nation have been victimised and that situation should not be allowed to continue.  When one makes representations to a local authority on behalf of an ex-serviceman one is asked how old he is and then one is told he is not wanted at that age.</P>
    <P>The question of reserving a number of jobs within military barracks or in State and semi-State organisations for ex-servicemen should be considered. That is done in other countries and it should be done here.</P>
    <P>A man may die immediately prior to retirement leaving his widow with a large family of young children.  She finds herself in dire difficulty and the pension she gets is of little use.  In <Col N="2218" /> other countries the widow, in such circumstances, receives free instruction to enable her to take up employment and the children are given educational training.  It should not be beyond the powers of the State here to provide such instruction for the widows of deceased servicemen so that she may be able to take up employment and rear her family in some sort of comfort. Many widows of ex-servicemen would be glad of the opportunity to take up employment following suitable training. Positions could be found for them in military barracks, in State and semi-State concerns.  They should not be directed merely to jobs as cleaners.  It is always the most menial jobs that are offered to widows of ex-servicemen. The widows of men who have served the nation are entitled to more than they are getting.  The children and widows of ex-servicemen should be protected.  The Minister should consider this matter.</P>
    <P>I had an opportunity, with members of a committee of the House, to visit the apprenticeship school at Naas and to examine the position there.  We were all impressed.  One of the problems that we brought to the Minister's attention was referred to in his speech, that is, the lack of suitable accommodation for the young boys serving in the apprenticeship school.  I am glad to note that a substantial amount of money is being made available and that young boys who have left good homes will be able to have reasonable comfort during their period of training.  It is all-important that there should be decent accommodation and it should be possible to have proper recreational facilities.  The existing accommodation is not adequate and great credit is due to those who have achieved success in the apprenticeship school, having regard to the difficult conditions under which they worked.  The school has developed in a very practical way and has produced excellent young men trained in electrical, technical, carpentry and other skills.  Greater attention should be paid to this school. There should be replacement of some of the machinery and all the tools necessary for the proper training of apprentices should be provided.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the very important <Col N="2219" /> matter of the financing of the technical school service at Naas and at Baldonnel, which I also had an opportunity to visit.  A demand may be made for a certain type of equipment by the technical personnel in charge of the school, who are the best people to assess the needs.  There is no point in having inferior equipment simply because somebody in the Department of Finance says that what is required cannot be supplied for five years.  The person in charge of the training knows what is required and when it is required and when that person requisitions equipment it should be supplied.  The apprenticeship schools in Naas and Baldonnel must be fully serviced and if more money is required it must be provided.  The best possible type of training and equipment must be provided.  It would be an injustice to the apprentices not to replace existing inferior equipment.</P>
    <P>The time has come when there must be an allocation of money to the apprenticeship schools at Naas and Baldonnel.  Let somebody in the schools be allowed to decide which equipment to buy and when to buy it instead of waiting for the issue date. I think the officer in command should be given an allocation of money instead of having to make demands on people who have never been near Baldonnel.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that nowadays officers have a certain amount of latitude in regard to the exchange of food with suppliers.  They can exchange, for instance, beef for mutton and it is no longer necessary for personnel to eat sausages and peas when they do not want sausages and peas. Because of this arrangement soldiers are getting a better deal in the matter of catering.  As I have said, people on the spot should be given more discretion in the matter of purchase because heretofore they had to go to the man in the Department of Finance and he became the nigger in the woodpile because when it came to the question of needed supplies an officer said: &ldquo;What will the man in Finance say?&rdquo;  We should cut out a lot of the nonsense and red tape, the shuttling <Col N="2220" /> backwards and forwards from one Department to another.  When I was in the Army I got one pair of boots every two years whether they were worn out or not.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the question of apprentices, we should ensure that the very best possible equipment is available for them.  These schools are very important and the people in them are doing an excellent job.  After they have served their term, the apprentices fit in very well to civilian employment and their employers have nothing but good to say of them.  However, a practice has risen up which must be stamped out.  There have been cases where young men, when trained, have been pirated by certain employers.  The employers have given these young men the money to buy themselves out of the Army and then have made them repay that money over a period of years.  In these circumstances these young men are nothing more than bondsmen.  This must be stamped out even to the extent of increasing the amounts for which apprentices can buy themselves out.  Personnel should be released only on genuine grounds and, perhaps, if this were done the financial consideration need not enter it to such an extent.  An officer can easily judge whether the reasons for releasing a soldier are special and pressing.  I should like to say that in relation to the practice of pirating employers to which I have referred, apprentices have found after leaving that the promises made to them have not been lived up to.</P>
    <P>Still in reference to the apprentice schools at Naas and the Air Corps at Baldonnel, I ask the Minister to consider allocating money to the personnel at both places and at engineering depots where equipment is in demand and where there are changes in the type of equipment required. Officers in these places should be enabled to purchase required equipment within a period and not have to wait until the end of an issue period.</P>
    <P>In relation to the educational schemes for personnel, I am glad <Col N="2221" /> arrangements have been made with the universities.  I also welcome the interest taken by officers in relation to these courses, which have been a success. There are, of course, certain limitations in regard to personnel attending these courses as there are in relation to those receiving training in vocational schools. The Minister has stated that the university training of Army cadets and young officers continues in a satisfactory manner and that the 14 cadets appointed in 1969 who commenced their university degree course in October, 1969, have all passed their first and second year university examinations. This is very creditable and it shows the value of this particular service and I hope there will be a further extension of it for the equipping of personnel for civilian life and the betterment of the Army.  In relation to training of one type and another the private soldier is on no account to be overlooked.  It is well that cadets and young officers should get this opportunity but I think the question of the NCOs and the men should be further examined.  The Minister states that 15 cadets of the 1969 class commenced their first year at university in October, 1970, pursuing courses in arts, commerce and science and that 12 of these are continuing at university.  He says that a further 28 cadets commenced their university studies in October of this year and are pursuing courses in arts, commerce, science and engineering.</P>
    <P>When we come to the personnel who have been trained in the vocational schools, we find that 85 men commenced courses at five different centres. That figure of 85 out of all the privates and NCOs in the Army is very small and there is some breakdown in the system here, or the matter is not getting sufficient attention, because on the basis of the ratio between officers, NCOs and men, there should be quite a lot more than 85 men who would be suitable for training.  This scheme must be examined to ensure that every NCO and man can avail of this scheme and that no exception is made.  Far too often in the Army we find that exceptions are made and this has been so right through the Army in relation to promotion and <Col N="2222" /> courses.  I remember when I was in the Army some fellows claimed they did more courses than Mick the Miller. They got all the courses while other men got nothing.  I hope it is not a question of some soldiers getting all the attention while others are disregarded. The weaker section is the section that requires attention, assistance and guidance. The person anxious to go ahead should be given the opportunity, but we should have a look at the person who does not appear to be anxious and find out the reason and see can we assist him.  These will be the real problems in society when their Army period expires.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the special arrangements initiated in 1970 whereby men may undertake a two-year course leading to the Leaving Certificate continue in operation and that a total of 43 men enrolled for the course at six centres.  Again, this is a very creditable effort, but I think the ratio between NCOs, men and officers again requires attention.  Very often a man who does not appear to be interested may have genuine reasons for this.  He merely says that he is not interested and no further action is taken, and this is a problem which should be examined to find out the reasons for his saying so.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service has been mentioned, and I want to thank the Minister for having given us the opportunity recently of visiting the minesweepers, of examining the equipment and of having a trip abroad.  One could not but be greatly impressed by the personnel and the service being provided.  Some people have stated that these vessels are not fast enough, and that may well be, but with the development of craft, and particularly fishing craft, at the moment, if one is six miles away from you, if one comes into view at six miles, it takes a considerable time, several hours, to overhaul such a craft. However fast the vessels may be, they still could not make up the distance mentioned, unless we have some type of craft other than the conventional type in use at present.  Even with the speed of the new ship being constructed at the Verolme Dockyard, a ship a couple of miles away would probably make the open sea before any impression would be made in breaking down <Col N="2223" /> the mileage.  I want to thank the Minister for extending the invitation to Members of the Oireachtas and it is regrettable that so few Members accepted.  Similarly with this debate&mdash; so few people appear to have an interest in it.  It is, however, very important, affecting as it does the lives of 8,000 or 9,000 people for all time.</P>
    <P>The security of the nation, our contribution to international security, our commitments in Cyprus and other countries&mdash;these are all very real problems. The contributions which we have made and which these men have made are very great and no words of mine could in any way do justice to their wonderful contribution.  It was a pleasure to serve with many of these people.  I served as a private soldier and as an NCO and I understand the problems of these men.  These are very real problems to the people concerned. The officers can, in large degree, take care of themselves, and while I do not want to see their problems overlooked, there are people here who can put forward their points of view and who will do so with their knowledge as officers of these particular problems.</P>
    <P>There is one point, however, that I would make in relation to officers and I ask the Minister to take particular note of it.  It is that where a single officer is leaving the Army, he gets no gratuity.  This seems to be a ridiculous situation, which I think applies to certain NCOs.  The purpose of the gratuity was resettlement, so that the man concerned would be able to buy a home and settle down but in present circumstances if a single officer &mdash;and there are only three or four in the Army&mdash;retires from the Army, is he not supposed to have a home? Where is he supposed to end up after 20 or 30 years service?  Does he not want to buy a home, to settle down or is he to end up in the Iveagh lodging house or some such place?  This question and the question of single NCOs must be examined to ensure that justice is done.  The day of the outmoded ideas about resettlement of Army officers has gone and in relation to NCOs the system should be completely overhauled to ensure that persons retiring <Col N="2224" /> from the service will get a fair and square deal.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for the courteous way in which he has dealt with the problems presented to him by me and my colleagues, and in saying that, I think I speak for the members of all parties.  He has been realistic in his approach and has tried to remedy many of the older problems which have existed. With his understanding of these problems and of human problems generally and his interest in the Deputies who bring the problems to him, in the future, I am quite certain that we will have much progress made and that the problems of the personnel I have mentioned&mdash;those living in married quarters, the fatigue men, the officers' orderlies and other people doing duties which are unbecoming&mdash;will all be rectified and remedied, so that we will have a more contented force and can look forward to new recruits coming in, in the full knowledge that they will have something at the end of the line.  They should join the Army to give themselves a career knowing that they will have something in the future and that they will not be at the end of the line in the labour exchange.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate has been awaited for a long time by many Members of this House.  For some time past the armed forces of this country have come under unfavourable criticism from many quarters.  The most notable section of the Minister's speech is the third last paragraph from which I will quote:</P>
      <P>Defence is one of many State services that have to be maintained from the limited and hard-won revenue. What is allocated to each service is determined by a difficult, even painful, balancing process, in the knowledge that if more is given to one, the others must do with less &mdash;unless, of course, extra revenue can be procured.  Money is really the nub of the matter, and these critical decisions are taken by Ministers and, in the final analysis, by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would submit that from that paragraph the Government stand indicted by the Minister for Defence with regard <Col N="2225" /> to the armed forces&mdash;and rightly so.  The Minister for Defence is an honourable man who is interested in his Department and in getting proper equipment and facilities.  The Minister has said that money is really the nub of the matter.  Why cannot money be voted for the Defence Forces?  A figure of £18,788,010 is quoted for the financial year 1970-71.  This year that sum will be £19,165,000.  Why are we voting a small amount of extra money for the Defence Forces?  What do we expect to do with this small amount extra by today's standards?  The extra money voted for the Defence Forces will not offset the extra costs of inflation over the past 12 months.  We have a figure of £3 million.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Final figures and costings are not yet available, but I can say at this stage that it will be of the order of £3,000,000.  It will include substantial provision for new and increased equipment and for an increase in the strength of the permanent Defence Force.  Satisfactory progress is being made in the implementation of these programmes.</P>
    <P>To me these programmes would seem to be the purchasing of new equipment and the increasing of the strength of the personnel in the permanent Defence Forces.  It is no boast for any Minister for Defence to come into this House and say that the strength of the permanent Defence Forces is higher now than it has been in the past decade.  It is only marginally higher.  It is only greater by 180.  That figure includes cadets, Air Corps personnel and the Naval service.  It is 25 less than the previous month's figure in that most important section of our armed forces, the non-commissioned officers.  Never over the past 24 months has the figure for NCOs in the permanent Defence Forces been as low as at present.  Only on six occasions in the past 24 months has the figure for NCOs been less than 3,000. In August 1970 we had 2,994; in September 1970, October 1970, January 1971, May 1971, September 1971 and October 1971 the figures were at their lowest and the last figure for NCOs is the lowest in this country over the <Col N="2226" /> past 24 months.  It is idle to boast that our permanent Defence Forces are stronger now without asking how efficient are they?</P>
    <P>How long does it take to train an NCO as compared with a private?  How long does it take to train an officer? We know that the money spent on training an officer or an NCO is greater than that spent on training a private.  I would question, therefore, the validity of the Minister's statement while accepting that the statistics are true.  The numerical strength of the permanent Defence Forces is at the figure the Minister mentioned and is the highest in the past decade but the efficiency and the power of these forces are not necessarily at their greatest.</P>
    <P>About six weeks ago the Taoiseach made a speech in Cork in which he said that the strength of the Defence Forces had never been higher.  I have a tabulated statement of the strength of the Defence Forces for each month over the past 24 months.  On at least three different occasions over that period the figure for the Defence Forces was higher than at the time the Taoiseach was speaking in Cork.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>From a reply to Parliamentary Question No. 100 of 30th November, 1971, and the figures I quote relate to the permanent Defence forces, the reserve Defence Forces, including the first line reserve, the FCA and Slua Mhuirí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the third last paragraph of his speech the Minister referred to the shortage of money.  I respect the Minister's integrity in what he has stated and I am not putting a twisted interpretation on what he has said.  The simple facts are that the Government will not give the Minister sufficient money to provide the country with an effective Defence Force.  I have sympathy with the Minister and with his predecessors.  The Defence.  Forces are in their present situation not because of the actions of the present Minister for Defence.  Over the past 15 years the Defence Forces have been allowed to run down continuously. Only recently have we seen new equipment <Col N="2227" /> purchased.  The Naval Service had deteriorated to such an extent that we were forced to make a hasty and panic purchase of three minesweepers from the British navy.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his brief said:</P>
    <P>The improvements resulted in more men taking their discharge than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    <P>In reply to a Parliamentary Question here last month the Minister told us that over 500 NCOs had taken their discharge from the Army.  If the amount of discharge pay given to soldiers were increased more of them would leave the Army.  The armed forces are the cream of this country, intellectually and physically.  To join the armed forces one must be 100 per cent physically fit and one must have reached the same educational standards as are needed to enter a university.  Therefore it comes hard for me to say that successive Governments have ignored the armed forces, and have neglected to provide them with proper living conditions, proper equipment and proper facilities for their families, because they know that by virtue of the contract which these personnel have signed, they are completely forbidden to resign or go AWOL as they could do in any other job.</P>
    <P>The member of the Defence Forces who becomes disillusioned or discontented, who does not find sufficient outlet for either his intelligence or his ambition, is bound by the oath he has taken to stay on regardless of the conditions. This is a factor on which successive Governments have capitalised over the years.  Recently other people with a high degree of responsibility have taken to the streets or gone on strike, to have their injustices rectified. We have seen nurses&mdash;it was never known before in this country&mdash;outside the gates of Leinster House carrying banners because the conditions of their employment were so bad that they could no longer tolerate them.  Apart from Italy this is the only country in the world where junior hospital doctors went on strike.</P>
    <P>Members of the Defence Forces cannot do this.  The only course of action <Col N="2228" /> open to them is to work to rule. Volunteers in our Army have continued to serve regardless of deteriorating conditions. They have done an excellent job with the tools made available to them.  We should be more than grateful to them for the manner in which they have defended our installations against internal aggression, particularly over the past two years, and we should be particularly proud of their service with the United Nations peace-keeping forces for the past 12 years.  They should be given the honour they deserve.</P>
    <P>The first thing that struck me about the Minister's brief was the total omission of the Slua Mhuirí.  The discontent of the Slua Mhuirí with their conditions and the fact that they can leave at any time has received great publicity in the newspapers over the past two weeks.  It has been reported in some newspapers that the commanding officers of five different sections of the Slua Mhuirí, sections that were in charge of the reserve defence of Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway, came in a deputation to the Minister stating that they were dissatisfied with the facilities available for training members of the Slua Mhuirí to become an efficient reserve force in backing up the permanent force.</P>
    <P>Newspapers have put the strength of the Slua Mhuirí at around 500.  Here again I must explode the myth that the strength of the Slua Mhuirí at 31st October, 1971, was 336, and that its strength at 28th February, 1971, was 274.  The officer strength of the Slua Mhuirí has gradually deteriorated from an all-time high of 28 at 30th November, 1969, to the present level of 25. The number of privates has not appreciably increased; it has fluctuated in the same way as the number of privates in the FCA.  The number of NCOs has increased. It would appear it has gradually increased to its highest ever figure. The present figures are: 25 officers, 87 NCOs and 224 privates at 31st October, 1971.  Therefore, there are not 500 members in the Slua Mhuirí and there never were over the past 24 months.</P>
    <P>It was also reported in the newspapers that the equipment available to the Slua Mhuirí for marine training <Col N="2229" /> consisted of five large rowing boats. A maritime country which requires the youth and men of this country to volunteer for the navy reserve, which is attempting to build a fishing fleet, which should have a good coastal defence service, should not find itself in the position in which, according to the newspapers, naval personnel say they will resign unless their conditions are improved.</P>
    <P>I would not attempt to criticise the Minister unless I could suggest an improvement.  There is nothing to stop the Department of Defence from purchasing high-powered trawlers which would, in fact, be faster than the minesweepers we have.  An Slua Mhuirí could receive training on these boats as well as mingling with fishing fleets moving from port to port along the Irish coast.  There is nothing to prevent the Department of Defence from overnight converting a civil fishing boat and designating it as a military vessel. It would certainly be an improvement on what we have.  We have An Slua Mhuirí attempting to defend the major ports of this country but they should have some facilities whereby they can receive training for such work.</P>
    <P>An Slua Mhuirí should be worked into the coastal rescue service.  The Department of Defence should consider the implementation of a coastguard service.  We are attempting to enter Europe; we are an island but we are the only country in Europe without a coastguard service.  We have been told that this is the responsibility of the Department of Defence, although I would have thought it was more the responsibility of the Department of Transport and Power because they are in charge of coastal rescue services and coastal marine operations.  It should not be beyond the scope of the Department of Defence to set up a coastguard service in this country.  Coastguard buildings were there when we took over from the British but those buildings are now in ruins.  If this coastguard service were even put on weekend rescue on the east and south coasts of the country, where the majority of yachting accidents occur, it would be a great help.</P>
    <P>There is no mention in the Minister's brief of the Department of <Col N="2230" /> Defence building new military barracks. I should like to see the Army valuing the properties which they have around the country, particularly Griffith Barracks.  On the 24th June, 1971, in reply to a question in relation to Griffith Barracks, the portion made available to the Dublin Health Authority for the housing of displaced families, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>This accommodation continues to be used by and is administered by the Eastern Health Board and my Department have no function in relation to the persons accommodated there.</P>
    <P>Army barracks should primarily be used for the Army.  One of the best ways of disposing of an unsuitable barracks which is not in use is to rent it and build a new barracks.  New barracks are very urgently needed. Some of them were built during Queen Victoria's reign and they are completely out-of-date; they are not habitable for our present Army.  It is no secret that when a new recruit goes into the Curragh he has to hang his clothes on a nail if one can be found to hammer into the wall or he has to throw his clothes over a chair. There is no secret as regards the lack of furniture available to our Army personnel.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening statement, referred to the duties of the Defence Forces.  He said that their duties were exceptionally heavy for some time.  What duties are we speaking of when we speak of the Defence Forces of this country?  What are the functions of the Defence Forces?  Are there to be different functions for the Air Corps?  The Minister stated that the Air Corps were engaged in semi-civilian operations this year.  They participated in removing injured people to hospital presumably from traffic and other such accidents and they participated in sea rescue operations.  While the Minister's brief was being prepared at least 19 incursions into our air space occurred. A British Air Force Canberra bomber came into the Twenty-six Counties within 20 miles of Dublin City and spent almost an hour inside our territorial air space in an international air <Col N="2231" /> traffic corridor without permission from the Irish authorities.  I do not know at what height or speed it flew but it would not be hard to ascertain that.  It constitutes the greatest act of violation of the Twenty-six Counties territory when a British Royal Air Force plane can come south of the Border and spend approximately one hour in an international air corridor, which takes commercial aircraft from Dublin to Belfast, Dublin to Glasgow, Dublin to Edinburgh.  Despite what the Taoiseach said this act was in complete breach of International Air Traffic Association regulations.</P>
    <P>It was in complete breach of all the recommendations made by Eurocontrol and it was in complete breach of the International Air Traffic Association which is the equivalent of a United Nations of airlines.  This body is there for the purpose of effecting co-ordination. I am not satisfied that this Canberra plane did not interfere with civilian aircraft.  The fact is that air traffic corridors had to be closed because of the incursion of that aircraft. That was a gross breach of international regulations, a breach which would have been sufficient to cause serious repercussions in other countries. But we have done nothing about this breach.  It was suggested to the Taoiseach that this aircraft might have been taking photographs of the north-eastern part of the Twenty-six Counties in the area of Mount Oriel.  Mount Oriel is the main communication line from Gormanston to the north-eastern board of command; it is also an important point in television communication.  It is a main point for electrical communication with the North.  It is a vital area. It must be defended.  If anything were to happen Mount Oriel our Border patrols would be out of contact with their base.  There is no secret about that.  It does not take any military genius to appreciate that.</P>
    <P>This aeroplane violates our territory and the Taoiseach makes a laugh out of the episode.  Others attempted to ridicule those who raised it in this House.  I innocently put down a question on 28th October and on the following day, the 29th, the incident occurred. There was little or no answer from the <Col N="2232" /> Taoiseach.  I was refused permission to raise the matter by way of Private Notice Question.  Eventually I got a question down and I got a hazy answer. There must be something the Taoiseach does not want us to know about.  There is more in this than he has told us.</P>
    <P>There are nominally 500 men in the Air Corps.  That is roughly 1/16th of the total strength of our permanent Defence Forces.  We have three helicopters. There is talk of buying a fourth.  We have six Vampires.  A question was asked recently as to the number of Vampires capable of taking off into the air on 29th October, the day the Canberra came in, and we were told in reply that not one was capable of taking off to obtain the markings of the intruding aircraft.  Indeed, the Taoiseach had to ask the British Government what kind of aircraft it was.  To rub salt into the wound, the very day the question was raised here two further incursions occurred, one by a British C130 and the other by a helicopter. The British have now decided to mount machine-guns on their helicopters used for Border patrol.  This is a further manifestation of aggression towards the civilian population.</P>
    <P>In 1969 the leader of this party said it was a retrograde step for the British Government to put the Army into the North and his assessment has proved to be true.  The British Army has achieved a certain success blowing holes in roads along the Border, something bold children would do.  We all know this is designed to placate hardline Unionists.  Nothing concrete is really achieved by this futile exercise, but the day is coming when those engaged in this exercise will be accompanied by viciously armed helicopters which will spray bullets into the Twenty-six Counties, if necessary. Over 40 roads have been blown up inside the Twenty-six Counties. On 19 occasions helicopters have flown south of the Border.  The Minister must take steps to defend our territory.  We are left with little choice but to arm the three helicopters we have.  A completely new situation has arisen.  I am familiar in only the smallest degree with the stupidity of the administration of the British Army, but I assert it will not take long before <Col N="2233" /> these armed helicopters shoot into the Republic and injure innocent people in the Republic.</P>
    <P>It was, indeed, a retrograde step ever to allow the British Army into the North.  Aggression has increased.  The poundage of explosives used has increased from 519 in June last to over 2,381 in October.  The number of British soldiers injured increased from three in June to 34 in October.  The number of British soldiers killed from June to October is 11.  The number of civilians killed in the same period is 17.</P>
    <P>How could anyone who believes in a life after death believe that internment could be a successful solution to the problems?  Who can give any credence to the statements which are being spewed out by the Tory politicians in Westminster that the IRA are beaten?  We must face the fact that there is an open war going on between the citizens of the Republic in the North of Ireland and the British Army. They should not be there, they have no right to be there and they should be removed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>How can the Government complain to the United Nations about the brutality of British troops, whether they be the Green Berets, the commandos or the SAS, when we have 390 men serving with the United Nations in Cyprus under a British chief executive officer?  We have always supported and encouraged overseas service by our armed forces where such can be justified.  It is not possible for us to attempt to convince a developing African nation that British troops are illtreating civilians in the North of Ireland when 390 of our men are serving under a British chief executive officer in Cyprus.  We should make representations to the United Nations, who incidentally have not paid our troops the full amounts they are due, to have this chief executive officer replaced by a Swedish officer.  The commanding officer may be Swedish but the man who is trying to sort out another mess made by the British in Cyprus is a British army officer.  The British should either pull out of Cyprus or get this chief executive officer away from controlling our troops there.</P>
    <P>Armoured cars have been brought <Col N="2234" /> back from Cyprus.  If they are Panhard armoured cars they are useless because no Panhard armoured car is allowed to fire a mortar shell in this country until the mortar shells have been completely checked.  On the 27th November, 1969, I asked the then Minister for Defence whether his Department had refused to purchase a special mortar shell necessary for the efficient functioning of certain armoured cars in the Army; and if it was a fact that the present mortar shells being used were ineffective or inefficient or misfired on many occasions.  The Minister stated in his reply, and I quote:</P>
    <P>My Department has not been requested to purchase a special mortar shell for armoured cars.  The present mortar shells are not ineffective or inefficient nor do they misfire...</P>
    <P>On the 2nd December, 1971, five Parliamentary Questions, including one by me, were asked about Army exercises.  I asked the Minister for Defence if he was aware of the tragic accident which resulted in injuries to the commanding officer of the Second Motor Squadron in the Glen of Imaal and whether, in view of the fact that his attention was drawn to the inefficiency of firing particular shells from an armoured car, his Department purchased the necessary shells for efficient firing of the armoured car guns.</P>
    <P>I know very little about munitions but I do know the difference between a barrel load mortar and a breach load mortar gun.  A slight difference is necessary in the fuse of such a shell. The shells bought by the Department of Defence for the Army were of the barrel-loading type for ground mortars. The Department of Defence was told that when used in a breach-load weapon they misfired, were inefficient or less effective but it has taken two years and one badly wounded commanding officer to bring this home to the Department of Defence.  If the Department refuses to purchase proper mortar shells necessary for efficient firing from armoured cars and brings back armoured cars from Cyprus which cannot fire shells because the shells are too dangerous they should be honest and tell the Army that they <Col N="2235" /> are not going to provide the necessary equipment.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that indirect taxation increased by £50 million last year and his Department got only £3 million of it?  We have the cream of this country in the armed forces, and many of them live in my constituency. I have seen a private in the Army getting into arrears of rent with the local authority to the tune of £270.</P>
    <P>The Army must have fully armoured personnel carriers instead of personnel carriers with armour put on or armour plating put on because there is no formula for armoured plating in this country.  Once the troops are mobile the next essential is to be able to keep in touch with them.  The most up-to-date radio equipment is needed so that the headquarters section can communicate with different sections of the Army in the field.  I have outlined the dangers of Mount Oriel and the North Eastern Border Command being cut off from headquarters.  Our Army should be able to stay in contact with headquarters and not be cut off because there is a 100 ft. or 200 ft. hill in front of them and they cannot get through with their old radio equipment.  It may come ill from me as a person trained in healing to be promoting something that takes life but I am a great believer in prevention being better than cure and I think if we have a properly equipped Army it will act as a deterrent to any subversive elements in the Thirty-two Counties in any illegal activity in which they might wish to engage.  Our Army badly needs a more up-to-date and efficient, high explosive, anti-personnel grenade, one that is lighter, smaller, easier to carry, package and transport. It needs more modern, light, multipurpose machine guns.  Every member of the armed forces going on Border patrol should be issued with a flack-proof jacket.  He should have a helmet instead of a beret on his head because things are happening in this country with the British Army that have made them perhaps worse than they ever were in the worst days of colonial Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another urgent military need is the <Col N="2236" /> provision of facilities for night vision for troops on Border patrol or installations duty.  There is no point in having four or five young student FCA members up in Kippure if they have not modern infra-red devices to see the terrain from which people may come. This is no longer mere theorising; it has already happened; they have been captured and their guns taken.  The same thing happened in Drogheda.  In 1939 the Germans invented night vision equipment.  It is a long time since then and our troops need this type of auxiliary equipment to render them effective.</P>
    <P>It is also necessary that each soldier in the Army should have a double combat uniform.  By that I mean a double tunic and a double combat trousers.  These articles must be cleaned.  The soldier does not need the linings or double belts or double helmets and so on, but he must get his tunic cleaned and when he does so he has nothing else to wear because he has no other combat uniform.  So, there is need for that.  When we do try to meet the needs for Army equipment let us not do what we did in 1969 and buy 1,550 British Army combat uniforms for distribution to our troops. I do not care where we get them but let us not have our troops on Border patrol with ex-British Army combat uniforms even though they may only be tunics and trousers and even though 16 other parts of the combat uniform have to be provided from elsewhere. The main part of the uniform and the colour, the tunics and trousers of 1,550 of our troops, if they have all been distributed, have been purchased from Britain and they have been distributed, as the Minister said last week or the week before, as appropriate to Army needs.  The reason they were purchased is because no Irish firm tendered in time.</P>
    <P>The present needs must be met and also we must have some form of protection of an open space for our armed forces, protection of an installation. One of the simplest forms of this type of protection is smoke-making mechanism of which we need a more modern type.  With the things I have suggested, plus modern armoured <Col N="2237" /> cars with efficient firing capacity, you would have a mobile force of a strength determined by the numbers available, a mobile highly-powered, quick-striking force with very good fire power, with good defence and attack ability and good deterrent value in contact with its headquarters because the modern radio equipment would have been purchased.  That is very important; it is something we have not in the Army at present.</P>
    <P>Out of the more than 8,000 troops we have, we are not far from the point where the majority of those men are involved in the day-to-day running of the barracks.  If you take the number working in the cookhouse, guarding the gates, putting up the flags, doing servicing and cleaning and other routine jobs around the barracks, you find very few Army personnel are capable of being put into the field.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this two years ago and said the number of troops our Army could put in the field was very small. Now I am saying the same thing.  It was true then and it is true now.  I have the full figures here, completely tabulated over the past 24 months for each month.  There is no significant difference.  There is a difference of 570 or so privates but on modern logistics where you need five, six or seven backup troops for every one in the field, and with 400 troops in Cyprus, we shall not be able to put many troops into the field if necessary.</P>
    <P>This brings me to one of the most important points on this Estimate.  It is that our Army, Air Corps and Naval Service have been so neglected by successive Governments over the years that it is hard to know where to begin. I want the Minister and his staff to listen carefully to this suggestion: that the Army value the property they have all over the country, that they dispose of assets they do not need at the moment because no modern army needs six or seven separate barracks in one city.  Even though we have 100,000 people in the Greater Dublin area it is still smaller than many other European capitals.</P>
    <P>The first thing that must be done is to give the Army a function and to define this function to the officers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2238" /> They should be told whether the prime function is to protect the State against external aggression, against internal aggression, or whether it is to be in support of the civil power in times of multiple accidents, strikes, nuclear fallout, air disasters or natural disasters. The definition of priority must be given to the officers and the troops, and this is the duty of the Government and the civil servants involved in this matter.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the functions would be with regard to, first, external aggression, secondly, internal aggression and, thirdly, aid to the civil power in times of natural disaster.  We must consider the site of a new military barracks. This should be selected as soon as possible and it should be made apparent to the personnel of the armed forces that this country will move along modern lines with a modern, skilled and manoeuvrable Army.  We must have an Army that will command the respect of the people.  At the moment the officers, the NCOs and cadets are respected and admired by the people but the people do not consider that the Army is efficient or powerful.  This is because successive Governments have denied the Army the necessary equipment to enable them to become an efficient functioning power.  It is not until we gather 400 or 500 troops together, give them the best equipment and put them into Cyprus or some other area, that they become an efficient unit and show us how good our armed forces can be when they are well equipped.</P>
    <P>The first thing to do is to have a new military complex, including the military headquarters.  In this matter consideration must be given to selecting the best location for national defence, for internal defence, and we must also consider the question of support for a civil power.  With regard to national defence, it is important that the site we select should have access to the main routes of this country.  It would be important that the site would have complete radio communication with all parts of the country, that it be located near an airport and that it be reasonably easy to defend.</P>
    <P>When one considers internal aggression, <Col N="2239" /> the factors must be changed slightly.  It is essential that access be had by road to all parts of the country, complete radio communication must be possible with all parts of the country, and it is essential to be able to protect vital non-military installations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the possibility of aid to a civil power, the first priority would be to locate the complex close to the largest centre of population.  Secondly, it must be near the main road arteries of the country and, thirdly, it must be easy to defend.  When considering this matter we must look at the camps throughout the country.  Some time ago Deputy Clinton asked a question with regard to Army property.  In examining the property, it appeared there were six camps that could possibly fulfil the function, but eventually there was only one that was considered suitable in all respects.  I think it is only fair to mention the reasons some of the camps were not suitable.</P>
    <P>The Curragh camp is one that should be mentioned first but Mullingar, Athlone, Limerick, Kilworth and Dublin city can also be mentioned.  If we investigate the facilities available at these centres purely from a military point of view&mdash;not from a social point of view, because a social function has never been defined for the Army; not from the point of view of providing higher education for the children of the officers and the soldiers, or from any other point of view&mdash;we will find that in relation to external aggression Mullingar, Athlone, the Curragh, Kilworth or Dublin would suit.  In regard to internal aggression one would have to look at Mullingar, Athlone, the Curragh or Dublin.  In each case the two stations that come to mind are Mullingar and the Curragh.  With regard to aid to a civil power, the only suitable sites are the Curragh or Dublin. However, Dublin cannot be considered safe because it would be a first target in modern warfare.  Above all the others, the Curragh emerges as the most suitable site.  However, there is one problem in that it is not close to an airport.</P>
    <P>If one were to go further afield, it would be found that Baldonnel airport <Col N="2240" /> is perhaps the most suitable and the one military complex we have at the moment that would be suitable if it were expanded sufficiently.  It would be the most suitable to attain the aim we all wish, namely, a modern, wellequipped, efficient and mobile Force.</P>
    <P>The advantages the Curragh has are that it is an inland location near a main artery, and that it is a good area for radio communication and for natural defence.  It is a fair area for internal security operations.  It is fairly close to the capital city.  Perhaps most important of all there is a good site available.</P>
    <P>Baldonnel is a good military installation. It is near a main road.  It is a good site for radio communications and for internal security.  It is also a good site for the general amenities and it is close to the capital city.  It is a reasonable site for national defence and it also has an airfield.  This makes it the most suitable place for the new military complex which is necessary.  It should be built there or on the Curragh. Having studied military history, since I have an interest in the subject, I would say that for the next 40 years Baldonnel would be the perfect site for a military complex for an Army whose function was to protect the State against external aggression, or internal aggression, and to support the civil power.  For the next century then you would probably have to move on to a place like the Curragh.  Our barracks were built in Victorian times and they are not suited to modern Army requirements.</P>
    <P>On 11th December, 1969, the Minister for Defence told me that the strength of the Air Corps was 506 comprising 76 officers, 146 non-commissioned officers and 284 privates.  He said:</P>
    <P>There are 48 pilots in the Air Corps and there are nine trainee pilots at present in the Military College undergoing a course of general training prior to commencing a course of flying training with the corps. </P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 106 on 11th December, 1969.  What sad reading that makes.  The Minister said we have 29 aircraft in the Air Corps, 48 pilots and nine trainee pilots, and that we have 222 officers out of a total of 506 people in the Air Corps.  Would not it sadden the heart of everyone who has any interest in our armed forces to compare that answer with the answer given by the Minister recently when he said that on 29th October, 1971, one of the six Vampire jet aircraft held by the Air Corps was undergoing a major overhaul and the other five were being checked and serviced?  He said that one of those aircraft was at present operational and a further three were expected to become operational in the next few months and that the remaining two were unlikely to become serviceable again.</P>
      <P>The writing was on the wall in December, 1969.  Are we to be honest with the recruits we take into the Army and the Air Corps?  Will we tell them that the last military aircraft we purchased in the fighter category was purchased in 1961 and that the last time we purchased ammunition for an Army aircraft was in 1961?  The Minister suggested that we should do all we can to encourage people to join the Army.  Are we being fair to the 48 pilots and the nine trainee pilots in the Air Corps if there is not one fighter aircraft that can take off or one Vampire jet that can take off and if the Army has only one plane which has to be tuned up for one hour to get it into working order?</P>
      <P>Is it not true that the Air Corps has no striking power apart from its helicopter section?  We have three helicopters.  The Minister has said that he is buying a fourth.  He said:</P>
      <P>The three existing machines have proved very suitable and so far they have enabled the Air Corps to meet all emergency calls.  However, the demands made on them have been increasing.  The periods during which they are out of service for maintenance purposes have also been increasing with their age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of getting an extra helicopter into the air all we are doing is replacing <Col N="2242" /> a helicopter on the ground.  On paper we will have 30 aircraft in the Air Corps.  The Army officers should now be allowed to run their own business. There are 503 civil servants employed in the Department of Defence to run an air force that has 506 officers and men and no aircraft.  There is something wrong somewhere.  The Minister has said that the nub of the problem is money.  That may be so, but the reason for that cannot be that people are not paying enough in taxes. One has only to look at the figures for last year to see the percentage increase that people are paying this year in income tax and, of course, there are all the other taxes.  Out of all this extra taxation the Army get a mere £300,000 and there is a Supplementary Estimate for almost £3 million.  Is this being honest in respect of an Army that we hope to expand?  Is this being honest with members of that Army who have served this country so well abroad under the flag of the United Nations? The Minister has condemned his own Government in saying that the nub of the problem is money.</P>

      <P>People on the Government Benches have expressed regret in regard to the facilities available in the Army but, yet, as they have been doing for the past 15 years, they will support the Estimate.  On the 20th November, 1969 I asked the Minister for Defence what was the date of his last visit to the headquarters of the Irish Naval Services at Haulbowline, Cork.  The Minister replied that since his appointment as Minister for Defence in the previous July, he had not visited the naval base at Haulbowline.  Is not that typical of the attitude of successive Ministers of this country during the past 15 years?  I exclude from that the present Minister, whom I believe to be an honourable man and who, in no small way, condemned the Government as being responsible in so far as they did not give him sufficient money for the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of us have been aboard the minesweepers that have been purchased. These are very fine vessels but again we are faced here with a <Col N="2243" /> peculiar problem, a problem that is indicative of a complete lack of planning. On 4th November, 1971 I asked the Minister the total number of officers in the Naval Service on 1st October, 1969, 1st October, 1970, and 1st October, 1971 and the total number of officers available for sea command on the same dates.  The Minister replied, as is reported at column 1311 of the Official Report for that day and I quote:</P>
    <P>The total number of officers in the Naval Service on each of the dates mentioned by the Deputy was as follows: 1st October, 1969, 34; 1st October, 1970, 32; 1st October, 1971, 36.</P>
    <P>The number of officers in the executive branch of the service who held certificates of competency or naval watchkeeping certificates on each of these dates was: 1st October, 1969, 18; 1st October, 1970, 17; 1st October, 1971, 16.</P>
    <P>At that time Deputies on this side of the House were warning the Minister and his Department that when they purchased the minesweepers they would not have sufficient officers in the executive branch of the service who held certificates of competency or naval watchkeeping certificates.</P>
    <P>The fears expressed by Deputy Clinton and myself and, indeed, by other Deputies, have been realised.  In reply to a parliamentary question tabled by me the Minister told me on the 10th November, 1970 that the complement for a minesweeper is expected to be four officers and 27 ratings and that the complement of a corvette was five officers and 60 men.  Here we are running into trouble with the Navy by ignoring the strength of the watchkeeping force of the Navy.  We had 300 ratings in the naval service but only two minesweepers could be put to sea because there were only eight officers out of a total of 56 who were available to go to sea on these craft.</P>
    <P>There is much unrest and dissatisfaction in the Naval Service and this is understandable because more ratings went to sea on a corvette than are going now on two minesweepers.  I <Col N="2244" /> understand that when there were three corvettes at sea practically the total number of men available went to sea. When people join the Naval Service of this country they do so because they wish to go to sea.  I shall say no more in regard to that matter except to tell the Parliamentary Secretary that he could do worse than go to Haulbowline as other Deputies of this House have done and see there the officers at work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Without taking a lead from the Deputy, I intend visiting Haulbowline in the New Year.  The enemies of the State will love the anti-national muck that he has been pouring out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The watchkeeping officers at Haulbowline, because they are working an 80-hour week, will have an increased deduction from their pay of up to £15 in extra mess charges. Is it any wonder then, that between 1st October, 1969 and 1st October, 1971, we have lost two naval watchkeeping officers?  Have the Department any plans for replacing these men or of enticing these two men to rejoin the force?  Have they any plans for recruiting commissioned officers to the navy so that the three minesweepers might be put to sea at once?  In my opinion the naval services have been hampered badly by successive Ministers.  It is not a bad thing that we have bought these minesweepers.  They will serve a useful function.  However, their main purpose should be fishery protection.  On 19th July, 1971, I asked the Minister for Defence:</P>
      <P>If his attention has been drawn to a report indicating the probability of greater efforts being made by the Dutch fishing fleet to increase herring catches off Dunmore East; and what contingency plans his Department have prepared to deal with any encroachments of territorial waters?</P>
      <P>The reply I received was a classic example of the replies we have been getting here for two and a half years. He replied:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen the report referred to by the Deputy.  While the report does indicate the probability that the <Col N="2245" /> Dutch fishing fleet may, in future, fish for herrings off the south coast of Ireland more extensively than was the case last season, it does not imply that such fishing will be carried on illegally within our fishery limits. Due cognisance will, however, be taken of the report by the Naval Service in arranging its programme of fishery patrol.</P>
    <P>It is not so long ago since we read in the newspapers that the Polish fishing fleet had come inside the fishing limit at Dunmore East and since we read that the fishermen of Dunmore East had stated that unless minesweepers were sent to protect the fishing limit there, they would take the law into their own hands.  After due warning being given on 19th July, 1971, that this would happen in October or November, there were tax-paying citizens, many of whom do not enjoy the easiest of lives &mdash; it is a hard life and a lonely life at times &mdash; threatening to take the law into their own hands because the minesweepers had not appeared on the scene when the Polish trawlers came into the Dunmore East fishing ground.  Incidentally, I see that in the EEC negotiations this area has been left with a six-mile limit for continental trawlers which means that the protection capacity of these vessels should be increased.</P>
    <P>We need more vessels and the place to look for proper vessels is the United States, and we should not be buying stuff that has come out of mothballs from the British Navy and which has been there since the second world war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy expressed satisfaction with the vessels when we visited them.  He said they were tremendous boats.  This is most unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We should go to the United States and see whether it is possible to obtain from them some of the all-weather motor torpedo boats which they designed in recent years for a war they were fighting in Asia; see whether it is possible to purchase these before they go into mothballs, while they are functional, while they are modern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>They can do a speed of up to 27 knots which is practically twice what the minesweepers can do. Deputy Dowling rightly said that the minesweepers have not got much chance of catching up with a ship when they see it on the horizon.  This relates purely to the power of the vessel.  It does not relate to the will of the men.  On the 10th November, 1970, the Minister in reply to a question, said that he would not issue any details regarding these vessels.  We on the Opposition benches have been doing great research and we have advised the Minister on many different aspects of these minesweepers, particularly on 19th July 1971, when I asked him whether a minesweeper could put to sea in a force 8 gale.  The reply was that the coastal minesweeper could put to sea in force 8 gale weather conditions but that it would not normally do so.  The prevailing conditions along the Dunmore East coast in the past two or three days have been south-westerly gales.</P>

      <P>The Deputy and I were on a minesweeper together and he expressed great satisfaction with the minesweeper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot learn all about sailing by just going out in Dublin Bay.  The Parliamentary Secretary was a fair weather sailor.  He went across Dublin Bay as far as Howth. You will not learn anything about a minesweeper doing that.  You will not learn anything about weather conditions doing that.  I suggest that he should listen to the forecast and he might learn a little about the weather and what gales are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said the vessels were satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary knows where Dunmore East is because it is a very important fishing <Col N="2247" /> ground and a very important area for these vessels to patrol.  You come out of Haulbowline and straight into a south-westerly gale.  That is why there is no fishery patrol.  The vessels, good and all as they are, were never designed to sweep mines, to operate in unfavourable weather conditions. One of them was damaged in transit from Gibraltar.</P>
      <P>Criticism is not any use unless one has an alternative to offer; so, the Government should investigate immediately the possibility of purchasing from the US Navy some of their all-weather motor torpedo boats which have a speed of 27 knots, which can go out in any weather and which would provide this country, if sufficient were purchased, with a naval force capable of patroling the coast and giving protection to the fishermen.</P>
      <P>I should like to move now to the question of purchasing armoured personnel carriers.  Why should we tie our apron strings to the British Government continually?  Why should we tie ourselves up militarily with them as regards the supply of equipment when we can negotiate with a Government that has had one of the largest armies ever in the field, over 500,000 troops in Vietnam, and is now withdrawing from that field of battle and will have a surplus of war material?  That is where we should look in an attempt to find modern and efficient material for our armed forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> At Question Time today I tabled the following question:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2260" /> To ask the Minister for Justice if he is aware that due to the interference by his Department in the day to day running of the Taxing Masters' offices in the Four Courts without any consultation with the Taxing Masters, the work of these offices has been completely disrupted and is at a standstill with consequent inconvenience to the legal profession and general public; if he will take steps to ensure that proper provision is made for the smooth running of these offices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that I consider the reply of the Minister for Justice to be unsatisfactory. I did feel that the Minister was apologetically standing over a state of affairs which he did not believe he could justify.</P>
    <P>I should like to say at the outset that I raise this matter on the adjournment because I believe there is a considerable principle involved.  We have here an example of the Executive, the Government in this country, adopting what I consider to be a very high-handed and arrogant attitude to a judicial or quasi-judicial officer or officers, and I think it is clear that unless we have a reasonably harmonious approach from the Executive to the judicial or quasi-judicial officers, indeed to all parts of the administration under the various Departments, we will have nothing but chaos.</P>
    <P>In the very recent past we had some examples of the chaos which ensued from what appears to me to be either a complete lack of communication between the Department of Justice and such an important institution of State as the Garda Síochána, and I raise this matter on the adjournment in the hope that by doing so I will bring clearly home to the Government and to each member of the Government the necessity for trying to preserve harmony, good relations, and a better understanding between the various sections of Government and the institutions of State.</P>
    <P>One of the oldest offices in the High Court is that of Taxing Master.  I do not propose to weary the House with <Col N="2261" /> exact details of when that office was brought into operation but I believe it has existed for approximately 100 years.  There are two Taxing Masters. They perform what, in my opinion, is a judicial, certainly a quasi-judicial, function.  They should be independent; they should not be interfered with; the dignity of their office should be upheld.</P>
    <P>Although it is not directly related to this question there is the position of Master of the High Court, another office of a judicial nature second only to that of a judge of the High Court, and according to reliable information which I have before me and which I intend to put on the record of the House, and defy the Minister to contradict it&mdash;if he does I will ask him to substantiate his contradiction&mdash;the present Master of the High Court will have concluded his term of office in a short time.  I am informed that on 29th October last an officer or officers from the Department of Justice, presumably with the authority of the Minister for Justice, approached the Master of the High Court and asked him to vacate his court, to hand over the court for use for other purposes. Having considered the matter, the Master of the High Court decided that, having occupied that court and having discharged his duties therefrom for approximately 20 years, he would not vacate the court until his term of office had expired, and he so informed the officers.</P>
    <P>He thought that was the end of the matter, but in the space of three or four days he received a letter over the signature of the Minister for Justice, the written signature, thanking him for his co-operation and for his agreement to vacate his court in favour of another judge to be appointed.  The Master of the High Court was utterly amazed, and, it having been brought to his notice when he was requested to vacate his office that it was proposed to abolish the office of Master of the High Court and to hand over the functions of that office to the Taxing Masters to be discharged by them, he learned from the Taxing Masters that an approach had been made to them to accept the functions <Col N="2262" /> of the Master of the High Court, which, of course, was absolutely absurd because there is as great a difference between chalk and cheese as between the functions of the Master of the High Court and the Taxing Masters.</P>
    <P>The Taxing Masters informed those officers who approached them that they were not interested in the proposal, that it was flatly in contradiction or contrary to the terms of their appointments and that they had no intention of assuming the duties of the Master of the High Court which they considered themselves entirely unsuited to perform. That was thought to be the end of it, but on 2nd November the Taxing Masters received a letter dealing with the interview which I have just related and which occurred on 1st November. The letter stated that there had been a change of thought about the matter and that it was not now proposed to proceed with the change or with the proposal to abolish the office of Master of the High Court.</P>
    <P>Subsequently a letter was received stating that it was proposed to make certain changes, that though it was not proposed to abolish the office of Master of the High Court, the following changes would be made: the Master of the High Court would transfer his office to the Senior Taxing Master's office; the Senior Taxing Master would go to the office of the Junior Taxing Master and the Junior Taxing Master would transfer his office to a conference room 240 yards away.  It was stated also that it was proposed to effect these changes as from 22nd November.</P>
    <P>On 4th November the Taxing Masters replied stating they did not accept the proposed changes.  On 9th November the most senior officer in the Department of Justice consulted the Taxing Masters regarding accommodation and there was a discussion between the most senior officer in the Department and the Taxing Masters, and the Taxing Masters made it clear they did not propose to transfer or to accept the alternative accommodation because it was not suitable.  I wish to emphasise that they made that perfectly clear in their letter and made it perfectly clear to the Secretary of the Department on 9th November.</P>
    <P>At that discussion, the matter was <Col N="2263" /> left in mid-air&mdash;there was no decision on it, no arrangement come to&mdash;and the Secretary of the Department left on the note that he would think about the matter.</P>
    <P>Nothing further was heard by either of the Taxing Masters until they reported for duty on 22nd November which I think was a Monday.  The senior Taxing Master found that the lock on the main door of his office had been changed and that his key would not fit it.  He went around to another door which leads to his office and found that it was very crudely, as I said earlier, but permanently barricaded, by having a crude piece of wood nailed upon it so that he could not get into it, and it is very significant to note that there were two other doors&mdash; artificial or ornamental doors at the Taxing Master's office which were not doors at all but which appeared to be doors and which were there really only for ornamental purposes&mdash;and so determined were these officers of the Minister in ensuring that the senior Taxing Master could not get into his office that they drove six inch nails into these dummy doors&mdash;quite an unnecessary exercise, but, I suggest, evidence of their determination to permanently barricade these people out of their offices.</P>
    <P>The only intimation this senior Taxing Master got that he was to move to another office was an arrow, in red, I understand, saying &ldquo;Master de Valera&rdquo; and pointing that he was to go into Master Bell's office, the junior Taxing Master, who found that his name was obliterated from his door, the only intimation that he got being that he was to go 240 yards away was a message to his clerk.  It did not stop at that, because the official papers in the senior Taxing Master's office&mdash;his private papers and photographs he had on the wall&mdash;were taken in bulk, without by your leave or a word to him, and roughly thrown on the floor of the junior Taxing Master's office. That was the condition these quasi-judicial officers found when they reported for duty on 22nd November.</P>
    <P>They very properly reported to the Chief Justice under whose direction <Col N="2264" /> they discharge their duties.  I do not want to say that they discharge their day to day function under the direction of the the Chief Justice but, generally, I understand that the Chief Justice is in charge of the administration of the Four Courts, or at least of the judicial officers in the Four Courts.  Having reported to him, the Chief Justice instructed them to down tools, to cease to carry out their functions, until such time as proper facilities were provided for them and between 22nd November and 9th December, there was something in the nature of, in fact, there was a strike.  The Taxing Masters refused to discharge their duties because they were not provided with adequate facilities, and, indeed, it is significant to point out that since then the junior Taxing Master has not been requested to travel these 240 yards, or one-eighth of a mile, to the new office.  It may be suggested that a journey of 240 yards is not an excessive distance for one of these officials to walk but it is very important when it is borne in mind that they are bound under the rules of the Superior Court, if not under statute, to keep in close consultation with each other, to consult daily on various matters and to ensure that they are acting in principle together.  Furthermore, there is a common office, a general office, serving both and it means that if the man 240 yards away wanted a file, he had to send down for it.</P>
    <P>The position now is that the two Taxing Masters resumed duty apparently on 9th December and both of them are working in what was formerly the court of the junior Taxing Master and working in shifts because they cannot work together.  I want to say that I believe this discloses an entirely unhealthy approach by the Minister&mdash;and I regret to say that he has to accept responsibility for it&mdash;and the Minister's Department, to the administration of justice in this country.  If this is an example of the arrogant approach of this Department, which is responsible for the administration of justice and the preservation of law and order, it is not to be wondered at that the Garda Síochána are up in arms suggesting that they are not getting co-operation from their superiors and from the Minister's Department and that everything <Col N="2265" /> is far from well in this important field of the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>I felt today, rightly or wrongly, when I put down this question and the Minister was answering it, that he was answering it apologetically in the belief that what happened should never have happened and I will be surprised if, accepting the history of this unfortunate episode as related by me &mdash;I will not be surprised if he accepts it, but I will be surprised if he denies it, because the information I have, as I understand, cannot be contradicted &mdash;the Minister stands over it or justifies it, or seeks to say that it could be tolerated.  I think he would serve his office, himself and the Government much better if he said it was an unfortunate incident which happened without his knowledge and which should not happen and will not happen again.  I believe it would be difficult for the Minister to do that, but there is a principle here, and we must have harmony, and have the independence of people appointed, such as these Taxing Masters, protected, I want to go on record as saying, they are appointed not by the Appointments Commission or the Civil Service Commission but by the Government, on the advice of the Minister to discharge judicial functions and they are treated in a way that I do not think anybody should be treated.</P>
    <P>As I said, if some ordinary citizen of this country acted as the Minister's officers acted in this case, the Minister would feel justified in invoking the Forcible Entry Act to have them thrown out and brought before the courts for a breach of the law.  I am not raising this as any personal matter, but I believe I would be guilty of a serious dereliction of my duty as spokesman on Justice if I did not do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to put this whole matter in its proper perspective, I want to emphasise at the outset, as I said in the statement I issued some couple of weeks ago in connection with this matter, that what was involved here was a rearrangement of the accommodation of two court officials to provide an additional courtroom for <Col N="2266" /> a new Circuit Court judge whose appointment was urgently needed in the public interest. The position at present in the Dublin Circuit Court is that there are arrears of between nine and ten months in the trial of criminal offences.  There are approximately similar arrears as a result in the trial of civil actions because criminal trials, naturally enough, so far as possible have to be given precedence.</P>
      <P>This creates a social problem which has been a source of serious concern to me as Minister for Justice.  Long delays in bringing cases to trial are unfair to accused persons.  They also contribute substantially to an increase in crime because persons on bail, who think they are likely to be convicted and sentenced to prison, are liable to commit additional offences while on bail. The Garda Síochána inform me that in the year 1970, to their knowledge, just short of 1,300 indictable crimes were committed by persons while on bail. While there are a variety of reasons for the fact that persons are on bail for long periods the major reason is that the trial of criminal indictments in the Dublin Circuit Court is very much in arrears and has been for some time.</P>
      <P>Efforts were made to reduce these arrears by enlisting the assistance of the provincial judges of the Circuit Court, as and when they were available, but, quite obviously, these efforts have been only marginally successful because the judges were only available for comparatively short periods.  It, therefore, became necessary to appoint an additional judge in Dublin and to find an additional courtroom in which he could function.  The only adequate accommodation available for this purpose was accommodation that had previously been used by a taxing master.  This fact was established after a lengthy and detailed examination of all sorts of alternative premises including suggestions for the building of prefabs in or beside the Four Courts. Efforts to acquire premises in the immediate vicinity of the Four Courts failed as did an examination of every room that looked in any way possible for use in the Four Courts itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This then was the background to <Col N="2267" /> the taking over of the accommodation concerned.  In today's Parliamentary Question Deputy Fitzpatrick alleged that there was no consultation with the Taxing Masters about the matter.  That allegation has since been changed in his supplementary questions today and in what he has said here tonight.  In fact, even in the rather inaccurate and coloured version of the history of the events which he gave he admits at least two lengthy consultations by senior officers of my Department.  The allegation, therefore, seems to be changed to the effect that while there were some consultations they were not enough or not adequate.  Quite clearly the Deputy is not aware of how much consultation did in fact take place or how much discussion took place at these various meetings and how long they lasted.</P>
    <P>I frankly do not feel under any obligation to defend myself in relation to the allocation of accommodation in public buildings.  The fact of the matter, as far as I am concerned, is not that there was not sufficient consultation but that there was so much consultation by such senior officers of my Department, including the secretary, two assistant secretaries and a senior principal officer, that if I were to disclose the full details of all those consultations I could very well see Deputies in this House accusing me of wasting the tax-payers' money by allowing senior officers of my Department to devote so much time to what ought to be regarded as a trivial matter of rearranging the accommodation of court officials.</P>
    <P>It is an absurd situation that the transfer of an official from one room to another should be allowed to take up the time of Dáil Éireann, both earlier today at Question Time and again now on the adjournment. Deputy Fitzpatrick, in the various statements which he made this evening, laid great emphasis on officials of my Department and what was done by officials.  I want to make it very clear here that I am responsible for everything that is done by every official of my Department.  I have looked into this matter fully.  I am fully aware of everything that happened <Col N="2268" /> and I approve of everything that happened.  I take full responsibility and I would prefer if any attacks made in this House, justified or unjustified, were in fact addressed to me and that no aspersions were cast on any official in my Department.</P>
    <P>In order that the record may be put right, because Deputy Fitzpatrick's history of the events, trivial and all as they are, was a bit coloured and a bit garbled as far as facts, dates and everything else are concerned, I want to say the first discussion with the two officials concerned, at which two Assistant Secretaries and a Principal Officer were involved, took place on 1st November, 1971.  There was a written communication sent from my Department on 2nd November, 1971, informing the officials concerned that these changes would have to take place not later than 22nd November, which is, in fact, the date on which they took place.  On 12th November, 1971, because of the disinclination of the officials to discuss the matter fully with the two Assistant Secretaries and the Principal Officer, the Secretary of the Department, at my specific request, went to see the two officials.  He, in fact, spent three hours discussing the matter with them explaining every aspect of the position to them.  The change over took place on the date they were told three weeks earlier would be the date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to ask one question but if the Minister objects I will leave it. Is it not a fact that nothing definite was arranged on, I think, the 9th, that the officers did not agree, that no communication whatever was received by them until the place was barricaded on the 12th?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  The Secretary of my Department, who has made a careful note of the three-hour meeting which took place on the 12th November, 1971, pointed out that these changes would have to be made not later than the 22nd and that he was extremely anxious to discuss the mechanics of the change-over and so on, that if the officials concerned <Col N="2269" /> refused to discuss the mechanics of the change-over we would be put in the very regrettable, position, because of the public interest involved and the dire necessity of having a judge started by the 22nd, that the change-over must take place then.  In fact, of course, the judge eventually was not appointed until the 6th December.  The reason for that was that the contractor could <Col N="2270" /> not get in until 22nd November and he took 10 days to do the necessary work. It is regrettable that such a trivial matter as this should be sought to be blown up and that some sort of <i>mala fide</i> should be imputed to me or my Department in a matter such as this.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 16th December, 1971.</P>

      <P>On the 24th November, 1971, planning permission was refused by me on appeal for the construction of a preparation room in connection with the sale of fried fish and chips and for the alteration to a shop front on the site referred to by the Deputy. The reason for refusal was that the proposed development would seriously injure the amenities of residential property in the vicinity by reason of the noise, disturbance, and odours which would be associated with it.</P>

    <P>It is not clear what the Deputy <Col N="2139" /> means by the second part of his question; if it is a question of enforcement, this is a matter for the Dublin Corporation.</P>
