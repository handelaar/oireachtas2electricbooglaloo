    <Title>Health Contributions Bill, 1971: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been introduced because of the urgent need to find another source of income besides rates and taxes to finance the heavy and growing burden of health costs.  The means proposed is a scheme of reasonable contributions towards the cost of the health services by those who are eligible <Col N="178" /> for them and who can be regarded as able to pay such contributions without undue hardship.</P>
    <P>The persons concerned are those classed by the Health Act, 1970, as having limited eligibility for health services, that is, broadly speaking, eligibility for all the hospital, maternity and preventive services but not for family doctor services.  They are those people outside the &ldquo;full eligibility&rdquo; category&mdash;that is, those with medical cards&mdash;who have social welfare insurance, are farmers of £60 valuation or less or, otherwise, are persons with means under £1,200 per annum.  I intend to bring before the House shortly a draft of regulations to raise this £1,200 limit to £1,600, to keep in line with the recent increase in the limit for social welfare insurance.  The total number of people, including dependants, with limited eligibility, is estimated at about 1¾ million, or 60 per cent of the population.</P>
    <P>I will try to sketch briefly the background against which the proposals in the Bill are put forward.  I make no apology for once again referring to the galloping cost of maintaining our national health.  In 1951-52 the total cost to public funds of the health services was £10 million.  In 1961-62, this had increased to £19 million.  The estimated cost in the current year is £76 million approximately, or an average of about £25 per head per year, collected out of rates and taxes in proportion to personal incomes.  This rate of increase is markedly out of proportion to the growth of national production. Indeed, over a period of ten years the volume of expenditure, that is expenditure at constant prices, on health services doubled.  Ireland is not unique in this regard.  It may be some consolation to observe that there is a similar trend elsewhere.  It seems to be a general phenomenon that the proportion of national expenditure devoted to health tends to increase with economic and social development.  There are various reasons for this.  It is partly due to the relative lack of productivity increases in health services since they are such heavy users of direct and expensive labour.  Other factors are the <Col N="179" /> astounding expansion of medical technology especially in surgery, and the increasing life span of the average man in modern times.  The World Health Organisation published a report by Professor Abel Smith in 1967 entitled &ldquo; An International Study of Health Expenditure&rdquo; which showed that in the early sixties some countries were spending over 6 per cent of their national product on health.  If that trend continues, health services by 1980 would take over 8 per cent of national resources in developed countries and, by the end of the century, perhaps 10 per cent or more.</P>
    <P>Problems in financing and organising health care are currently causing worry in many countries.  In the United States of America, which has traditionally leaned towards reliance on private finance and organisation, there is increasing recognition that these on their own are inadequate and several Bills to increase public participation in the financing and organisation of health services are awaiting consideration by Congress.</P>
    <P>In Britain the cost of the national health services continues to cause concern and proposals have been under consideration for increasing the revenue from charges on patients for prescriptions. In the EEC countries also, considerable examination is being given to the financing of health care.  In these countries this is based largely on contributions from employers and workers, with substantial aid from State funds. The report of the EEC Commission on the social situation in the community in 1970 refers specifically to financial problems in that field in most of the EEC countries and in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands special bodies have been set up to examine these problems.  I am aware that in Denmark also a special committee have recently examined the financing of the health services.</P>
    <P>I refer to those foreign examples so that the House will realise that we are not alone in facing problems in the financing of the health services.  In this country one in every ten of the population spends some period annually, short or long, in an acute care hospital, excluding mental hospitals. <Col N="180" /> The numbers of patients in this category are rising by 3 per cent or 4 per cent per annum.  There are similar statistical analyses in other developed countries.  Perhaps what I have said also makes the point that we can find no complete answer to our problems in another country.  What we have done is to look at systems in other countries and come up with a proposal which has regard to our own background and social structure.</P>
    <P>One of the main objectives of the Health Act, 1970, was to reorganise the administrative structure of the local health services in a way that would ensure the fullest possible return for the huge sums being spent.  It will continue to be an important function of my Department to give special attention to economy and efficiency in the health services.  Nonetheless, we have to face up to the inevitability that health costs as a proportion of national product will continue to grow, as it is unthinkable that we can neglect to apply the benefits of new techniques in the field of community or individual medical care.  At the same time, there are many competing demands on national resources for other services &mdash;in education and social welfare for example&mdash;not to speak of the need for maintaining investment in directly productive spheres so that the basic capacity of the economy is strengthened and developed.  The proportion of the Budget which goes to meet health costs has risen from 7 per cent in 1961-62 to 9 per cent in the current year.  I need not remind the House that the increasing contribution from the rates has also caused concern.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Health this constant and growing problem of constraint on financial resources has confronted me.  On the one hand I need additional funds.  On the other hand I am under continuous pressure to relieve the growing burden of local taxation.  In this House and at local authority meetings throughout the country there has been an increasing volume of protest from public representatives about what the rates are being asked to bear.  I sympathise with these protests.  I am personally satisfied that, where the local rates are concerned, we have reached the stage <Col N="181" /> where this particular cow has been almost milked dry.</P>
    <P>It is thus clear that the traditional sources for health finance must be supplemented in some other way, and preferably in a way which can be shown to be directly related to the services concerned.  This is the means which is proposed by the Health Contributions Bill.  It is not an original idea.  Some form of national insurance or contributory scheme for sharing the cost of health services is common in European countries, and in countries which are more prosperous than ours.</P>
    <P>The Bill I am now asking the House to approve provides for an introductory scheme based for employees on a modest rate of contribution of 15p per week&mdash;less than the cost of one pint of beer of half a gallon of petrol. It would be collected in conjunction with the social welfare contribution for insured workers.  Farmers and other self-employed persons would contribute at an annual rate of £7.  This is rather less than the total amount which an insured person stamping a card for 52 weeks would pay&mdash;£7.80&mdash; and is justified by the fact that insured persons are automatically exempted from the contribution during periods off work through illness and unemployment because of Social Welfare procedure for credited contributions.  Farmers will pay their contributions to the local health board and the contributions of other self-employed persons will be collected through the machinery of the Revenue Commissioners. All the money collected will be paid over to me and disposed of in accordance with regulations which I shall make with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Where it is difficult for a farmer to pay his contribution in one sum to the health board I have under consideration the possibility of enabling him to pay in easy stages by stamping a card or by some other method.</P>
    <P>All medical card holders would, of course, be exempted from making these contributions and there is provision for exempting other specific categories where this is thought desirable.  In particular, it is intended that agricultural labourers and female domestics will be <Col N="182" /> exempted.  Because the employees' contributions will be collected as part of the social welfare stamp, it is not, however, practicable to exempt classes for which there is not a separate denomination of stamp.  Hence, employers of most lower income group workers will, in stamping the cards for social welfare purposes, have to include the element for health services. There is no practicable way of avoiding this so that in these cases there will be a liability on employers to meet the cost of contributions.  Medical card holders will of course pay no contributions.</P>
    <P>I think it would be hard to argue that 15p per week is an unreasonable price to ask people to pay who are getting full protection for themselves and dependants.  When the scheme starts hospital services will be completely free to contributors: the present charge of up to 50p per day will be abolished. Charges for out-patient services have already been lifted since April last.  In addition, on the introduction of the scheme, the present arrangements under which drugs are available to all diabetic patients irrespective of their means will be extended to other specified long-term ailments, in accordance with regulations under the Health Act, 1970.  Other benefits are also foreshadowed in that Act and will be brought into operation at a later date, for example, assistance with heavy chemists' bills and a home help service to keep people from having to get institutional care.  I should also refer particularly to the important reorganisation of the child health services which is now operating successfully.</P>
    <P>This introductory scheme is expected to yield a gross £5 million in a full year&mdash;not a very large sum in relation to the total current costs of health services but a valuable contribution in our present very difficult economic circumstances. From this will have to be deducted the revenue we receive from hospital charges&mdash;about £700,000 a year&mdash;leaving a net addition to income of about £4.3 million.</P>
    <P>Ideally, a scheme of contributions of this sort should be graded to take account of the varying capacity of different people to pay and it would have been my preference that, from the <Col N="183" /> begining, the scheme of contributions should be so designed.  However, at this stage it is not possible to implement a graduated scheme since it has many complicated aspects and calls for a good deal of organisation which the Revenue Commissioners, on whose administrative machinery we must depend, will not be in a position to complete for some time.  The Bill makes provision for a changeover to this more sophisticated kind of scheme when we are ready for it and a high-level working party has been set up by the Revenue Commissioners to plan the changeover.  The rates of contribution which would apply in such a scheme will be fixed by regulations which the House will be asked to approve in draft form.</P>
    <P>Draft regulations will be introduced in this session providing standard norms of income for medical card holders with the hardship clause maintained and this will prevent anomalies arising in relation to the rights of persons who are in the lowest income category in the limited eligibility category.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear to the House that the impact of taxation in all forms upon the taxpayer has not been the subject of any notable research in this country or in the case of our neighbouring States.</P>
    <P>We are reasonably certain that the tax measures in force, taken together with social welfare payments, are progressive in character and based on income levels.  We are quite sure of one fact, namely, that there is no large wealthy class of persons earning from £3,000 to £5,000 net of tax and that the distribution of taxation is such that every section contributes proportionately to their total incomes.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this scheme of insurance contributions cannot be said to impose a contribution for hospital services that is out of proportion to either the income less taxation and rates paid.</P>
    <P>In the 1966 urban household budget inquiry the amount spent by the average household in the limited eligibility group each week on medical expenses was shown as about six <Col N="184" /> shillings; the amount spent on drink and tobacco was 32s 6d.  The people of this country devoted 11.14 per cent of their personal expenditure for goods and services on alcoholic drinks and soft drinks.  The 15p weekly contribution is a very reasonable insurance premium.  The limited eligibility group again I feel can make this contribution and as incomes rise the contribution can be markedly increased.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to support the adoption of this new principle in our health services and recommend the Bill for a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>When most people throughout the country, like myself, heard some weeks ago that the Minister for Health intended to introduce here in the Dáil a Health Contribution Bill, there was hope in their minds that possibly today or some time before the Summer Recess there would be some news of relief for the heavily loaded ratepayers.  They will be, as all of us on this side of the House are, sorely disappointed with the Minister's speech this morning.</P>
      <P>When reading of any health legislation that was introduced by a Fianna Fáil Minister, those of us with any experience in this House will think we should read between the lines.  We go back in memory this morning to the Health Bill introduced by the late Dr. Ryan when he told everyone&mdash;and most people believed him&mdash;that the Health Bill that he brought in with such a flourish of trumpets would cost the taxpayers about two shillings in the £.  That Bill and those days are best forgotten.  The unfortunate thing about it is that some of my neighbours in Cork got demands yesterday morning for rates for the current year and they will have the kind of sickness which will need hospital treatment, of a type which the Minister will understand, before the rate collector comes to collect the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally we have to read between the lines in legislation brought before us but in this case I do not think we will have to do that because what the Minister wants is spelt out quite clearly in the Bill.  Despite all his flowery language and his talk about Luxembourg, the Netherlands and other countries <Col N="185" /> that will not be much use to the unfortunate workers and the small farmers who in effect are asked now to be compulsorily insured and to carry the extra £5 million which the Minister anticipates this scheme will cost.</P>
    <P>Does it not mean that in this proposed legislation, the Minister is asking the workers and the small farmers to pay this extra £5 million?  Does it not also mean that the only benefit which will be got from this is that the 50p a day will be done away with?  Instead they will have to pay something between £7 and £8 per year for the privilege, if they are unfortunate enough to have to go to hospital during the year, of not having to pay this 50p per day.  Would anyone in this House suggest that any commercial insurance company engaged in this type of benefit would not give a much better bargain for that money?  Would anyone suggest that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board would not give far better value for that amount of money?</P>
    <P>I do not intend going into all the details of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board but after speaking to Deputy Tom O'Higgins this morning I feel he will have quite a lot to say about it.  However, I remember when studying his proposed health plan and the proposals in it that he spelt out clearly and precisely the benefits to be derived from that plan and how the money to pay for it would be obtained. It was made clear how 85 per cent of the people would benefit from free dispensary, hospital services and home services on a contributory basis, one-third by the employer, one-third by the employee and one-third by the State.  He suggested then that the cost of it would only amount to the price of a packet of ten cigarettes, that was about 1s 6d at that time.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes some way towards the Fine Gael thinking on health services but I still believe in a contributory health scheme.  This, of course, is one of the first mini-Budgets which we forecast in this House a few weeks ago we would have this year.  The only thing we did not forecast was the indecent haste with which this Bill <Col N="186" /> would be introduced.  While we agree in principle with the contribution part of the health plan we do not agree that the underprivileged section of our people should be the people called on to bear this £5 million and for that reason we oppose the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to social welfare and health generally there is throughout the country at the moment dissatisfaction among the people who are called on to provide the money for those services and there is also dissatisfaction among the people who expect to get those services.  The regional health authority boards, as we predicted before the Health Act was introduced, now that they have had some chance of proving themselves, are a dismal failure.  We should take adequate care of the underprivileged and the deprived section of our community but in this Bill we are putting the load on them. The Central Fund is being relieved of £5 million and no relief is given to the ratepayers.  This Bill, for that reason, should be condemned and it should not get a Second Reading.</P>
    <P>This party will not be party at any time to putting an extra imposition on the people who are less able to bear it.  That is Fine Gael policy on health and social welfare.  The ratepayers and taxpayers when they read the papers tomorrow, will not be convinced that there is anything here for them.  They will realise that it is the first of the mini-Budgets of 1971.</P>

      <P>This problem of health has been with us sufficiently long for <Col N="187" /> the general public to get the impression that the way in which a health service should be organised is particularly difficult and complicated. There is no doubt about the frequency with which we appear to discuss this very important problem of our people, and the number of elections which have been fought on promises that good health services would be provided, but yet every piece of health legislation brought in here appears to be a very grudging step forward towards the kind of scheme which all of us know is needed in this country.  Every scheme of this kind, as anybody can see, is simply another very threadbare piece in the makeshift, nondescript jigsaw which constitutes the health services, yet another step away from the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party in their radical days in regard to the problem of the health services.  Nobody knows better than the Fianna Fáil Government who have had such a good record on health legislation what is needed in this field.</P>
      <P>To me these makeshifts are simply another manifestation of Fianna Fáil's betrayal of their early idealism in regard to the care of the sick, the unemployed, those without houses, and so on.  This Bill is all a part of a very complex pattern.  Listening to the Minister's apologia for his pathetic little scheme, one would think that in some way or another he is blazing the trail of a great social revolutionary, that he is a great pioneer, that he is introducing dangerous and hitherto untried schemes to improve our health services.  We have been told that a high level group have been established by the Revenue Commissioners in order to work out all the complex tortuosities that will be needed to introduce a means test which will be no more than a reactionary and backward scheme hostile to the working classes.  This is to be a new sliding scale means test which will be an advance on what the Minister has in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that this insurance principle in social legislation is a device of paternal, benevolent capitalism in its struggle to hold what it has, to <Col N="188" /> resist the advance of social legislation through the acquisition and redistribution of the workers' income in the various social services of one kind or another, meanwhile directed exclusively to preserve the wealth of the wealthy minority.  It is true that the minority of wealthy people is small but it is the wealthy minority, its wealth and property, that schemes of this kind help to ensure, whether they be schemes in regard to unemployment, old age or disability.  Their prime purpose is to prevent and to obstruct any serious redistribution of the wealth in capitalist dominated societies.</P>
    <P>That is the general principle in the EEC countries as well.  Even in Britain, the welfare State, there has been no serious redistribution.  I repeat that on the question of social legislation Britain is one of the most backward countries in Europe and we are well behind the British in our attitude to the collective responsibility of the community for welfare and care in sickness, in old age, in housing and in other social services. The welfare of the total community is the responsibility of the total community, not simply of the relatively poor, the middle or the moderate income groups.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made his usual convoluted case for his niggling, unimportant little schemes, setting off pleasure, luxury, recreation on one side against some sort of self-denial, self-sacrifice, self-abnegation on the other&mdash;packets of cigarettes and pints of beer against the contributions for health services.  Clearly, the goodies will always come down on the side of contributions to the health services, an infantile over-simplification and a misleading over-simplification of reality. The general inference is that the Minister is more concerned with our general social morality than he is with what is really his main objective, the protection of the really wealthy to see that they will stay as wealthy as they are and that their wealth will not be in any way interfered with or reduced.</P>
    <P>Those are the people whom the Minister is protecting.  He is not preaching a new form of high morality.  He is not advocating a new puritanical outlook as to how the worker should <Col N="189" /> spend whatever he may have.  He is simply, consistently as he always has done, advocating and defending the rights of the wealthy privileged minority in this society at the expense of the ordinary workers&mdash;the white collar workers, and the industrial wages earners.</P>
    <P>In all his other ministries the Minister for Health has always defended the privileged classes.  He has always managed to provide a completely humbugging, hypocritical, high-sounding, phrase-mongering explanation as to why he has adopted this peculiarly selfish attitude to the policies he is adopting.  This measure will bring in £5 million although it will be reduced by £700,000 by the abolition of the idiotic 10s. a day contribution, which the Minister has at last had the sense to get rid of because it was so administratively foolish.</P>
    <P>He is taking this £5 million from people who will ultimately earn £1,600 or under.  The people earning £3,000, £5,000 and £7,000 are saved from making any contribution towards this £5 million, although it could be taken from them in some form of taxation. Those gentle souled philanthropists who are about to rape County Meath to the extent of hundreds of millions of pounds worth of our natural wealth and the others in Tipperary and Galway are going to be saved from paying this £5 million because of their tax-free contract with the Government which enables them to take all this wealth out of the country.  In order to give them those tax-free benefits people earning £1,600 and under, which is quite a small income these days, will be paying an additional tax because, of course, this measure is simply another form of taxation.</P>
    <P>These people are already paying many taxes to protect, as I say, the industrialist with his tax-free incentives in order to make him keep his industry here.  These people are paying this additional tax in order to protect the wealthy mine exploiters; they are paying taxes in the form of rates; they are paying taxes in the form of direct taxation, which is the highest in Europe; they are paying taxation in the form of purchase tax; they are, <Col N="190" /> without a doubt, paying wholesale tax; they are paying their national health insurance contribution tax and I am quite certain that the so-called employer's tax is also paid by the consumer. I do not believe the employer pays that tax at all.  It is simply treated as an item in the cost of the consumer cost and the consumer pays not only his own contribution he also pays the employer's contribution.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out before this was all thought up in the old benevolent paternalistic approach of resisting and was brought into the 20th century, as cleverly as they have been resisting it over the years, by the great Dublin firm, Guinness.  They have provided social services and health services of one kind or another and they have got the reputation of being a remarkably kind, generous and good employer when, in fact, nothing came out of their profits at all, profits went up and up and up, a penny went on the pint and the consumer paid for the services they were providing to their employees.  They were one of the first companies to catch on to this magnificent device whereby the unfortunate consumer, the ordinary, average person, believed he was living in an advanced, socially just society, the just society, as we call it. It is simply an accountancy device whereby money is taken out of one pocket and paid back in the form of social services of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>No attempt has been made by the Minister to explain why the Fianna Fáil Party have abandoned the principle of their earlier approach to social legislation of this kind.  I remember being attacked here pretty violently by a former Minister, Mr. MacEntee, because of my delay in introducing a free, no means test health service, which was based on the free, no means test principle and I have always given Fianna Fáil great credit for it.  At that time they had not gone across to the radical change in fiscal policy when they realised that all these indirect taxes were excellent devices for taking money off the ordinary worker, and not only the ordinary worker but the ordinary worker with a large family, which meant that the larger the family <Col N="191" /> the higher the tax.  We have seen the change in their enlightened attitude to fiscal policy of the thirties and early forties and now a considerable part of the taxation is borne by the ordinary consumer and, as I say, the larger the family the bigger the consumption and the bigger the consumption the higher the tax.  The higher the tax the family man pays the less tax the mine owner, the big businessman and the industrialist has to pay.</P>
    <P>I always get the credit for the tuberculosis scheme but I was implementing a piece of Fianna Fáil legislation which had a free, no means test principle. The infectious diseases scheme also had a free, no means test principle.  Why have we departed from that principle? The Minister has given no explanation. He has made no attempt to rationalise the desertion of this excellent scheme. At that time the Fianna Fáil Government were well up with the national health scheme, which, for all its defects, broadly was infinitely more advanced in its social morality and social attitude to this kind of thing, robbing the poor to protect the rich.  Even if the old people were not treated better in the north, even if the unemployed were not treated better in the north, even if housing was not better, even if education was not better, probably the greatest single impediment, recognised by both the Unionist Protestant and the Nationalist Catholic, against uniting Ireland would be the national health service with all its defects, compared with the Victorian poor law means test in medicine which we have down here.  Catholic or Protestant would be very foolish in the north, I have said it many times, and they know they would be very foolish, to come into this kind of society in which these kinds of services are put forward as panaceas for the very frightening needs and demands of health services. One in ten, the Minister tells us, will spend some of his time in hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made no attempt to defend his departure from this excellent Fianna Fáil principle.  He cannot produce any medical grounds at all for the great achievement of the virtual disappearance of infectious diseases of all kinds&mdash;diphtheria, scarlet fever, <Col N="192" /> typhoid, tuberculosis and all these things&mdash;directly due to the introduction of these magnificent schemes under the Fianna Fáil 1947 Act in particular. People say it is simply a question of new drugs making all the difference. This again is a dishonest over-simplification of the truth.  One only has to look at East Pakistan.  There are excellent ways of preventing cholera; there are excellent ways of curing cholera, but look at East Pakistan. There are many countries in which infectious diseases are still rife&mdash; typhoid, typhus, tuberculosis, child meningitis.  The drugs are there, the medicines are there, the doctors are there, the nurses are there to cure all of these conditions, to prevent all of these conditions, but they are neither prevented nor cured.</P>
    <P>It is the presence of the schemes readily available that makes the difference between life and death, life and disease, life and permanent disability, unnecessary illness, unnecessary death. It is the existence of the schemes and the availablity of the schemes.  The wealthy people never had any great difficulty in dealing with preventable or treatable diseases.  They could always pay their way.  As long as they could pay their way they could save their lives and prevent themselves unnecessary pain and disability.  Scandalous but true.  That is the way society is organised.</P>
    <P>It was because we had these schemes readily available under the Fianna Fáil 1947 Health Act that any great advances were made in relation to the improvement of our health services. We have now turned our backs on that.  There is no way in which the Minister can justify the failure to continue with these excellent principles. I presume they are not frightened of the Bishops, or maybe they are, maybe this is their real worry.  I find it hard to believe that Fianna Fáil could have run that far from their earlier traditions. There is no reason advanced whatever for departing from what we know to be an excellent basic principle in fiscal policy related to the creation of social services in a social democracy of this kind.  All the Minister can tell us is that it has to be related to national income, it has to be related <Col N="193" /> to national production.  The usual performance. But the Minister is one of the most intransigent defenders of the capitalist system.  He says it is infinitely superior to the socialist idea, a most obstinate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not misquote me.  I have perpetually said I believe, and Fianna Fáil believe, in a mixture of private enterprise and socialism.  I have outlined that at very great length at least half a dozen times. A mixture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;A mixture&rdquo; are the operative words.  &ldquo;Confused&rdquo; would be a better one.  You can have all sorts of mixtures.  You can have a mixture in which one predominates and the other is negligible or not noticeable.  That is the one that I would say now dominates Fianna Fáil policy and that is a complete reverse of the attitude of Fianna Fáil in the years 1932 to 1939 when the interest of the mass was the predominating interest in the Fianna Fáil Party and led to major advances in health, social legislation, housing and so on.  Fianna Fáil in my view can take virtually all the credit for this because of their preoccupation at that time with a different mixture to the one the Minister has now put forward. The mixture then was the mass against the minority.  Now it is the minority's interest against the interest of the masses.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government can make no defence at all of their present policy or no defence at all of their departure from their own policies. I have tried to show that taxation on the ordinary consumer is infinitely heavier than the Minister would appear to believe.  I have referred to national health insurance contributions, purchase tax, wholesale tax and now this new health tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At least those with £1,600 a year and under are getting something for it. Unjust as it may be, they are getting something for it, but what about the unfortunate person with from £1,600 to £2,000 or £2,500 or £3,000 who has not got enough to be unworried about ill health and who is at least covered by the new type of insurance but has to pay on both sides?  I am referring <Col N="194" /> to the white collar worker who is paying for this scheme through various taxation devices and who is also paying to allow the wealthy Canadians or Swedish or British or Irish or whoever they may be, to dig our silver, or lead or copper or whatever it may be, out of the ground and export it at great profit to themselves, a policy which is now being rejected by almost all of the most backward middle-eastern and African countries.</P>
    <P>If he is in any way conscientious he is also paying for the protection of his own and his family's health through the voluntary health insurance scheme, another patch in the patchwork, the pathetic, makeshift patchwork of our health services.  That is his additional taxation.  The voluntary health insurance scheme is, of course, a very selective scheme.  A person is not allowed to benefit from it at all if he has a bad health record, and nobody needs it more than the man with the bad health record.  He gets no general practitioner cover.  He gets no chemist bill payment, an even greater need than general practitioner cover these days because of expensive drugs.  He gets no maternity benefit for his wife, which is probably the costliest of the whole lot and which he is encouraged to qualify for at least once a year if he is a professing Catholic.  He is advised not to indulge in responsible family planning and contraception.</P>
    <P>So, the lot of the unfortunate person with £1,600 a year and under is bad, but the lot of the person with £1,600 to £2,500 or £3,000 a year is worse. He is the unfortunate who is crushed between the upper and nether millstone. He pays tax to help the people with £1,600 a year and under, and to save the people with £3,000 a year and upwards.  Then he pays his voluntary health insurance scheme contribution. Then, in addition to that, like almost everybody in this society, he has to pay tax on his hire-purchase commitments. There are taxes all round.  They are most complex.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate salaried person or wage earner has a treadmill kind of existence.  Everything that comes in at the end of the week or the month is <Col N="195" /> already opted for, somewhere or other: rates, taxation, health contribution, health insurance contributions, social welfare contribution and hire-purchase commitments, in this wonderful society in which the one great thing is to own property.  I do not suppose that 5 per cent of the average suburban householders or families own 2 per cent of their property, including their houses.  Hire-purchase companies own their fridge, their radio, their television set, their motor car, in some cases their clothes and in most cases their house.  This is the great property owning democracy.</P>
    <P>These are all taxes which these unfortunate people have to pay and the Minister is making no attempt whatsoever to help them in this piece of legislation. The Minister makes no attempt, and has never made any attempt, to explain why it is that if people are successful in their work, if they get up the promotional ladder in their jobs, this indirect tax on thrift, which is what it amounts to, inevitably hits them.  If a person has £1,601 a year he and his family are out of benefit. Contrast that with this continuing plaintiff concern for the wealthy person. Unless he gets this tax concession you cannot expect him to work that hard or to make his business a success. Unless these mining people get their tax concessions you cannot expect them to dig the silver out of the ground.  They have to be helped to do this.</P>
    <P>It is really inconceivable that any thoughtful, intelligent rulers of any society would attempt to rationalise that kind of behaviour.  These people must be helped.  These people must be encouraged.  Taxation must be reduced. They must be protected at all costs and let the white collar worker or the manual worker pay.  I think it was Deputy O'Connor who was told yesterday that we will find ourselves paying more tax, that the Central Fund will have to compensate these people who are being good enough to come in here and take away our natural raw materials and riches, which could have so improved the quality of life for our own people here if we had developed <Col N="196" /> them ourselves.  We will have to compensate them for the wonderful prosperity promised to us should we enter the Common Market.</P>
    <P>The tax remissions will have to be paid.  We have committed ourselves and we will honour our commitments. They will be honoured, of course, by the same tax packhorse now used exclusively, virtually, by the Fianna Fáil Government, the ordinary white collar worker and the manual worker. Their taxes will go up.  Taxation will be increased and the promises of the Fianna Fáil Government redeemed at the expense of the consumers.  The Minister has made no attempt to defend his present proposals except to say that the money is not available.  He says that the rate of increase is out of all proportion to the growth in national production.  Whose fault is it that national production has not grown fast enough?  Fianna Fáil have been in office, with only a few breaks, since 1932.  Is it an act of God or is it a record of consistent inefficiency that the growth in national production has been slow?  Might it not be due to this implicit faith that the Minister has in pragmatic capitalism?  There may be the occasional spot of radicalism but capitalism is predominant in our society.  The Minister tells us constantly that capitalism is the better system. Why, then, does he not make it work? We have been told that each of the other Departments is competing unsuccessfully with each other for more money.  There is no Minister who does not come here and say that he cannot get money because all the money available is going to some other service.  For instance, the Minister for Education may say that the old people are getting the money while the Minister for Social Welfare may say that it is going towards housing, or that roads have to be constructed.</P>
    <P>With the exception of Portugal it can surely be said that we have the most inefficiently run and unjust society in Europe.  We have not the money for schools, for universities, for roads, for swimming pools, for the care of the aged, for the unemployed or for the small farmers.  Who, then, benefits from living in this society?  The only <Col N="197" /> ones who benefit are the wealthy minority.  These have a wonderful time. They have an 18th/19th century existence&mdash;hunting, shooting and fishing. For them, this is a great place to live.  We ask tourists to spend their holidays here but we must tell them they cannot stay for too long unless they can pay their way.  Is it possible that the wrong economic policies have been adopted for our problems? Capitalism cannot work as has been proved in the US which is the greatest capitalist society in the world.  The only countries in which the mass of the people are better off than in any capitalist society with the exception, perhaps, of Sweden which is ruled by social democratic parties of one kind or another, are socialist countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here with a very important subject.  Our people suffer because of misguided people such as the Minister who, in spite of what anybody can see for himself, continues to advocate policies that have failed time and again at the hands of people who are dedicated in such policies.  There is not one Minister who could not use more money but he cannot have it.  Nobody can now say that this is a poor country. We have listened to such excuses and explanations for the past 50 years.  It is now clear that we are one of the wealthiest countries in the world but the money is in the hands of the wrong people.  It is a long time ago since a former Taoiseach, Mr. de Valera, said that if the system does not work, we will go outside it.  Surely we are now <Col N="198" /> justified in going outside the system. Makeshift solutions will not solve our serious problems concerning health. We have not been able to solve the problems in any sphere in our society in spite of the fact that we have now a population of a million less for which to provide these services.  In so far as health is concerned we are probably unique in that we have had to pay virtually nothing from the Exchequer towards the building and upkeep of hospitals, which expense must surely be one of the most costly components of an efficient health service but which was provided for us out of hospital sweeps funds.  During my term of office as Minister for Health, I spent £30 million all of which came from the sweepstake funds.</P>
      <P>I shall not develop the obvious case why, down through the years, we have under-used grossly the prerequisites of the healthy formation of our society. Land has been grossly under-used; agriculture has been virtually stagnant for a hundred years; labour has been at least 7 per cent or 8 per cent constantly unemployed; one million people have emigrated and £1,000 million has been invested abroad.  The money of the good patriots has built railways in South America and other places but apparently it was not available for development in Ireland.  These three prerequisites of wealth have been grossly under-used and that is why we have not the money to finance the services we need.  It is nearly as simple as that.  Successive Governments have consistently deluded themselves into the pleasant belief that they should and must continue and that there is no other solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talks nearly in terms of regret of the astounding expansion of medical technology and of the increasing life-span of the average man. One gets the impression of petulant impatience because these people continue to live and make demands on the health services when, if they had any sense of patriotism, they would get out of the way and save us having to spend this money.  The expenditure of money on our health services started at such a pitifully poor base line&mdash;the <Col N="199" /> Victorian poor law health services&mdash; that practically any expansion would be a noticeable advance and would mean a significant appreciation in the amount spent.</P>
    <P>I have the impression that the motivation behind this proposal is to keep up with the Joneses in the EEC&mdash;that somehow we must have some kind of contributory scheme to make us acceptable to the other EEC countries.  It is not motivated by concern for the ordinary Irish man or woman.  As usual, the Minister sees only one side of the balance sheet.  To quote Bevan's words, the Minister has the wonderful capacity of the &ldquo;desiccated comptometer or accounting machine&rdquo;.  People continue to live because of the advance in medical technology.  Most of us are glad that this advance has taken place &mdash;people who can pay for it are always glad that this is so.</P>
    <P>However, there is another side to it. A number of the infectious diseases institutions are empty and are being used for other purposes; I would mention fever hospitals and TB institutions. There are young people who do not get the dreadful diphtheria that formerly choked young people to death because now we spend money on vaccination services.  Young people do not get meningitis; families do not lose their breadwinner as they might have done in the past when infectious diseases caused deaths.  There are very few bad cripples nowadays&mdash;hunch-backs, deformed people and the like. There are very few who spend their lives lying on frames; nowadays people spend less time in hospitals where they are isolated from their families.  There are less people suffering pain and distress. Could the Minister not look at health expenditure from that point of view&mdash;that there are benefits from the expenditure on health services and, in particular, on the preventive health services?</P>
    <P>Even if the Minister is not impressed by humanitarian reasons for spending money on health services, will he not consider that it is good business to spend money for this purpose?  There are less people out of work and they are out of work for shorter periods. Would that appeal not influence the <Col N="200" /> Minister?  The Minister appears to get some comfort from the fact that other countries are spending more money on health services.  Yes, people are becoming more conscious of their responsibilities to their fellowmen.  This Christian ethic is being imposed on them by literacy and education and by the example of socialist countries.  They are being forced to become more civilised.</P>
    <P>There are some other points arising out of the Bill itself which we will deal with in greater detail on Committee Stage.  If the scheme as set out here goes through, could the Minister at this stage tell us what he proposes to do about the general practitioner service? Is it the Minister's intention that this service will be available to those people earning £1,600 per year or less in the new scheme being negotiated with the Medical Union and the Medical Association?</P>
    <P>In this scheme what is the arrangement about payment for drugs?  Drugs are a very important new development in health services, as the Minister said, and there are a great many people who use drugs of one kind or another as a result of therapeutic advances.  One gets the impression that the Minister is going to leave this matter open: there will either be a contribution towards payment for drugs or there will be a special appeal in certain cases, as there is at the moment.  A person who is not now eligible can apply for assistance but this is a very clumsy way of working.  The Labour Government in Britain departed from the original principle by introducing charges for prescriptions and it looks as if the Tories will move even further away from that principle.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about assistance with chemists' bills.  What has he in mind?  Illness can strike very suddenly and unexpectedly.  Bills have to be paid.  When the patient is well again and back at work the whole dreary process of applying for assistance with chemists' bills is more than most people can stomach.  The existing scheme has been availed of to only a very slight extent.  There is a means test.  This means test, where health services are concerned, is something <Col N="201" /> nobody seems to be very clear about. Bad as the existing means test is, the new sliding scale will be worse unless some special body devise a scheme which will work fairly and efficiently.</P>
    <P>I object to these means tests on ideological grounds.  The main objection is to the creation of different qualities of health services.  Certainly that was the evolution in the past.  A stronger argument against a means test is the necessity for setting up a bureaucratic control exercised by people who will interpret the regulations according to the law rather than according to the spirit.  Such a bureaucratic machine is very costly, so costly as not to be justified.</P>
    <P>A scheme which does not include free medical supplies is one which is bound to increase the fears of people. Illness does not lend itself to the Minister's accountancy type of actuarial approach.  People do not choose to fall ill and, when they do fall ill, it is a very frightening and worrying experience, not only for them but for their families.  Illness is something every normal person tries to avoid.  No one wants to be faced with chemists' bills, doctors' bills, technicians' bills.  For that reason people tend to delay going to the doctor and that means delay in diagnosis and delay in diagnosis means a worsening of the patient's condition and that worsening results in an increase in the cost of treatment and care.</P>
    <P>The Minister professes to be worried about the cost of our health services. He may feel he is making a saving by putting in these charges of one kind or another.  The 10s per day charge was removed simply because it was not worth the cost of collection. The Minister may appear to save money but in the long run the saving will be vitiated by the cost of the treatment required.  Fears with regard to health services that can be removed should be removed and, if such fears are removed, the Minister will save a good deal more money.  There is no general practitioner scheme in the VHI scheme and there is no domiciliary or out-patient care service.  I suspect that is one of the reasons why the Minister is now so very concerned about the <Col N="202" /> degree of bed occupancy.  The only way a person can benefit under the voluntary health insurance scheme is by going into hospital.  It is in a sense an illustration of the way in which medical practice can be changed in its orientation by ministerial policy or the policy of the Department of Health. Nobody doubts that there are many people in hospital much longer than they need be; that is generally accepted, because support services, laboratory services and so on, are not available before the person goes into hospital.  He goes in on Saturday, stays Sunday and tests start on Monday and nothing is done for the person until Friday or Saturday&mdash;five days wasted. I am sure the Minister knows about that.</P>
    <P>These seemingly over-generous attitudes to social and health legislation&mdash; to me simply humane attitudes&mdash;in the end, save money.  The Minister has already experience of that in relation to the health services, how the number of people falling ill from infectious diseases is practically negligible and very limited because of enlightened health legislation introduced exclusively by the Fianna Fáil Party.  There is no case for the perpetuation or extension of this serious departure from that excellent general principle&mdash;general, free-of-direct-payment, no-means-test principle of the earlier Fianna Fáil Party health legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>We in public life know the increasing demands by more people than ever before for better health services. People who in the past had mentally or physically handicapped children were inclined to hide them away.  Now they are encouraged and are sufficiently enlightened to bring them for treatment, with great benefit as a result.  I do not intend to speak at length on this because it seems to me that increasing services demand more money which must be provided.  When I hear, as I did this morning, talk about the late Dr. Ryan's Health Act and how much it was supposed to cost I am amazed that we should talk like this because at that time I remember quite well, while 2s or 2s 6d was mentioned, the services available now were <Col N="203" /> never envisaged.  It was only the thin end of the wedge, a beginning, but it was a great breakthrough.  I would remind Fine Gael speakers who mentioned this that as far as I remember they bitterly opposed that Act and I do not understand why they should now talk about it as if we should still be at that stage without having made any progress.  There is no comparison, thank God, between the services now and what were then available.  If we have to reduce expenditure, does that not mean cutting out services that are essential at present?</P>
      <P>I believe we must continue to improve services and make more services available and somehow find the money to do so.  The services now provided are improving rapidly.  As the Minister said, it now costs £72 million from the Exchequer as against less than £10 million in 1951-52.  But we can see the results: we have first-class medical advice and services; nursing conditions have improved out of all knowledge&mdash; they probably need still more improvement&mdash;and so have the conditions of hospital staffs.  We have improved hospital equipment, some of which is very expensive, and it is now available at several centres.  The hospitals themselves have been improved and we have provided clinics.  Research work is being done: one could speak at length on the improvements even in the past ten years.  This is all necessary and desirable but money must be found for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mental services are being improved but we all know there is tremendous work still to be done before those services can be brought to a satisfactory position.  Mentally and physically handicapped adults and children are now being cared for and treated sympathetically and to their benefit. Placement officers have been appointed to look after them so that the treatment of their ailments is not the final word; they will be so placed as to be useful members of society.  These steps were not even envisaged 20 years ago.  It can be said that we had other problems, slum dwellers and infectious diseases, which were hereditary through the conditions in which we lived and <Col N="204" /> which are now eradicated.  We still have a tremendous amount to do and money must be provided.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the socialistic system and what could be done under it: I shall not follow him on that because we are working, rightly or wrongly, under a different system and the funds must be provided under that system.  Personally, I am satisfied so long as there is a clause in the legislation which prevents undue hardship.  This is mentioned in the very first paragraph: &ldquo;...a scheme of reasonable contributions towards the cost of health services by those who are eligible for them and who can be regarded as able to pay such contributions without undue hardship....&rdquo; That is the safeguard about which I am most concerned. I have worked since their inception in a health authority who have been, I would say, almost benevolent in their interpretation of the hardship clause.  I have yet to meet a public representative in Cork who has a fault to find with the interpretation of the hardship clause in regard to the granting of medical cards or reduction of hospital bills.  That is a very import-and section of the Bill and should satisfy many people.</P>
    <P>It will be a great relief to many people to know that when they or any members of their family are hospitalised they will be free of any bill.  We in public life should also be relieved because people are continually coming to us and saying that the 10s per day should be reduced.  One of the things I regret is that they get the bill as a lump sum at the end of their stay in hospital when it has mounted to perhaps £10, £15, £20 or more and they find it difficult to pay even though it is assessed only at the rate of 10s a day.  We have been requested to have it reduced to 6s or 5s a day and have had to make representations because the payment involved a certain hardship. In most cases, if the amount was not reduced, deferred payments would be accepted.  The fact that people need not worry about hospital bills for themselves and their families is a great relief which is well worth contributing towards as an insurance policy.  It is an <Col N="205" /> insurance policy and as such should be welcomed.  I am not one of those who believe that everybody should get everything for nothing.  It is right that people should learn to be thrifty, to put something away for the rainy day, to save for health purposes just as they do for holidays and other things.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be made for providing relief for the person who has a good income but who has to meet heavy medical expenses because of the presence of a handicapped child or a chronically ill person in the family. Those who enjoy good health are the wealthiest people in the community and they should contribute towards those who are not in that happy position. It is a duty and should be so regarded.  We are urged to help the poor not only of our own country but of other countries.  We should need no urging to help those who are ill and in need of medical care.  The thing that I welcome even more than the State expenditure on medical services is the tremendous upsurge in voluntary help which is given so willingly and generously by hundreds of people to those less well-off than they are.  In the city and country of Cork there are many movements absolutely depending on the voluntary assistance that is given so generously.  May I mention in particular the Mental Welfare Association who have done tremendous work for patients in mental institutions, taking them out, reading to them, bringing them to the theatre? This is something that we can be very proud of.  No matter what the State may be able to do in the future, it will never be able to replace the voluntary organisations.  It should be realised that there is always need for the voluntary worker, that his or her services are irreplaceable.</P>
    <P>This money is needed for the expansion and improvement of the services. We may differ as to how the money may be raised and as regards the people who may have to pay it but there is no difference of opinion about the fact that the money is necessary and that it will be well spent.  On this premises the Minister has gone to great pains to see that those who benefit in future, as we all may, will <Col N="206" /> pay something, that those who are unable to pay will not be asked to pay and those who have to pay are those who can afford to pay without hardship. For that reason I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That people should be encouraged by insurance to provide while in good health for the hazards of illness in their own case and in the case of their neighbours is a sound social principle and one that has been advocated from these benches for many years&mdash;a sound social principle because by means of community effort, by means of social insurance, the community can supplement, but not supplant, the efforts of people to provide for themselves.  That is the basis of the claim for social insurance in our health services.</P>
      <P>To the extent that this Bill smacks of insurance it does merit attention though I note that the Bill in its Title denies the insurance content.  The Title is the &ldquo;Health Contributions Bill&rdquo; and, frankly, I am not surprised.  In my view, this bit of legislation is a tawdry exercise in public deception and it is put forward by a Minister for Health who should be thoroughly ashamed of his proposal.  Indeed, it is in keeping with the last 20 years and the whole sordid story of the exploitation by Fianna Fáil of the problem of ill health in this country for short-term political purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Health Act, 1953.  Deputies who were in this House at the time can well recall the claims made on behalf of that kind of legislation.  The people were promised under the policy enshrined in the Health Act, 1953, as a Bill going through this Dáil, that there was going to be a new era in health services, that without cost to themselves a paternal State was going to provide developing health services for the sick and the needy, the underprivileged and generally for the mass of the people. In the general election of 1953 the Fianna Fáil slogans were: &ldquo;Should wealth buy health?&rdquo;; &ldquo;Vote for Fianna Fáil to ensure free health services&rdquo;. Of course, that was not true, it was not accurate, and it was in itself an exercise in public deceit just as this <Col N="207" /> Bill is.  There was no intention of providing anything adequate in the way of health services free for the people, because it could not be done; our resources could not have permitted it; but the people were fooled into believing that that was what would happen and, of course, the proposer of the legislation and of the policy contained in the Health Act, 1953, in the events that had happened, did not have the responsibility placed on him to see that Act put into operation.  Unfortunately, that was my lot.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health I undertook to Dáil Éireann, despite my views on the policy contained in the Health Act, 1953, and the views of my party, that if it were possible at all I would see that the Act was fully implemented before I left office.  That undertaking was fully discharged.  What was the Health Act, 1953, and its policy?  It was, in effect, a re-enactment by this Dáil at that time of the poor law relief system of medicine that had represented the public charitable disposition of the imperial Parliament of a century ago.  We had the dispensary system of medicine&mdash;no longer called such&mdash;available for those who, in the terminology set out in section 14 of the Health Act, could prove that they were totally unable to provide for themselves and their families by their own industry or other lawful means.  In other words, it was incumbent under that Act on a person who had been promised free health services by the Fianna Fáil Government to prove that he was a pauper. Having established that and having gone down on his knees before some employed inquirer, he came out with the badge of entitlement, the medical or blue card.</P>
    <P>The dispensary system of medicine under the Health Act, 1953, was Fianna Fáil's gift to the Irish people.  There were means tests.  It was my unfortunate obligation at that time to endeavour to put the Act into operation. In doing so, I made it clear that I did not believe it was right or proper that we should try to advocate a paternalistic attitude towards health services.  In the first place, I do not think that this is possible, and anyone <Col N="208" /> who advocates that type of approach is asking people to look forward to never-never land.  I believed that the State had a direct responsibility to supplement what an individual could do for himself, his family and dependants&mdash;supplement but not supplant. Believing that, I suggested that there should be some immediate examination and appraisal of the possibility of health insurance in this country.  Some people said at that time that such an idea was just not feasible because we did not have the centres of population and the large sectors of people in industrial employment, such as are found in England, on the Continent and elsewhere and which make such a plan feasible.  The inquiry continued and the first fruit of that investigation was the suggestion of voluntary health insurance outside the Health Act services. I am not going to talk on that subject.  It is history now.  That proposal was criticised, attacked and jeered at but the scheme went into operation and has been a very significant success.</P>
    <P>Following that experiment in insurance my party in particular considered the feasibility of providing a comprehensive medical service based on the principles of social insurance.  The inter-Party Government had left office at the time, but the work went ahead. What we sought to do was to provide for all persons a full domiciliary, medical service with free choice of doctor, free hospital services, free specialist services and a free mother and child service.  It was part of the proposals that all services and medicines would be provided free of charge to a section of the people who had been known as the lower-income group, and who had subsequently been called &ldquo;those entitled to full eligibility&rdquo;, but to a sector of the population totalling 800,000 people.  In relation to others, the scheme envisaged the provision of drugs and medicines at half cost based on a national list, and the provision in the same sense of dental, ophthalmic and other medical appliances.  The scheme also envisaged an adequate domiciliary nursing service for the sick and the aged and the development of measures for the home treatment of people.  That was what we proposed to achieve.  The <Col N="209" /> result was that we were able to put forward, ten years ago, a viable scheme based on the existing hospital and specialist services under which all these services could be provided for a contribution of 1s 6d per week from each employed person, a similar contribution from the employer, a contribution of 2s per week from each farmer and a contribution of 2s per week from each self-employed person within the scheme.  The ambit of the scheme covered 85 per cent of the population. The State paid its one-third and would continue to pay as a contribution towards the scheme the cost of providing the full services for the 800,000 people in receipt of social welfare assistance of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that ten years ago, based on the existing hospital services, a scheme along these lines could have been financed for a contribution by a worker equated to the then cost of ten cigarettes.  Of course, our proposal was ridiculed by the then Fianna Fáil Government.  In fact, I remember a Minister for Health at the time saying: &ldquo;What you are proposing is a poll tax on people.  You are proposing to tax people at the rate of 1s 6d per week.  We could not have that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Fortunately, however, these Fine Gael proposals at the time attracted considerable public support and sympathy, and although I was well aware that the Fianna Fáil Government had no intention of implementing them, probably because they had emerged from this side of the House, nevertheless, political expediency at the time dictated that something should be done.  As a result a Select Committee on Health Services was established some years later.  I do not want to go into the history of that committee.  Suffice it to say that it was intended to bury in the limbo of forgotten things all proposals in relation to health policy and its development. However, I went along to that select committee on behalf of my party. After the period in which submissions were taken from different bodies and different associations concerned with health, most of whom recommended the introduction of a health insurance scheme, I eventually submitted, on <Col N="210" /> behalf of my party, our concrete, detailed, costed proposals, and the Minister has them available over there if he asks his advisors on his right-hand side.  These proposals were detailed in relation to the cost of a general practitioner service at the time, because it was only that stage that had been reached at the select committee.</P>
    <P>What was the result?  The very instant the Fine Gael submission in my name was presented to the select committee, an emergency meeting was held by the then Minister with his advisers, and the select committee never met again.  That was the end of it.  It never reported.  It never made any recommendations. It suddenly blew up because of the circulation of a Fine Gael document indicating the feasibility of a comprehensive national scheme based on insurance.</P>
    <P>What happened then?  We had subsequently the circulation to Deputies of a White Paper on Health Services. We had all the feinting, the dodging and the shop-window display that something was going to happen, but nothing ever happened: a White Paper on the Health Services followed by an alteration of health bodies, a change eventually in the Health Act of 1970 &mdash;a play on words.  The term &ldquo;lower income group&rdquo; was dropped and instead of that the term &ldquo;full eligibility&rdquo; was used.  The term &ldquo;middle income group&rdquo; was dropped and the term &ldquo;limited eligibility&rdquo; was used. You had all this posturing, this verbiage but, fundamentally, no progress whatsoever.  There still remained the dispensary service.  There still remained the means test.  There still remained the medical cards.  There still remained the situation in which we as a community were the only community in Western Europe who had not provided in some fashion for a comprehensive medical scheme for the entire people.</P>
    <P>After all that, the Minister comes in, in a hurry, with his miserable little Bill, a Bill circulated to Deputies on Saturday and Dáil Éireann asked to take it today.  The mountain has been in labour and what a puny mouse has emerged&mdash;the Health Contributions Bill, 1971.  Our people have a saying <Col N="211" /> that they do not like to buy a pig in a poke.  What is the Minister asking the people to do under this enlightened legislation today?  He is asking all the workers, all the small farmers, as a group, to pay £5 million and he will give them back £700,000.</P>
    <P>That is what this Bill is about.  It is nothing more than that.  The cost of providing free hospital in-patient services to those from whom it is collected &mdash;and in many cases the collection is not effected&mdash;is £700,000.  At the moment the small farmers and the workers have out-patient services available without charge.  For the in-patient service they pay 50p per day if they are in hospital.  There are the other existing services: the provision of drugs for diabetics, longterm illnesses and so on, the operation of the hardship clauses and all the rest of it.  The one thing in respect of which there is a charge is the in-hospital service of 50p per day.  The Minister says: &ldquo;This is grand.  Every worker will pay 15p per week from this on.  Every farmer will pay 25p per week from this on.  The total contribution you will give me is £5 million and I will drop the £700,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think there has ever been a more daft proposal put forward.  It is not as if new services will be provided; not at all.  What is there is there and will continue to be there, the only change being that the 50p a day goes and for that every worker will pay 15p per week and every farmer 25p.  You pay £5 million to get away with £700,000.</P>
    <P>If anyone went around trying to sell 7p for a £5 note he would be locked in one of the Minister's institutions very quickly but that is what this House is asked to do.  This Bill was introduced by the Minister this morning as if it were an enlightened piece of legislation marking a great step forward in the progress of social thinking. It is no such thing.  The Minister is being used as a pawn by the Minister for Finance and this House is being used, by using the motive of a better health service, to tax the workers and farmers and shift from the Central Fund on to the backs of the workers <Col N="212" /> and small farmers a burden which up to now has been borne by the Central Fund.  That is what this is about.</P>
    <P>The sum of £4.3 million is going to be collected in taxation from those who are affected by this legislation. May I use the phrase used so often by former Ministers for Health in relation to insurance: &ldquo;This is a poll tax.&rdquo; It is a capitation tax imposed on people who get nothing in return except what they have already.  I do not understand the thinking behind this.  I do not understand what it is hoped to achieve.  Of course the costs of health services have increased and are increasing.  All these things will continue to cause apprehension and anxiety to the taxpayer and the ratepayer and everybody affected, but is this the way to solve the problem?</P>
    <P>The trouble with this kind of legislation is that it will get insurance a bad name.  When people are forced to contribute to something which they have enjoyed free for many years past they will react against the whole idea of social insurance and that is what I fear.  I suggest very seriously to the Minister that he take this tawdry proposal away and think again.  This proposal does at least give some evidence of a conversion in Fianna Fáil towards the whole idea of health insurance but why not make a proper job of it?  Why not investigate now the feasibility of a comprehensive health scheme including the general practitioner health service, the service for the handicapped and the underprivileged and all the other services? Of course it would be much dearer now than it would have been ten years ago&mdash;it would not be financed by the cost of ten cigarettes&mdash;but it is a worthwhile proposal because it would remove for ever the appalling situation in which the development of health services in different parts of the country depends upon the exigencies of local rates.  It would remove a situation in which different standards seem to apply in different parts of the country because of local financial considerations. It would make people realise that the improvement in health services was something they were financing themselves.  It did not come from any paternalistic State or any paternalistic health authority.  I believe we <Col N="213" /> could do it.  It would be worth the further study involved to scrap all these bits of legislation which we have now and get down to the job of distilling and developing a national health policy in accordance with the traditions, instincts and history of our people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne was perfectly right when he suggested as a possible explanation for this Bill, apart altogether from the obvious financial one, that with Europe looming up we have to appear to wear some suit of clothes. We could not go ino Europe at the moment.  They would look at us as though we were some sort of queer insect brought in from outside.  They would say: &ldquo;You have no comprehensive health services.&rdquo;  They would not understand the delayed kind of thinking which would permit that sort of situation to arise.  Is this an effort to put up some pretence in Europe that we are doing something worthwhile?  If so I do not know who is going to be deceived.  It amounts to nothing.  It is a frothy bubble.  With the advent of Europe it would be much better if a new examination could be made and the whole matter of health policy removed from political controversy.</P>
    <P>If the Government thought that kind of development would be possible I can assure the Minister he would get every co-operation from this side of the House.  If he wants an all-party examination again he will get our help provided the target and the aim is to provide a comprehensive scheme which is available to almost all the population so that we can get away from the present system which is based on the erroneous idea which operated at the time of the Famine, when it was considered that a dispensary system of medicine was all that was necessary to meet the needs of the starving, dying people.  We must get away from that idea.  If we could develop the idea that every man who is in good health and is working should contribute each week so that a fund would be created by means of which ill health affecting any of his neighbours or himself could be paid for, everybody would know that he was providing this himself; he would know where the money was <Col N="214" /> going and that no poll tax was involved and that his contributions were not being used for any other purpose.  In that way certainly and with assurance we would be moving in the right direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Labour Party are very much opposed to this Bill.  We think it is a fraud and a farce. It is obvious to us that Fianna Fáil have now aligned themselves with the wealthy classes.  Here we see 10 per cent of the population excluded from this.  These are the people Fianna Fáil have decided should not come under this scheme.  They are not expected to pay any money towards this <Col N="215" /> service even though they avail of this service.  If the Minister is thinking of contradicting me on that I would refer him to sections of the Health Act.  The child health services are available free of charge to the wealthy classes under the Health Act, 1970.  They will not pay one penny towards this scheme.  This is further proof that Fianna Fáil have aligned themselves with the wealthy classes and decided once again to tax the middle income group.  This is selective taxation which we will not condone and will oppose with everything we have.</P>
      <P>The Minister gives us his reasons for this and he spells out the services which will be provided under this Health Contributions Bill.  He talks about the in-patient service.  We know that only 15 pence per day is collected on average for the in-patient service. We also know that the cost of administration is as high as 50 per cent so that, in fact, only £350,000 is collected from the in-patient hospital service. I cannot see how it requires a Health Contributions Bill to provide that service especially when the Minister will collect £5 million.  I saw this some months ago.  I opposed it.  I thought it was an attempt at a new form of tax levy on the middle income group exempting, once again, the wealthy classes.  I wonder why the Government could not have delayed this.  I think it is another blunder by the Minister for Finance in an effort to get in money fast.  This Minister has made many blunders over the past year and this is another.  He has decided to try this new manoeuvre to collect £5 million in taxes.  The benefits it will provide are negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The out-patient services are available free.  It was not economic even to arrange for collection of the amount payable for out-patient services so the Government found it economic to dispense with payment for out-patient services.  That is why they are provided free so that is no benefit.  We can omit that.  On the in-patient services they have only collected an average of 15 pence a day and administration costs 50 per cent.  That can be eliminated.  The infant care service has <Col N="216" /> been available and is available to all under the Health Act, 1970 so there is no reason whatever for the introduction of this Bill.  No genuine reason has been given by the Minister for Health for it.</P>
    <P>I came into the Dáil in 1965.  It was obvious in that election campaign that the people were dissatisfied with the health services so a White Paper was prepared and after dilly-dallying and pussy-footing over the years it is only now we are seeing some kind of agreement being reached with the doctors. It is obvious to me that the reason the Minister has agreed on the latest offer and the reason he made this latest offer is that he is assured now that some income will come to pay for this service from this Health Contributions Bill.  This is very obvious because he cannot even gauge the number of items of service which a person may have or year by a lower income group patient. He said he would agree and I dare-which will be used in the course of a say had the negotiators held out a little longer he would still have agreed and there would have been a final, final, final offer knowing that he would have obtained some of this £5 million to finance this scheme.  This is exactly why he is doing this.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the Minister could not even have extended this scheme to include the upper income group, that 10 per cent, the 300,000 people who are exempt from this.  I wonder why he did not include these and, perhaps, with a graduated set of payments charge them 30 pence per week.  This would have brought in £4.8 million in the year.  We are entitled to charge these people and I do not think any director with £2,500, £3,000, £4,000 a year would object to 6s a week towards the health services, more especially as they are availing of the services already.  The child health services are free to them and now I shall explain how the hospital services are free to them.</P>
    <P>They can go in and are being admitted to general hospitals for general check-ups.  They are being charged the full hospital charge but that does not take into account the subsidy paid by the Department to voluntary hospitals to cover their deficits.  Therefore, this upper income <Col N="217" /> group are getting a subsidised service. They are not paying for this through any health contribution and, again, it falls on the middle income group to bear the burden of this.</P>
    <P>It has been obvious to me over the past few years that when improvements in social welfare benefits are granted to various groups like the disabled and old age pensioners the burden again falls on the social welfare contributors.  In every case their contribution is increased.  These are the people who are asked to finance all these benefits.  It seems the Government are determined once again to impose an extra burden on this same group.</P>
    <P>What will happen to the person above the £1,600 a year limit who is working overtime?  Also, under the 1970 Act the income of the spouse was included and if their incomes exceed the £1,600 limit what will happen to them?  We should pay special attention to these people because they will be outside the new scheme.  The fact that the payment is made by the employer for the medical card holder makes it very embarrassing and humiliating for the medical card holder. His personal affairs will be known to the employer.  This places a stigma on him and he could be discriminated against since the employer might not want to continue to employ him if he is told that he must pay the contribution. This gives rise to an anomalous situation.  It should have been possible to make some other administrative arrangement instead of asking the employer to pay for the medical card holder.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the small farmer is penalised.  He is asked to pay but the large farmers with the large ranches are not included in this scheme.  They form part of the 300,000 people who are exempted from the scheme but can still avail of the hospital services free. We in this party want the health service to be a comprehensive service embracing all groups and providing a proper service, including a general practitioner service and a specialist service.  If those in the upper income group do not want to avail of these services, they should be compelled to <Col N="218" /> pay and, if they feel for snobbish reasons or any other reasons that they do not want to avail of them, we say by all means let them pay for a private service.  We would have no objection whatsoever to that, but they should be compelled to pay.  If a proper scheme was proposed we in this party would support it wholeheartedly, knowing that there would be no discrimination and no means test.  If we could rid the health service of this iniquitous means test we would have achieved something very useful for the community.</P>
    <P>We know that at the moment we are discriminating against the lower income group.  We are humiliating them and placing a stigma on them.  We are forcing them to give details about their household.  We have inspectors calling on them.  We are making life intolerable for them.  We are forcing them to prove that they are impoverished, and to prove that they are entitled to a free service.  Why be hasty with this Bill? It is badly drafted.  As I said, it is a farce and a fraud.  If we had devoted a little more time to it we could have produced a Bill which would bring in enough revenue to provide a comprehensive service.  This could be done within the next year.  It would not involve putting a tremendous burden on the Exchequer.  It would relieve the people who are most in need and it would force the wealthier classes to pay.  If we could do this we would have performed a very useful task.</P>
    <P>This Bill might be regarded as the forerunner of a proper comprehensive service if it embraced the 300,000 people in the upper income group.  If we had imposed a levy of 30p per week on those people, we would have ensured that, even though they might not want to avail of the service they would be paying for it, just as the lower income group and the middle income group will be paying for it under this Bill.  It has been obvious to all that health costs were becoming a bigger and bigger burden on families.  People are realising this more and more because of the difficulties they are experiencing.  We have never endeavoured to spell out who is entitled to free medical services or, as the Minister said in the Health Act, 1970, <Col N="219" /> who is covered by full eligibility.  This has never been determined.  I could never say.  It depended on how good a case you could make or on how a person could state his claim for a medical card.  People had to disclose intimate details about their household and their illnesses to civil servants.  I always thought this was very dangerous.</P>
    <P>People are discontented and disgruntled because they can see that, in some instances, the family next door with a better income gets a medical card and they do not, for no apparent reason.  If we had devoted more time to this we might have been able to establish elegibility and to go a step forward and make the service available for one and all.  Since the Minister and his predecessors have spent so many years in discussing with the medical profession the terms for a fee per item of service method of payment, and since it is obvious that agreement is being reached, it should have been possible to avail of those negotiations to include the people who are excluded and thereby provide a proper comprehensive service.  The hospital services and the out-patients service are available and it should have been possible to go a step further and make a general practitioner service available to all and sundry with a small extra contribution under a proper Health Contributions Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides nothing.  It is an attempt at the selective taxation of the middle income group.  There is no doubt about that.  It provides nothing in return.  I see no purpose in it.  I do not see the need for rushing it through the House.  If there were any social reason for it I would say yes, but there is none.  It is purely an attempt by the Government to obtain more revenue from that already harassed and overburdened section of the community. This is wrong and we will oppose the Bill with everything we have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  I am not surprised at the attitude of the Labour Party in opposing it and wanting to defer the benefits which will accrue from it.  It was interesting to hear Labour Party speakers state their opposition to an <Col N="220" /> improvement in the health services and suggest a deferment of the Bill for a year.  These are the same people who, over the past months and the past years, have been demanding better health services and now, when better health services are being provided under this Bill, they are opposed to the improvements they were crying out for over a period.  Such hypocrisy is not new to this House but we now have in concrete terms the sentiments of the Labour Party spokesman in relation to the improvements in our health services that will result from this Bill. These people must remember that they cannot ride two horses in the one race. It is now clear that the Labour Party intend opposing the proposals in the Bill for the betterment of the health services but this comes as no surprise to us.  The fact that at this moment the Labour benches are deserted is in itself an indication of their lack of interest in the Bill or, for that matter, in the health of our citizens.</P>
      <P>Down through the years Members of this House have contributed to debates concerning health and the views expressed, regardless of which side of the House they came from, were considered and have been used in the formation of our health services.  It was difficult to know what Deputy O'Higgins was speaking about on this occasion.  He referred to the voluntary health service.  This service is very good but bad risk cases are not accepted and consequently the State must make provision for such persons.</P>
      <P>Much has been said already about what is proposed in the Bill and while much of this concerns the situation as it was ten or 15 years ago, we are concerned only with what is the situation now and what it is likely to be in the future.  In any case, the position ten or 15 years ago is very different from the position today.  Various Health Bills have had rather peculiar passages through the House at one time or another.  I have no intention of going into details about Health Bills that were responsible for bringing down the Government of the day because our concern is that something constructive be done to provide the best possible health services for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much demand for <Col N="221" /> better health services and on this occasion the demand is being met and it is my hope that in the future we shall be in the position of being able to improve all services.  One feature of the Bill is that the 50p per day charge for hospitalisation is being abolished. This is to be welcomed because the charge has imposed hardship in some cases because of the inability of persons to pay.  Another feature of the Bill that is particularly welcome is that the provision of free drugs for such persons as diabetics is to be extended to cover persons suffering from other long-term illnesses.  The Bill provides also for persons of limited eligibility in that they will be helped to meet the heavy expenditure involved in the purchase of drugs, medicines and appliances.  Many people must take drugs for a long period of time and I understand that because of the cost of such drugs, some people could not take the amount prescribed by their doctor with the result that the amount which they did take was of no advantage. This provision, therefore, deserves widespread support.</P>
    <P>The extension in the home help service, too, is very welcome.  This will ensure that there are available as many hospital beds as possible for those who must have hospital treatment.  Other provisions of the Bill that are very welcome also are the progressive development of the child health services and the extension of accommodation for the mentally handicapped.  We are all aware of the necessity for extra accommodation for those who are mentally handicapped.  I am sure that no group of people would deny to the Minister any contribution to ensure that the mentally handicapped are accommodated. This section of the community has been neglected for a long time and it is gratifying that efforts are being made to ensure that additional accommodation will be available.  I hope that the Minister will pay particular attention to this section to ensure that they receive the assistance they require.</P>
    <P>There have been references by Deputy O'Connell in relation to the postponement of the services.  There have been too many delays in regard to the provision of services under the <Col N="222" /> Health Act.  In regard to the free choice of doctor, the delay in this case has been caused by the doctors themselves. People have been deprived of the service because the issue that concerned some people was who was getting the most money out of it.  To hold up this Bill for another 12 months, as suggested by the Labour speaker, would deprive the most needy section of the services they require.</P>
    <P>I hope the time will come when we can abolish the medical card system and have a fully effective service that can be operated without having to use medical cards.  If we have a completely free service contributions at a higher rate will be necessary.  The entitlement to free and comprehensive medical services is desirable in many ways but there is a responsibility on those who can afford to pay.</P>
    <P>The sections of the Bill that appeal most to me are those in relation to the mentally handicapped and home help which assists in the care of the aged of whom we speak so frequently. Finance is necessary to meet all the demands but I am sure that no one will object to contributing in order to ensure that their future and the future of their children are safeguarded by the additional benefits that will be derived.  Neither will they object to increased contributions being requested of them if it means that the people who are in need of services are able to obtain them.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will continue on the lines he has been developing during the years.  He has filled his position as Minister for Health with foresight and dignity.  I have attended quite a number of functions and the view expressed by learned people was that the Minister has an extensive knowledge of the matters on which he speaks.  In this he is unlike some people who speak quite frequently on matters about which they know very little.</P>
    <P>To all those who have made contributions to our health services during the years&mdash;as Ministers for Health&mdash; and as Deputies&mdash;I would say that they did a good job.  Any Deputy who makes a constructive contribution in regard to our health services deserves credit.  I support this Bill and <Col N="223" /> I hope it is but another step to ensure that those who need help will get the assistance they require.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dowling is usually capable of most lengthy contributions. This Bill is a fund-raising Bill; it is merely a taxation measure. It could equally have been introduced by the Minister for Finance because all it does is to provide for extra funds for the Exchequer.  There is nothing in the Bill about the provision of new services nor are more people benefiting from the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that charges for out-patient services have been lifted since last April.  Out-patient services have been always a nominal type charge.  If my memory serves me correctly, these out-patient charges have a rather peculiar history.  They have been described as the &ldquo;dog licence fee&rdquo;. When they were introduced the charge was 2s 6d for a surgical consultation or consultant's fee.  The service one gets in return may cost £10 or £20. The charge was fixed at 2s 6d.  Later it was advanced to 7s 6d.  That is a good number of years ago and, as far as I recollect, it goes back to earlier legislation here.  When Deputy Dr. Browne was, as Minister for Health, introducing some modification of the health services the proposed modification was objected to on the grounds that it was contrary to faith and morals.  I could never understand the objection.  Later on there was a change of government and the same objections were rumoured, but they were resolved very simply; consultation took place between a person whose name we may not now mention in this House and the Cardinal at the time and this very <Col N="224" /> abstruse problem was resolved by putting a charge of 2s 6d on out-patient services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a good government then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can recall that at that time this charge was described as the &ldquo;dog licence fee&rdquo;.  The fee was not commensurate with the services provided but that was the fee which provided the escape clause to regularise the position; by paying this fee a man was supposed to fulfil his moral obligations. I could never understand it and this &ldquo;dog licence fee&rdquo; always amused me.  It was a clever manoeuvre and it took the Fianna Fáil Government out of a cleft stick.  The &ldquo;dog licence fee&rdquo; was abolished last April and I cannot understand the Minister mentioning it in his speech this morning.  The charge no longer exists.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to people who need assistance in the purchase of drugs.  This assistance is already there and has been for a number of years. It is covered by the hardship clause. Every Deputy is familiar with this because he has to write to the local authority and ask that constituents be considered so that they may have their drugs provided free or at a reduced rate.  Those in the middle income group enjoy that concession and have done so for a number of years.  I can see no reason why it should be mentioned by the Minister here.</P>
      <P>Home health services and child health services have been available for years.  Nothing is said here about an expansion of these services.  It is certainly not spelled out.  I am puzzled as to why these matters were raised by the Minister in his introductory speech. These services are already available free or almost free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the great difficulties is that there is no general practitioner service. We have more hospital beds per thousand of the population than any other country.  This may be grounded in history.  Hospital beds were provided from three sources&mdash;the Protestant community, the religious orders and, in our time, the State. There has not been any great degree <Col N="225" /> of integration of these services.  Indeed, they often overlap.  The net result is that we have more beds per thousand of the population than any other country.  I believe this Bill will accentuate the trend towards institutional treatment.  This is a very expensive way of treating patients.  It is not always the best way.  I am certain there are many people in hospitals who could be treated at home.  If one had a hospital from here down to Naas one could get people to lie in the beds provided the beds were free.</P>
    <P>The difficulty always is to make the best use of the beds.  My own experience is that hospitals which can always provide a bed and which have no waiting list are not making the best use of their beds and are not getting the best turnover.  The middle income group, some 60 per cent of our population, have to pay the doctor and, at the same time, they are compelled by law to contribute to an insurance scheme under which they will get services free inside an institution.  In that set of circumstances the natural tendency is to bypass the doctor and look for the more expensive method of treatment.  They may get an x-ray thrown in.  The mild pneumonia patient could be treated at home by the general practitioner.  That was the practice in the past.  Today that patient goes into hospital.  By doing so he is saving money.  He is insured and his argument is that, since he pays for the services, he should get them.</P>
    <P>The pattern is similar in the VHI. That scheme does not cover domiciliary treatment either.  This is the principal defect in this piece of legislation. The Minister says the numbers seeking hospital treatment are increasing at the rate of 3 to 4 per cent per annum.  I believe that this Bill will accentuate that increase.  I admit the amount contributed is small and I have to modify my prognostications on that premise, but, when people are compelled by law to contribute to a scheme, there is a natural tendency to look for some return.  The increase will be accentuated unless there is some thinking in the pipeline; the Minister may have some idea of introducing a compulsory scheme for domiciliary <Col N="226" /> services.  So far these have covered only 30 per cent; the other 70 per cent have to provide out of their own resources.</P>
    <P>It is true that health costs have increased inordinately all over the world. That trend will continue.  Medicine is becoming very sophisticated and, therefore, more expensive.  Machinery, equipment and the evolution of new specialties all contribute to the cost but, if people want these services, they must be prepared to pay for them.  I see no other way out of that.  If the people want narrow specialisation it means that the type of service provided will become more expensive.  For years we have enjoyed a very cheap medical service at general practitioner level from the State's point of view. The dispensary services were provided at a pretty low figure but we forget they were subsidised by the private practice of dispensary doctors, private practice derived from the middle and upper-income groups.  I can recall when dispensary doctors were getting about £200 a year and providing their own travelling expenses.  There was tremendous competition then for dispensary appointments.  Now, when much higher salaries are paid, we cannot get them.</P>
    <P>I think this Bill derives from the fact that, like many services provided by the Government, it has been difficult to secure direct payments for services as they are given.  In every county council the usual practice is for people who get hospital bills that they feel are too high to go to local councillors who go to the local manager who reduces the bill under the hardship clause.  I think only a small percentage of people pay the 10s per day they are supposed to pay.  This has been the tendency from the very beginning.  It is not altogether due to political pressure exercised by county councillors but is partly due to the fact that the executives in county council offices say: &ldquo;If we do not get it in direct payments by sending bills to people we can do it more easily by adding 2d to the rates.&rdquo;  From the administrative point of view the temptation was there not to go after the recipient of the service but to make <Col N="227" /> it a county-at-large charge by adding one penny or two pence to the rates.</P>
    <P>This is the first insurance approach by the Government to financing the health services and limited though it is and open to criticism as it is, particularly as it is not a comprehensive service and is unbalanced, even it has been forced from the Government.  I was on the select health committee established some years ago of which there are still two Members in the House, Deputy Browne and Deputy O'Higgins.  I can recall that the attitude of Mr. MacEntee and, I presume, the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party in these days, was entirely in favour of the retention of the dispensary system.  The question of free choice was rejected and opposed by Mr. MacEntee who very much favoured the dispensary system because he said it was very cheap and it was very easy to sack the doctor.  To his mind, these were the two outstanding virtues of the dispensary system.</P>
    <P>Financing medical services by insurance was completely rejected by him. Because of our agitation on this side of the House people became alert to the idea of insurance and the associated idea of free choice of doctor.  It was only on the eve of an election when the late Deputy Lemass saw that free choice of doctor might be important on an election platform that he suddenly decided that the Fianna Fáil Party would agree to that principle.  Further, to emphasise his attitude in the matter he simultaneously announced that Mr. MacEntee would not be again seeking a ministerial post.  In other words, the insurance principle and free choice of doctor were forced from Fianna Fáil by agitation on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned that the cost of the scheme is small.  He said the contribution would be &ldquo;a large beer&rdquo;.  I do not know why Ministers always seem to speak in terms of beer or cigarettes.  These are favourite expressions of the present Minister, &ldquo;small beer&rdquo; and in some cases &ldquo;large beer&rdquo;.  We are improving when he has advanced to the large beer in this case.  He says farmers will pay £7 per year and people stamping cards <Col N="228" /> will pay £7.8.  It is also obvious from the explanatory leaflet that farmers will pay extra for farm labourers and domestic servants as they will, apparently, be covered by their insurance stamps.  This contributory scheme will cover the middle income group on an income basis shortly to be raised to £1,600 and on a valuation basis of £60 and will cover the entire family. It will mean the abolition of all direct charges for hospital treatment which at present are netting £750,000.  For that gain we will pay £5 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  Perhaps the Minister would explain what extra service the public will get for the extra £5 million they are being asked to contribute.  The middle income group are being asked to pay an extra £5 million instead of the £700,000 which is already being collected.  When you examine that £700,000 you must deduct the expenses of collection which one Deputy here estimated at 50 per cent.  You also have to deduct from it the moiety of £700,000 contributed by the upper income group and I would guess that £700,000 would be largely contributed by the upper income group through the Dublin hospitals.  That would leave the net payment from the middle income group, if there is such a figure available, fairly low, much less than £700,000.  So, if we brought that figure back to say, £200,000&mdash;I am now in the field of guessing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the middle income group are being asked to pay £5 million for something which they previously got for a couple of hundred thousand pounds and without anything being provided in terms of extra service or extra people serviced.  My criticism of this measure is that it is in effect merely a financial measure and should be more properly considered and brought in here by Deputy Colley rather than by the Minister for Health. He will be the beneficiary, not the Minister for Health.  It would save the Minister for Health going into the Cabinet and asking for extra money that he has collected on his own but it is nothing more than a Finance Bill. The old means test is still with us.  The health card remains and is being retained. There is no prospect of any reduction in rates as a result of this measure, no prospect of any reduction in taxation generally but a large select group, the middle income group, are being asked to participate in this opening gambit and it is only an opening gambit of a fund-raising operation without the people concerned getting anything extra in return.  I do not know what percentage of the population the middle income group would be but if the figure is to be raised from £1,200 to £1,600, I suppose the middle income group would in future constitute more than 60 per cent of the population. Taking it at 65 per cent, that means that out of 2,800,000, 1,800,000 constitute the population from which this £5 million will be got.</P>
      <P>In that respect I feel that this is a take all measure.  It reminds me of the little spinning top.  The Minister comes in and spins his little top and it comes up all the time at &ldquo;take all&rdquo;.  There is no give-out on the part of the Minister Deputy Childers, that I can see in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little further one can say on this measure.  I think it has been forced on the Government, not by any measure of conviction, but merely as a desperate effort to support a failing economy, a desperate effort to get in funds for the Revenue.  The Minister for Health has now become a Revenue Commissioner in effect.  Even at Budget time when every Minister for Finance comes in and looks for extra <Col N="230" /> money for this, that and the other thing, he always gives something in return.  He does try to redistribute in some fashion the wealth of the community. He taxes or pretends to tax those who have more than they, perhaps, should have and to redistribute it to those who are less well off.  Here is an example where the Minister comes in and asks for £5 million, or almost that, say £4¾ million, extra money from 1,800,000 of our population and is giving absolutely nothing extra in return.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hogan referred to the Minister spinning his little top. I do not know about that but I do know that there will be a considerable number of people blowing their top when they discover what this Bill has in store for them.  I would hate to accuse the Tánaiste, for whom I have very high regard, of deliberately trying to fool certain sections of the community but very definitely somebody is trying to fool them and somebody has been trying to fool this House.  When somebody starts to talk about a Health Bill of any kind one immediately starts to think of improved services.  Indeed, we have been seeking improved services under the last Health Act for some time.  It seems to have run into very heavy weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me as if this Bill is an effort, not to improve the services, but to correct a mistake which was made by somebody because when certain arrangements were made under the last Health Act which was passed here it was discovered that no provision had been made for the financing of it.  I am a member of a health board and if I am wrong, perhaps, the Minister will explain where I am wrong when he replies but, as I see it, this Bill is devised, as has been said, simply for the purpose of raising the wind and in spite of the fact that originally the Minister for Finance was under the impression that the amount raised would be £3 million and the Tánaiste, in a reply to a question from me, said that as he had not the exact figure he could not say, he now realises that it will be over £5 million.  I am sure that news was welcomed by the Department of Finance.  This appears to be for the <Col N="231" /> sole purpose of making money available to run the new health services until something else is thought up.  In fact, it seems to me to be the imposition of a collective tax on certain people.</P>
    <P>When the health committees were set up under the last Health Act arrangements were made for the appointment of a number of CEOs and under them a number of other people who would be carrying out the work, and for the setting up of headquarters and the appointment of committees of various kinds to help to operate the Health Act as it was to be revised.  As I have said, nowhere can I find provision made to pay for these extra things.  I would be the first to give fair time to see how a new arrangement such as is proposed under the Health Act would work but I see no provision made to cover the very substantial expenses which will be incurred.  It has been truly said that, so far, the Health Act has not provided any improvement in services and is costing a great deal more than the original health legislation was costing. When this new Bill was mentioned I had an idea, which may, perhaps, seem peculiar to the Minister, that in some way an effort was being made to provide many of the things which we on this side of the House have been talking about for a very long time.  I was more than disappointed to find that all it does is to propose that those who go to hospital and are liable for 10s per day, if they are in that peculiar type of class known as the middle income group, will not be asked to pay after 1st October the 10s or 50p per day they are now required to pay.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the State will collect £5¼ million and the health authority, out of the rates or from some other source, will pay the 50p per day to the hospitals.  It is as simple as that.  At present the position is that people in the middle-income group, who do not have a medical card and are not &ldquo;filthy&rdquo; rich, are expected to pay 50p a day when they go into hospital.  It has been my experience that if the breadwinner, and it is the breadwinner who has to pay <Col N="232" /> this extra impost, goes to hospital on very rare occasions the local health authority pay the 50p or make arrangements so that at least the person concerned does not have to pay it. I thought the Minister would start off by deciding who is entitled to a medical card but he says he is going to bring in regulations some time to make that decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The sooner that comes the better but it is rather a pity it was not published before this Bill was introduced because at least we would then know who was being excluded. The Minister may not be aware of this &mdash;I suppose he cannot be aware of everything that is happening&mdash;but since the introduction of the health boards a considerable number of medical card holders have had their medical cards withdrawn, not because they are not entitled to the medical cards but first because those who are now administering the Health Act are not as well aware of what the situation was as the people who were previously administering it, and second, because it was felt that in some areas, according to answers given in this House, the percentage of the population in a particular area in posession of medical cards was rather higher than it should be and consequently an effort was made to try to cut down the number of medical cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister made an order saying what the income limit would be we would at least know where we stood. He mentions the question of the medical card and he mentions the question of the farmer with a £60 valuation.  If I remember correctly when the Health Act was first introduced the valuation <Col N="233" /> was £20 which brought it to £1,200. Perhaps the Minister has forgotten that the move upwards to £1,600 will leave a rather peculiar position, because the farmer can reasonably claim that he still has to go by certain regulations if his income is only £1,200, whereas the insured person's income is up to £1,600.</P>
    <P>Is there any good reason why a number of other matters, particularly the domiciliary services for which these people will still have to pay, could not have been included in the scheme proposed even if it meant putting a charge on more than the people who are referred to here?  The Minister pooh-poohs the question that anybody should suggest that 15p is too high a charge.  Perhaps the Minister has forgotten but it is just as well to remind him that his colleague the Minister for Finance has already put on an impost of £11 income tax, which is over £18 a year, and works out at about 40p a week out of a working man's wages, and in addition it is now proposed to deduct £7.80 for health.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why some arrangement should not have been made not by the addition of 15p but by the addition of a much smaller amount on all insured workers in order to give them something which they have been claiming for years as a right&mdash;a free medical service?  I believe this could be done.  I know a number of people who work very hard in order to make ends meet and when either they fall ill or a member of their family falls ill they send for the local doctor. With all due respect to the numerous doctors in this House there are doctors who believe in getting their pound of flesh when attending a patient and insist on being paid for their services. Indeed, when some go to a house they apparently first refer to the fact that they will have to be paid before they even look at the patient.  These people would be very glad to pay a few extra pence if the domiciliary services could be given free.  The Minister did not think of that; he decided to put 15p on all insured workers who do not have a medical card.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister knows that those who have a <Col N="234" /> medical card today may not have it tomorrow and those who do not have a medical card tomorrow may have one the day after.  There is a continual change over and back with medical card holders.  It is going to be extremely difficult to keep track of those who should or should not pay this amount.  Is it the Minister's intention that if they are in a certain category when the Bill is passed and the first collection is made that they must continue to be in that category for a period of, say, 12 months?</P>
    <P>In addition, I should like to know how he proposes to collect the £7 a year from farmers and self-employed people.  It is very easy to write it into a Bill: &ldquo;It shall be done&rdquo; but collecting it is an entirely different matter.  Apparently this Bill, which was first mentioned during the Budget, and has had a few brief references made to it during the years has apparently not yet been thought out fully because there are so many imponderables in it that even now the Minister, if I asked him, I am quite sure, could not say how it is proposed to do a number of things which it is suggested in the Bill must be done after the Bill has been passed, or with effect from 1st October next.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why the Bill should not have been made to apply to very many more people than it does apply to?  Why say £1,600?  Some people may find this a rather peculiar thing but there are people in receipt of £1,600 a year who find it extremely difficult to pay hospital bills and ordinary medical expenses.  The Minister is, of course, aware that the trade union movement and many other people asked the Minister for Social Welfare to increase the limit for insurability to a much higher figure than £1,600.  Of course he said £1,600 and there it must stay for the time being, anyway.</P>
    <P>The Bill is badly thought out.  Those who have drafted it are as far out in their estimates of how it is going to work as they are in their estimates of what it is going to bring in and what it is going to cost.  In one section the Minister says that certain low income people&mdash;he mentions specifically farm <Col N="235" /> workers and domestic servants&mdash; because their rate of insurance stamp is lower can be exempted without any difficulty.  He says further on that other low-paid workers cannot be exempt because there is no difference in their insurance stamp and that of higher paid workers and that in such cases the employer will be requested to pay for the stamp.  He also says&mdash;I have been trying to find some type of rebutting clause which I have not found&mdash; that the employer has the right to collect back from the worker any health insurance which he has paid for that worker.  When the Minister is replying I would be glad if he would show me where it is stated in the Bill that the insured worker, who has his health stamp paid for by his employer, is not required to refund that out of his wages.  So many sections of the Bill appear to me to be contradictory&mdash;as do indeed, the explanations given by the Minister&mdash;that I cannot see how it is proposed to make the measure work.  One of the things which should be taken note of is that the Minister refers to the people who will benefit&mdash; I would put a question mark after the word &ldquo;benefit&rdquo;&mdash;as the limited eligibility group.  The Minister says:</P>
    <P>Again I feel that the limited eligibility group can make this contribution and as incomes rise the contribution can be markedly increased.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister is giving as a throw-away in the last few lines of his speech a warning that this is the thin end of the wedge and that as soon as this is the law there will be very little difficulty in pushing it up when the Minister feels like doing so. It reminds me of the introduction of the turnover tax.  It appears that the Minister has at the back of his mind that he can increase this when it suits him.</P>
    <P>We have been asking for graded payments and graded benefits for social welfare insurance for many years without much encouragement from the Government.  One or two noises have been made to the effect that the matter was being considered but we have not <Col N="236" /> got any concrete example that this sort of thing could be put into operation in 12 or 18 months time.  We have here a suggestion, without giving it very much consideration, that it is the intention of the Government to introduce this type of payment which can be increased if and when those who are paying get increased wages and, indeed, in the section of the Bill it is suggested that the idea is to apply on existing wages a graded scale at a later date when it suits the Minister to do so.</P>
    <P>I am rather touched by the Minister's suggestion that he has had investigations made in other parts of the world as to how health services are being financed.  The fact that he starts off with the United States of America makes me laugh when we know that the one thing you must not do in the United States, if you have not got plenty of money, is get sick because if you do then nobody cares about you unless you are able to pay your way. As far as Britain is concerned may I repeat what one of my colleagues said earlier?  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>In Britain the cost of the national health services continues to cause concern and proposals have been under consideration for increasing the revenue from charges on patients for prescriptions.</P>
    <P>May I point out that this is under a Tory Government which it appears will not be there very long to make any regulations good, bad or indifferent. The suggestion that we should try to base any legislation we are proposing here on what is being done at present in Britain is too ludicrous to pursue it any further.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, is referring in this case to the charges on patients for prescriptions.  I am surprised in view of the fact that he makes no comment at all on what should happen in this country with regard to payment by patients for prescriptions. Does he know that one of his predecessors, who was not terribly popular in this House as an administrator, did, in fact, introduce a regulation whereby in hardship cases prescriptions could be paid for by local authorities and that if this is administered properly <Col N="237" /> there is no reason why we should have to introduce special legislation to deal with it?  Is he aware also that the home helps which he talks about have been in operation in many cases for quite a long time?</P>
    <P>This appears to be a piece of legislation which is dressed up to look like something which it is not.  We have heard of mutton dressed as lamb.  This looks like a particularly ancient piece of mutton which is being dressed up as lamb.  We have taken a bite of it now and we realise that it does not taste too good.  It is hasty legislation. It is an attempt to put across something which has been badly thought out, rushed into the House for one reason or another and it will not achieve what the Minister says it will achieve.  There are many things which could have been regulated and improved in the Bill if the Tánaiste was anxious, as Minister for Health, to do so and it is just not good enough to put before Members of this House a Bill such as this which suggests that all that is worrying the middle-income group as far as health is concerned is the 10s per day which they are supposed to pay if they go into hospital.  It would be a very good exercise on the Minister's part if he would withdraw this Bill and present a Bill covering the matters which he must know are affecting the people concerned, if he would arrange even if he has to twist the arm of his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, to increase the insurability limit very considerably, and if he would ensure that the limit would be high enough to cover those who are unable to pay for health services at present out of their own resources.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is well meaning. I would take it that he considered when this was mentioned to him that it was, perhaps, a step forward.  I am trying to point out to him that it is not the step forward he thinks it is and that, while some people, who are ill and who have been caught for 10s per day when they could not afford it, will welcome the introduction of something like this, very many people will be terribly disappointed because, when they heard this Bill was being introduced, they thought it was something <Col N="238" /> very different from what has been put before us in the last few days and, indeed, what has been explained to us by the Minister today.</P>
    <P>It is not too much to ask that this Bill should be entirely redrafted.  We have redrafted enough Bills over the past couple of years.  Some of them have been introduced here and after debating them for months it eventually dawned on the Minister concerned that they were absolutely unworkable and they have been taken back and presented in a different form.  I hope the Minister will do the same with this.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste may feel that I am being pretty harsh in my comments on this Bill.  I want to assure him that if I am harsh it is because I meet every day in the week people who will be affected by this Bill and people who are expecting something from it.  I should like to see something better being produced than this sham because a sham it is.  It proposes to do things which I believe it cannot do and it ignores completely the things which it should be dealing with.  It is not the type of legislation which this House should have before it now.  It is something which might possibly have been dealt with by a full committee of the House and would be amended in this House by the Opposition Parties if we got an opportunity of doing so but we cannot because it would involve finance and, therefore, all such amendments must come from the Minister's side.</P>

It is understood from the hospital that this represents an improvement on what the position was a year ago.  The <Col N="241" /> total number of tonsil and adenoid operations being done in the hospital is over 1,000 per year and the waiting list is made up mainly of such cases.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware of the increase in the number of fatal accidents on level crossings used by CIE rail services; and what steps will be taken to prevent such accidents in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1961 to 1970 the number of accidents per annum at level crossings on the CIE rail system dropped from 38 to six and with the exception of 1967 when there were seven fatalities, four of which occurred in one accident, the number of fatalities shows no upward trend, varying from nil in the years 1961, 1963 and 1970 to one or two in the remaining years.  All of those fatal accidents, except two, occurred at unattended crossings at which CIE have no statutory obligation to provide attendance.</P>
      <P>As a result of a special investigation carried out by CIE in 1965, the board have taken certain measures to improve safety precautions at unattended crossing.  Additional warning signs and whistle boards have been erected and steps have been taken to improve visibility where this is practicable.</P>
      <P>The board have also, in collaboration with the traffic section of the Department of Local Government, produced two safety films for showing on TV&mdash;one relating to unattended crossings and the other to the automatic barrier type crossing.  In the films the proper method of using the crossings is demonstrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of safety at level crossings has also been under examination by my Department in consultation <Col N="249" /> with the Department of Local Government and CIE.  As a result of this examination, it is proposed to install automatically controlled warning devices instead of gates at a number of selected unattended crossings and provision has been included in the Transport (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1971 to enable this to be done. Provision has also been included in this Bill for an increased maximum penalty of £25 for failure by a user to close the gates at an unattended level crossing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if it is in accordance with the role of the Civil Service that civil servants should take part in meetings in various areas of the country in order to explain Government policy, such as that on community schools, particularly when such policy is politically controversial and involves important social and religious issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Civil servants attended the meetings referred to in order to explain and clarify, as necessary, the proposals already made by the Minister for Education, to listen to the views of parents and other interested parties and to report back to the Minister for Education.  This procedure does not contravene the accepted role of the Civil Service in such a matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this is a new departure in so far as these people appear to have been directed by the Minister to engage in a national campaign in a politically highly charged and controversial subject?  These people must find themselves subject to criticism and possibly attack and, in turn, find that they are attacking and criticising, thus losing the traditional non-political role of civil servants?  Would the Minister not consider that there is a danger they may find themselves in conflict with Deputies, councillors and people who may form the Cabinet in a subsequent Government, should there be a change of Government?  In fact, they may find themselves in an invidious position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic issue is the distinction between the enunciation of policy, which is a matter for the political head of the Department&mdash;the Minister&mdash;on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the explanation and clarification of aspects of such policy as enunciated by the Minister.  In cases where clarification is necessary the technical and specialised knowledge of the matter which would be available to civil servants comes into play. This distinction has been drawn in instances in the past where somewhat similar cases occurred.  I might draw the attention of the House to something that bears out what I have said. In the Irish Press of 24th June, 1971, there appeared an article by Father Joseph Nolan, Dean of Studies at Rockwell College, in the course of which he said:</P>
      <P>The Department was extremely well served in the officers chosen to administer this consultation.  The exercise was carried out in exemplary fashion.  There was no effort to push departmental policy, only to state it, clarify it where necessary, and listen.  There was on their part courtesy and a clear wilingness to listen, and possibly to learn.  They had come not to impose a view but in search of views.  They would report back, they said, to the Minister. They were in the best tradition good civil servants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the general principle is as laid down by the Minister.  This appears to be an unusual departure from precedent. Apparently these meetings are tending to become controversial in which case one is likely to face a situation in which a civil servant may say something he should not say and may find himself subject to criticism, something all of us have tried to avoid up to now in relation to civil servants because they are not in a position to defend themselves.  Would the stand taken by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Collins, who has gone to public meetings himself, supported by his staff, and explained there the activities of his Department, not be very much more in line with the general practice in regard to the use of civil servants?</P>

I would agree certainly that it is important to ensure that civil servants are not, to put it crudely, involved in politics.  I would certainly agree with that and I tried to indicate that in the reply I gave.  I also tried to indicate by the quotation I <Col N="257" /> gave from an independent source, a source I do not know, that it would appear that the assessment of that independent source is that the civil servants in question in this particular issue acted strictly in accordance with the guidelines laid down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister whether he does not agree that when a civil servant takes the chair at a meeting and rules a vote out of order, or attempts to rule it out of order, that very action is of its very nature of a political kind?  When there is a controversial issue and a civil servant takes the chair and rules there shall not be a vote that ruling of its very nature is a political act and would the Minister not agree there is a divergence of practice here? In some Departments the permanent head ensures that civil servants do not take decisions of this kind and would he not consider, having thought it over, that it might be worthwhile to achieve uniformity in this respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;No&rdquo; and, to the second part, it is not possible, I think, to attain uniformity in a matter like this because circumstances can vary so much from Department to Department and even from case to case within a Department.</P>

      <P>I am fully cognisant of the fact that the ancient monastic site of Clonmacnoise is widely recognised as one of the outstanding national monuments in State care.  After the transfer of the site to the Commissioners of Public Works was completed in 1955, a large scale scheme of conservation and repair work was undertaken and today Clonmacnoise is an open-air museum of one of the greatest periods of Christian art in Ireland where visitors can view the high crosses, monastic buildings and a display of decorated grave slabs in a setting worthy of their importance and beauty.  Apart from maintenance, no further treatment of the site is at present contemplated but the provision of facilities for visitors is under discussion between the Commissioners of Public Works, the Offaly County Council and Bord Fáilte Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Dr. Byrne</b> asked the Minister for Education if he is aware of the proposed increase of fees by 25 per cent in the near future by University College, Dublin; if his Department will provide an increased grant to that university to obviate the necessity for this increase; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 34 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the proposals of the governing body of University College, Dublin, to increase students' fees as from October next and again in October, 1972.  This is a matter which cannot be considered in isolation.  It raises major issues in regard to the future provision for higher education, the nature of that provision and the burden which should be placed on the taxpayer.  It will be fully considered in all its aspects and I do not propose to make any statement in relation to it until this consideration has been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary indicate when it might be possible to make a statement because parents naturally will be perturbed by this turn of events and when the Cabinet, if it is a Cabinet decision, will make their decision on whether or not a further subvention will be available to obviate the necessity for this increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can appreciate the fact that it will be taken as soon as possible, particularly having <Col N="273" /> regard to the fact that students on grants will have to be considered as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary, being aware of the hardship facing many parents, give an assurance that a comprehensive statement will be made before the results of the leaving certificate examination and the matriculation examination come out in the autumn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give any such assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary say whether or not he is aware that the reason why this problem has arisen is that the increase in the financial aid to the college is barely half the increase in expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to raise broad issues, there are many factors which are involved in this consideration to which I referred. Many of them would raise issues as to the student intake into certain faculties, whether or not, having regard to the taxpayers' burden in this matter, some allocations must be considered to the other third level institutes and, of course, also, the question will have to be considered to ensure that those on grants will be considered favourably having regard to the whole question. There are many other matters relating to the whole third level scheme other than those to which the Deputy has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think lack of money could be summed up as the root of this whole evil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>After that long statement from the Parliamentary Secretary, could I ask him is he aware that the grant per student in Trinity College, Dublin, is £350 a year, in University College, Cork and University College, Galway, £300 a year and in University College, Dublin, £200 <Col N="274" /> a year?  Does it surprise anybody that University College, Dublin, should have to increase their fees?  He ought to have some regard for reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donovan, amongst other things, ignores the reality that certain courses cost more than other courses.  On the Higher Education Authority Bill the Deputy made that statement categorically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The most expensive faculties are in University College, Dublin and the Parliamentary Secretary missed what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if the grants will go up by the percentage increase in fees?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, this matter is being considered at this time and I think it would be as well for the Deputy and all concerned to wait until the decision has been taken but I have indicated that the grants position particularly will obviously have to be given very full consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether his Department has instructed schools, which had appointed new teachers prior to the receipt of the circular of 12th May concerning teacher recruitment, to revoke such appointments; and, if so, whether he will immediately reverse these retrospective measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the process of ensuring that the demands on State funds would not place an undue burden on the taxpayer an examination of various services was carried out.  This examination disclosed among other things that our pupil/teacher ratio in post-primary schools was so liberal as compared with other countries that a saving could be effected in this area without damage to the education being offered to the pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="275" /> Schools were accordingly requested not to enter into arrangements for the employment of additional staff without first seeking the authority of the Department and giving a full statement of the reasons which made any additional appointments necessary.  No instruction other than that contained in the Department's circular has been issued to school managers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that in one instance the relevant member of a religious order went to the Department about appointments made before she had received this circular and was told quite simply: &ldquo;You are to cancel them.  That is that.  There is no going back on it&rdquo;, and would the Parliamentary Secretary, in view of the contrast between that and the answer he has given, look into the matter and arrange that, whatever about the future, there will be no retrospective cancellation of appointments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will furnish me with the information, I will have it looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCott" hpid="Mr. Cott Mr. Cott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cott</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give sympathetic consideration to schools, particularly boarding schools, which have been understaffed and which have now a large increase in their student population and would certainly need to employ more staff and in cases where arrangements have already been made with teachers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Deputy, in fact, that many such applications are already under consideration and some decisions have been taken already.  Every case will be considered on its merits and if there are special merits of the type mentioned by the Deputy I am sure they will be fully considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware that the price of tomatoes per chip to Irish growers has dropped to 60p per chip; that this price will make many growers bankrupt; and if it is proposed to try to so regulate the market that a fair price will be paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a seasonal fall in tomato prices has occurred somewhat earlier than usual this year due mainly it appears to less buoyant consumer demand on the home and export markets as a result of unfavourable weather conditions.  I cannot see how it is open to me to regulate the supply/demand situation on the market.  I am satisfied that export market outlets are being suitably availed of to the maximum extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that best quality tomatoes are being sold in the market at 12s a chip and that small and substandard tomatoes are being sold as cheaply as 1s a chip? Is he also aware that a considerable amount of tomatoes has come in across the Border and the net result is that tomato growers, who have put a lot of their money into this type of industry, now find themselves almost on the verge of bankruptcy and would the Minister not agree that before additional incentives are given to people to grow tomatoes there should be some effort made at a marketing policy?</P>

      <P>The Minister apparently is not aware that tomatoes are coming in across the Border and are being sold at what are considered to be much below cost prices.

      <P>I agree that the disposal of the crop is a matter that needs to be considered very carefully by the industry but, on the point of the alleged import of tomatoes, my information is that only 190 tons of the 1,000 tons of the United Kingdom quota provided for by the Anglo Irish Free Trade Area Agreement were actually imported this year and that the issue of licences for these was cleared by the end of May, leaving the market clear for the Irish crop by 1st June.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister inform us as to why he refers to the weather conditions in relation to the supply of tomatoes at this time from Irish sources?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if his attention has been drawn to reports to the effect that producers' organisations <Col N="278" /> in Britain are concerned about the future of horticulture after entry to the EEC; and if he will make a statement on the future of the Irish horticultural industry, with particular reference to Irish tomato producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen reports to the general effect stated in the first part of the question.  The general implications for our horticultural industry here of Ireland's membership of an enlarged European Community were set out in the study &ldquo;Irish Agriculture and Fisheries in the EEC&rdquo; published by my Department last year. As indicated in that publication, the industry could, with the dismantlement of protection, be expected to encounter increased competition.  Because of the difficulties which could arise in the case of some horticultural products, we have raised in our entry negotiations with the Community the question of the arrangements to apply during the transitional period in regard to the removal of our present quantitative restrictions on these products, which include tomatoes.  Our negotiations on this point have not yet been completed but the Community has already agreed generally that the dismantlement of tariffs between the member States of the enlarged Community on horticultural products should be effected at a slower rate than in the case of agricultural products.</P>
      <P>As regards tomatoes, we have of course, successfully developed a sizeable export trade in recent years without any special export subsidies and I would hope that our tomato producers would be able to continue competing effectively in the enlarged European Community.</P>

      <P>In line 27, &ldquo;for use solely as part of such firearm&rdquo; inserted after &ldquo;part&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, which was put down originally by Senator O'Higgins, is intended to put beyond doubt that the right to sell a spare, replacement or extra part of a firearm without requiring the production by the purchaser of a separate certificate or other authorisation in respect of the part in question and the right of the purchaser to keep and use such a part without a separate authorisation are <Col N="281" /> to be subject not only to the condition that the purchaser must already hold a firearm certificate but also to the condition that the part is to be used solely as a part of the firearm to which the certificate relates.  This, of course, was the intention from the beginning and the change is merely intended as a drafting improvement to make that clearer.</P>

The amendment passed in the Seanad on the motion of Senator O'Higgins puts it beyond doubt that the person can only purchase a part provided it is for use in a firearm for which he already holds a licence.

      <P>In page 3, the following new section inserted before section 6:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) (1)  Section 9 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (7) of the following subsections:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(8) Registration (including registration in pursuance of a renewal of a previous registration) of a person in the register of firearms dealers may, at the discretion <Col N="282" /> of the Minister, be made subject to the condition that the person shall not deal in firearms or deal in ammunition otherwise than by the sale and purcase of ammunition for shotguns, for unrifled airguns and for rifled firearms of a calibre not exceeding .22 inches, and a person whose registration in the register of firearms dealers is made subject to the condition aforesaid and who fails to comply with it shall, notwithstanding anything contained in section 10 (1) of this Act, be guilty of an offence under this Act.</P>
    <P>(9) In any proceedings a certificate under the seal of the Minister stating that the registration of a person in the register of firearms dealers was subject, on a specified day or during a specified period, to the condition referred to in subsection (8) of this section shall be evidence of that fact unless the contrary is proved.&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>(2)  Section 10 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (6) of the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(7) The references in subsections (2) and (3) of this section to a registered firearms dealer shall, in relation to a sale of any firearm or ammunition, be construed as references to a registered firearms dealer for whom it is lawful to purchase that firearm or ammunition by way of trade or business.&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>(3)  Section 11 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (2) of the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(2A) If and when the Minister is satisfied that any person who is registered in the register of firearms dealers and whose registration is subject to the condition referred to in section 9 (8) of this Act has failed to comply with the condition, the Minister may remove the name of such person from the register aforesaid.&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment, which is related to Section 51 of the Finance Bill, proposes <Col N="283" /> to empower the Minister for Justice to make the registration, or the re-registration, of a firearms dealer conditional on his confining his dealings as a firearms dealer to the sale and purchase of ammunition for shotguns, for unrifled airguns and for rifled firearms of a calibre not exceeding .22 inches.  Section 51 of the Finance Bill provides for duty at the rate of £25 per annum to be paid by an &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; firearms dealer and at the rate of £3 per annum by a dealer subject to the condition.</P>
    <P>The reference in the proposed new subsection (8) of section 9 of the Principal Act to section 10 (1) of that Act is due to the fact that subsection 10 (1) might be construed, in the absence of the proposed subsection (8), as permitting any firearms dealer, that is including a dealer subject to the condition, to manufacture, <i>et cetera</i>, any firearm or ammunition.  It is desirable to have it put beyond doubt that a dealer who is registered subject to the &ldquo;sporting ammunition&rdquo; condition cannot avail himself of the final clause of Section 10 (1) save in respect of sporting ammunition.</P>
    <P>The proposed subsection (9) of section 9 of the Principal Act is intended to avoid a situation where an officer of the Department would have to appear in court to prove that a dealer was subject to the &ldquo;sporting ammunition&rdquo; condition.  It may be compared with section 24 of the 1964 Act, which provides that in a prosecution for an offence under the Principal Act, it shall not be necessary to prove that a certificate, licence, <i>et cetera</i> under that Act does not exist.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the proposed subsection (2) is to put beyond doubt that it is only where a firearms dealer is not subject to the &ldquo;sporting ammunition&rdquo; condition that it shall be lawful to &ldquo;sell&rdquo;, that is to sell, give or lend, to him in his capacity as a firearms dealer a firearm or any ammunition other than &ldquo;sporting ammunition&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the proposed subsection (3) is to enable the Minister to remove from the register of firearms dealers any dealer whose registration is subject to the &ldquo;sporting ammunition&rdquo;<Col N="284" /> condition where the Minister is satisfied that he has broken the condition.  This would be appropriate in a case thought to be urgent.  There is already power in Section 11 (2) of the Principal Act to remove from the register any dealer who has been convicted of an offence under the Act.</P>

      <P>As Deputy O'Donovan has said, amendment No. 4 meets the point of view expressed by him and by other speakers, including Deputy O'Donnell, on Second Stage and on Committee Stage that it would be inequitable to make this new periodic medical test applicable to existing drivers.  It was said that this was an excellent idea from the point of view of safety and should certainly apply in the interests of safety to new entrants into locomotive driving. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that it does apply to new entrants and does not apply to locomotive drivers who were employed as locomotive drivers by the board prior to 4th October, 1968.  The purpose of that is that since that date entrants into locomotive driving have, by their employment agreements with the company, agreed to abide by both an entrance test and periodic medical tests.  What we are, in effect, doing in the section, as now amended, is giving statutory effect to a situation that has existed by way of agreement between the proposed entrants into locomotive driving and the company since 4th October, 1968.  Locomotive drivers employed before that date come within the exemption which was envisaged by Deputy O'Donovan's amendment and it is put into effect by my proposal.</P>

      <P>I listened to some Opposition speakers this morning criticising this Bill.  We have a huge problem here, that is, that expenditure on health services is going up and up all the time.  It is no harm to ask anybody who is in a position to do so to make some contribution towards his own health charges.  That is not a mortal sin.  According to Deputy Tully today everything in the Bill is wrong.  He has a free scheme for everything but he avoided saying how we were to subsidise the free scheme.  We would all be happy if we could strike oil and say to our people: &ldquo;We will not ask you to pay rates, rent or anything else.  We can provide everything from our mineral resources.&rdquo;  We must be practical.</P>
      <P>A large number of people are in the voluntary health insurance scheme. I pay about £36 a year into that scheme.  Mention has been made of the small amount contributed by farmers with valuations of from £20 to £60, and the whole family is covered.  Those of us who are members of health boards know the continual pressure that is on us to have hospital bills reduced or abolished altogether.  The day has come when we should realise that we should all help each other. We are a Christian community and we should be capable of realising that. At present £7 would not be sufficient to cover a person for one day in certain hospitals if he had to have treatment. Now he will get treatment independently without having to go to any public man and ask him to have his hospital bills reduced.  We are up against this day after day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be a small contribution from every section of our people if that were possible.  Referring to this Bill as another Finance Bill is all cod.  Up to now children who are retarded mentally or physically and who have been in hospital for many years have been paid for by their parents in the middle income group and possibly the remainder of the family have been neglected.  There are a number of sad cases like that.  I believe our people should welcome any opportunity to help one another.  I was the secretary of a parish council, a voluntary organisation, during the <Col N="288" /> war, and I had about seven people cutting timber.  There were about 30 old age pensioners in the area.  This was the first time I ever practised Christian socialism.  I asked the people who were able to pay a few shillings more to do so and in that way we were able to give timber to the others for nothing.  I think it was three cwts. a week.</P>
    <P>I back what the Minister has done because I believe it is the right approach. Nobody can say that it is too much to ask from anybody.  Charges in hospitals and nursing homes today are very high.  A member of my family was in a private nursing home for a few months last year and between doctors' fees and everything else the charge came to about £65 a week.  I know that the ratepayers will now pay also but we are all ratepayers.  Those of us who are members of the voluntary health insurance scheme are ratepayers and we get no relief or benefit from the health services.  Of course there are hospitals and doctors at our disposal and in the case of fevers and certain other diseases the treatment is free.  We should be big enough to say: &ldquo;Let us all try to help one another.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister were St. Patrick or St. Peter and if he had a golden wand, he could not keep health charges down because more and more of our people are looking for treatment.  Our standard of living has improved and our health services have improved.  Working conditions for our people are better. People are living longer and they are anxious to go to a hospital or a home in their old age.  Possibly they are suffering from some disease and their children cannot keep them at home. As I often said in the old days nobody went to hospital unless he was dying. Trends have changed.  Our hospitals and our homes for the aged are more modern and I hope that will continue to be the case and that we will provide the best facilities we can.  I should like to see that spirit of independence coming back into our lives again.  If the lowest paid workers and people of moderate means paid only £1 a year everybody would realise that he was doing something to help others.  In this way the rates could be brought down.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> The Minister for Finance can only get money from the taxpayers.  We are all anxious to see the cost of living being kept down.  We are all anxious to see social services improved.  We are all anxious to see everybody getting a better slice of the cake.  We must be serious and practical in dealing with this problem.  I heard words like &ldquo;niggardly&rdquo; and &ldquo;mean&rdquo; used by some speakers this morning.  The money for any improvements must come from the ratepayers and the taxpayers. All of us pay tax and the great majority of us are ratepayers.  All of these moneys go into a central pool.  I welcome this advance and my only regret is the Minister has not gone further.  The contribution of £7 per annum is very moderate when one considers that a person would not be maintained in a hospital for that amount of money for even two days.</P>
    <P>Many insured persons will benefit from the abolition of the 50p per day charge for hospitalisation.  Every encouragement should be given to each person in the community to involve himself in voluntary work, even in a small way.  As to the collection of the £7, small though the amount is, I thought it might be collected quarterly or by way of stamps but I do not know whether that would be feasible in the case of self-employed workers.  There is no use saying that anything introduced by Fianna Fáil is wrong.  Deputy Tully enumerated everything that he would wish to see done but as soon as we impose extra taxation for the improvement of services, there is a cry from the merchants of Venice.  It is regrettable that this approach has been witnessed here so often.  The Minister for Health is making great advances in the field of health and I hope that the lead he is setting will be followed by intelligent people outside.  Our people are very good when it comes to helping each other.  During the harvest campaign of 1946, of which I was one of the organisers, I remember an old Dublin woman coming to me with two ounces of tea and a half pound of sugar which she wanted me to take for the volunteers because, as she said, she was not in a position to help with the work herself.  At the time there were about 80,000 volunteers engaged in <Col N="290" /> saving the harvest and we had obtained permission to buy provisions and, also, we were receiving many gifts.  However, rather than offend that old lady, I told the personnel officer to take the gift but to take also details of her name and address so that we could send her four pounds of tea.  That is only one example of the goodness of our people. The rates position has got out of bounds but the reason for this is that in order to help certain people, they have been relieved from paying any rates.</P>

There is some good in each of us and there is some bad in most of us.  I have admired Deputy Coughlan, for instance, for some of his deeds.</P>

      <P>Deputies should be constructive in their criticism of any legislation brought before the House.  It is said sometimes that we are only taking certain measures to get the Minister for Finance off the hook but, of course, any money that he gets must come from the people.  If we were an industrialised State we would be in a position to provide free medical service for all our people but that is not the position and, consequently, we must be practical.  Our mineral wealth is limited.  It is my belief that each person here, regardless of which side of the House he is on, has nothing but goodwill towards his fellowman.  In the House, politically, we might tear each other asunder but each one shares a common anxiety that everything possible be done for the betterment of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion I commend the Minister for having introduced the Bill.  I hope that the people will realise the wisdom of what he is doing.  Through <Col N="291" /> these measures the Minister is giving an air of independence to certain people by reason of the fact that they themselves will be making some contribution. Many people will be relieved of having to go to a public representative or some other person to explain that they are unable to pay a medical bill because of the illness of some member of the family.  I hope the Minister will tell us how many voluntary health contributors there are in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This Bill is a hastily drawn-up piece of legislation.  I say that, having read it carefully and having considered the Minister's speech in support of it.  It is a Bill that has been rushed through the parliamentary draftsman's office and it comes before this House as a vague and uncertain piece of legislation. It is vague in regard to the benefits it will confer.  The only thing certain is that the 50p daily charge for the middle income group will be abolished. There is mention in the Minister's speech and in the Bill about other benefits but they are vague and apparently have yet to be decided upon.  It is vague about the amount of contributions that will be levied.  At the moment people paying social welfare contributions will be subject to a levy of 15p.  Farmers and self-employed people who come within the ambit of the Bill&mdash;those whose income does not exceed £1,600 per year and, in the case of farmers, whose valuation does not exceed £60&mdash;will pay £7 per year.  However, this is vague because at some future date it will be changed and will be related to the income of the person paying social welfare contributions, or to rateable valuation in the case of farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vague in regard to the method of collection.  At the moment it will be collected by way of social welfare stamps in the case of those who pay contributions and it will be collected in a lump sum in the case of farmers and self-employed people.  Again, at some future date it will be adjusted and regulations will be brought in to accept in instalments the £7 per year charge&mdash;where it is difficult for <Col N="292" /> the person to pay the contribution in one sum.</P>
    <P>That is why I say this was a hastily drafted piece of legislation and that it was rushed through the office of the draftsman at the request of the Minister for Health and the Government. The Minister is a through person and I would not expect him to be guilty of introducing such an unfinished Bill in this House.  I do not believe it is accidental that he did so in this case. He is precise in what he says and does, and generally speaking he tries to do a definite job.  This legislation will be amended and improved, it will be chopped and changed in a way the Minister cannot tell us beyond saying that there is a high-powered committee working on the matter.  Therefore, the question must be asked: why the hurry?</P>
    <P>I must look to the Minister's speech for evidence as to why the Bill was produced in this way.  The only answer I can find is that it is not a measure calculated to improve the health services or to tidy up the machinery for providing health services.  It is nothing more or less than a measure that will bring into the Exchequer £5 million this year instead of £750,000. That is what this Bill really means. It is a mini-Budget that was forecast by the Minister for Finance in a short paragraph in his Budget speech when he announced this measure in the vaguest of terms.  I do not blame him because he did not have any information about it.  Today it is just as vague. The only thing we know is that the charge of 50p will be abolished and the Exchequer will collect £5 million this year at any rate and maybe for many years to come.</P>
    <P>The health services have not improved and I know that statement will shock the Minister for Health.  In many parts of rural Ireland it is very difficult for people to get medical attention, whether they pay for it or not.  Doctors are demanding a more organised life and the result is that it is more difficult for people to get medical attention.  I do not wish to enter into a general discussion of the health services, but the Minister for Health would need to keep a careful eye on the new health <Col N="293" /> boards and make sure they are operated to the advantage of the sick. We have handed over the administration of the health services to health boards that are controlled and operated by the medical profession.  It is true that as a result of an amendment put down in this House there is a marginal majority of elected representatives on the boards but it is the medical people and the related professions who control the health boards.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain some points in regard to this legislation. I know he has stated that it is proposed to standardise the qualifications for a medical card and I am glad to hear that.  Will the Minister tell us whether it is proposed on the coming into operation of these measures to give a medical card to every farmer who has a PLV not exceeding £20, irrespective of whether he is married or single? If it is not proposed to do this, this Bill will abolish de-rating, if I follow the Minister's speech correctly.  A farmer who is not the holder of a medical card will be required to pay £7 per year.  If that farmer has not a health card&mdash;in the counties I know many farmers with a valuation of less than £20 are not the holders of health cards, but they are derated&mdash;he will, nevertheless, have to pay £7 a year.  To me this is a direct attack on the derating system and I should like the Minister to deal with the point when he comes to reply.  If there is an explanation for it I shall be glad to hear it.</P>
    <P>Agricultural labourers, domestic employees and people who hold general medical service cards will not be subject to the contribution of 15p per week if they contribute to social welfare, but their employers will still have to pay the 15p per week for them.  This is my reading of the Bill.  The employer will not be entitled to recover from the agricultural labourer, the domestic helper or the holder of a general medical service card.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Take the businessman or other employer who has in his employment the holder of a general medical service health card; he will have to pay a contribution of 15p per week in respect of that employee and he will not be entitled to recover that from the employee. In my opinion that is imposing something like an employment tax on a par with the tax in Britain.  It is a tax on employment.  This certainly needs tidying up.  Deputy Dr. Browne thinks employers will deal with the problem by passing on the cost to the consumer.  On the face of it it is a tax on employment.  It might even discourage people employing those entitled to general medical service cards.</P>
      <P>A single man earning £15 a week will certainly not get a general medical service card.  He will have to pay 15p per week and the man earning £30 a week will also pay only 15p per week.  That is not fair.  That is not social justice.  A farmer with a valuation of £25 will pay £7 a year.  A farmer with a valuation of £59 will also pay contribute £7 a year.  It is difficult to see the justice in that. This is a drift towards injustice.  I had occasion to speak about this on the Budget.  The lower paid employees had their income tax increased by £12 per year and the surtax payer will also pay only £12 per year by way of increase.  That is another manifestation of the kind of thinking there is at Government level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly want to know from the Minister whether farmers under £20 valuation who do not hold general medical service cards will be rated <Col N="295" /> again because that is what this amounts to.  It is no use saying they will pay to the health board instead of the county council.  This is really rates.</P>

      <P>It is a great pity the Minister did not postpone this effort until he knew exactly what he was bringing before the House.

We got a vague hint about that but have since heard nothing about it.</P>
      <P>Generally, that is all I wish to say. I am most disappointed with the present performance which does less than justice to the Minister for whom in a sense I am sorry because I believe he was driven in here to collect this £4.3 million long before his scheme was prepared and before receiving any proper advice or proposals from his Department.  I object to the Bill because I believe it is the beginning of re-introducing rates on small farmers.  A system whereby a man with a £59 valuation and a man with a £25 valuation pay the same contribution to health is unjust and a system whereby a man earning £15 per week and a man earning £30 a week make the same contribution is unjust and cannot be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps as Deputy O'Higgins said it is an indication that the Minister at last is thinking towards a general health service based on insurance and on equality and on fair and equitable contributions. To that extent, I suppose it is to be welcomed but it is a very thin end of the wedge and only a very slight indication of the Minister's thinking. As Deputy O'Higgins also said, it is significant that the Minister had not the nerve to mention insurance in the Long Title of the Bill.  The 50p per week charged to the middle income group has stood at that figure since at least 1961 and, perhaps, longer and the Minister, I suppose, had not the courage to increase that or to wait until he had a proper scheme to put before the House.  I suppose he found himself on the horns of a dilemma in that he had given an assurance a couple of years ago that further increases in health charges would be borne by him or that he would ensure health charges would not increase further.  On the one hand, he had given this assurance and <Col N="298" /> on the other health costs were going up and he had to do something.  This is the net result.  The Minister may think we are very ungracious but if he considers&mdash;he knows it perfectly well&mdash; he will realise that the end result of this operation is to collect £4.3 million for the Exchequer.  It certainly does that but nothing else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>While we all want free hospitalisation for the majority of people I think the Bill the Minister has introduced has some dangerous aspects which merit comment.  It is important to bear in mind that in the past 20 years or so public expenditure on health has risen from approximately £10 million to £76 million a year. Much of the money is spent on the maintenance of general and specialist hospital beds.  I am wary of the possibility of patients opting to be treated in hospital completely free of charge when they could be efficiently treated at home.  However, because of the present medical services set-up it is very often too expensive for a patient to remain at home.  Successive budgets and legislation have not provided for medicines or medical care at home for those who can ill afford it, apart from medical card holders.  We saw an example of that in last year's Budget which contained a turnover tax and increased the cost of medicines for human beings at the same time exempting the cost of medicines for animals from turnover tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have liked the Minister to introduce, what I would regard as the first instalment of legislation of this kind leading to a comprehensive medical service, a measure which would deal with the majority of the population at general practitioner level. Unfortunately, we have now reached the stage where patients can ill afford to buy the medicines prescribed for them and in the area outside medical <Col N="299" /> card holders and below the £1,600 a year level doctors more and more find themselves prescribing for private patients the cheaper preparations rather than those they would like.  Very often the incomes of the patient dictates the type of drug prescribed.  Whereas medical card holders have all the drugs and hospital services available to them, people outside this category have not the general practitioner service available to them.  In some cases of illness which would necessitate perhaps two weeks medical attention, it would be an economic necessity for the patient to enter a hospital.  The maintenance charge for a patient in a specialist hospital can be up to £16 a day.  The figure of £700,000 mentioned by the Minister as a saving is a doubtful figure.  It should be related to the projected increase in the number of patients who will now enter hospital.  This is something which the British Government observed.  When they introduced their national health service they anticipated that hospitals would be closed as a result of the anticipated improvement in the general health of the population. They found, in fact, that they had to build more hospitals.  This is a possibly dangerous aspect of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Some simple form of legislation should have been introduced with a view to relieving patients who suffer from mild to moderate illness and are best treated in their home environment. I suggest that provision might be made for the abolition of turnover tax on all medicines for human use.  Even in this Bill the Minister could make provision whereby, on a contribution basis, a group of 20 drugs essential for general practitioner service could be made available.  This would create a very good system and at the same time prevent over-hospitalisation because of domestic economic factors.</P>
    <P>The type of modern hospital treatment should be considered.  The hospital authorities concerned are responsible for the patient and there is a far greater tendency towards X-raying and laboratory investigation than there was ten years ago.  The cost of X-rays and laboratory investigations is increasing phenomenally and is in <Col N="300" /> no small way responsible for the increase from £10 million to £76 million over the last 20 years.  This part of the Bill, though very welcome and very necessary, is, perhaps, dangerous because there is no provision at general practitioner level, the front line of medical service, to help patients financially to overcome illness.  This is a realistic hazard in relation to this Bill. I would urge the Minister to consider introducing legislation as soon as possible to provide therapeutic medicines for patients outside the medical card system.  The greatest hardship is caused to persons who take ill and who have not got a medical card.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the amount of money collected in taxation and rates.  It is of great importance to remember that not only have we milked the cow almost dry in regard to rate collection but that many people are certainly not paying rates in proportion to their personal incomes. Many people are paying far more in rates than their personal incomes can tolerate.  This legislation is welcome from the point of view that it is hoped it will reduce the burden of rates in respect of increased hospital charges for this particular group but I am dubious about the figure of £700,000. I consider that that is a guess rather than anything else.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the number of persons, including dependants, with limited eligibility, comprise 60 per cent of the population.  I should like to know whether the amount which he estimated will be collected involves the 60 per cent with limited eligibility plus the projected 30 per cent who have the medical card?  Will the contributions come from this 90 per cent of our population?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Only from the 60 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be the 30 per cent of the population who hold the medical card who will be paying the contributions and the employers will be carrying one-third of this increased contribution which is projected at £5 million.  I cannot but feel that it is another form of selective employment tax because they will be paying over <Col N="301" /> £1½ million.  It could mean that a person with a medical card coming to an employer who is in business in a small way could be victimised.  If two persons apply for a position with such a person, one having a medical card and one not having a medical card, and it costs more to employ the man who has the medical card, it is fair to assume that the man who has not got a medical card will get the employment.</P>
      <P>The provision of these services at no direct charge to the patient apart from his contribution is a very doubtful matter.  Can we, in fact, provide sufficient beds?  Are there sufficient beds available for these people and their dependants?  In reply to a question I asked today I was told there are over 500 children on the waiting list in Temple Street Hospital for ear, nose and throat operations.</P>

      <P>I had hoped to see introduced before the recess regulations providing free service for people suffering from specific illnesses but that is not included here.  There are many sections in this Bill which do not appeal to me.  I do not think the 50p a day which the patient in hospital had to pay was as great a burden as the cost of general practitioner services and the cost of medicines.  I do not want to say anything more but as the Minister's brief mentioned the hospital services and the cost of running them I feel I should be allowed to comment on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to various speeches on this Bill which deals with the financing of the health services. As the Minister pointed out in his introductory speech costs rise year by year.  One only has to look back ten or 20 years to see how costs in our health service have risen.  There is no doubt that costs tend to rise more quickly in an intensified labour unit like the health service because any adjustment in the pay or conditions of the people employed always brings about a corresponding increase in costs.</P>
      <P>Those of us who are members of local authorities will have due regard to the pressure at the present time on the rating system and in this context we would be glad of any move designed to remove the burden from local authorities.  We know that if costs have increased the scope of the service has been extended.  Any expansion in the scope of hospital services or any upgrading of the facilities in the auxiliary services tend to make for higher expenditure.</P>
      <P>Substantial progress has been made in the last number of years in controlling the incidence of disease in general.  We have made relatively good progress in the field of preventive medicine.  This is very apparent when one considers that we have reduced the death rate from tuberculosis from thousands to hundreds.  In 1945 the number of deaths from tuberculosis was 3,694 but since 1967 the death rate has lowered considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preventive medicine has greatly reduced the rate of infectious diseases. The infant mortality rate has dropped dramatically in recent years.  If we want this sort of service we must be prepared to ensure that the cost of the service is met in an equitable manner. There is no doubt that in years to come we shall have new problems because other diseases are gaining ground.  Some may be attributed to the affluent society in which we live and I refer here in particular to heart disease.  Chest diseases have gained ground in recent years.  There is also the problem of psychiatric ailments which require expensive treatment and a high degree of specialisation.  This trend in psychiatry will continue to <Col N="303" /> take up the time of hospital units and specialists and so far as can be foreseen this will apply in the immediate and even long-term future.</P>
    <P>There are also special problems arising from the fact that people are living longer.  They will need more attention by way of housing, nursing and specialisation.  We may expect to see more frequent changes in the health system if we hope to deal successfully with these problems.  A number of branches of the health service, especially of the auxilliary health service, will expand in the coming five years.  The service as we have known it in the past was broken into three parts&mdash;the general medical service, the middle income group service and the higher income group service&mdash;and was worked out on a selective basis.  This arose from the fact that we had to have regard in every Budget year to the amount of money which this House would vote to the Minister for Health for those services.  The service was and is available free to the lower income group and to the middle income group at a very modest charge.</P>
    <P>The higher income group was catered for by a voluntary health insurance scheme, if this group wished to take advantage of that scheme.  As good as this scheme is and was the number of people availing themselves of it indicates that while people may be interested in health from an academic point of view they are not prepared to take advantage of a scheme which offers them a good deal more in terms of hospitalisation, <i>et cetera</i> than any State scheme could offer.</P>
    <P>Arising from that, and from the fact that the Government and the Minister are aware of the position arising from pressure on the rates, this limited insurance scheme comes before the House. It is right that we should be limited in insurance in so far as it relates to providing an element of finance for the health scheme.  If one accepts that, as the Minister has pointed out, the present health service costs £76 million a year and if one relates that to the figure of £25 per head of the population in our circumstances and having regard to the size of the insurable <Col N="304" /> group one must recognise the naked fact that no insurance scheme we could provide here could be deemed a comprehensive scheme.</P>
    <P>I said we were limited in our activities in regard to health.  I would be prepared to argue that we were prepared to make the best use of the money voted by this House to gain the best results we could by way of curative measures and medicines.  It would have been a grave mistake to start a comprehensive insurance scheme here which I think would fail.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins mentioned this morning that he proposed a comprehensive scheme in 1965.  He did but he did not tell the whole story and he should have told it.  He also said that the Select Committee on the Health Services foundered when he presented this scheme.  This is not so. Deputy O'Higgins did present a scheme. We did not agree with it because we thought there were too many holes in it.  He presented it not merely to the committee but he presented it afterwards at the 1965 election.  I am not aware to date at any rate that Deputy O'Higgins found great favour for his scheme.  The vast majority of people know very well that if it takes £76 million of a vote from this House to underwrite the health of the community we could not formulate an insurance scheme which would support or return to the Department of Health that sort of money.  We have also the experience in Britain where they had and still have in many ways, a comprehensive scheme.  We know that the Exchequer had to step in to support this scheme.  We have further evidence of the fact that the late Lord Beveridge who was the forerunner, if you like, or the foremost promoter of social schemes in the past, admitted in the evening of his life that the insurance fund was being robbed and that the Exchequer would be called on to come to its aid.</P>
    <P>I want to make the point here that if we had a comprehensive insurance scheme on the scale envisaged by Deputy O'Higgins, our expenditure would not merely be £76 million but £106 million.  What sort of a contribution would we have to get from every <Col N="305" /> participant in the scheme or every insurable person to bring in that sort of money?  We must be realistic and limited, as I said, because we are a limited liability company.  We can only extract from the taxpayer in any given year what he is reasonably able to pay. When we talk about the redistribution of national income we must be realists.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the point I am trying to make is that I much prefer a scheme of this kind which applies to roughly 1¾ million of the population and is limited in its scope but yet is designed to get the best out of each branch of the health service, and yet designed to see to it that waste will not predominate and that excessive spending will be avoided, and that whatever money is devoted to the health service will be spent in a realistic way, namely, on better measures to secure a better health service for the community.</P>
    <P>Both Dr. Browne and Deputy O'Higgins contributed, each in his own way, to the provision of a better health service and let me pay tribute to them for doing so.  Even if they did, I doubt that it is realistic at this point to say that the socialist system would provide a better health service.  I do not think this is evident even in Eastern Europe and certainly not, I would say, in the Communist countries.  Be that as it may, I will not go into that matter now except to say that I hope we will be able to work this insurance scheme and apply it to the group for which it is designed.  I also hope that the medical profession will take up the terms of such an insurance scheme and apply them in their everyday work.</P>
    <P>As I said before, we do not want to have the name of having what Deputy O'Higgins would refer to as a comprehensive scheme and, at the same time, having to come in the back door and subvent such a scheme from the Exchequer.  In my opinion this is more or less a smoke screen.  I would not think that in our circumstances it would work because we have not got the scope or the grounds, shall we say, for such a comprehensive scheme except at an enormous cost to those who would be insurable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I want <Col N="306" /> to deal with is the initial statement by the Minister that:</P>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced because of the urgent need to find another source of income besides rates and taxes to finance the heavy and growing burden of health costs.</P>
      <P>It is a very nice distinction as to whether or not an insurance contribution for a specific purpose which was previously paid for out of rates and taxes is another tax.  I do not think the wage earner is terribly worried one way or the other about whether he pays the 15p specified by the Minister with his insurance stamp, or with his PAYE, or by direct taxation on an article carrying turnover tax or wholesale tax or coming under the ordinary budgetary provisions.</P>
      <P>The fact is, of course, that this is another mini-Budget.  The figures given in the Minister's speech are quite clear. W are taking from the people £4.3 million where we were taking £700,000.  This is a mini-Budget of £3,600,000.  Last November an iniquitous corporation profits tax was imposed on companies in addition to their other taxes.  They had hoped to put that money into capital expenditure to defend jobs and create new jobs.  A row was kicked up about that and at the time the figure for part of the year was precisely the same.  It was £3.6 million and £6 million for a full year.  We now have a mini-Budget imposed on us of £3.6 million in a full year.  There is no doubt that this is an extra tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of my party never said they would not impose taxation.  Of course, you have to impose taxation if you want to provide services and, of course, if you want increased services you must increaase taxation.  Two questions then arise.  One is how you raise that taxation and what is a fair and proper way to raise it.  The second is what are the services you are going to provide.  Are they proper services? Are they services that could be provided in a better way by some other means, or are they services that should be provided at all?  The position is that people who at one time or another might have to pay 10s per day in respect of themselves or a relative in hospital will now pay 15p per week <Col N="307" /> which is a considerably larger sum in most cases.</P>
    <P>I agree with the insurance contribution system but I would have thought that the Exchequer's contribution towards health could have been made to bear this impost.  The Minister's speeches of a month or two months ago suggested that he was removing hospitalisation charges from the middle income group and that this was not to be taken as being political or as being of voting advantage to his party. The truth is that this is an attempt to camouflage an extra charge on the people of £3.6 million per year.  I would have no objection to this extra taxation if it resulted in the provision of extra services but perhaps the Minister would tell us what extra services are being provided in this Bill.  Perhaps he would say that he is increasing the income level at which those in the middle income group can avail of hospitalisation in a public ward.</P>
    <P>The increase in the income limit from £1,200 to £1,600 is nothing more than political expertise and opportunism. When the 1953 Health Act was introduced this figure was if my memory serves me right, £800 per year.</P>
    <P>In succeeding years during which the value of money decreased considerably, that figure was increased to £1,200. That increase to £1,200 was not for the purpose of including more people but was set because of the decrease in the value of money.  I should be surprised if the Minister could prove that more people were eligible because of the increase.  The increase was necessary because of the decrease in the value of money and also because of the galloping inflation which is due almost completely to successive Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
    <P>While people will now pay an extra 15p per week by way of insurance they will not be entitled to free medical services outside of hospital unless they are in the lower income group.  This increase to £1,600 will do no more than bring us back to square one no matter what figure the Minister may give for the number of people who are likely to derive benefit because of this increase. Because of increases in wages and salaries there has been a constant <Col N="308" /> decrease in the number of people in the middle income group who qualified for benefit and this increase, therefore, will do no more than bring those people back into the scheme.  It will not mean that more people will be eligible for benefits than were eligible since the introduction of the 1953 Act. Instead of doing what would have been the fair and decent thing&mdash;having an increase each year related to the consumer price index&mdash;there is now this increase of £400.  If there had been a yearly increase in the figure the increase now by £400 would, of course, bring in more people, but that was not the case.</P>
    <P>It is important that everybody who reads the newspapers tomorrow morning will discover that he must continue to pay for his doctor outside of hospitalisation unless he happens to be in the lower income group.  Let us consider what that means.  It means that the medical card system is not being abolished.  It means that there will still be blue cards, green cards, pink cards or cards of any other colour depending on what local authority area one happens to be in.  This is no consolation to those people who must, when seeking benefit, give details of all income they have and hope that somebody in an office will decide they are members of the lower income group.  There is real hardship in borderline cases where the person who does not qualify may have an income of only £50 more than the figure set for eligibility.  Such people are in dire need because of the cost of drugs and medicines.  As we all know, the cost of drugs and medicines has increased all over the world to an extraordinary degree.  While it can be argued that drugs now are very effective the fact is that a man might not be able to pay for the drugs which his sick child might require.</P>
    <P>If a person is adjudged as not being within the lower income group he has no recourse, according to the 1953 Act, except to the hardship clause.  As a member of the North Eastern Regional Health Board I asked the chairman at a meeting&mdash;I do not know if Deputy Tully was present&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always present at meetings.</P>

    <Col N="309" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  I should have said that I am not aware whether Deputy Tully is a member of the committee. I asked the chairman, who then referred the question to the chief executive officer, what was the position in relation to a hardship case in the lower income group.  My interpretation of the 1953 Act in this respect is that there was provision for hardship cases and if the county manager considered a case to be a hardship one, he could take action.  I was told that the position is that at the top level of the middle income group there is no appeal.  As I understand the matter the chief executive officer must deal with whichever officer is designated by the local authority in so far as the lower income group is concerned.  I would not mind if, instead of being 15p per week, the contribution were to be 45p per week and if people in the lower income group and those who have just a little more than the figure set for the middle income group, could avail of these medical services.  Of course, the proper way of providing health services for our people would be, as defined in the Fine Gael health policy, to include 85 per cent of our people in a contributory scheme.</P>
      <P>The few who, at the moment, are disqualified from benefits, will be brought within the scope of the new figure.  No extra services are being provided in this Bill.  In a full year the Bill will result in an extra £3.6 million in taxation and presumably the 15p per week contribution will eventually be increased whereas the charge for hospitalisation of 50p per day brought the Exchequer £700,000 each year.  I am taking the Minister's figure of £4.3 million.  When £700,000 is subtracted there is £3.6 million left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully </NameTxt>
      <P>I think the £700,000 comes from the £5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan </NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, it is £4.3 million?  However, it does not abolish the medical card system or the means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not supplement the contribution from the Central Exchequer to the rates.  The position is still the same except that on 1st April <Col N="310" /> there was the transfer to the health boards of the financing of health services Under a certain agreed formula levies will be made on the local authority areas for the operation of health services.  I would draw attention to the fact that, whereas in the financial year ended 31st March, 1971, two supplementary grants were given by the Department of Local Government to local authorities, before we struck the rates in mid-March we were informed by circular that the two grants would not be paid.  The grants were introduced by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Seán Flanagan.  At the time Deputy Flanagan said that it would be a grant of everything above the existing figure of 50 per cent in cash which was falling on the rates. Within four months Deputy Flanagan had to step down; he was obliged to say that he could not guarantee this and that it was for one year only. Since that time local authorities have had a certain percentage of their health expenditure paid for by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>A circular was sent to all local authorities before they struck the rates this year&mdash;I speak on this matter as Chairman of the Louth County Council &mdash;informing them that there would not be any supplementary grant in regard to excess expenditure.  In County Louth the figure to be considered was £38,954.  What will happen in the North Eastern Health Board when consideration is taken of the excess amounts which Counties Meath, Louth, Monaghan and Cavan enjoyed in previous years?  The action of the Minister, in taking the last penny and not giving any increases in service, bodes ill for the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>This Bill increases the amount of money available to the Minister.  There is nothing to help the ratepayers, there is nothing but a future in which the Minister has forecast escalating health costs.  From this it appears the ratepayers must pay more, the Exchequer may pay more but it will be helped to the extent of £4.3 million by the action of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carter commented on the Fine Gael health policy.  First, he spoke about no Exchequer contribution or rates contribution and finally he <Col N="311" /> spoke more accurately about the Fine Gael policy.  Deputy Carter and I sat on the select committee on health and he should know that the Fine Gael policy provided for one-third payment by way of contribution from the Exchequer, one-third by way of contribution from stamps and one-third from the rates.  However, that was not to provide what we are enjoying at the moment.  It was to provide medical care and drugs outside hospital.  It was regarded as a fair way of taxation.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Minister has nailed the Government's colours to the mast in regard to the methods of financing health services; it is to be by way of increased contributions from the insured worker, by adherence to the 1953 Health Act, to the iniquitous system of medical cards and it means that for the majority of people there will not be a health scheme outside hospital. The people must provide for themselves, they must pay the doctor's expenses and the cost of medicines and drugs.  Anyone who has been obliged recently to attend the doctor and obtain medicines knows that nothing can compare with the escalation of charges in this regard.</P>
    <P>I do not mean that as a criticism of doctors.  I accept that a doctor must change his car every two years, I appreciate the running costs, the cost of secretarial help and of maintaining a surgery. I am thankful for the services our doctors are providing.  The plain fact is that in this city at the moment, if one calls a doctor to the house, the average fee is £2.  If one goes to a surgery the average fee is £1.  If one gets a prescription the average cost of that is somewhere between £1 and £2.  This is the sort of money that we, even though we say we are ill-paid and have many expenses, can afford.  It is the sort of money that the man with £2,500 a year can afford but it is not the sort of money that the person earning £13 or £14 a week can afford.  This very day I had a case which I sent to the officer seconded by Louth County Council to the North Eastern Regional Health Board; it concerns the wife of a farm labourer, with seven children, who did not get her maternity grant from the North Eastern Regional Health <Col N="312" /> Board.  I am certain the position will be corrected but, if she were on the dividing line, where are all the rest? Where is the £1 for the doctor?  Where is the £2 for drugs?  Where is the money for food, for shoes, for clothes?  I neither want to weep nor to adopt some sort of socialist line.  Quite frankly, I believe in neither socialism nor capitalism. This country is far too small and ways of life are too intermingled to produce any theoretical brand of either socialism or capitalism.  We must deal with facts.  There is need for change.  The only change provided in this measure is the garnering of £4.3 million into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into detail about the Fine Gael policy for health.  It is well known.  One of the ways a certain politician, no longer in party politics, adopted to impress the people was continuous repetition.  This bored some people but he did get across to a great many exactly what he wanted to do. We, in this party, fail in this respect because, if we keep repeating something we know to be good, we end up boring ourselves.  We are not the sort of people who can get up at every crossroads and keep repeating what we are going to do.  We believe the people know and once or twice is enough to tell them, or perhaps, at election times, at Ard-Fheiseanna and on party political forums.  The basis of our policy with regard to health is one-third/one-third/one-third. Under that scheme 85 per cent of the people would have their medicine paid for and a choice of doctor, where possible, inside as well as outside a hospital.</P>
    <P>We seem to be heading in the same direction in which the USA has gone; we seem to be driving more and more people into hospital, people who do not really need hospitalisation, people who, with modern drugs and modern facilities, could be attended to in their own homes.  If we encourage hospitalisation we will escalate health costs more and more and we will create a situation in which doctors, because of pressure of work, will send people to hospital in order to get rid of them, placing an extremely heavy charge on people in general.</P>
    <P>There is no increase in this Bill in <Col N="313" /> the valuation provision for farmers.  I know that the argument is that the valuation stays the same but the income should increase; if the valuation was producing a certain income in 1956, 1961 or 1963, the argument is that, as that income increased, there was no need to increase the valuation because all one was doing was including more people and placing farmers in a preferential position.  The fact is that the farmer's net income has not increased <i>pro rata</i> with the fall in the value of money.  It has not increased <i>pro rata</i> with the increases in wages and salaries paid to industrial and other workers.  The £60 valuation today does not signify an income of £1,600. This Bill, therefore, as well as doing nothing for anybody, is unfair in this respect.  We know what health costs are and farmers can be just as sick and need just as expensive medicines and medical attention as anybody else. What has been said here many times is correct : the first valuation figure, namely £50, and the present valuation figure, namely £60, are both unfair from the point of view of income fixed for the middle income group in other occupations.</P>
    <P>The Minister said nothing about this. He was lax in this regard and, when he comes to reply, he should certainly say something because he knows there is widespread dissatisfaction all over the country with the figure of £60 valuation.  My information is that if there was a farmer with the valuation of £62 or £63, and if there was great hardship, if, for instance, there were other members of the family disabled or unable to earn a normal livelihood, if that was a further charge upon that farm, and if the officer seconded by the local authority to the health board decided that that particular farmer was not a hardship case, then, as I understand the present situation, there is no appeal.  I would be interested to know if, in fact, this Bill does create a situation in which there can be an appeal.  As I understand it, at the moment there is no such appeal.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have failed as far as health is concerned.  From 1953 onwards&mdash;that was the year in which the Health Act was born and, if ever there was a Caesarean birth, that was one&mdash;<Col N="314" /> there was room for change.  Looking back one sees the Gilbertian approach to the Deputy Dr. Noel Browne mother and child scheme.  Surely since those days, when that Caesarean birth took place and the 1953 Health Act was produced and we were told it would never cost more than 2s in the £ on the rates, there was room for some change.  The fact is that the 1970 Health Act establishing the health boards and the 1971 Health Act which increases the figure for people in the middle income group to keep pace with the loss in the value of money and various other things, have fundamentally changed nothing.  We are still back in 1953 and the breath of fresh air that we hoped would enter the Department with the present Minister did not arise.</P>
    <P>I make no secret of the fact that he is a man for whom I have a high regard. He will accept that this is a political criticism on his political performance and involves no personal animosity. The health system is stagnant; we still have our rotten medical card system; we have no choice of doctor outside hospitals.  The great majority have no doctor under a health scheme outside hospitals and no provision of drugs outside hospitals.  At the same time, we have the degrading situation whereby people must prove themselves, in the words of the 1953 Health Act, to be unable to provide by their own efforts medical care for themselves or their families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for the generally constructive way they have examined the proposals but I must remark that it seems to me that the Fine Gael Deputies were divided in their opinions.  Many of them commented on the Bill as though it provided merely for an increase in taxation and was not the beginning of an insurance contribution scheme.  Then, having criticised it, both Deputy Fitzpatrick and Dr. Byrne said that as there was an insurance element in it they welcomed the Bill.  I do not know how to take the attitude of the Fine Gael Party towards the Bill since practically all of them condemned it and, at the same time, they gave <Col N="315" /> the impression that they recognised that the Bill as a method of raising money for health purposes on an insurance basis had at least some merit even though they did not like the characteristics of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Health services, as I have already indicated, will cost more and more and more.  Whether they are paid for by taxes, rates or insurance contributions or by a combination of all three it is absolutely certain that the whole community in proportion to its income, the lower income group paying less proportinately than the higher income group, will have to put aside more and more savings for health.  I say that without fear of contradiction.  It will happen not only here but in other countries.  A question we can discuss at length and without much profit is whether the present method of levying taxes and rates and now this new contribution is a reasonably fair one or whether anyone can prove it imposes too great a burden on any section of the community.  I want to be absolutely honest with people outside and I say that this growth of health costs is a reality beyond all doubt. It is due to the growing specialisation of hospital services, to the extension of services provided by this Government with the consent of the House and, of course, at present it is due to a gross inflationary situation which inevitably affects any service where the labour content is of the order of 70 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the inflationary element can be contained with, shall we say a continuation of the spirit that was shown and is so evident this year in the employer-worker agreement and if it can be, perhaps, even more attuned to productivity, next year this element in the increased cost of services may be reduced.  I hope everybody seeking higher wages or salaries will examine how much they will inevitably have to pay for health services in one form or another and that they will realise this is completely inescapable because, whereas the average labour content in any service in industry in any case would be something in the region of 40 per cent to 50 per cent, inevitably there are more people involved&mdash;and <Col N="316" /> rightly so&mdash;in the health service and so the cost mounts.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to make it clear to those Deputies who suggested that there was no warning in regard to proposals to have insurance contributions that this is not the case.  The Minister said quite clearly in his Budget Statement, as reported in volume 253, column 709 of the Official Report of 28th April, that there would be introduced in the House a measure dealing with the collection of insurance contributions.  He indicated that the total revenue that would be available from that source in the current financial year would be £2 million.  Were it not for the £2 million available this year, while it does not specifically relieve us of an increase in rates, either taxes or rates would have gone up more than they did.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have spoken as though it would be possible to reconsider the whole method of charging for health services and they have suggested that, perhaps, there could be some radical change on a large scale in the method of providing the money as between taxation and rates and insurance contributions.  They have suggested this could be done and would be acceptable to the people. I have already indicated my belief that the present system of taxation is progressive; that it taxes those in the higher income group more than those in the lower income group.  I believe the burden is spread reasonably fairly.</P>
    <P>Any radical revision of the methods of collecting the revenue required for the health services involving, for example, very large insurance contributions that might be pay related covering not only the general medical services but also the cost of hospitalisation, even if it did result in reduced taxation and reduced rates would result in very severe political conflict. I do not know any country in Europe which in the past ten years has been able to make radical changes of this kind.  Everywhere I see adjustments from time to time, adjustments in taxation, in property taxes, in social welfare contributions whether for health, social services or disability, retirement or widowhood.  I see only adjustments; I <Col N="317" /> cannot see any evidence that people are able to make radical changes and I believe if I were to introduce a measure with such a radical provision there would be tremendous criticism from the Opposition because once you start interfering seriously with the method by which people pay each year a contribution in taxes, rates or insurance you inevitably give them the feeling they are not personally benefiting by it and that they will be paying more than they should in relation to other sections of the community.  So that if we had a revolutionary change I do not believe it would be acceptable to the people.  If anybody can cite to me an example of a country that did this, that was democratic and the people had the right to elect their own government, I should like to hear it.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I will go on and be perfectly frank and say that in this country taxation is proceeding on a gradual basis and is being gradually altered and, if one section of the community appears to be suffering, there are reliefs arranged in the Budget either by way of allowances for income tax, allowances for farmers in the form of rate relief or else social welfare services are increased.  There are modifications each year.  There are no violent changes.  Even when the turnover tax was first imposed the level imposed was extremely small and was partly met for those with large families by increasing the social welfare allowances at the same time and increasing the children's allowances.  So, when I am criticised for putting before the House a Bill for an insurance principle I have no apology to make that the amount to be raised is small because I do not believe there is any other way of introducing this change.  If I were to introduce a Bill here today, even if it were pay related to some large sum such as 45p per week and if I were to explain that there would be such and such reliefs of taxation and rates, I believe there would be very widespread agitation outside the House and I do not believe Deputies themselves would be able sufficiently to analyse the position no matter what information I gave them in order to judge properly the merit of such a revolutionary change.  I stand open to contradiction <Col N="318" /> on this but I certainly make the statement with the utmost sincerity.</P>
    <P>It would equally apply to the introduction of a very large and immediate turnover tax even if it were accompanied by very big increases in children's allowances and social welfare services, so that the Minister could say it was not regressive taxation, that it was taxation based on current expenditure and that there was no need for anyone to feel that those in the lower income group and with large family responsibilities would be adversely affected.  Even if the Minister could get consent that that was the case and it was agreed in the House&mdash;that would not happen&mdash;I, nevertheless, feel the impact on the community would be too severe.</P>
    <P>This is my own personal opinion fortified by what I have seen taking place in other countries and by studying the complex position that obtains in the various countries in Europe where the systems of payments for health vary from country to country, vary in relation to the impact of rates and taxes and insurance.  They are varied and it is quite evident that in the case of each one of them they have been developed gradually.</P>
    <P>I should like also to repeat what I said on Second Stage, that there are some countries where because of being free for a long time have had certain advantages in education that we were not able to have in the 19th century, such as Denmark, that developed a very fine co-operative concept in regard to agricultural production and insurance and which, I suppose, at one time was the most highly developed country in the world co-operatively.  The Danes alongside of this developed a very good and excellent health insurance scheme wisely conceived and wisely administered but they found and have been finding ever since that the costs of hospital services have mounted so greatly and so explosively that they have had to dismantle the perfect element in their almost perfect insurance scheme by imposing very heavy taxes of one kind or another in order to pay huge subventions to the co-operative company running the insurance, in order to enable the health costs to be paid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> I can give other similar examples.  I am sorry to tell the House this because there are countries with a longer period of freedom, with developed education services, where they tried this insurance principle and the system is breaking down and in these countries there is a mixture of insurance, rates and taxes of one kind or another.  So that there is no country to which we can look at this moment and say that even allowing for the difference in our economic and social conditions, if we could adopt the machinery of that country, transform it, modify it, to our own circumstances, we would end up with the perfect insurance system.  It does not exist.  That is why I say that in introducing this insurance system we are doing it on a modest scale to begin with and will watch and see what the results will be.</P>
    <P>It is equally true to say&mdash;I must make this clear&mdash;that one could not go very much beyond 15p per week without its being changed into a pay related scheme and the whole question of pay related social insurance and pay related health insurance charges is under immediate study and review, as the Minister for Social Welfare has informed the House and, as the House will appreciate, this involves very big changes in administration methods but it is true to say that if this insurance method of contribution is found satisfactory and does not impose undue burdens and, in the light of experience, works well, any further changes to a great extent in the upward direction of the contribution would have to be pay related.  I give that undertaking to the House that when it grows in extent, quite obviously, there will have to be a pay related element in it.</P>

      <P>The middle income group.  Somebody asked a question about the contribution of local authorities for health services.  Local authorities will contribute about £30 million in 1971-72 to health services and about £10 million of this comes from the agricultural grant, leaving £20 million from the rates proper.  If Deputies <Col N="320" /> want to measure the effect of this contribution against the total amount levied for rates, they can examine these figures.</P>
      <P>Deputies also referred to the very heavy burden of the rates in relation to health services.  That is quite true in the towns and the cities.  In connection with quite a number of counties, particularly those in the western areas, about 75 per cent of the total health costs are now paid for from central funds, if we include the proportion of agricultural grant attributed to the health expenditure in the county. So that the impact of the rates is heaviest in the towns where it is a far more important element in paying for the health services.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies asked what the people of this country would get in return for the payment of the £5 million a year insurance contributions. I suppose it is absolutely true to say that they will get the benefit of the fact that the volume of services is increasing every year.  When the Health Estimate comes before the House I will send to the Deputies a list of extensions to hospitals, of new beds created for various services, of new services provided, and they will find that this, although not as great as I would like it to be, is quite considerable.  The people paying the £5 million will be taking advantage of the better theatre equipment in hospitals, the new Sligo hospital, the new St. Vincent's Hospital and the various extensions to other hospitals. They will be able to take advantage of the long-term disability grants for drugs and hospital accommodation for children in all income groups.  They will be able to take advantage of the same arrangements for providing drugs for adults who have certain classified, long-term disabilities in all income groups and that service will commence in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House knows out-patient fees have already been abolished.  These people will be able to take advantage of the fact that every year we are gradually and steadily appointing more specialist consultants in various areas. Every year we are gradually providing a more expert out-patient service by specialists who go to various areas in <Col N="321" /> order to examine patients and by means of which we hope to keep people from going to hospital, or whose hospital duration may be less as a result of their being able to avail of out-patient services at an earlier time.</P>
    <P>We are gradually providing more short-stay psychiatric units in general hospitals.  We have already provided a number and a further six or seven will be provided in the course of the next two or three years.  The people who pay for this service will be able to take advantage of the growth of the out-patient psychiatric services all over the country.  The numbers who came for out-patient services ten years ago was something like 15,000 compared with 150,000 now.  They will be able to take advantage of the new child health service in towns with a population of over 5,000.  I am very glad to be able to tell the House that we had a very high percentage response from mothers of babies who offered to have their children examined by the developmental paediatrician, who is a person trained in developmental paediatrics. Some 83 per cent of the total number of children born were the subject of applications for appointment.</P>
    <P>The people who pay the £5 million will be paying a contribution towards the inevitable and essential improvement in some of the salary structures in the health service which are a part of the inflationary increases in wages and salaries which took place last year, which are in the nature of well deserved status increases.  I am referring to the nursing community.  The total cost of providing improvements in salaries and conditions for them in the current financial year is £1,150,000.  It was found that because they were not regarded as permanent officers the intern, junior doctors and registrars seem to have lagged behind in receiving the kind of incomes which they merited. Because they were not considered permanent staff the conciliation and arbitration scheme did not apply to them. This was wrong; it was simply an administrative error that they could not be included because they are certainly part of the permanent staff of any hospital even though they move in or out.  Certain increases were given to them which placed them at a reasonable <Col N="322" /> level compared with those in Great Britain.  The £5 million obviously has to contribute towards those status increases, quite apart from the increases in the nursing staff which will be re-required consequent on the 80-hour fortnight having replaced the 85-hour fortnight and certain other changes which have taken place in the hours performed by junior doctors, interns and registrars, which are still the subject of examination in connection with overtime pay.</P>
    <P>There is nothing exceptional in our coming forward with these proposals. Practically every country, including those with far greater wealth than ourselves&mdash;even the Swedes who have nearly three times our income per head partly because of the huge capital value of their standing forests and their iron ore&mdash;are finding it difficult to raise money for their health and hospital services.  It is not true that we are imposing this insurance contribution because the economy is failing or because we are going through a period where the increase in our gross national product is likely to be smaller than it was from 1967 to 1970, which followed equally a period of difficulty from 1965 to 1966.  There are countries with booming economies who are still finding it difficult to provide the cost of their health and hospital services.</P>
    <P>We are going to make the best effort we can to ensure the greatest possible efficiency in our services while maintaining the right human attitude towards the patients.  The regional hospital boards, the resolution for whose appointment will be brought before the House some time between October and January next, will work in co-operation with the work study unit which I am initiating in my Department.  We hope to follow the good example of a number of other countries in which some savings in costs have been secured through better methods of management and through better systems by which hospital nurses operate, saving them unnecessary time and walking, and various other changes in methods which we hope, with the consent of the unions concerned, can be effected in the hospitals.</P>
    <P>A survey is being conducted by the socio-medico research board into the <Col N="323" /> whole of patient work load of every hospital in order to see what further means of co-ordination and integration must be effected in order that the beds we have can be used to the greatest benefit in order to ensure that the average stay in hospital can be reduced and above all that the time taken between the entry of the patient into a hospital, his observation, final diagnoses and treatment can be reduced. All that will be a long-term business which cannot be done overnight but we are beginning to make progress in that direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne made a speech which reflected his views as what might be described as a 100 per cent socialist. I am sure that Deputy Browne is absolutely sincere in everything he says but it would be useless for me to discuss his particular philosophy because he is in a very great minority in this House, even in his own party, in his belief in a completely socialist system. Deputy Browne charged me as being someone who expounded the cause of capitalism.  I have never done any such thing.  I have constantly said through the years in this House that I and my party stood for a blend of private enterprise, co-operation and socialism, using the word &ldquo;socialism&rdquo; in its ordinary sense.  If I were to list one by one all the socialist-type legislation passed under the aegis of Fianna Fáil in this House involving Government intervention, Government insistence on the redistribution of wealth from the better-off to the less well-off and various types of social measures, it would take me until 11 o'clock tonight.  They have been continuous and contrary to what Deputy Browne said there has been no diminution in the rate at which there has been Government intervention in regard to the operation of private enterprise whenever this party consider this to be the right course to adopt.  Right from the very beginning without any hesitation or halting this has been done.</P>
    <P>I think it is not only necessary for sociological reasons but it is essential because the world is becoming more complex.  We are now reaching the position where it is extremely difficult <Col N="324" /> for even private enterprise to continue its own operations without very considerable guidance from the State not only in this country but in all other countries in which they still believe in private enterprise wherever it can be properly administered, wherever it can operate without undue detriment to the people.  I want to say that because it is no good Deputy Dr. Browne charging me with being a super capitalist. I assisted, in my position as Minister here, in passing Bill after Bill through this House which were of a Government interventionist nature.</P>
    <P>Someone suggested that the insurance system in England paid for the health services to a considerable degree.  This is not the case.  Only 10 per cent of the huge panoply of the health services in England are defrayed from the insurance contributions made by the people of England. The rest comes entirely from general taxation and is absorbed by the great body of taxes collected from the community in Britain.  So let no one suggest that in England, where they adopted the Beveridge scheme, a complete medical service from the cradle to the grave, is associated with insurance. The insurances cover the other types of social welfare, social insurance of one kind or another, social services of various types and only cover to the extent of 10 per cent payment for the health services.</P>
    <P>I must also refute the suggestion made by a number of Deputies who in their opening remarks seemed to speak of the 60 per cent of the people of this country who are in the middle income group as the under-privileged of the community.  Why did Deputies use that statement that the middle income group were the under-privileged of the community?  It is true that we are not a very wealthy nation.  We are the least well-off of the more wealthy nations, about 18th out of 153 nations according to the United Nations.  We just at this moment have an income which is above those of the less well developed white countries and our income is growing steadily as the incomes of other countries grow.  That being the case and when one observes the very high consumption of foodstuffs <Col N="325" /> in this country, the consumption of calories, as compared with other countries and when one observes the report of medical officers in relation to malnutrition and the very low figure found recorded in this country, to speak of the middle income group as under-privileged seems to me to be a hopelessly exaggerated statement. There are people who live on extremely frugal incomes, who are very near the poverty line, at the lower end of the lower income group.  We are constantly doing our best to assist those people by increasing the social services and by developing more industries.  We have still a certain problem to solve in that region but no one who is honest can really describe the middle income group as the under-privileged group in the community.  I could not possibly accept that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne asked whether the general practitioner service would be made available to the middle income group.  I have already indicated that that will not be the case.  They will not be included.</P>
    <P>I also want to mention again the whole problem of payment for drugs by the middle income group.  That also has to be remembered in connection with what is available for the £5 million. Those in the full eligibility class, the lower income group, will get their drugs free through the retail chemists or in some rural areas direct from the doctor.  A scheme will be introduced on the 1st October and will provide free drugs for all people with certain long-term conditions including epilepsy, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, haemophilia and diabetes which is already covered by a free scheme.  Then a scheme will be introduced at a later date which will provide a subsidy towards the medicine bills of the middle income group families when their monthly spending on medicine exceeds a specified sum.  I want to be honest with the House.  I am not able to tell the House when this scheme will be introduced. It will be introduced as soon as I can.  Of course, the figure of monthly drug expenditure above which there will be a subvention I am unable to state.  I will do my best in regard to this but I think that I have generally <Col N="326" /> and reasonably kept my promises as Minister in various Departments and it may be taken for granted that this is an integral part of the scheme for the middle income group which will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Any illness.  As the House knows, we voted £200,000 this year towards hardship cases in relation to drugs for the middle income group which matches a similar amount that has been raised by the rating authorities, that is, something in the neighbourhood of £350,000 to £400,000 is now already spent to help people in the middle income group who have real difficulty in paying for their drugs. It is spent on a very pragmatic basis. There are no specified rules for it and I have not heard any great complaints about how it is being spent.  I gather it would not be sufficient to meet the very heavy cost of drugs as they gradually mount in cost in the next few years. Hence the section in the Health Act, 1970 which makes it possible to make a specific kind of contribution.  I would say without fear of contradiction that that provision of £200,000 is assisting many people who otherwise would find it very hard to pay for drugs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have quite a lot to say on this subject.  Deputy O'Connell seemed to imply that in some way we could tax the richer section of the community a great deal more in order to provide the extra cost of the health services.  This is a subject which is largely debated during Budget time but I have already indicated, and nobody has contradicted me yet, that the number of persons earning very, very large salaries in this country is extremely small, the number of persons even earning £3,000 and over and who are subject to tax and surtax is not large. If a person earning, for example, £7,000, who is married without children pays £2,468 in income tax and surtax we in Fianna Fáil regard that as a reasonable contribution towards paying for other people's health service.  If <Col N="327" /> he earns £5,000 and is married without children I think the tax and surtax amounts to £1,300.  Then we have the very high rate of death duties that have just been increased.  I do not believe it would be possible to tax the very wealthy group in the community much more than we do at present.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach told the House about two years ago that if no one in this country was ever allowed to earn more than £5,000 a year the result in tax and surtax would only be a few million brought into the Exchequer and that the result would equally be that those who were very highly paid as extremely effective executives and professional people would tend to leave the country. If we allowed nobody to have more than £5,000 the differential between the £5,000 and the income of the lowest paid worker would be far less than it is even in Communist Russia and Czechoslovakia. So, this concept that there is a huge wealthy community to be milked with huge taxation in order to get us over the difficulty of finding the money for more expensive health services is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another argument which one could use&mdash;and this was rather suggested by Deputy Browne&mdash;is that not enough taxation is collected.  He also suggested that the upper income group found medical costs very high in any event. We collect between 30 and 32 per cent of the value of gross national product in taxes and in rates.  This is a respectably high figure.  It is higher in some countries with enormous defence commitments.  It varies between 28, 35 and 40 per cent in the developed countries of the world.  Contrary to what might be imagined, with one or two exceptions, it can be said that the more wealthy the country, the higher the amount of taxation and rates as a proportion of GNP.  The figure of 32 per cent at least places us in the respectable category of a country that takes a great deal in taxes and rates in order to provide social services and all the other necessary State services.  At least no one can say that we are taxing too little those who are better off in comparison with other countries.  There may be variations here and there.  That <Col N="328" /> again relates to the fact that the level of taxation and rates is so high, particularly that of rates, that the introduction of an insurance contribution seems to me to be a reasonable proposition under the circumstances.</P>
    <P>If Deputies say that this new insurance contribution is another example of patchwork in collecting money&mdash;I think I have already dealt with this but I will put it in another way&mdash;I know of no country in Europe where changes in taxation and in rates of insurance contribution could be called anything but cumulative patchwork followed sometimes by some co-ordination or by looking at some particular tax structure and examining it very carefully and eliminating anomalies in it.  It is true to say that, in the whole of Europe, the whole development in methods of collecting money for services has been in the nature of, as I described it, a cumulative modification of taxation systems of a patchwork character.  If Deputies accuse me of patchwork I am at least in good company with a number of very respectable democracies who consider themselves as having first class administrations.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to give Deputy Browne the list of increases in social services over the past ten years and the net increase over and above the cost of living, but we made a very big contribution in that regard.  Deputy Hogan suggested that levying these contributions might have the effect of encouraging people not to go to a doctor but to wait until they had to go to hospital because they would get the hospital service free.  I have challenged Deputies to give me really succinct, specific evidence that in the middle income group there are a noticeable number of people who do not go to their doctor because they do not want to pay the charge and who wait until it is very late and then have to go to hospital. I have not been able to get any evidence of this.  If anybody can give me any evidence of it I should like to hear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all the various social surveys that <Col N="329" /> are made from time to time by social workers who go around the country exploring social evils of one kind or another, I have not been able to get any evidence of this.  My reply to Deputy Hogan is that we are developing out-patient clinics all over the country.  The out-patient services have been developed.  We are trying to discover disabilities in children at an earlier age.  We hope to reduce the time taken for observation in out-patient clinics when the patient has to go into hospital.  This will take some time and it will take a good deal of examination of one kind or another.</P>

      <P>Both Deputy Browne and Deputy O'Higgins suggested that the contributory scheme in this Bill is being brought in only because of our application to enter the European Economic Community.  There is no requirement in the EEC which would oblige us to bring in a scheme of this kind.  This point is really irrelevant to the debate.  There is no comprehensive health insurance scheme in the EEC countries.  In each there is a complex of schemes covering specific groups. I do not really need to read to the House the list of the health schemes in the European Economic Community because they are extremely complex. In fact, their actual definition of terms and words is slightly different from ours, but the House may take it for granted that we are not obliged to introduce a specific health insurance scheme as part of the conditions of our entry into the EEC.</P>

      <Col N="330" /> Deputy Tully asked whether, once a person had paid a contribution as a member of the middle income group, the limited eligibility group, he would be able to apply for a medical card if he felt that circumstances so warranted. The answer is that the person can apply for a medical card having paid the contribution, but the contribution could hardly be refunded.  It would be regarded as a new situation.  He would have an income which would have declined to the point that he was regarded as being in the medical card full eligibility group.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies asked about the method of payment.  We are examining all this.  When we reach Committee Stage, if a number of Deputies in all parties really press me to provide cards with insurance stamps for the use of the farming community, and if they recommend that this might be one of the best ways by which the self-employed community could save the money for this very modest contribution, I, in turn, will press upon the officers of my Department and on those concerned in the Revenue Commission to adopt the principle.  Even though the amount is very small, saving money like this is an excellent principle: saving it gradually through the accumulation of stamps.  I should also like to see it apply more than it does to rates.</P>
    <P>Of course everybody is complaining about the level of rates.  The other day I was reading one of the White Papers issued after an examination of the rating position.  It is about five years out of date now in terms of statistics.  It stated that a person who had to pay £65 in rates in the year paid the same amount if he smoked 20 cigarettes every day, or if he drove a medium sized motor car 10,000 miles, the tax on petrol would amount to £65 in the year, and that it was the impact of the two moieties in a solid cash demand that created some of the objections to paying rates.  I am not talking about those people in the community whose incomes have not increased to the same degree as have rates; I am talking about other people in the community.  The psychological elements in the impact of taxation and rates can be overcome by way of insurance <Col N="331" /> stamps and I hope it will be possible to do this.</P>
    <P>A Deputy asked whether we could increase the limit for the limited eligibility group beyond £1,600.  The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Here again there can be a hardship element in relation to those people in the very upper income group but as the House is aware we are not changing the system whereby someone in the upper income group who may find the cost of medical services or hospital treatment absolutely enormous can get a contribution from the health authority.  One Deputy suggested that the £1,600 limit was not sufficient.  This figure is reasonably fair when compared with the period during which there was a limit of £800.  If we start with the new limit of £1,600 and compare it with the £1,200 limit we would have to admit that the figure should be more than £1,600 but all I can say is that we have done the best we can in raising it to £1,600, as is to be the case in respect of social welfare contributions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan complained, as did other Deputies, about the cost of general practitioner services and drugs for those not covered by medical cards. In 1966 a household budget inquiry showed that the average medical expenses in a family which included some children were about £16 per year. Allowing for increased fees and costs since then, the figure is now probably between £20 and £25 a year.  I would not consider this as being a grossly excessive amount in respect of a middle income group family.  The House may disagree with me on this but I honestly think that total average expenditure of this amount on general practitioner services and drugs is not excessive and if it is compared with the consumption of tobacco and alcohol and with entertainment costs by the same group of people, no one can say that we are imposing a crushing insurance contribution by asking this group to pay, initially, 15p per week towards hospital services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested that this was merely another form of tax and asked if, by the imposition of this tax, I hoped to relieve the rates.  We do <Col N="332" /> hope, in later years, to relieve the rates by the use of this insurance contribution method and of course while relieving rates we would also be relieving taxes of one kind or another.  I cannot predict what the insurance element will be in future years in the payment of health services.  I can only indicate that we intend charging 15p per week and, in the case of self-employed persons, £7 per year for this year.  It would be impossible for me to foretell what the level would be in later years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully made an incorrect statement about the estimated yield of these contributions.  He said it is £3 million when in fact it is £5 million and the figure of £5 million relates now to a full year.  We expect to earn £2 million in the present year.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the cost of collecting these insurance contributions. The cost will not be noticeable in connection with the social welfare group of people because it will only be a matter of putting on a stamp and we reckon that the cost will be between 8 and 10 per cent in respect of the farming group and the self-employed but it is estimated that they will provide only about £700,000 in a full year out of the total of £5 million.  Therefore, no one can say that the cost of collection will be excessive.</P>
    <P>I want to be fair to Deputy O'Higgins in his references to the Fine Gael scheme as it was devised originally. Fine Gael claim that, ten years ago, they put forward a viable scheme, based on the then existing services, for comprehensive services which involved the State paying one-third of the contribution and the employer and employee each paying one-third, amounting to 1s 6d per week.  The main point about this scheme was that it assumed static costs and we have never been able to persuade those in Fine Gael who were sponsoring that scheme that there was no provision in it for increases in the cost of existing services.  In fact, the increase in expenditure from the time of the 1s 6d per week scheme as proposed by Fine Gael has been £57 million.  This annuls the significance of any insurance scheme proposed a very long time ago. The kind of contributions envisaged then would have done little to solve <Col N="333" /> the real and growing problems of health finance.  Without imposing very substantial and probably intolerable increases in the rates of contributions the scheme would quickly have become insolvent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to examine that.  I do not believe it will remain static.  It is bound to increase but I cannot commit myself because this question has to be studied.  A version of the Fine Gael scheme was published in 1969 in a document entitled <i>Winning Through to a Just Society</i>.  If a scheme on the lines advocated by Fine Gael was in operation this year, the total health expenditure instead of being £76 million would be between £95 million and £100 million.  That would include the general practitioner service for the middle income group and also a free dental service. It is clear that the contributions as advocated, much the same as in the Bill, could not meet this additional cost and relieve the rates and keep the Exchequer commitments within bounds. That is the position.  If, for example, one reckons that there are about one million people gainfully occupied, one would reckon that a general practitioner service would cost about 45p a week.  This would be 15p each from the Government, the employer and the employee.  Presumably it would be 30p from the farmer and the self-employed person.  It would not cover any hospital services but would simply be an imposition on top of the present budget of £77 million.  I do not think this is a practical scheme but I am willing to admit that with the introduction of any insurance scheme great care and vigilance must be exercised.  We must do our best to estimate how fairly it operates and how far the insurance contributions can be increased on a pay-related basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan said that only those <Col N="334" /> in the lower ranks of the middle income group can ask to be treated as hardship cases.  This is not so.  Anyone outside the lower income group can ask, on hardship grounds, to be given free or reduced cost services to which he is not otherwise entitled.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins said that the Bill would provide £5 million to cover the cost of £700,000 hospital expenses for the middle income group.  The charge of 50p per day is not related to the economic cost of providing a hospital service.  The cost of maintaining a patient for a week in a teaching general hospital can be as high as £80.  This is due to the specialised nature of services, to examination by teams of consultants, to the use of expensive equipment and the other modern devices of medicine today.  As I have already indicated, no country has been able to produce a perfect scheme of contributions to cover the very heavy hospital expenses.  I hope we never reach the American level of hospital expense.  I was reading recently that there are some beds in American hospitals that cost £70 per day&mdash;not £80 per week.  I hope we escape that frightening escalation of cost.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies asked me about the standards for the medical card group.  I shall bring them before the Dáil and I think Members will be reasonably satisfied with them.  I am sorry to disappoint Deputy Fitzpatrick, but we must continue with the method of calculating medical card standards for the farming community by assessment of their agricultural incomes.  As the Deputy knows, this is being done throughout the country in connection with non-contributory social assistance payments and in connection with other services.  Although I can see the objection by farmers to this assessment and although it is being changed in connection with the limit of valuation for social welfare payments in the summer months, nevertheless when we are going to have a standard basis of income limits provided by this House for the medical card group, it would be anomalous to make use of the valuation system if the valuations differ in their economic content so much from one part of the country to the other. We shall adopt the principle of relating <Col N="335" /> the agricultural income of the farmers with the income stated for the non-farming community.  This seems reasonably fair.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan asked why we did not change the £60 valuation limit for the limited eligibility group.  Estimates of farm incomes prepared on the basis of management surveys sometimes are questionable.  Nevertheless a survey was carried out by An Foras Talúntais on a sample of farms in a variety of regions.  No attempt was made in these summations to relate the results to valuation.  If one wants to make a rough guess, the total valuation of agricultural land is £6.9 million; total family farm income, including home consumption at farm gate prices, was £178 million in 1970.  On this basis the average income for £1 valuation was £26.  I hope Deputies understand the method of that calculation.  Using this ratio, a table can be prepared showing what might be regarded as the approximate average income in the range of valuations from £20 to £60. On that basis&mdash;which is a rough calculation&mdash;land with a valuation of £60 would yield an average income of £1,560.  I hope it is not just a coincidence that it works out this way because the business of applying an average income per £1 valuation is dangerous.  Nevertheless, for what value that statement has, I give it to the House.  In this way it can be seen that the £60 valuation corresponds to some degree with the £1,600 upper limit in the case of the social welfare class of people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry seemed to imply that the health boards would not be effective. The Deputy will admit that he must give them some chance to operate before he condemns the concept of the eight regional health boards.  They are new small parliaments, created recently.  They began only a few months ago and in many cases the final officers have not been appointed. In many instances the officers will have to be trained in their work with the help of our consultants and officers of my Department.  They must examine the content of the health services and the health board area; they must initiate a system which has been <Col N="336" /> well devised by the consultants for indicating performance to the health board members; they will give financial reports; they must set out priorities for improvements in the service based on whatever general indications I can give them.  It would be reasonable to say that the health boards will have proved themselves, or not proved themselves, not before at least three or four years.  They must develop the whole concept of the regional examination of health services which involves not only the centralisation, co-ordination and integration but the better handling and administration of a variety of decentralised services.  It would be unfair to condemn the health boards at so early a stage in their development.</P>
    <P>When Deputy O'Higgins was explaining his reason for putting into operation the Fianna Fáil Health Act of 1953, I was surprised that he seemed to think it was a dreadful Act in many ways.  He was not able to convince the public about it.  He was not able to convince the electorate because Fianna Fáil were returned to office in 1957 and, ever since then, there has been criticism by the Fine Gael Party of the division of the community into three groups for the purpose of devising methods of payment for health services.  Policy documents have been issued by both the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party as to other methods of ensuring payment for health services and providing services to the public at large.  As I have already said, nobody has given me any evidence to show that the limited eligibility group suffer medically as a result of having to pay general practitioner bills.  With the policies we are devising to help with the payment of drugs it is very unlikely that anybody will suffer in future.</P>
    <P>So far as the medical card group is concerned, as the House knows, I hope the Medical Association and the Medical Union will agree to the proposals I have made in connection with the choice of doctor principle.  If I am to believe the medical magazines my amended proposals will be approved and the choice of doctor system will start to operate on 1st April, 1972, and <Col N="337" /> we should then be ending the old-fashioned dispensary system.  This will have some effect on certain people who have never yet secured medical cards and who have always paid a private doctor.  There may be a change there. Other people will obviously leave the full eligibility group because of rising incomes and wages.</P>

      <P>This does not solve the problem entirely in regard to doctors in rural areas.  Deputy Donegan suggested people in rural areas were not getting the kind of service they deserve because of the difficulty of finding local doctors.  The problem of general practitioners is acute not only here but in other countries as well. I am promoting an advisory committee to examine the whole position of the general practitioner service.  We have had a considerable number of commissions of inquiry into various aspects of the health services.  We have none in operation at the moment except the temporary committee on drug abuse.  It would be a good thing, I think, to have this whole matter of general practitioner service thoroughly examined by a committee, with very wide terms of reference, including postgraduate training, apprenticeship training, refresher courses and the problem of finding general practitioners to operate in the west, as well as the problem of group practice, <i>et cetera</i>.  I hope this committee when they function will have some useful recommendations to make so that those in the middle income group who feel the medical service is inadequate because of a lack of an adequate number of doctors will have every cause for satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have examined exhaustively all the observations made from the Opposition benches.  I should like to thank Deputy Burke, Deputy Healy and Deputy Carter for their helpful contributions. I agree with them.  I do not believe sensible people will object to paying 15p per week to finance health services.  I do not think that could be regarded as an excessive contribution. I do not think it will be hurtful even <Col N="338" /> to those at the lower income end of the limited eligibility group.  Much as I would have liked to begin the scheme on a pay related basis that is not administratively possible.  However, I think this is a very reasonable contribution. We will be watching its effect and examining how we will find the money for what will be inevitably increased costs of health services as time goes on.</P>
    <P>The cost of psychiatric services will increase.  Ten or 15 years hence the cost of these services will be much higher than it is now in relation to the cost of the ordinary acute care hospital services.  The cost of the mental health services is bound to increase if we are to deal with the problem of the large numbers of young persons who are having their first entry into mental hospitals.  This surprising fact was illustrated by the medical and social research board in their recent study.  It came as a shock to many of us because, when one goes into a mental hospital, one does not get the impression of youthfulness. However, the registers were examined with great care and the facts were confirmed by the officers of my Department. This applied not only in rural areas where inter-breeding might account for a certain level of mental illness, but it also applied in urban areas.  We will have to have some kind of priorities.</P>
