    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I moved the adjournment last night I was dealing with a matter with which both the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary are conversant, namely, the payment of the dole to single men.  In relating the facts as I know them, I obviously stepped on the corns of the Parliamentary Secretary who interrupted me rudely.  Indeed, there were times when I thought the Chair would have to call him to order but, however, the Chair decided that it was not necessary to do so in the circumstances.  I might say at this stage that it is not customary for the Parliamentary Secretary to interrupt <Col N="1081" /> any Deputy and I have no recollection of being interrupted by him on any previous occasion.</P>
      <P>As is the case with other Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, the Minister for Social Welfare and his Parliamentary Secretary are in a very bad mood at this time.  Perhaps this is understandable in the light of the difficulties and problems they are facing but which, it must be admitted, are of their own making.</P>
      <P>I was referring to the cutting off of the dole from single men living in rural areas.  I recall the sudden, snap decision to wipe out, with one stroke of the pen, the payment of dole to former recipients.  One can well imagine the shock that created, not alone down the country but also here in the city of Dublin.  Following on that announcement, the Fine Gael Party, through their Leader, Deputy Cosgrave, immediately took the matter up as one of grave urgency.  Deputy Cosgrave was, of course, discharging his duty to the country and to the people when he did that and he was strongly supported by the Leader of the Labour Party and the Deputies in that party.</P>
      <P>There was panic in the Government. Statements were made in the morning and contradicted in the evening.  The Minister for Social Welfare would make one statement and a few hours later another Minister would make another statement contradicting the first statement.  There was general confusion. Thanks to the newspapers and the media generally, because of the publicity this matter got, the Government had second thoughts and decided to pay the dole to married men with dependants in towns but not to single men in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last night, the Minister for Social Welfare and his Parliamentary Secretary both come from rural areas.  They were reared in rural areas and they were brought up with the people in those areas, the people whose fate it was to have to migrate to England or, in the case of the Minister's constituency, to Scotland. That is where the majority of his migrating constituents go.  That is the tradition in Donegal.  Travelling <Col N="1082" /> through that county I have noticed that, if one tenders an Irish or an English £5 note at a petrol filling station, one gets Scotch single notes in change, a clear indication of the volume of Scottish money circulating there.  In some cases one will get a few English notes as well.  The Minister is well aware of the pattern.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Parliamentary Secretary the majority of his neighbours, like my own, go to England.  A few of them go to Scotland.  This has been the tradition of these people for generations past; they emigrate to America or migrate to England and Scotland to try to supplement the meagre incomes from their small holdings of £2, £3, £4, £5 or, maybe, £6 valuation.  These little holdings are situated on the mountainside.  They are the little holdings that they were grudgingly allowed to have when they were driven off the land by the occupying forces and driven on to the mountainside.  There they built little homes, poorly constructed, thatched with straw or rushes.  They got little help from the powers that were.</P>
    <P>I have travelled through Donegal and not so long ago I saw quite a number of these little houses, still hidden away on the mountainside.  Some of them are empty now but some are still occupied.  They are in poor condition. Those that are occupied are occupied because of the social welfare benefits paid down through the years.  It may have been the dole; it may be widows', old age or blind pensions, children's allowances, and so on.  The Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary and other rural Deputies know the problems of these people and the hardships they have had to endure, with the head of the house taking the bus or train to Dublin and the boat at Dún Laoghaire or the North Wall to a foreign country.  These migrants also leave from Larne and Derry.  They may leave behind wives who are expectant mothers and they themselves will have to face the difficulties, the hardships and the loneliness of an alien environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary, who were both reared with these people, know that what I am saying <Col N="1083" /> is true.  I am amazed that a Minister in an Irish Government could recommend to the Government that these very people should be the first to be deprived of the little bit of benefit they were getting.  It was apparently no trouble to the Minister to take this decision.  We were told there was a financial crisis and that money was not readily available.  It is extraordinary that it should have been a Minister from a congested area, and his Parliamentary Secretary from another congested area, and also a Gaelic-speaking area, who took such action against their own constituents.  It was a disgraceful step.  It is something of which both the Minister and the Government should be ashamed.  Were it not for the media and were it not for the fact that the Leader of the Labour Party and the Deputies of that party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Labour Party who discovered what was happening and broke the news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and were it not for all the publicity, these unfortunate people would have been utterly deprived.  As a result of the publicity something happened; something has happened more than once in the last year and a half as a result of publicity. Fianna Fáil panicked and had a change of heart.  But, once again, in the month of November we have single men ineligible for the meagre allowance due to them.  This morning, as I left my hotel I met three neighbours.  One was a native of the Killala/Carraghmore/ Lacken district.  He was returning from England.  He told me he was glad he met me because he wanted to see me about a problem he had.  He was coming back, he told me, from Leeds where he had gone to bury a sister.  I sympathised with him.  I am aware that this man lived on a fiveacre holding.  He told me that before he left home he had got the bad news that his dole was being stopped.  He asked me why this was so and asked me to put his case before the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This man had helped to reconstruct his neighbour's house under an essential repairs grant scheme.  The grants are small and he and two other neighbours <Col N="1084" /> agreed to do the work together in order to reconstruct that little home. The grant was about £200 and this money was needed for materials.  The three men provided the labour.  He told me his story and said it could be verified.  Someone reported that he was engaged in a building contract and that he had a big income.  This was the only work he did.  I know him to be a decent, honest person whose word I would believe.  He went to the local parish priest who took up the matter with the Department of Social Welfare. Subsequently an officer from that Department called on him.  The officer told him that he had a figure in his books as income, and said there was nothing he could do to help him.  He told him that his dole would be cut from £4.50.  I have the name and address of this man and can give the Minister full particulars.</P>
    <P>Is it not a disgrace that the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Government are prepared to penalise a man like that who is finding the struggle hard on his five-acre holding?  The man also told me that his wife was in poor health.  I asked whether she received any benefit or allowance and he said that she did not.  He said that the dole was the only ready money coming into the house and he believed the depression she is suffering from has been caused in particular by the stopping of the dole while they have still many problems and difficulties.  This man had to pay his fare to Leeds and was on his way home.  The prospect for that man under the Minister for Social Welfare is indeed gloomy.  This is harsh treatment which is being meted out to him.  I know there are thousands like him.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given statistics showing the increases in the amount of money being made available under the different headings.  On paper it may all seem very rosy, couched as it is in Civil Service jargon.  No amount of flowery language will solve the problems of the man I met this morning People like him are in dire straits.  The fact that the Minister's figures show increases really means nothing, because much of the increase is being eroded by the increased cost of living brought about by the introduction of turnover <Col N="1085" /> tax, by the increases in rates, food prices, fuel, electricity and other bills. We will shortly have the value added tax.  The Minister for Finance said that many people escape tax but that with the introduction of the VAT no one would escape.  From his statement I am entitled to conclude that the taxation to be introduced by this Government, if they remain in office&mdash;and we are not sure whether they are in office at this moment because while I stand here speaking there is a party meeting in progress&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is very encouraging and I thank him for the information because he is taking a chance in making that statement.  It is no problem for Fianna Fáil members to make statements without due consideration or knowledge of the facts.</P>
      <P>It is a shame and a disgrace for the Minister to act in this manner.  The Minister was forced to restore the dole to certain categories of people.  He yielded reluctantly to the pressures on him in this matter.  The people of whom I speak here are people who have contributed much in one way or another to the national wellbeing.  In their time they sent back millions of pounds from England, Scotland and America to help their families at home.  They built schools and churches, made roads, tried to educate their families and made a good job of it.  Many of them had sons and daughters who distinguished themselves not only within the country but in far, foreign lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hard to think that an Irish Minister for Social Welfare would select for attack this decent, respectable class of people, many of whom are Gaelic speakers, with good background and tradition.  It is no wonder <Col N="1086" /> that emigration figures for the Province of Connaught reflect the distressing situation that exists and that our population is declining.  Young people are forced to go to England where the unemployment figure is now about one million people.  It is hard on our people if, as a result of the action of the Minister, more and more of them must emigrate.  We have had the denunciation of the Defence of the West Committee which met at Charlestown, Foxford, Swinford and other centres, the denunciation of distinguished churchmen, Protestant, Catholic, Methodist and so on and of bishops of the various dioceses pointing out what I have said.  What I am saying here is quite correct and it is no pleasure to me to have to tell this sad tale once more.</P>
    <P>I do not wish the Minister ill but when I was in Donegal I observed that he had certainly done better for himself than he had done for his neighbours. I wish him luck in that regard. I passed by his home and saw a modern home with all the luxuries that could be provided&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Chair that I shall be able to relate my remarks to the business before the House if I am permitted to do so.  In Cork which I visited recently&mdash;the Taoiseach's home town one might say-there is a great deal of poverty and hardship while there is wealth and affluence and no scarcity of money for people who are able to get the ear of the Taoiseach and his Ministers.  We were told that this was a poor man's Government.  As a boy, I listened to the politicians of that day promising all sorts of benefits and blessings if they elected this Government.  It is not <Col N="1087" /> surprising that you have protest groups and marches now all over the country.  It is nearly impossible to count these groups&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy come to the Estimate or else resume his seat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that if I persisted in bringing these matters to the notice of Parliament I should soon be shot down and so, to show respect for the Chair's ruling, regardless of what I may think about it, I shall confine my remarks to what I have already said.  But let the message go forth loud and clear that the people in the west, in the congested areas, and their families are determined that they will get a new deal in the future.  If they do not get it peacefully I fear many of them will resort to breaking the law which would be a regrettable situation.</P>
      <P>I have spoken at length of the benefit that the dole, if continued, would be to those people.  I advocated increased social benefits such as the dole, widows' and orphans' pensions and old age pensions and I want that to go on record.  If the Government were looking after the affairs of the State instead of fighting among themselves it would be possible to increase these benefits.  There were many increases in national earnings in recent years, on the agricultural side through increased prices for cattle and on the industrial side there were also great increases. Another item I am proud to mention is mining which is now becoming a great money spinner.  Last night Deputy Carter told us it was easy for the Opposition to suggest increased benefits because we have not to provide money by way of taxation.  I am pointing out that our national income has increased substantially but the distribution of our national wealth leaves much to be desired, to put it mildly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not preaching communism.  I am an Irish Catholic, perhaps, a very poor one, but somebody must say these things, which should be said even if we get very little publicity for saying them or even if we become unpopular and take the risk of having a &ldquo;run-in&rdquo; with the Chair, something I <Col N="1088" /> would very much regret.  Last night I referred briefly to the fact that many people who have to go to England come home after spending many years in England and contributing to social welfare over there.  Because they were insured workers and employed they had to register there and pay the usual contribution which employed people must pay in England and Scotland.</P>
    <P>Many of them worked long and late hours; they could not afford to live on a 40-hour week.  They undertook piecework, fuelling furnaces, down in the pits and, as Deputy Coughlan knows, they went to the potato fields.  Whereever they went they worked long and late and hard.  They earned overtime and their earnings were quite considerable. The majority of them sent home money to keep the little homestead going.  Quite understandably some of these people have returned in poor health.  Some of them are neighbours of mine.  When they try to claim social welfare benefit they run up against certain difficulties.  Some of these cases have been drawn to my attention by my local medical men who pointed out the difficulties some of these applicants for benefit meet.  They have been certified by doctors as unfit to work.  The percentage is not high but there are cases here and there, some of them in my own neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>I said last night that I was aware that our Minister went across to England to make reciprocal arrangements for benefits but some people are being denied benefit.  They have made a contribution down through the years and they are now unable to fend for themselves.  The Parliamentary Secretary saw fit to challenge me and I am happy to take up that challenge this morning.  At the moment I have one name which I will give him for investigation, but not across the floor of the House.  I will supply him with more names if he is in office next week or even within a couple of days.  He said that I was making foolish statements which would not bear examination.  I will send him on details of these cases and I hope he will deal with them expeditiously.  These people are waiting for their money.  They have made their contribution and they are entitled <Col N="1089" /> to their benefit with their record of achievement.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that increases have been granted on paper.  Ministers can quote the extra 10s a week granted to old age pensioners and widows, but is it not true, as Deputy Barry said yesterday, that we have been suffering from inflation for quite a considerable time?  Is it not true that the cost of living has gone up, and up, and up?  Is it not true that with the changeover to decimal currency the cost of living went up overnight?  Ask anybody in the street.  People who are running homes and people who keep records are well aware that the changeover to decimal currency hit the general public very hard indeed.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us in this white-washing statement, which is the most deceitful and fraudulent document I ever read, that these people are well off but I can tell him, and his neighbours can tell him, that they are not well off.  The proof can be seen in the figures for unemployment and the figures showing the decrease in the population.  If he does not care to take my word for it, let him read the speeches and the pronouncements of the distinguished bishops of various denominations.  Let us show an increase on paper for the sake of deceiving the public.  Let us throw dust in their eyes and try to blind them.  They are not being blinded because they all have to face up to the reality of trying to make ends meet and trying to keep body and soul together.</P>
    <P>In an inflationary situation do we not all know that the rich can always cushion themselves in some way or other, but the poor have to pay the last penny.  They cannot go to the supermarket, they cannot go ten or 15 miles to a town, to avail of a bargain in clothes or shoes, or something else. They cannot avail of the 4d off one article or 3d off another because they are dealing in quarter pounds of butter and half pounds of bacon.  They are in the first line in the trenches when inflation hits as it has hit this country. It has completely upset the balance of things.  A few days ago we had the announcement about the £20 million <Col N="1090" /> that suddenly came from under the carpet.  I do not know where it was lying for some time past.  Deputy O'Higgins described it as an each-way bet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a point if I am permitted to do so.  We are told that certain categories of industry and certain categories of people will benefit from this £20 million.  I have not got the list with me of the various sections who will benefit from this £20 million which is allegedly there.  In the course of a little bit of cross-chat, which is quite frequent in this House between some Members on our side and the Taoiseach's, the Taoiseach said he had some good news which would stop us from talking for a while. If you read the Minister's statement, Sir, announcing that this extra £20 million would be made available, you will find it very difficult, if not absolutely impossible, to see how one penny of that £20 million will reach the pockets of the people on whose behalf I am speaking here this morning.  The well-to-do, the hoteliers, people who subscribe generously to election funds for a certain party, will be considered when they make their claims for increased sums of money for different projects, allegedly industrial development&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely I am entitled to make this point on the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare without being shot down every minute by you?  I mean this with respect.  After all, you come from a similar area to mine and, with due respect, I think your ruling is a little harsh.  There is not a mention of social welfare recipients in the announcement about the £20 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal now with widows and <Col N="1091" /> orphans and other social welfare recipients.  Having spent eight or nine years in business in this city I know that the cost of living has gone up very rapidly.  This has adversely affected widows and orphans who have to pay rent for a small room and also have to pay for other little odds and ends.  It is only fair to say in passing that, were it not for the generosity and charity of organisations like the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, many of these people would starve and would be on the street.  These organisations take a keen interest in the poor and destitute.  There are homes in this city where people for a small sum of money can get under a roof for the night and have a warm meal.  During the day they stroll around the city and perhaps go into parks.  I have met these people.  I am more familiar with the way of life of people in this city than I am with that of the people of Cork or any other city.  This section has my sympathy and I understand their problems because I worked with them at the North Wall and around the city.  I have often discussed their problems with them and I have always found that they are a very proud, honourable, decent people.  We read in the newspapers and hear it on radio and television when somebody robs a bank or steals something and is brought before the court, but we do not hear of the great contribution many of these people made in their time when the chips were down in 1916 and indeed before and after that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the case that there is very little consideration being given in this Estimate to people who suffered these hardships.  The niggardly increases about which the Minister has told us will go a very small way indeed towards keeping body and soul together.  I am making the point that, were it not for organisations like the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, these people would be starving.  Many of them would die on the roadside if they were depending on the present Minister for Social Welfare and his Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> Deputy Dr. O'Connell mentioned delays in the payment of benefit.  He would know more about this than I do because in the country there is something to cushion a person and carry him over for a week or two. There is the grand old tradition that a person can get a jug of milk or a little food next door if he is down and out. There is not much of that in any city. There are letters being written to the newspapers about delays in the payment of benefit usually over a technicality. Imagine the plight of a person depending on his little cheque on a certain morning on being told that it has been stopped or that there is some technical hitch and inquiries have to be made.  These people find themselves in serious difficulty and it should not happen.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of people who take up employment with disreputable employers who are not concerned about the welfare of their workers and who fail to stamp their cards.  I know of these things having happened in my constituency.  This should not happen if there was an efficient Minister who was concerned about the welfare of these people.  But after what we have witnessed on the dole and other issues it does not surprise me that certain individuals get away with not stamping cards.  It is disgraceful, particularly when one considers the cost of a stamp today and the cost of living, that any employer should get away with failing to stamp cards and depriving people of benefits to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>Maybe it will be some consolation to people to know that the Minister has referred to some benefit after one has died.  It seems they are prepared to pay for one's burial.  They call these things death grants.  I suppose poor people can draw encouragement from the fact that the Minister has promised that when they die they will not be left on top.  There will be a few pounds somewhere to bury them.  Even in the days of British rule there was that sort of thing and indeed it must have been more generous than the present scheme.  I was approached on Monday last by a woman whose husband has died.  She lives in a very old county council cottage which is in a shocking <Col N="1093" /> state of disrepair.  She is in very poor health.  She applied for the death grant to help her with the burial costs and she got a letter back to say that she would not get it.  I have known her for 20 or 25 years.  She has a little job cleaning a court house.  I am taking up the case for her.  I do not know whether I shall succeed, but I have a duty to refer to the type of treatment which this woman has received when I speak in the presence of a Minister who comes in here to boast about all the benefits and blessings that are being distributed to the people.</P>
    <P>I want to say in conclusion that I do not know what the future holds, but with all the fighting and wrangling that is going on in Government I am not surprised that social welfare recipients have to wait for their benefits.  I suppose the Minister can give the matter very little attention.  He is one of the very few in attendance this morning; the rest are otherwise engaged in knifing each other at the Fianna Fáil meeting which is going on at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to enumerate in detail any of the cases I have had to deal with during the last 12 months.  If I were to do that I would keep the House in session until after Christmas Day.  Most of my time and the expenses attached to my duties as a Dáil Deputy go on the Department of Social Welfare.  I want to deal with the Department, as I see it, from my working with it over the last 20 years.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare is the most important Department in the Government because it deals with necessitous people who live from hand to mouth.  The treatment meted out to these people is a scandal in a Christian country.  I cannot for one moment understand the procedure adopted in the investigation of legitimate claims by the officials of the Department.  I do not deal personally with the Minister; I deal with the Department he controls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why a person in my city or county, who is legitimately entitled to social welfare benefits and who applies locally through the employment exchange or at the Custom House for benefit, has to have <Col N="1094" /> his claim taken there and then sent to Dublin to be stamped and numbered before being sent back to Limerick for investigation.  In a sane country who would put up with such procedural nonsense?  This is a new procedure, introduced in the last three or four years.  If claims are investigated locally why can they not be stamped and numbered locally as well?  Under the present system they are sent to Dublin and held in the Department for weeks and weeks on end.  I know of a case of a man who sent up a claim last July and it still has not been investigated.  He and his four children are living on home assistance.</P>
    <P>When the application is finally receipted, numbered and dated in Dublin it is sent back to Limerick for investigation. The investigation officer covers a large area including the city and county of Limerick and parts of Clare and Tipperary.  He has to file that application away and wait until he has sufficient investigations to make in the area of the person concerned.  If that is the way the Department work we should employ a group of cub scouts to carry out this duty, because unfortunate people have to wait weeks and weeks and months and months for a decision on their claim.</P>
    <P>At home I have a ledger where I tabulate every application I send and I am willing to let the Minister have a look at it.  I have a note of the number of letters and telephone calls I have to make to the Department asking why claims have been held up.  The reply I usually get is that they will get around to it and I will have an answer in a few days.  Days grow into weeks, weeks grow into months, and I get no answer.  I stand for the underprivileged people who spend their time waiting for the postman to deliver a cheque. When no cheque arrives they go up to Coughlan who rings the Department and is told that they are investigating it and a note will be sent next week. They then go down to the home assistance officer who can only give an unfortunate man £3 to look after his four children.</P>
    <P>At my local health board meeting tomorrow I am going to ask how much we spend on telephone calls to the <Col N="1095" /> Department every day in order to speed up claims for unfortunate people.  We can all talk&mdash;talk is cheap &mdash;but people with rent due, ESB bills waiting and mouths to feed have to go to the home assistance officer where they are given three lousy pounds because of the dilatory manner in which the officials in An Roinn Leasa Shóisialaigh are doing their job.  I cannot speak with as much severity as I would wish on this matter.  The quicker we alert these people to their responsibilities the better.  I see six of them here today and I wish the whole Department were here.  I should like to lay down to these people their responsibilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Up to three or four years ago these investigations were carried out locally, but someone got a brainwave that the job should be handled in Dublin and that the people there should make the decisions in all cases.  I would ask the Minister if he thinks this is a fair method of investigation. I do not think it is and I would <Col N="1096" /> ask the Minister to consider this matter urgently.  We are dealing with people who are living from day-to-day and they should be our first concern.</P>
      <P>I wish to give the Minister an example of the bungling that goes on in his Department without his knowledge.  Frequently I have occasion to phone his Department, perhaps in connection with an inquiry regarding an old age pension or a pension for a person who might have returned to this country after spending some time abroad.  I ring the number in the telephone directory&mdash;which is 46811&mdash;and I am told I have the wrong number. I am told to ring 300922 but when I check in the telephone directory under Aras Mhic Dhiarmada I find there is no such number listed.  However, when I ring the latter number I get an answer but I do not understand why we are put to the expense of ringing a number listed in the book only to be told it is not the correct number.</P>
      <P>I rang Aras Mhic Dhiarmada at 9.45 this morning only to obtain the engaged signal.  I kept ringing until 10.15 a.m. but the line was still engaged.  I asked the courteous lady on the telephone switchboard here to obtain the number for me and explained that I had been ringing for 30 minutes.  She told me that was not unusual, that this happened every day. However, she promised to call me back when a line was free and finally at 10.25 a.m. I got through to Aras Mhic Dhiarmada.  I do not regard this as an efficient service and I am sure the Minister will agree with me in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When investigations are held up in the Department, the unfortunate people to whom I have been referring are put on home assistance.  The limit of assistance is £3, except in rare cases where they might get £1 extra if there is a very large family.  Fifty per cent of home assistance revenue comes from the ratepayers.  I am wondering if this is a deliberate campaign by the Department to reduce their obligations and work and to throw the increase on the overburdened ratepayers?  In view of the time it takes to investigate claims I am forced to the conclusion that there is such a campaign by the Department. <Col N="1097" /> In the last hours of this Dáil we are aware that all stops are out, no punches pulled.  We saw what happened this morning with regard to the Garda Síochána and tomorrow there will be something else.  I would advise the Minister for Social Welfare in his own interest in Donegal and in the interest of his party that he has a glorious opportunity now to retrieve the position of his party.</P>
    <P>Claims for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance are sent to Dublin for investigation.  Eventually, when the claims are returned, frequently the applicants are told they are disqualified for six weeks because they have not made a reasonable attempt to obtain employment.  Frequently the applicant comes to me and we fill up the appeal form.  After an interval of several weeks the appeals officer comes to the area&mdash;he comes when he has perhaps two days appeals to hear.  I should like to put on record that 99 per cent of the appeals officers whom I have met in Limerick have been most courteous and understanding although one always meets the person who is not courteous.</P>
    <P>Frequently the appeal is upheld and the applicant is paid his back money. Why can these cases not be dealt with locally?  Can the local person, whether an employee of the employment exchange or an employee of the Department of Social Welfare, not judge these applications instead of the person from Dublin?  The person with local knowledge will know the applicant better than the official from Dublin; he will know the family background and the character of the applicant.</P>
    <P>With regard to free fuel and free footwear, we got our allocation last year, as in other years, but no account was taken of the increase in the cost of living and in the cost of fuel.  Most of the recipients of the free fuel are not dependent on liquid fuel, apart from tenants in corporation estates. Most of the people depend on the half hundredweight of coal or on the vouchers they receive for turf.  Sometimes they exchange their turf vouchers for coal which devalues the voucher to about one-fourth its value because of the difference between the price of <Col N="1098" /> one and the other.  Those people get their bag of coal and that will have to do them for at least a week.  There was no account taken last year in our allocation of this difference.  We appealed to the Department and we pointed out the cost of fuel, the cost of delivery and the cost of administration generally but still it was the same figure that we got over the years.  I ask the Minister when our allocation for this year is received to ensure that the Department will be much more generous than they have been in the past.  The Department should take a good look at the provision for free fuel in the coming months because I know the difficulty we went through in Limerick over the past two years.</P>
    <P>The same applies to footwear.  We all know that leather is practically a thing of the past and the footwear being supplied down the country is no use after one shower of rain.  It is like a strainer because the water goes in one side and comes out the other.  There is no life at all in the footwear produced today.  We got such good wear and tear out of our boots and shoes when we were going to school that we were lucky if we got one pair in the year.  Now it is a case of buying a pair every fortnight or three weeks.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about the men who are on sickness benefit and national health generally.  Somebody in the Department gets an idea that the certificates being sent up by the local doctors certifying these people as unfit are not true and valid documents.  The Department then send down an appeals doctor to inspect these unfortunate recipients of national health and disablement benefits.  He certifies them as fit for work.  They go back to their doctors, who have certified them unfit for work, the following week.  Then we have tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee and the unfortunate man is in the middle not knowing where he is going.  He will say to his local doctor: &ldquo;Doctor, what do you think of this?&rdquo; He will say &ldquo;I do not know; you are unfit&rdquo;.  According to the Department the man is fit for work.  This is more of the Department's stupidity.  One doctor is as good as another but we must bear in mind that the doctor from the Department <Col N="1099" /> is expected to cut off as many as possible to save expenses.  They have all got the same qualifications but still the piece of paper that one doctor writes on is accepted and the piece of paper which the local man, who knows the history of the case, writes on is not accepted.  This unfortunate man is then left with nothing but home assistance. I ask the Minister to do something about his Department and if he does not put a bomb under them we will get somebody from elsewhere to do the job.  It is popular at the present time to bomb buildings and I do not see why the Department of Social Welfare should not go up the same way.</P>
    <P>Last week I raised the question of the prosecution of recipients.  It is very hard to blame the Department for prosecuting these people under the Social Welfare Act because of the manner in which the Act is applied.  You have to sign for three days; you do that and on the third day you get a day's work. You are then between the devil and the deep blue sea; you do not know what to do so you look at your wife and children and say: &ldquo;I will do the two things.  I will go to work and I will go down and sign.&rdquo;  I do not blame anybody for doing that because of the stupid way in which the Act and the regulations are applied.</P>
    <P>That unfortunate person is brought before the court and because of the harshness with which justice is administered he is put in prison.  While he is there his wife and children are outside the gate living on the charity of the neighbours.  He is deprived of all benefit while he is in prison because he succumbed to the temptation laid before him.  I would do the same thing if I was in his circumstances.  I do not blame that man, I blame the Minister and his Department for being the cause of this.</P>
    <P>We now come to the cost of running the Department.  Is it not crystal clear, from what I have said, that the cost of administration in the Department is beyond imagination?  If the Department were only decarbonised and got a decent reboring the cost of administration, without causing any unemployment, <Col N="1100" /> would be reduced considerably. There is too much overlapping, expense here and expense there, which could be cut out and nobody would be a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; out of pocket.</P>
    <P>I now want to talk about the manner in which the Department check on employers and on their responsibilities to their workers.  Deputy O'Connell and Deputy O'Hara have already spoken about the situation but they did not mention that when these things are reported, as I have done on many occasions, the Department's attitude is that it is up to the person concerned to prosecute the employer.  I say it is not. It is the duty of the Department to see that every employer fulfils the obligation laid down on him because the employee has, by compulsion, to pay whatever he is called on to pay for the weekly employment stamps.  He fulfils his end of the contract and if the employer, for one reason or another, fails to do his part&mdash;and this is rampant&mdash;it is the Department's responsibility to see that every six months a worker's card is returned.  If it is not, the Department have an obligation to inquire why not.</P>
    <P>In the great majority of these cases the employees do not bother: they accept the employer at face value and perhaps by an oversight the card has not been stamped.  Then the claim arises and the worker goes to look for his legal rights.  He is told: &ldquo;You are not in benefit, you have not sufficient stamps.&rdquo; By this time the employer may have fled the country or gone bankrupt and the unfortunate worker is left high and dry.  He is told to take the case to court.  In the name of all that is holy, with legal fees at their present level, how can a worker get a solicitor?  Even if he does he may find that his employer has gone to America or Jamaica or that by now he may be an employee himself.  This is the responsibility of the Department and I hope the Minister will take up the matter and ensure that employers who for one reason or another do not stamp cards are brought to book.</P>
    <P>There is still a more glaring injustice. I am talking about the Nevins&mdash; I name them&mdash;who have been prowling <Col N="1101" /> around the West of Ireland picking up boys and girls to go into the potato fields of Scotland, exploiting them to the last, giving them conditions unsuited to dogs.  Those boys and girls were never registered as employees in either Ireland or Scotland.  They were travelling around like Duffy's Circus from field to field from the east to the west coasts of Scotland.  Where in the name of God were the investigators then?  I want to know what is now being done about it.  Are those Nevins being brought to heel and are our people now being treated as if they were in employment in their own country?  I will not say any more about them because a lot has been said already, but I ask the Minister to tell us what the position is now.</P>
    <P>Those boys and girls were forced to live in bothies, hovels and stables, to work from seven o'clock in the morning to seven o'clock at night. Those responsible, who were making £100 a day out of those boys and girls, must be brought to heel.  When I was in Scotland they chased me all over the place trying to catch up with me but they had a damn fine chance of doing that.  My investigations were fruitful and if the conditions I uncovered have not ceased to exist completely I hope the Minister will see to it that they are remedied immediately.</P>
    <P>I should like to discuss for a moment the Department's contribution to the social welfare centres throughout the country.  It is nothing like what it should be from the point of view of the work those centres are doing.  Their members are visiting the sick, helping unfortunate people in their homes-out night and day helping old people in bed, washing them, cooking for them. I wish the Minister would send some of his officials to the Limerick social centre where they will learn a lesson which might put a bit of life into them. I hope the Minister will review the contribution he is making to those centres because they deserve a lot more than they are getting.</P>
    <P>Some consideration should also be given to what I would call lapsed members of the social welfare system, persons who, though they had contributed for many years, are found to <Col N="1102" /> be out of benefit because they had not stamped cards sufficiently in a given period.  We all have experiences of such people.  They have contributed thousands of pounds throughout the years and all that money has gone down the drain.  I suggest to the Minister that some benefits should be made available to such people.  I do not say they should receive full benefits but recognition should be forthcoming for the contributions they have made over the years.</P>
    <P>I will refer only briefly to the matter of the abolition of unemployment assistance because enough has been said about it.  I am glad it was I who raised it here.  I am glad we on these benches anticipated the action of the Department and that we brought nationwide criticism to bear on the intentions of the Department.  Because of what we said there was a reappraisal and we got half a loaf.  That was not enough for me because it illustrates the callous approach of the Department to the underdog: hit him and let the other fellow get richer and bigger while the unfortunate at the bottom of the ladder gets poorer and poorer.</P>
    <P>My diaries and letter book are there to prove how dilatory the Department are in the matter of social welfare.  I have said enough to convince the Minister that the Department need a major overhaul if those people are to receive the treatment to which they are justly entitled.  I am not asking for charity, only for the just rights of those people.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that there will be no necessity in future for expensive telephone calls to non-existent numbers.  I feel very strongly about this and I will continue in my efforts inside and outside this House until I see a major overhaul in that Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true to say that this is the best Estimate ever presented by a Minister for Social Welfare because of the fact that it envisages the spending of £134 million. However, what is more important is that the Minister stated that he is preparing a new code of social welfare, and I hope the Minister will speed the day when we shall see this.  Some <Col N="1103" /> changes are needed in the whole social welfare code and its administration. When we say we are not complacent in respect of the social welfare code, at the same time we should admit that people are inclined to belittle our social welfare services here, very often speaking in ignorance.  It was the fashionable thing at one time to criticise our services here by comparing them with those of other countries.  I often thought that if people would really compare them with those of other countries they might find out that in one instance at least our service is ahead of that of the United Kingdom.  I do not want to start making comparisons between ourselves and other people; I just mention that to create some air of realism when we are discussing this most important subject.</P>
      <P>I can say, without fear of contradiction, that in recent years we have got away from this attitude that Social Welfare is a kind of poor law institution dispensing the slight alms of the State to the people who need them.  We have an educated public and a good Government.  We have shown to each pensioner in whatever category he may be that we try to cherish all the people equally and to give the old age pensioner, the blind pensioner and the widow that sense of belonging to our society, that they are part of our society and that the State recognises their importance.  A great deal more can be done on these lines, and the Department have a great task before them to get the priorities right, to recognise that the basic unit in our society is the family and that our whole legislation must be geared towards protecting that unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection it is very important that we should increase widows' pensions and children's allowances.  We should ensure that every child from whatever type of home he comes&mdash; and they are mostly the poorer type&mdash; will have, first, at least a frugal living and, secondly, as full an education as the boy or girl in the more affluent sector.  It may be said that education is not a matter for this Department. That is quite true, but children's allowances do come under the Department. <Col N="1104" /> The Minister, to give him credit, in recent years increased the age limit for these allowances.  Where boys and girls are taking full education these allowances should be extended at least up to the time they have started the final phase of that education.  This will cost money, and I will say for every Member of this House that none of us begrudges this money to the Minister. Of course, it is easy to say that, but it is the Minister who must explain to the House why taxation has to be increased.  It is easy for me or for Deputies over there to be generous in our remarks and say: &ldquo;I do not mind more taxation&rdquo; but when the Budget comes and the Government must introduce heavier taxation, then we are not so generous.  It is well known that any Government could be brought down by the fact that the public will have judged their taxation to be too heavy without examining for what actually the taxation was intended.</P>
    <P>Widows and children are the weakest sector of our society and I would like to see increases given to widows and orphans.  They get it really tough today when on one side we have an affluent society and on the other side one not so affluent.  In between you have the family of the lower-paid worker or the family of the widow. They must be protected against the very serious effects of inflation.  Do not let us think we just have it here because this is a problem facing countries all over the world.  As inflation increases the hardships on the family increase and the State must try to buttress them against these increases which erode the increases previously given.  The Government party, of which I am a member, has, I think I can say with all due respect to the other parties, brought a new outlook to social welfare, the attitude that we are not prepared to stand on what we have done, but will go ahead and ensure that the wealth of the country is distributed to those who need it most.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to pick out small things that have happened in the Department.  Deputy Coughlan mentioned the telephone.  I certainly agree with him.  It would drive you almost round the bend sometimes trying to <Col N="1105" /> get on to them.  However, that is a small point; a new switchboard would fix that.  I do not want to join in the popular pastime of denigrating the Department all the time.  The men and women in the Department are just as conscious as I am or any other Deputy is about the needs of the people.  The way they administer the laws we make may be a reflection on the laws as we drafted them.  If that is so, we must examine the laws and the regulations. The Minister in his brief here promises to do that.</P>
    <P>Another section that should get special protection are the old people. In recent years old age pensions have been increased greatly, but again, as the Minister states, pensioners are not satisfied.  That is a good sign, but we should look at the matter from the point of view of basic economics.  You pay an old age pensioner £5 a week and he lives in the city here in a corporation flat at a special rent; he may have a medical card and he may have some other assistance from the State. The total commitment of the State in respect of that person would be roughly £500.  However, if that man or woman cannot stay at home in the little room or flat he must be sent to an institution.  The cost of maintaining him there would be almost £1,000 a year.  In addition to this economic factor there is also the social side of the question because most old people would prefer to be able to stay at home if they had somebody to look after them.  Despite the dedication of the staffs of institutions that cater for these people the very fact of their being in such places can be demoralising for them, as anybody visiting various institutions will realise.  Therefore, our efforts should be concentrated on keeping people in their homes.  Of course, in some cases it is necessary for old people to go to institutions. The Department of Social Welfare, in conjunction with the Department of Health, could ensure that as many old people as possible are enabled to remain in their familiar surroundings and that they would have daily help.  A certain amount of daily help is being provided at present.</P>
    <P>The mark of our civilisation will be reflected, ultimately, in the way in <Col N="1106" /> which we care for our old people and other less well-off persons in our community. It is common to see placard-carrying groups in this city who, very often, are protesting about some trivial or even foolish matters.  But one will not see any of the many voluntary workers who look after the aged carrying banners protesting against grievances, imaginary or otherwise.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's review of social welfare, I hope that the persons I have mentioned specifically will be given priority.  It has become almost a national pastime for people to condemn our social services, but in many cases such people do not acquaint themselves with the facts.  If these people are not serious in their approach to the problems of the aged or the less well-off, they should not voice their grievances until such time as they have done their homework, because otherwise they only hinder the efforts being made.  It would be difficult to visualise a situation in which the social welfare services would be perfect because, basically, this is a matter of finance.  Unless our economy is sufficiently buoyant to provide the necessary services, they cannot be provided. We are aware that there are inadequacies in the services but, at the same time, people should not protest without keeping the question of finance in their mind.  If there is a real intention on the part of all concerned to better the existing services we can look forward optimistically to the future.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Department allocating certain amounts each year for the various services, I would like to see them becoming a kind of social generating station from which would come ideals and ideas on the whole question of social welfare.  There are many people in the Department who are of great ability and these people could make a tremendous contribution to the new social welfare code&mdash;a social welfare code that we could be proud of and that would be as extensive as our resources allow.  As a nation that spends vast sums of money yearly on such items as drink and tobacco, it would be wonderful if each one of us had a sense of commitment in relation to our less well-off brethren and that we would be prepared to accept <Col N="1107" /> additional taxation for the purpose of providing better social welfare services. Profit and loss accounts are no criteria for determining the wealth of a society. The way in which we treat the less well-off sections of the community will be reflected in the national balance sheet.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to pay tribute to the voluntary societies who are doing trojan work in this city in the spheres of social welfare, housing and in many other ways.  Even small committees can do a great deal of work.  I am a member of a committee of not more than 15 people and this committee are planning the provision of a scheme of flats for old people that will cost probably £70,000.  Of course they will be helped by the Government by way of grants, but the point I am making is that people can do a lot if they have the will.  The Catholic Housing Aid Society were instrumental in the building of flats for old people at Gardiner Street, St. Anne's Court.  Again, they received generous help from the Department. In my own area the Methodist and Presbyterian Churches have provided homes for old people, again, with help from the Department.  We in Ireland have the means and the will to provide a code of social welfare that will be in keeping with our traditions and our beliefs, but until we have accomplished such a code we cannot say that we have made all the progress possible.  From the Minister's brief we can take it that the future can be faced with confidence and I look forward to the day when he will introduce his new social welfare code.  I hope there will be no undue delay and I assure the Minister that we on this side of the House will back him in relation to whatever additional taxation he may find it necessary to impose.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a few brief comments on the activities or, as some might describe them, the inactivities of the Department of Social Welfare.  I do not think this Government will last long enough to permit all of us to deal with the many aspects of the Department that necessitate comment. At a time when there is so much talk of a United Ireland, one is justified <Col N="1108" /> in making comparisons with benefits here and those in the Six Counties. Most of us are aware that the northerner is a hard-headed businessman and business extends along the line to the household as it were.  I know there are many Nationalists in that part of the country who would be willing to make sacrifices and come in with us, but I wonder how many Unionists would be willing to do likewise.</P>
      <P>When one looks back over the 50 years of rule by Irishmen one realises that quite a number of those years have been spent under Fianna Fáil.  I think there is little to show for their policy over those years.  One need only look at the state of the nation today.  Looking for a republic for the 32 counties! I never knew so many republican parties in this country. Fianna Fáil claim they are republican; but there are many republican parties, if we are to believe all we hear.  Who in the North of Ireland would want to come in here in the present state of confusion here?</P>

      <P>Let us turn now to the Twenty-six Counties.  Because of the failure of Fianna Fáil hundreds of thousands of young men along the western seaboard have had to emigrate. What had the country to offer them?  The policy has been to export our people and export our language. It is the remittances of our emigrants that keep the pot boiling, pay the rent on Monday and put a bite on the table&mdash;remittances to the tune of £20 million a year.  When the emigrants come back they find that every time benefits are increased in Britain whatever they are entitled to here is cut <i>pro rata.</i> That is all the country has to give them.</P>
      <P>I never believed the dole would solve the economic situation in the West.  The dole has now been withdrawn. What has been done by Fianna Fáil to compensate those who are deprived in this way or to provide work for these men?  What is there for the young man who stood by his ageing parents?  That was the loyalty that kept him at home; it was not loyalty to the crown or the half-crown, but to his father and mother.  When the parents die this man has no option but to emigrate.  All over the countryside there are hasps on doors and chains on gates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked about increases in social welfare.  What about the increases in the cost of living?  The people were like dromedaries carrying a hump of taxation.  When the value added tax is introduced they will become camels with two humps.  Ministers are running around all over Europe. I would ask the Minister to run over to Britain and do something about the reciprocal arrangements where social welfare benefits are concerned.  It should not take him long.  Every day Ministers are running up and down the steps into and out of Aer Lingus planes, being seen off by their friends and officials.  If the Minister will go to Britain to do something about these benefits I will see him off and I will meet him when he comes back.  Something must be done to alleviate the hardship on these poor people.  We <Col N="1110" /> have the telephone number of the Department of Social Welfare off by heart, 46811.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I am pointing out.  One would not have to ring the Department if everything was all right.  Things should run smoothly.  People should not have to suffer delay in the payment of benefits to which they are entitled.  Mention was made of a bomb being put in the Department.  I suggest a time bomb should go in with every case.  I would not like to injure any of you.  Something must be done to activate the Department of Social Welfare.  Perhaps a time bomb or some sort of explosive device could be set to warn the officials about long delays in dealing with queries.  Many unfortunate people have their claims delayed.  I know of many cases of delay.  We are a society in which the rich are becoming richer and the poor poorer.  Some people in our society are affluent and we have the Taca element and I think of them as &ldquo;effluent&rdquo;.  The rats are beginning to desert the ship.  People are beginning to realise on which side their bread is buttered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to deserted wives.  Unfortunate women who have <Col N="1111" /> been deserted should be helped.  What are we in this country doing for them? The &ldquo;good time boys&rdquo; in England should be brought to justice.  Why should we have to pay expenses which are really theirs?  Many families would bring cases against the missing husbands if these cases could be held <i>in camera</i> to save the embarrassment of the wives and children.  Perhaps the Minister for Justice could make a special effort to bring home these husbands to face their responsibilities.  Any such cases should be heard <i>in camera.</i> This might result in the Minister benefiting more than he imagines.</P>
    <P>Many claims for social welfare benefits have been delayed in the Department. I know of one case of an old age pensioner, aged 75 years.  For three years she did not draw the pension. Old people in the country are sometimes uncertain of their age.  She was 73 before she got a pension or even applied for it.  For a short period she was overpaid.  Is it just that the Department should demand repayment of the slight overpayment?  The old lady was overpaid a few shillings, but the State benefited by the fact that she did not claim a pension for three years. Credit should be given to her for these three years instead of looking for the few shillings back.</P>
    <P>I would like to commend the great social welfare work done by voluntary organisations.  Great things have been done in this country by voluntary effort.  We hear of students who are dissidents or radicals.  There are many students who work quietly.  They are not shown on television working for old people.  I have seen lads papering rooms for old people.  I commend the great work they do.</P>
    <P>I conclude by asking the Minister to have his telephone fixed.</P>

It is a pity that matters which are either not correct or only partly correct should be brought in here and hurled across the House as if they were the absolute truth.  To listen to the record of complaints about the Department of Social Welfare one would get the impression that people were born and reared to become social welfare officials in order to crucify the poor people of this country.

I should like to know the number of people who were laid off unemployment assistance this year.  Would the Minister be able to tell me what the net saving was?

      <P>They have not been living on the wind.  They had no employment and they must live on something. It was certainly not on savings they made while on unemployment assistance. They had to get money somewhere and the only place they could get it was from home assistance.  I suggest that is what happened.</P>
      <P>This did reduce the number on the unemployed register.  Another thing with which I entirely agree also reduced the number.  It is as well to point this out.  People went on retirement pensions&mdash;about 4,000, according to the Minister.  At age 65, because of the number of stamps they had, they were entitled to do so.  This is a very good idea but I would ask the Minister to arrange that, when somebody is retiring, if he leaves a job and applies for a retirement pension, there would not be the great delay there is at present in issuing the pension book to him.  It appears that there is a crossing of lines somewhere.  People employed, perhaps, for 30 or 40 years and stamping cards who apply for pensions have to wait far too long.  If their incomes from employment cease they should get the pension without delay; if they are drawing unemployment benefit they should be allowed to continue drawing it until the week the pension book is issued.  Although that seems simple, I have had one or two cases where it does not happen.</P>
      <P>It is quite safe for the Minister to go now, I understand.  I am not talking about myself but about the party meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The retirement pension should be paid without any delay. Recently I had a case of a woman whose husband was invalided and she was drawing unemployment benefit and subsequently home assistance.  When her husband died, although she was then destitute, the Department informed her she was no longer entitled to draw unemployment assistance because she was a widow entitled to a pension.  When she applied for the pension she was told it would be possibly five or six weeks before it could be issued.  She was left suspended like Mahomet's coffin.  She would possibly be now out of the way altogether but for the charity of her neighbours which enabled her to live.  I hope she gets the pension soon.  This is another case of delay where delay should not be.</P>
      <P>I have complained consistently here and must now repeat the complaint about the situation in regard to appeals whether these are against a referee's decision who decides somebody is&mdash; they use a lovely expression&mdash;&ldquo;not unfit for work&rdquo;: they do not say he is fit for work with the result that the disability benefit is cut off&mdash;or whether it is decided for some peculiar reason that he is not entitled to unemployment benefit or assistance and an appeal is submitted.  The delay is far too long. A few days ago I was appalled by a complaint from a man with a wife and ten children, all at home and entitled to benefit, who was ill and whose doctor says he is not to work under any circumstances and who was, on two occasions, declared &ldquo;not unfit for work&rdquo; by a referee.  The result is that this man had to get home assistance which is not very generous.  Therefore, his low standard of living has dropped almost to zero.  This decision was given in July; the second decision was given in September and the man is still awaiting a decision from somebody in the Department on whether the certificates issued by his doctor are to be honoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man could, if allowed by his doctor, sign as unemployed but since one of his eyes is badly affected by an abscess and he cannot see, the doctor is not prepared to agree that <Col N="1115" /> he should seek work.  Therefore, because the Department of Social Welfare cannot make up their mind this man and his family are left in an unenviable position.  This is an instance of appeals taking too long.  They should be dealt with far more quickly. If there are not sufficient of these officers to deal with the cases, for goodness' sake appoint them.  Why should the Ministers come here every year saying: &ldquo;They are very busy and unable to cope with the volume of cases&rdquo;?  Obviously, if they cannot deal with the work you must get more people to do the job.  The appeals officers are dealing with people in dire need.</P>
    <P>The matter of insurance cards not being stamped has already been mentioned. I am very glad to welcome the recent change whereby if an employer does not stamp cards and the insured worker applies for unemployment or disability benefit, the Department, if the card is stamped, will no longer impose a six weeks penalty but will pay from the date the evidence of unemployment or illness was produced. This is a big improvement but far too many employers have been consistently failing or refusing to stamp cards.  It amazes me when I find an employer, particularly a large employer, who was forced by the State to stamp cards four or five years ago not stamping cards in the meantime so that the case recurs.  Is it not reasonable to ask that the State should keep an eye on employers who have failed to stamp cards?  They deduct the cost of the stamp which is over £1 a week from the workers and they should not get away with it.  Recently, I had a report about somebody who owed about £8,000 insurance to the State.  He had to be coaxed into paying it.  The proper thing is to prosecute people who fail to stamp cards and if that were done in a few cases the others might change their minds.</P>
    <P>Another matter arose recently in regard to stamping of cards.  Apparently, Westmeath County Council, and I do not know how many other employers, last year handed in their stamped cards to the local office.  The cards were stolen with the result that <Col N="1116" /> everybody whose cards were stolen and who applies for a benefit must first get a notice from the Department informing him that his 1970 card was not received in the office.  When somebody like myself kicks up a row eventually a query goes to the employer to find out if the card was stamped and if the Department are satisfied that it was, they give credit for the stamps and pay the benefit.  Why cannot the Department ask each employer concerned, particularly an employer like Westmeath County Council, whether all their employees' cards were stamped, if not, what stamps were put on, and give credit for them now? The point is that if the Department do not do that, individuals applying for benefit and who are eventually paid may be all right but those who do not apply for benefit, if they retire inside the next few years, will be affected by the fact that a full year's stamps are not credited to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Westmeath County Council should have taken action straight away and notified the Department that their office was broken into and that the stamps and cards which were duly stamped were stolen.  The Department would accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not that be lovely?  The only snag is that it was not Westmeath County Council who lost the cards.  It was the Department who lost the cards.  The cards were deposited in the office of the Department and they were stolen from there.  If Westmeath County Council lost the cards naturally they would make a claim for a reissue.  In fact, it was the other way round.  The Department should clear up their own house.</P>
      <P>I have already taken up several individual cases of disability benefit.  I do not think it should be necessary for me or anybody else to have to make representations on behalf of someone who was in employment for 40 years and when he makes an application for the first time, he is told that his insurance card&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Why not issue it in October?  There is also the case of persons who draw disability benefit for a full year and because they have less than 156 stamps they are told: &ldquo;We are terribly sorry, but you are not entitled to any more benefit.&rdquo;  If they were unemployed and that happened they would sign up for unemployment assistance, or the dole as it is called.  Why not introduce a scheme of disability assistance?  Why can there not be a lesser benefit which could be paid to people who have not got the correct number of stamps to enable them to draw continuously?  Surely it should be possible to ensure that people in that position will not have to draw home assistance or, if they are in hospital, be left destitute because they are not entitled to draw anything at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell asked a question yesterday about old age pension books and the cheques for disability benefit which go to people who are in hospital. Pension books should not be taken from people who are in hospital.  A strict order should be made by the Department that a person in hospital for treatment as an ordinary patient should not under any circumstances hand over his books to the people in charge of the hospital.  This is a game that has been going on for far too long. I know the reasons for it.  It means that these old people are subsidising the general rate because, if they hand over their books and £3 or £4 is taken from them every week, this is supposed to reduce the amount of money which their stay in hospital will cost.  If they were 30 years of age instead of 70 years this would not happen.  It should not happen.  If they go in for shelter, <Col N="1118" /> which is entirely different, there is a regulation and, while I do not entirely agree with it, I can see a certain amount of justification for it.  I can see no justification whatever for the other matter.</P>
    <P>I also want to mention the position of a person in a mental hospital.  I object very strongly to the present system whereby disability benefit to which a patient in a mental hospital is entitled is sent to the RMS.  The RMS is usually a very busy man and has not got the time to deal with the cheques that come in from the Department for patients so he usually passes them on to somebody else.  On more than one occasion I have had to make lengthy representations on behalf of an unfortunate person who suffered mental illness for several months and on being discharged was allowed out of the hospital without his bus fare home although the Department had sent perhaps £100 or more which belonged to that person to the mental hospital. This is entirely wrong and it should be stopped.  Perhaps it is not administered as the Department intended it to be administered.  If it is not, they should ensure that it is properly administered.  This has been happening too often and it should be stopped immediately.</P>
    <P>Only a few months ago I discovered that the Department had set up a new section in Phibsboro' Towers.  The telephone number which was quoted by Deputy Coogan, 46811, is well known to us all.  Not so many people know the number 300922.  I have to look at it myself to make sure that I get it right.  This is the phone number of Phibsboro' Towers.  The officials of the Department are usually very courteous.  If a person rings 46811 he is told that the section is no longer there but that it is now in Phibsboro' Towers.  This means another phone call and another long wait to get through.  On every communication and document sent out by the Department to newspapers or anywhere else the phone number should be set out so that people will know exactly what number they should phone.</P>
    <P>Recently I have found it extremely difficult to get through to either of those numbers.  It is relatively easy <Col N="1119" /> between 9.30 and 10 o'clock in the morning.  After that there is a long wait.  It appears to me that the people employed on the switches at those two places are grossly overworked.  It appears as if there are not enough operators.  This is a service which requires to be dealt with expertly.  There should be a proper phone service in those places.  If they have not got enough telephones, as has been suggested, more should be provided.  Very often the phone rings for quite a long time.  Nothing is so annoying as holding a telephone in your hand for five minutes waiting for a reply and, when you think you are getting through, there is a click and you are cut off.  This may be due to the fact that the person doing the job is already overworked in trying to deal with other calls coming in and may accidentally knock over the switch.  Very often it is impossible to get through at all.  The line is engaged and you have to dial about 20 times in the hope of cutting in between calls.  I am not blaming the staff.  I am saying that proper facilities are not provided.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the amount of money being spent by the Department. Over the past few days we had queries about the Common Market. Everybody in this House knows my views on the Common Market.  I do not think we should go in and I do not think we will go in.  If we are put into the position that we have to go in, we should know what social welfare will cost each individual and what benefits we will be entitled to get.  It is very hard for someone like me who is continually meeting people to try to give them the full particulars when the Minister does not know them.  He was asked here in the House and he gave a very evasive reply.  He dithered around and gave the impression that everybody could set their own rates, that it would be no different when we go in.  This is wrong.  He knows it is wrong.  The Department should get out a document setting out what the rates are, what they are likely to be in five years time.</P>
    <P>There is far too little money being spent on social welfare particularly as the raising of money is something at <Col N="1120" /> which the Government are so expert. We are told now that because of certain things that are happening an extra £3 million will have to be found for defence.  I am quite sure that if things get any worse it can be £6 million, £9 million or £12 million and nobody will grumble.  It will be brought into this House.  There will be a few hours discussion and it will go right through.  I think the greatest emergency in this country is the state of our sick poor. The Government should take steps to improve the rates paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health used a neat little trick to pick up £5,200,000 on the Department of Social Welfare stamp.  He said he was giving something to people who have to go as out-patients to hospitals but this will cost £700,000 which was collected last year so there is a hefty balance.  Why do the Department of Social Welfare not look after their own house?  Nobody who is employed will complain if they are asked to pay a little extra on insurance stamps if there is a decent increase given.  The 15p which was put on for health, if it had to be put on at all, should have been put on for social welfare.  If that had been done, the claims of the many people who are depending on social welfare could be dealt with in a reasonable way.  Unfortunately, I understand that the percentage of people in the older age group is so high that people who are working are overloaded.  In this case the State should assist more than it is assisting.  I see from the Minister's brief that of the extra £5 million which has been put in to pay certain increases the State is supplying £1 million. That would suggest to me that the State is opting out of its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the result of this morning's meeting was nor do I know whether in the vote next week, as one Deputy said last week, Deputy Foley's voice will say one thing and his feet do a different thing, but if the feet follow the voice when the vote takes place we may get an opportunity of giving the people of this country the right to decide whether they are satisfied with the Government and the way they are being treated.</P>
    <P>Personally, I think the Department of <Col N="1121" /> Social Welfare are doing a good job within the limits set for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Including the Parliamentary Secretary.  He does not give anything away but at least he will reply civilly to a letter sent to him.  I find that most of the complaints made about non-payment are caused by the fact that somebody put a wrong number on or sent it to the wrong section or did not put an X where they should have put it.  I believe the Department could help by explaining more clearly what people are expected to do.</P>
      <P>One final thing I would ask.  When somebody applies for disability benefit or occupational injuries benefit, would the Department immediately send a DB.5 to him on the off chance that he is married and has six or seven children because it is very annoying when somebody who has sent in a couple of certificates is treated as a single man when there are a great many people depending on what he gets from the State.</P>
      <P>With regard to occupational injuries, delays caused because employers fail to certify that the accident occurred in their work can be cut out.  If an employer does not reply within a week he could be visited by a Department official and some penal clause could be introduced to ensure that such an employer would have to pay out of his own pocket the amount of benefit which should have been paid by the State if the certificate was sent in in time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider this one of the most important Estimates. To reply to Deputy Tully I am sure he will hear what happened at the Fianna Fáil Party meeting this morning but we do not know what happened at the Labour Party meeting yesterday and we probably will not know for a considerable time, maybe until such time as the history of the Labour Party is written.  No matter what happens on Wednesday, and I am entirely optimistic about what will happen on Wednesday, the record of the Labour Party in coalition in the context of <Col N="1122" /> social welfare cannot be held up as a banner of honour, as an example to follow.  That is a matter of ascertainable fact.  When one talks about what goes on at party meetings one should examine one's conscience.</P>
      <P>There has been many criticisms of the Department but when I looked at a document last night setting out the various areas in which the Department are operating I wondered how they work so well having regard to their many and varied responsibilities to the people who are entitled to social security.  The words &ldquo;social security&rdquo; appeal to me.  This is an old chestnut of mine which I shall deal with later. When there are so many people entitled to social security benefits the people administering those benefits must be under considerable pressure.  We should recognise that.</P>
      <P>Since the Fianna Fáil Government have come into office the whole area of social security has taken on a completely new and realistic look.  This is not to suggest that everything is absolutely correct.  Who is to say that instead of a £5 pension one would not like to give a £10 pension but the reality is that we must work within our own financial limitations?  What Deputy who saw a person in very bad conditions would not like to get that person out of his difficulties?  It is unrealistic to suggest that insufficient money is being given out.</P>
      <P>As far as the Fianna Fáil Government are concerned every single penny that can be given to people entitled to social scurities benefits is given.  There is no gainsaying that; the record is there.  Deputy Tully made snide asides about future general elections but we can go to the country with a record which is ascertainable and identifiable. The record of Deputy Tully's party is equally ascertainable and identifiable but it does not measure up to our record.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare and his Parliamentary Secretary have moved:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £75,326,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on <Col N="1123" /> the 31st day of March, 1972, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare for certain services administered by that Office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, and for sundry grants.</P>
    <P>This is quite a considerable sum and I, in common with every other Deputy, would like that sum to be three, four or five times greater.  However, there are other areas of economic, social and cultural endeavour which must be taken into account when one is making up the national Budget on an annual basis.  Any extra moneys which become available from time to time are directed towards the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the term &ldquo;social welfare&rdquo;.  I know I am a bit of a bore on this particular subject but, having brought up the position of deserted wives, illegitimate children, paraplegics and so on, people have begun to listen to me and as a result of my urgings quite an amount of social legislation has arisen although I must say my urgings fell on receptive ears.</P>
    <P>What I am about to say now has already been recorded in the Dáil Debates and will continue to be recorded until such a time as the situation which I am about to speak about is changed.  One of the many functions of a Deputy is to bring about change in the way he thinks change should be brought about within the context of the disciples of one's political party. I would strongly urge the Parliamentary Secretary to bring to the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare the question of changing the title of his Department from &ldquo;Social Welfare&rdquo; to &ldquo;social security&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; reeks of the soup kitchen, the poor law, the county home and all the cretinous side issues that involved; it reeks of Victoriana.  It has been with us since the beginning of Queen Victoria's reign in the 1830s and it is still with us today.  I have taken the view over the short number of years I have had the honour to represent the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown that the word &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; should be changed. It is a small matter and may be the <Col N="1124" /> Parliamentary Secretary and his officials think I have been niggling, but I do not intend to be.  I make the point as an observation and not as a criticism, in the hope that as a result of my observations this change will come about. I know my appeal will not fall on deaf ears, but I should be grateful if the Minister when he is replying would deal with the point.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to see the various reciprocal agreements with Britain being brought up to date.  The question of deserted wives has been of considerable concern to me over the years, as has the position of illegitimate children in our society.  I should like to thank the Department of Social Welfare for taking note of what was said in this House.  Reciprocal legislation relating to deserted wives between this country and Britain is not entirely satisfactory, but I believe moves are being made there to introduce legislation whereby a husband who deserts his wife and goes to Britain can be prosecuted there with a view to getting him to pay whatever weekly sums his deserted wife is entitled to.</P>
    <P>The amount of money given to illegitimate children and their mothers cannot in these inflationary times be described as generous.  I have no doubt that the sum will continue to be increased as years go by in order to make the mother and her child as well off as one possibly can.  It is a fact of life that we are living in a situation where money loses its value daily.  This is not endemic to Ireland; it is the pattern in developed societies throughout the world.</P>
    <P>During the Fianna Fáil term of office many innovations have been brought about in the Department of Social Welfare.  One area which one would like to see improved is the position of the old in our society.  I read an article on this very subject in a magazine entitled <i>Land and Liberty,</i> November-December, 1971.  The article was entitled &ldquo;Review and Reflection&rdquo; by Robert Clancy, in which he comments on the place of the aged in our society.  The expression &ldquo;The poor we will always have with us&rdquo; is anathema so far as I am concerned and I will not accept that from any quarter.  It is my belief we should have a good and <Col N="1125" /> decent society in which the poor will no longer be poor and where they have a reasonable standard of living.  I accept there are people who cannot help themselves, but we have an obligation to help them.  It is totally unacceptable to this side of the House that the poor shall always be with us. This need not be so if we take a proper view of the whole philosophy of the workings of government, not only in the Department of Social Welfare, but throughout other spheres of economic endeavour.</P>
    <P>Regarding the aged poor, Mr. Clancy states:</P>
    <P>It is evident that the problem is basically an economic one.  Making a decent living in a way that provides for one's old age holds the key to the problem.</P>
    <P>This is the point I was making about the expression &ldquo;The poor we will always have with us&rdquo; and it coincides with Mr. Clancy's writing on this topic.  He continues:</P>
    <P>When we can solve the problem of having progress without poverty we will be in a fair way towards solving old age as a social problem.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we shy away from the words &ldquo;old age&rdquo;; we use such words as &ldquo;the later years&rdquo; and &ldquo;our senior citizens&rdquo;.  If they are used in everyday language and in a fair context that is all right.  But sometimes they are used by people who wish to escape from their responsibilities and, used in that context, they are used fraudulently. The use of such terms puts me on my guard about the person who is using them and the context in which he uses them, because he might utter these words in an effort to avoid his responsibilities.</P>
    <P>No praise can be loud enough for the voluntary bodies throughout this city and country who are dedicated to alleviating the lot of the aged in our society and I have no doubt they will continue their worthwhile work.  I would mention the home help services, the voluntary social welfare services and the various societies such as St. Vincent de Paul, the Little Sisters of the Poor and organisations of that <Col N="1126" /> calibre who work to lessen the stress of modern living on the old.  I know the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Health are appreciative of the work being done by these organisations.  In effect, they are taking over the functions of the State.  Perhaps the State should do the work they are doing, but it is a happy combination of the State and voluntary organisations working hand-in-hand.  It is good that people make some voluntary contribution towards the society in which they live.</P>
    <P>It is important that we take a hard look at the integration of the aged into housing estates and new housing complexes.  People with money do not have problems in that context as they can buy the necessities of life and so maintain a good standard of living. However, those who retire from jobs that do not carry large salaries have low pensions and these are the people I have in mind.  In some cases their families may be deceased or they may have been neglected by their families. A young or middle-aged couple may find they cannot cope with their parents and they may take the view that it is the responsibility of the State to care for them.  One might regard this as tragic, but nevertheless it is a reality of life.  If a young, or middle-aged, couple have not the necessary financial resources to look after their parents, then it is a matter for the State.  Having accepted that principle we must integrate them into a society in which they will have a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>I urge strongly the integration of the aged into housing estates, and I consider they should be given flats or accommodation in schemes which cater also for young people.  Once the old people have their own base their neighbours will look after them; from time to time the younger people may invite them to their houses perhaps to baby-sit or to do a similar service.  This gives the old people a feeling of belonging and this is most important.</P>
    <P>Lack of finances and a sense of boredom afflicts the aged.  At the risk of being a little crude, to get the smell of old age when one visits the apartment of an old person is upsetting.  This <Col N="1127" /> is tragic when one considers the emphasis placed nowadays on affluence. I do not believe in being a killjoy&mdash;quite the contrary&mdash;but we should reflect from time to time on the conditions of the less well-off sections in our society.  It is an exercise in mental discipline, if nothing else; and if it does not prick one's conscience that is a matter for the individual concerned. I do not believe in moralising, nor is it my intention to do so now, but I would make that point with regard to the position of the aged in our society.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the information services in the Department of Social Welfare.  It is good to know that there are booklets and summaries of social insurance and social assistance services available to the public.  It is important to put on the record of the House once more that there is in the city of Dublin a public office at Beresford Place and that another office was provided earlier this year in the Phibsboro' Tower, which is intended for the personal use of callers there.  I would like to thank the Minister for Social Welfare for providing that office.  It is a welcome development and one which I know will not cease at the Phibsboro' Tower but will spread throughout the city and county of Dublin and also throughout the country.  I am not familiar with the position throughout the country but I am satisfied that there are other places where information relating to social security entitlements is available.</P>
    <P>One finds, in one's capacity as a TD, that people come and ask what their entitlements are.  With all the waste of time from the point of view of the person concerned it is pretty frustrating that one cannot say that there is a social security office down the road and ask the person to call in there to get all the advice he or she requires. Instead, one is obliged to say: &ldquo;The employment exchange will be open on Monday next, perhaps you can go down there?&rdquo; The person usually says: &ldquo;No, I will be working.&rdquo; You then say: &ldquo;I will send you a copy of the pamphlet <i>Summary of Social Insurance and Assistance Services.&rdquo;</i> You then find the person comes back to you and states that he or she did not quite <Col N="1128" /> understand what was meant after reading that booklet.</P>
    <P>This is another matter which should be guarded against.  All those entitlements should be put down in clear, unequivocal language so that a person's entitlements are put down in figures rather than in words.  If there is something which confuses people, including myself, more than anything else from time to time it is to have figures explained with a long piece of verbiage added.  It is interesting to note that 45,000 copies of this booklet were ordered in the last reprint. It is distributed free of charge to Deputies, Senators, local authorities, trade unions and others on a mailing list. It is also issued to any individual inquirer and is available for consultation at employment exchanges, employment offices and post offices.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to examine the possibility of setting up information offices of the type already set up in Phibsboro' Tower.  If the office is only to be staffed by one person, they should be dotted throughout the city and the country generally, particularly in the areas of dense population.  This would take a lot of worry off the people entitled to these benefits and it would, to be a little selfish about it, take quite a lot of work off individual Deputies, not that I believe in complaining about anything a Deputy has to do.  I always believe if a Deputy does not like what he is doing he can get out, so Deputies do not deserve any sympathy in this or any other context in the light of the type of job they are called on to do.  &ldquo;If you do not like the heat of the oven you can always get out of the kitchen&rdquo; was an expression used by an American President, I do not know whether it was Roosevelt or Truman.  That is the answer when that type of sympathy is directed towards Deputies.</P>
    <P>I believe if these individual offices were set up throughout areas of dense population it would go a long way towards educating the people to what their entitlements are and it would also help the Department of Social Welfare because it would take quite a considerable amount of pressure off them in terms of inquires and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell mentioned a case <Col N="1129" /> yesterday which I did not have an opportunity of pursuing.  It is that of a woman who is a deserted wife and is in poor physical condition.  She is in one of the Cheshire Homes in Dublin, in the Earlsfort Terrace/Harcourt Street direction.  He mentioned that the woman cannot look after her children and therefore she is not entitled to support.  As he described it she could not even afford the price of a bottle of lemonade.  I really have not examined this case so maybe it would be wrong for me to predict what the outcome of it might be.  I am quite satisfied that Deputy O'Connell did all in his power to bring about a situation whereby this woman of 31 or 32 years of age could afford a bottle of lemonade and I have no doubt that the Deputy in his generosity bought her whatever she required.  If this is the position it is wrong that this should be the case. However, as I pointed out to Deputy O'Connell, I believe that that is not the position and that the matter has not been fully investigated and that after full investigation it will be found that she is entitled to something.</P>
    <P>I realise that the conditions for deserted wives have to be very strict and if she has not got one dependant living with her it would be unfair to make an exception in her case, but nevertheless she is a deserted wife.  Deputy O'Connell did not tell us where the children are living at present and whether in fact they are being looked after by the State or being looked after privately.  If they are being looked after by the State surely in that way the State are discharging their obligations to some small degree to the unhappy mother.  I told Deputy O'Connell I would mention this and I will pursue it.  He gave me the name of the person concerned.  It is fair to say that he also gave the name to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare.  During the course of the day I will remind the Parliamentary Secretary of the case and I am sure he will solve it or attempt to solve it.  One can never be sure as to the full facts involved but when one states that one can solve a case one has to be very careful because it might be unsolvable.</P>
    <P>I should like once more to bring to <Col N="1130" /> the attention of the House, arising particularly out of Deputy Tully's criticism of the Government in relation to our efforts in the field of social security generally, that Fianna Fáil have nothing to be ashamed of in this respect. They have made available all the resources at their disposal.  As I said already, we should like to give £10 where a beneficiary is getting £5.  However, a budgetary problem is involved as well as an economic situation.  Perhaps in the not too distant future we will be able to give people sufficient benefits to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>We have a darned good social welfare staff and one realises this by comparing our social welfare entitlements with those of other social welfare structures, be it in Britain or the Six Counties. When we make such comparisons, however, we ought to be perfectly clear on what we are talking about.  When a person says that one reason why the Six Counties would not join us is that our social welfare benefits are not as good as theirs, which are paid for by Britain, that is a fraudulent argument. It is fraudulent, peripheral and lightweight and people who make such arguments should sit down and examine the various entitlements and the relative positions of the recipients in either case.</P>
    <P>Such an argument put forward as a justification for the people in the Six Counties refusing to reunite with us is as lightweight as that which suggests that they might join us if our contraceptive and divorce laws were changed.  It is a fraud of an argument, totally out of touch with the reality of the position that exists and it worries me when people trot out such arguments without consideration, apart altogether from the effects such arguments may have.</P>
    <P>We have done quite well down here in the matter of our social services. Perhaps we do not give as much as we should like to give but we have made a beginning and I believe that with a little modernisation within the Department we have the basis of a very good social welfare structure.  We realise that nobody in our society should have to go without a minimum standard of living and I believe we <Col N="1131" /> can realise that ambition in the not too distant future.  It will be a Fianna Fáil Government who will do it.  A long list of new concepts in this field has been the result of Fianna Fáil efforts.  We have nothing to be ashamed of.  When the Opposition criticise us on this they should examine their consciences and think of what they did in Government not so long ago.  Let them compare what they offered to what we achieved.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by thanking the Minister for Social Welfare and his Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Geoghegan, who is efficient and competent.  When one brings a matter to his attention in the social welfare sphere he deals with it immediately. I should like to put on record also my appreciation of the officials of the Department who over the years have been most helpful to me in my efforts on behalf of my constituents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a constituency where the number of social welfare beneficiaries are so great I cannot let this Estimate pass without making a few points that affect my people there.  Their problem is very great and far different from that in other counties. Most of them occupy small holdings. Therefore, the decision taken last year to do away with unemployment assistance affected them grievously and the leader of my party brought it very forcibly to the attention of the House and the country.  It almost brought down the Government at the time.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare comes from a county similar to mine. During the Donegal by-election I travelled his constituency extensively and I should think that the number of social welfare recipients there exceeds even that for my constituency. Therefore, the Minister knows perfectly well that if that decision by his Government had been implemented the hardship imposed there would have been enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of those in my constituency have stayed on small poor holdings to look after their parents.  Some of them, boys and girls, are well educated and could have succeeded elsewhere but <Col N="1132" /> they stayed at home to look after their parents.  The few shillings unemployment assistance which helped those people to stay to look after their aged mothers and fathers was to be taken away from them.  That decision by the Government should not have been tolerated by the Minister, who comes from a constituency so similar to mine.  Many people in my county would not survive or rear their families were it not for the social welfare benefits. They would have to emigrate.  It is true to say that 6,150 people have left my county since 1966 and practically every one of them was a recipient of social welfare.  The Government failed miserably to provide work for them and they had to leave.  I am delighted that a Deputy from my consituency who belonged to that party across the House voted openly against the Government on that issue.  That man knew exactly the position and the conditions that exist there.</P>
    <P>I come to a more pressing situation in relation to old age pensioners living alone or living with their sons or daughters and receiving an old age pension.  Many of them should be in hospital.  There is an allowance paid to a female relative to look after an aged person who cannot provide care and attention for himself.  In many cases daughters-in-law have to care for their mothers-in-law and take them in and out of the bed maybe ten times a day.  They are completely debarred from any assistance to look after those aged people.  There is a regulation there that debars the woman of the house from an allowance and if she is maintained by her husband.</P>
    <P>In the normal course of events these people go into hospital.  In my county it is impossible to get people into the county home or the district hospital. There is a waiting list.  I would appeal to the Minister to give an allowance to a male or female relative who is prepared to look after his or her father or mother at home so as to keep them out of an institution, a county home, a district hospital or a geriatric institution. An old person is never happier than when he is in the home in which he was born.  It is tragic that assistance is not provided for such a person.  I <Col N="1133" /> have to make a recommendation to the local authority for home assistance.  I do not know how many letters I have written, for home assistance, for these poor people since the Minister changed the regulations for unemployment assistance.  As a result of that, there is a rate in our county of £7.50; we must pay 50 per cent of the cost of home assistance.  I must say that the St. Vincent de Paul Society in the various towns in which they operate have given a tremendous amount of help to those people.</P>
    <P>I would say 50 per cent of the people of the West of Ireland have gone to England as migratory labourers and many of them have had to stay there.  It was as a result of the earnings of these people across the water that they were able to rear their families and build the homes they have at the moment.  The Government may claim that they built the homes, but it was the hard-earned money of the people who emigrated that helped to make these nice homes we have in our county today or which are in any other county where such conditions prevail.  These people come back after years of slaving to earn big money.  They are among the finest working people in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Let me say to the Minister that there is no man in the West of Ireland who wants unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit if work is available.  Thank God our fathers never lowered themselves to that level.  It was a Fianna Fáil Government that did that.  We do not want that.  What we want is work and an honest living. We in the West of Ireland have been classed as lazy people by people in the city or other well-off areas, but I can guarantee that there is no lazy man there.  If the work is available and the incentives are given they will do the work.  We have proved this in the West of Ireland through the large number of our people who have emigrated to Britain, America and other countries and done so well.  I do not want my county to be called a social welfare county.  What I want in my county is that full-time employment be given so that people can earn a decent living.</P>
    <P>In regard to sick benefit, I want to refer to people who are injured and are called before a medical referee.  I know <Col N="1134" /> of a man who was called before a medical referee on three occasions in a nice hotel in some centre in County Mayo.  He was turned down each time even though he was wearing an appliance and, as I knew, could not work for one half hour.  I wrote to the Department of Social Welfare and asked how this person could certify that the man was not fit for work when he had not been examined by an orthopaedic surgeon.  I complained in my letter that this man who had a family of seven children and who lived on a small holding was deprived of benefit for 15 months.  In fairness to the Department, they arranged for the man to be examined by an orthopaedic surgeon and, subsequently, he received the social welfare benefits that were due to him.  My point is that it would be impossible for any of these medical referees to determine whether a man was fit for work without first having reports of medical examinations and X-rays.  Of course, in certain cases a referee would be able to decide.  I would suggest that in cases such as the one I have mentioned, the Department, instead of sending down a referee, would request reports from orthopaedic surgeons.  I have known of cases where persons were considered to be eligible for benefit by one referee but were rejected by another.  Can the Minister say if a Deputy of this House is entitled to be present when a person is interviewed by one of these referees?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not wish to have to depend <Col N="1135" /> on social welfare benefits but were it not for the benefits that are paid to some people in my constituency these people would not be able to survive.  It is disappointing that, having had two Ministers in Dáil Éireann from our constituency, these Ministers did not succeed in creating more employment for the people there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the Minister's brief and I listened this morning to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  My reaction is one of amazement at the complacency of the Government in respect of social welfare. The Parliamentary Secretary said that the Government had nothing to be ashamed of in respect of their record in the field of social welfare. The Minister has told us that he accepts that while things could be better, he thinks everything is going well.  He said:</P>
      <P>When it becomes evident that the community is prepared to pay substantially more, I, as Minister for Social Welfare, will be only too glad to introduce further improvements.</P>
      <P>Does this mean that the Minister considers further improvements to be necessary but because he is either unwilling or unprepared to seek more money, he does not intend trying to improve the benefits under the various schemes?  It has been evident during the past year that the Government have disregarded social welfare recipients. Everybody on this side of the House who has spoken so far has mentioned the dole issue.  While this question may not be of the same dimensions in my county as it is in the west, nevertheless, it had its effects. The Minister has told us that the change in the application of the dole has saved the Exchequer nearly £2½ million but he said that these increases are offset by a reduction in the provision for unemployment assistance.  I take it that this is the saving that was made by the removal from the register of persons&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my interpretation of the Minister's words.  We <Col N="1136" /> all know that unemployment figures have been increasing steadily during the year and when the full figure is known and when there is a return to the register of the people who were removed from it, no doubt, it will be seen that there are more people entitled to assistance now than there were last year.</P>
      <P>One can only deplore the attitude of the Government towards the recipients of social welfare.  The attitude adopted this morning by the Parliamentary Secretary must surely be indicative of the attitude of the Government as a whole.  However, perhaps, the situation is not as bad in the Parliamentary Secretary's constituency as it is in other areas.  For instance, there is a difference of 32 or 33 per cent in the number of medical card holders in my constituency as against the Parliamentary Secretary's.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that the carrying of the dual responsibility for the Departments of Labour and Social Welfare is not only unfair to him but unfair also the Department of Social Welfare.  During the past couple of years he has had to face immense problems in respect of the Department of Labour and no one could blame him for having less time to devote to the problems of social welfare.  The Minister for Lands has expressed his willingness to give up that office and suggested the amalgamation of the Department of Lands and Forestry with Agriculture and Fisheries.  Perhaps if there is a spare Minister about he could be appointed to the Department of Social Welfare.  This is a Department which ranks high among Departments of State.</P>
      <P>There is no information in the Minister's opening statement about social welfare in the event of our entering the EEC.  The social welfare code in the EEC differs very much from our code.  The Minister does not tell us what changes, if any, he proposes to make in order to dovetail our social welfare code with that of the EEC countries.  I am amazed that there is no reference to this by the Minister because we are pursuing entry into the EEC with great vigour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be fair to compare <Col N="1137" /> social welfare benefits in the EEC countries with those obtaining in this country since there is a wide divergence in the standard of living.  There is also a wide divergence in ability to pay for social welfare.  That is why the Minister should give us some information now as to proposed changes in our code should we become members of the EEC.  It is suggested agriculture will benefit to the tune of £30 million when we enter the EEC.  Will there be any funds to improve social welfare benefits?  Our cost of living will inevitably rise sharply when we join.  I am speaking from experience now because I was in two EEC countries in the last month and I know what the cost of living is; it is almost twice as high as it is here.  If we join there will have to be changes made in our social welfare benefits to offset the increased cost of living.  I personally hope we will not join, but I cannot discuss this now. When the Minister comes to reply he might tell us what will happen in our social welfare system when we become members of the EEC.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach suggested to the Minister that the title of the Department should be changed from Social Welfare to Social Security.  I think there are a great many more important things the Minister could do before he engages in that exercise.  Recently we had External Affairs changed to Foreign Affairs.  Social Security might sound a little better but will it make any difference to recipients?  This is just an exercise in semantics.  The real benefit will be in the size of the payments made to those in receipt of social welfare and the Minister could bend his energies in this direction before he engages in name-changing.</P>
    <P>The explanatory booklet is both useful and interesting.  The information in it is up to date and helps in solving problems which constituents bring me. More problems arise under social welfare than under any other State activity. As I say, the booklet is useful and the Department are to be commended on its production.  Examples would have been very useful.  They might add to the cost of the booklet but examples would be a help to ordinary people since they might save a journey of <Col N="1138" /> several miles to the nearest TD to find out what exactly a particular sentence really means or what a constituent must do in order to claim benefit.</P>
    <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with widows particularly those of them who go out to work and who are not always, I think, fairly treated.  Income is lumped together for taxation purposes.  Recently two widows working in a factory some miles from me received a large bill from the Revenue people.  They had neglected to include their widows' pensions as part of their incomes.  The result is they have to work for practically nothing for some weeks in order to pay the back tax.</P>

      <P>I set out in my reply to a question by Deputy O'Hara on 28th October the outcome of the negotiations in so far as the continuation of our scheme of export tax reliefs is concerned.  The position which has been clearly established&mdash;that the export tax reliefs are necessary for our economic and industrial development and that we can continue them&mdash;is based on my intensive discussions with the Community on 19th October, the understandings reached then and the agreement on the text of the proposed Protocol.</P>
      <P>As regards the reference in my statement to the Community on 19th October to commitments in relation to export tax reliefs, the position established is that firms in respect of which commitments had been entered into at the time of the completion by the Commission after accession of its examination of our industrial incentives, will continue to benefit from export tax reliefs for the full period of entitlement under existing legislation.</P>

      <P>This country was represented by an officer of my Department at the 7th regular session of the Assembly of the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation held in London from the 5th to 15th October, 1971.  The main topics considered at the Assembly were&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  amendments to the Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954, which were adopted, as well as a number of recommendations dealing with other measures for preventing or limiting pollution of the sea, which were also adopted;</P>
      <P>(ii)  amendments to the Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, 1960, which were adopted.  The Assembly also reached agreement on a total of 17 other measures aimed at maritime safety;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii)  arrangement of future conferences. These would cover compensation for oil pollution damage, the carriage of nuclear substances, <Col N="1145" /> and the carriage of containers by more than one mode of transport. A conference on Maritime Pollution, to be held in 1973, is intended to prepare an international agreement for placing restraints on contamination of the sea, land and air by ships operating in the maritime environment.</P>
    <P>The countries elected to the Council of IMCO were&mdash;Algeria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, India, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, USSR, United Kingdom and USA.</P>

      <P>The conference referred to in the Deputies' questions was convened by the Nordic countries with a view to adopting an international convention prohibiting dumping in international waters of persistent noxious substances. The conference did not adopt a formal agreement and further information in this regard is awaited.  It would, of course, have been open to this country to consider ratification of any convention adopted by the conference.</P>
      <P>The agenda of the conference related to the work of a number of Departments in this country.  In the case of my Department, the preoccupation of the staff concerned with more urgent matters precluded attendance at the conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> As regards future conferences of this nature, consideration will be given to any invitations to attend.  As the Deputies will note from my reply to Question No. 7, arrangements are being made by the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation to hold an international conference in 1973 on the subject of restraint of pollution of the marine environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme of financial assistance for hotel development which has been operated by Bord Fáilte was designed to ensure an adequate supply of hotel accommodation to meet traffic needs.  This scheme has been suspended since July, 1969, and Bord Fáilte have not been taking on new grant commitments since that date. Bord Fáilte provide advice to intending developers about hotel development but neither my Department nor the board are empowered to restrict the building of hotels in Dublin or elsewhere and developers take their own decisions about their projects.  Any hotel development now in progress had been approved by Bord Fáilte for grant assistance prior to July, 1969, or is proceeding without a grant.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that the developers of approved hotel projects now in progress in Dublin have, generally speaking, proved themselves to be generators of new traffic and that these new hotels are expected to provide further job opportunities for trained catering workers on a permanent basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that the permanent workers employed by Bord na Móna have indicated that they will withdraw from the board's superannuation scheme unless a scheme similar to that available for ESB workers is provided; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. As I indicated in my reply to a question by the Deputy on 5th May, 1971, there is no fundamental difference between the way in which superannuation contributions and pension benefits are calculated for workers employed in the ESB and Bord na Móna. In the case of each body, the relevant legislation provides that the workers and the boards shall pay equal contributions to the superannuation funds. The percentage contribution rates in both bodies are determined actuarially and pension benefits are related to these contribution rates.</P>
      <P>I might add that I had discussions during the summer with the Bord na Móna group of unions about further amendments to the new scheme for regular workers which I approved with effect from 4th June, 1970.  The points raised by the unions are being examined at the moment in consultation with Bord na Móna and the Minister for Finance and I expect that a decision will be reached shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if one of the problems which was the subject of discussion between the board and the union has been the differential in the charges between Bord na Móna and the ESB?  In Bord na Móna workers have to pay superannuation contributions on their earnings which can include seasonal overtime, whereas in the ESB the superannuation contribution is based on the flat wage only.  Similar benefits are available in both bodies but in Bord na Móna the workers must pay considerably <Col N="1149" /> more and this is a grave source of dissatisfaction.  Has that been the subject of consultation?</P>

      <P>I have assumed that the Deputy is referring to persons who contract to supply machinery or materials and that his question does not extend to purchasers of timber.  The Deputy will be aware that timber is purchased in County Donegal forests from time to time by firms from across the Border but the Department would not have information as to the localities from which such firms draw their labour.</P>

    <P>In regard to part (<i>c</i>) of the Deputy's question, programmes of work in the individual forests are at present undergoing review to implement the increase in planting acreage arising from the increased financial allocation for forestry purposes announced last week.  It will be some time before staff quotas are fully revised and revision will of course have to take account also of other changes, upward and downward, in work volume at the various Forests.</P>

Pupils had to try to do their work in a bicycle shed and other out-offices. Does the Minister not appreciate that it is of the greatest importance that this work should be undertaken forthwith? In view of the promises which were made, can the work not be undertaken at an earlier date?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I am sure, we have a very heavy commitment in relation to the building and the reconstruction of schools generally.  I pointed out to him that I hope the work will commence in 1972-73.  The vocational education committee were authorised to proceed with the preparation of documents required for the purpose of inviting tenders for the work subject to their accepting a suggestion made by the Department regarding the layout of the metal-work room.

This proposal was put very sensibly to the Minister by the committee in Ballymun that was set up to obtain their constitutional rights and have their children educated through the Irish language?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the point raised by Deputy FitzGerald. Obviously in this area prior to this the children were being educated through the medium of English and it would be rather difficult to transfer from English to Irish after a certain age, so in my view the proper thing to do was to start with the younger children and develop from there.</P>

I have never heard the theory put forward before that people cannot take up education through a different language after the age of seven.

      <P>At a meeting held in Drumshanbo on September 23rd, 1971, <Col N="1168" /> an officer of my Department explained the position fully to the parents' representatives.  Officers of my Department have also explained the position in detail on various occasions to the chief executive officer and individual members of the County Leitrim Vocational Education Committee.

The Minister is telling the people of Leitrim that they should be able to have the same attendance at a school in a small town like Drumshanbo as a school in an area like Ballymun or some larger town in the country.  The Minister has been asked by the Vocational Education Committee to receive a deputation. He has been asked by the Parents' Association to receive a deputation. But, instead, he sent down a Department official who came, typical civil servant, very well prepared and put his case, but he only told the people things they knew too well already about Carrick-on-Shannon, Manorhamilton and Ballinamore.  What those parents really want is a leaving certificate course for their children despite the fact that there are only 270 pupils attending the school.</P>

I cannot agree that we should <Col N="1170" /> have a situation where, if a person happens to live in a city or a big town, he will do well because he will have the opportunity of availing of the broad range of subjects necessary, but if he happens to live in a small town in rural Ireland he must do with whatever is provided.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the enormous disquiet in the Opposition benches because I am succeeding in doing what they said I could not do. I am providing community schools.  I remember not long ago when a discussion took place here in relation to community schools and I was charged with having secret agreements with His Eminence, Cardinal Conway, in relation to these schools.  I denied this but, of course, my denial was not <Col N="1172" /> accepted by the Opposition.  They assumed that the Cardinal in some way would prevent the religious from having their say.  They went along a certain track because they thought it would be the popular one and, suddenly, the religious made a statement.

I should like to ask the Minister if he is telling the Protestant community that they should regard these as satisfactory schools for their children?  If the Government in Northern Ireland did what they have never attempted to do&mdash;to transform the State schools there into Protestant schools in this way&mdash;would the Minister tell Catholic children that they should go to them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 to 42 together.</P>
      <P>I would direct the attention of Deputies to a general statement which I have made in relation to university fees and which with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to have circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In connection with university fees the Minister for Education feels that he must refer to the mounting costs of higher education in general and university education in particular which are placing an ever-increasing burden on the taxpayer.  While by far the major portion of these costs must continue to be borne by the taxpayer, the Minister considers that the students, who are the persons immediately benefiting from university education, should be called upon to bear a portion of the increases in cost.  At the present time the taxpayer is contributing more than £400 per annum towards the education of every university student.  This is apart altogether from the amounts being paid to holders of grants under the higher education grants scheme. The position is, therefore, that, even with the increase in fees now proposed, the proportion the students would be called upon to pay would be less than one-fifth of the total cost.</P>
      <P>While accordingly the Minister considers that the increase in fees now proposed should operate, he is prepared to meet the case of grant holders by making funds available so that an increase may be made in the value of the grants, which would offset the increase in fees.  Furthermore, in order to obviate any portion of last year's increase in fees other than £10 being passed on to students in the higher fee faculties, the Minister will be prepared to make sums available by way of supplementary grants to the university colleges which will offset any loss incurred by them through not levying the full amount of last year's increase in the case of such students.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that within the last two days <Col N="1182" /> the president and the secretary of University College, Dublin, have said that institution faces imminent closure?  Could I put a straight statistical question to the Minister? In view of the fact that within the last few days his colleague has been able to find a Christmas present of £20 million&mdash;no doubt related to circumstances within his own party and largely addressed to big business&mdash; could he tell us just how many thousand pounds a supplementary grant from his Department would cost to enable this institution to keep going by abating these fees?</P>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, I will read the statement.</P>
      <P>In connection with university fees, the Minister for Education feels that he must refer to the mounting costs of higher education in general and university education in particular which are placing an ever-increasing burden on the taxpayer.  While by far the major portion of these costs must continue to be borne by the taxpayer, the Minister considers that the students, who are the persons immediately benefiting from university education, should be called upon to bear a portion of the increases in cost.  At the present time the taxpayer is contributing more than £400 per annum towards the education of every university student.  This is apart altogether from the amounts being paid to holders of grants under the higher education grants scheme. The position is, therefore, that even with the increase in fees now proposed, the proportion the students would be called upon to pay would be less than one-fifth of the total cost.</P>
      <P>While accordingly the Minister considers that the increase in fees now proposed should operate, he is prepared to meet the case of grant holders by making funds available so that an increase may be made in the value of the grant, which would offset the increase in fees.  Furthermore, in order to obviate any portion of last year's increase in fees other than £10 being passed on to students in the higher faculties, the Minister will be prepared to make sums available by way of supplementary grants to the university colleges which will offset any loss incurred by them through not levying the full amount of last year's increase in the case of such students.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister a question on his reply to Question <Col N="1185" /> No. 40.  Is the Minister aware of the seriousness of the situation in UCD?  Is he aware that there is a real danger of a breakdown in education at UCD and that he and his Department encouraged students to go to UCD by stating that not only would grants be made available to students so that they could have completely free education, but also indicating that other grants would be given to cut down the cost of higher education for these students?  Is he further aware that many children who have the necessary qualifications to go to UCD have not been able to go there this year because of the increase, and that because of the increase next year which the college authorities have already announced the same situation will arise? Is he aware of the seriousness of this which is affecting 8,000 students?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there has been an occupation of UCD and that when I left it several offices were occupied and attempts are being made to disrupt telephonic communications?  Is he aware of the statement of the secretary of the college yesterday that up to last Monday only 10 per cent of the students had sent in their fees, what on both these counts the university is facing an imminent threat of closure, and will he therefore agree to the two steps that would end this deadlock&mdash; first, to agree to extend grants to three-year diploma courses which is what is involved here and which does not involve much cost, and secondly, to agree to discuss with the students the devising and the eventual introduction of a comprehensive grants scheme?  If these two steps were taken the college could be kept open.  The responsibility rests with the Minister to ensure that it does not close.</P>

The second point is in relation to the Deputy's query as to whether we would agree to have discussions in relation to a comprehensive scheme.  You do not have discussions unless you have a reasonable hope of being able to provide the money.  I have pointed out that the minimum amount necessary to cater for what is being demanded by the students at the moment would be £7 million.</P>

I want to ask the Minister, first of all, whether the legislation he speaks of is this Government's legislation, and whether it is not open to him to change that if he thinks it is desirable? Will he take steps to amend that legislation if it is an obstacle to giving grants to senior diploma courses in the university?  On the other point, will he agree that to suggest you do not negotiate with people unless you know in advance you can give the maximum they are looking for, if adopted by employers in this country, would lead to a shut-down of all industry? Does he suggest that where workers ask for a 50 per cent increase in wages you do not talk to them at all, you just refuse to negotiate?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that increases in Civil Service salaries or in unemployment <Col N="1189" /> benefit are of no relevance as far as higher education grants are concerned and, therefore, no purpose would be served by my seeking to give the information sought by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this mean that whereas other groups in the community, and I have mentioned but two, are entitled to increases in earnings at least equal to increases in the cost of living, and in all cases nowadays more, students must make do indefinitely with the same amount of money, no matter how much prices rise and the cost of living goes up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy in regard to Civil Service salaries that increases are very often given not only on the basis of increases in the cost of living but also to raise the general standard.  This is common in relation to increases in salaries generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister perhaps misunderstood the purport of my question.  I merely took two examples of wages and salaries, on the one hand, and social benefits, on the other, to point out, what the Minister must know, that these both rise by more than the cost of living and that it is accepted that as national output increases the benefits are shared.  What I am asking the Minister is why one group of social welfare beneficiaries only, that is, those who benefit from transfer payments in order to enable them to go to the university, should be discriminated against and held at a constant figure regardless of the cost of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take questions Nos. 49 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>It will be recalled that, in reply to questions in this House following the publication of the governing body's decision on 1st July, 1970, I undertook to make known to the college authorities the concern of Deputies and my own concern in the matter.  This I did by way of correspondence and through a meeting with representatives of the college during the course of the past year.  I expressed disappointment that facilities should be curtailed for students who would benefit from attendance at university courses leading to degrees in arts and who for one reason or another did not have the opportunity of attending such courses as day students.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding my representations the governing body decided to adhere to its original decision.  It will be appreciated that there is no further action which I can usefully take in the matter since, under the provisions of their Charter, the college is enabled, without reference to me, to determine what courses it shall provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister if he is aware that in view of the recent increase in fees at university college an increasing number of intending students will not be able to take their places there and there will be a far greater demand among the leaving certificate group to attend night classes at UCD?  Could he not use his office in some way, or the money which these people are paying in tax, to enable <Col N="1194" /> them to go to university at night, to provide night classes for them where they can get higher education, which they want?  I think this is a disgrace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also point out to the Deputy that in information with which I was supplied in October, 465 had applied to take the evening art courses and there were 600 places. I am not making any case out of that because I know that if you took each year separately it would be a different matter.  Nevertheless, that was the figure that was given to me some time ago.</P>

      <P>Surely the function of Question Time is to compel Ministers to answer to Parliament for decisions which they take or which are taken under their responsibility?  They have a duty to answer questions in relation to actions they have taken.  That duty is one that I have not heard challenged before.  If this body are transferred subsequently to a board, it would not be proper that questions would be directed regarding their day-to-day activities but for as long as these people are under the control of the Minister, he has an obligation to answer questions concerning them.  Otherwise he is making a farce of Parliament.  Therefore, will he reconsider his decision and answer a question which he has a parliamentary and democratic obligation to answer?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the situation at University College, Dublin, the matter of the fees to be required of students is one for the governing body of that institution. The Deputy will, no doubt, have read my statement which was published in the daily press of 23rd October, 1971, and in which I indicated that the Government were prepared <Col N="1201" /> to make additional funds available so as to make special provision in relation to fee increases in the case of grant holders and students in the higher fee faculties.  The Government do not feel that the very heavy burden which grants to the university colleges are placing on the taxpayers should be further increased.  This is a fact which the students who are benefiting directly from university education must accept as they must accept also that nothing is to be gained by disrupting the functioning of University College, Dublin.

I am also aware of the value of the breed to the cattle industry.</P>
      <P>In an effort to halt the decline my Department introduced a special scheme last year for the improvement of Shorthorn cattle.  Under this scheme selected cows or heifers, together with their approved progeny by designated bulls, are eligible for entry in Coates's Herd Book.  In addition, the progeny, male and female, are eligible for a headage grant of £10 at the yearling stage and a further grant of £10 is payable at the three-year old stage in respect of the female progeny retained for breeding.</P>

      <P>The brucellosis eradication scheme was extended on 1st March, 1971 to the portion of County Offaly north and west of the River Brosna and this part of the county should be declared free of the disease within the next few years.  The scheme will be further extended as soon as resources and the progress in the area at present under clearance permit but I do not anticipate that any further areas can be taken on before the end of 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The warble fly eradication scheme which commenced on 15th August last is progressing very satisfactorily and will, I am confident, go a long <Col N="1210" /> way towards the elimination of the pest throughout the country.

In addition, the Treaty states that the <Col N="1215" /> following types of aids will be allowable, depending on the circumstances of each case: aid to promote the economic development of underdeveloped regions; aid intended to promote an important project of common European interest; aid intended to facilitate the development of certain activities of other economic regions; any other type of aid authorised by the Council of Ministers.  This is a matter which has not been determined yet but which seems to us to give us scope for negotiation in that in our particular position it is possible to make a case for discussion.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will grant a licence under section 171 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, to Mayo County Council so that they can proceed with the sewerage scheme at the Quay, Ballina.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to issue such a licence to the Mayo County Council provided that I can be satisfied that the location of the outfall pipe from the scheme would not be such as would endanger fish life in any way or injure fish in their value as human food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that planning permission for 200 new houses has been given in Ballina in the last four or five years and that all the sewage from these houses goes into the River Moy?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary prepared to give a licence to the people of the Quay who have been looking for sewerage facilities for 20 years?  Mayo County Council have got sanction. They are ready to go ahead, but future progress depends on the results of the application to the Parliamentary Secretary for a licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will state in respect of the past five years for the areas of Wexford, Kinsale, Courtmacsherry, Clonakilty, Union Hall, Castletownshend, Baltimore, Schull and Bantry, the landing figures and values of each of the following species of shellfish: mussels, oysters, crabs, lobsters, crawfish, periwinkles and clams; what steps are being taken to increase the productivity of such shellfish areas; and if there is any evidence of pollution in such areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>As to the second part of the question, the position is that the scientific staff of the Fisheries Division of my Department is continuously engaged in research programmes designed to assist in the development and expansion of our sea fisheries.  Because of its economic and social importance, particular emphasis is placed on research work relating to shellfisheries where such exist or show any potential along any part of the coastline.  The areas mentioned by the Deputy are, of course, included in this work and the results of the research and investigations are published by my Department in its Annual Report on Sea and Inland Fisheries, in the Sea Fisheries Bulletins, in the Irish Fisheries Investigations Series B (Marine) and in numerous Fishery Leaflets which are widely circulated amongst fishermen and fishermen's organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the third part of the question, my function in regard to the problem of water pollution relates only to the prohibition contained in the Fisheries Acts, 1959 and 1962, on the discharge into any waters of deleterious matter liable to render the water <Col N="1217" /> poisonous or injurious to fish, to spawning grounds or to the food of fish.  Pollution of this kind has been detected from time to time in some estuaries of rivers along the south-east and south coasts and arrangements <Col N="1218" /> were initiated to rectify the position but no evidence was found of pollution in the open sea.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he has received a report from the Departmental officials on the survey of these areas?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of the big potential of the shellfish industry, especially if we enter the Common Market?  What is he doing <Col N="1219" /> to develop the shellfish industry in this area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been substantial developments with regard to the shellfish industry in recent years. We are continuing to try to bring about improvements in the production in various spheres and we have been successful in this work.  We are continuing to try to bring about improvements in production in various ways and I think we are succeeding.</P>

      <P>The reason I put down Wexford in this question was to make the Parliamentary Secretary aware that much has been done at Wexford, and as a result there has been a big increase in the fishing there, but nothing has been done along the coast from Kinsale to Castletownbere where there is a huge potential.  Surely it is time to have something done there?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons for the present increase in unemployment are complex and diverse.  In the case of any particular industry or firm a combination of factors is usually involved and the unemployment is seldom attributable to any single factor.  The factors influencing the situation include a slowing down of economic activity in many countries, resulting in difficulties for some of our exporters in markets abroad; cost inflation; cyclical depression in certain industries, notably in some sectors of the textile industry; and product obsolescence and technological changes leading to competition from alternative products.  The movement towards freer trade is, of course, also a factor although often not the only one and in some cases not a factor at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assistance to established industry to maintain its position, and to redevelop, is available in the form of modernisation and re-equipment grants and technical assistance grants.  My Department and the Industrial Development Authority are in close touch with industry and in cases where difficulties <Col N="1225" /> arise arrangements are made to bring into play the whole range of services provided by the state Agencies, including such bodies as the Industrial Credit Company, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the Irish National Productivity Committee. This kind of assistance can be effective in many cases but it must be recognised that some firms, for various reasons, are not viable and in such cases efforts can only be made to provide alternative employment.</P>
    <P>The Government is naturally concerned to ensure that all measures possible are taken to deal with the present position.  The Deputy will be aware that the Taoiseach and other Ministers concerned have discussed the problems involved with representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on Monday last.  Suggestions made at that meeting are at present being examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, when a company is in difficulty and goes to the Industrial Development Authority and succeeds in making a case for a grant, if the discussions last several months during which time the industry has great difficulty in carrying on, and if it subsequently goes to the Industrial Credit Corporation for a loan, it is a bit much to be told that they feel the company is not viable and not eligible for any assistance even though the IDA, knowing that a loan was to be applied for, agreed to give a grant for the purpose of trying to keep the company in existence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>A re-equipment or modernisation grant must be provided by the IDA under existing regulations. The Industrial Credit Corporation may take the view that the company is not viable.  One of the reasons that has emerged in relation to a number of the industries that have failed is the lack of proper management, or management not being able to adapt itself to modern-day conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, if such an application is made to the Industrial Credit Corporation, their investigation should run side by side with the investigation by the Industrial Development Authority, and that there should not be a further lengthy inquiry?  There is no point in the IDA agreeing to a grant if the Industrial Credit Corporation take the view that there is no question of giving a loan even though it is agreed that both loan and grant are required.</P>

      <P>The Government provide generous incentives designed to attract new industries and to strengthen existing industries.  I understand from the Industrial Development Authority that there are three new factories and two expansions of existing undertakings under construction in the county which will, it is estimated, employ 290 workers, mostly male, at full production and that the authority have also approved grant assistance for five other new industrial projects in the county, involving an employment potential of about 670 workers.  In addition, two advance factories are planned for County Cork and the authority have under consideration 24 proposals under the small industries programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the fact that over two years have elapsed since the Commission on Motor Insurance was set up, its full report will be published before January next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee of Inquiry into the Insurance Industry was set up a little over one year ago, not two as the Deputy understands.  I am aware that the committee is pressing on urgently with its examination of motor insurance and that considerable progress has been made.  I am not in a position to state when precisely this complex operation will be completed, but I am hopeful that I will have received the report by January.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that insurance companies are fleecing car owners at present and that increases of 300, 400 and in some cases 500 per cent have been demanded? Does the Minister intend to take any action in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not seem to be appropriate to Question No. 102.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because they are all waiting for the result of the inquiry and the Minister seems to be standing idly by while insurance premiums are being increased.  Does he intend to do anything about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>On the next question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>103.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what premium <Col N="1238" /> scale or specific basis was used when authorising increased premiums for motor vehicle insurance since 1967; if he is aware that many insurance firms ignored the authorised increases by doubling the percentage increases and cutting agents' commission by 50 per cent; and if he will explain why he did not take steps to ensure that authorised increases only were charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The increases which were sanctioned in motor insurance rates as from 1st January, 1969, and 1st June, 1970, were affected by means of the application of a specified percentage increase to existing basic rates.</P>
      <P>I am aware, however, that many companies are applying loadings to premium rates for certain categories of risks in which claims experience has been particularly bad.  I must accept the right of insurance companies to apply reasonable additional loadings in cases where claims experience has shown this to be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a number of previous replies, I have indicated the steps which I have taken in cases where it appeared that a breach of my arrangements with the companies might have occurred.  I have had a large number of individual cases taken up with insurers.  In some cases reductions were secured following intervention by my Department; in other cases the companies were in a position to show that increased rates were justified by claims experience or undesirable features of the risk.  I must say, however, that in several cases I was not satisfied that the actual increases proposed were justified, but the companies concerned were not prepared, in the absence of statutory control, <Col N="1239" /> to reduce their charges.  I am taking this matter up with representatives of the companies.</P>
    <P>The amount of commission paid by insurance companies to brokers is a matter for settlement between the brokers and the companies.  The reduction in commission referred to did not alter the basic premium rates.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, a comprehensive examination of motor insurance is at present being carried out by the Insurance Industry Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister may think it reasonable for these companies to increase premiums in certain cases, does he say that increases of 300, 400 and, in one case I know of, of 500 per cent are reasonable?  In view of the fact that he has stated that he is not satisfied with the attitude of some companies in not reducing them without statutory control, will he now introduce the statutory control, and do so immediately, to compel them to give reasonable coverage to motorists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past 12 months since I set up this Committee, I have conveyed on all occasions, when questioned in this House, that I am not happy with the motor insurance industry as a whole.  I am also reasonably satisfied that it is, as it at present stands, a not too remunerative industry as such.  As I have said, I am not satisfied in relation to the replies I have had from insurance companies. However, at this stage, with the impending early report which I expect to have, as I said in reply to the earlier question, by January at latest, I would be hoping that the advice received from the committee might help me to deal comprehensively with this problem and I am not anxious at this stage to take interim measures to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to increases of 400 and 500 per cent.  There are additional loadings and the main one I come up against is the loading which goes on by reason of the age of a car. It may be additional loading in so far as a driver wants a young son or daughter covered and these have been established to be additional risks.  Maybe <Col N="1240" /> it is not always the young people, but to be practical about this, I have found even myself in driving around St. Stephen's Green when trying to get home at 10.30 at night the dicing that goes on in that circle.  Those are factors which have to be carried by insurance companies and I am satisfied from the knowledge I have of the situation at present that one of my main responsibilities is to see that when there are claims, the insurance company will be able to carry the claim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the insurance companies are jumping the gun in anticipation of his legislation and trying to get in before it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>It is plain to be seen that some are.  Does he not agree that it is completely wrong to take into consideration the age of a car?  I know cars ten years old which have not done 20,000 miles and cars six months old which have done 30,000 and 40,000 miles and are wrecked. Surely it is the state of the car, whether it is in good mechanical repair or not, that should be taken into consideration. If you have an old car, they load you completely&mdash;I agree with what the Minister said about young people driving cars&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have endeavoured to make arrangements with the insurance company in relation to this loading on the basis of the age of the car and I have made an arrangement whereby the company have agreed to reduce the loading&mdash;there was a case where there was a 75 per cent age load on vehicles&mdash;to 50 per cent subject to a satisfactory engineer's report that the vehicle is in good order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not generally agreed that the business of insurance is particularly lucrative, if one is to go on the enormous buildings which they have continued to provide all over the city and country, and is it not an unusual ambition on the part of an enterprise to wish to make a profit on every sector of their undertakings? Surely it should be possible for the <Col N="1241" /> insurance people to carry their losses on the motor side out of the enormous profits which they make on the other side of their business&mdash;accidents and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is enormous profit to be made on fire&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Accident insurance is separate and conducted by separate insurance companies from life insurance. I am hoping that the committee of inquiry will come up with possibly revolutionary ideas in this regard.  I am rather hopeful they will.</P>

Details have already been announced of the interim arrangements agreed in the course of the discussions to prevent injury to Irish industry pending the completion of the negotiations. These provided for a standstill from the 1st July, 1971, in the levels of duty on a number of products and, in certain other cases, a smaller reduction in the rates of duty than was required under the agreement.</P>

      <P>I should like to clear this with the Deputy.  I think it was Deputy Tully who spoke about the car stickers having been made outside the country.  Quite honestly I was shocked to learn that car stickers which had been purchased by the NDA were printed in Holland.  I checked this out and the position was that the order was placed with an Irish printing firm for a particular type of long life sticker and the Irish firm came up with those.  I was not consulted but the decision the NDA had to make was whether to scrap all those or to use them.  They used them.  In the light of the complaints that have come up, it might have been as well if they had scrapped them.</P>

I made inquiries from the Garda some time ago as to the desirability or otherwise of making an order under section 2 and at that time the Garda were of the opinion that it was not necessary to make such an order.  However, in the light of certain recent developments I asked the Garda about two or three weeks ago for their opinion as to whether or not an order should now be made.  I have not heard from them as yet but if they are of the opinion that it would be beneficial to make an order under section 2 I shall make it as soon as I hear from them.</P>

In a case in Waterford recently, of which the Minister is aware, it became apparent that the purpose of the collection, an allegedly charitable collection, was open to very considerable question by the garda superintendent and the licence was rightly refused by him and by the district justice.</P>

Political considerations in appointments are bad enough at other levels but in the judiciary it is unfortunate and without reflecting on the decisions made by judges, which have been notably independent of political considerations, the system of appointment does give rise to public concern and is <Col N="1253" /> something that we should all agree now to change in our mutual interests and in the interests of the country.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the courts to impose penalties.  In these matters the maximum penalty is not often imposed.  The most important sanction the courts have on conviction for an offence of this nature is the power to endorse a licence.

It is being said throughout the country at the present time; it was even said in the Mansion House, which was let to an illegal organisation by an official of the corporation.  Surely the Minister realises that, unless something is done, there will be a Fidel Castro-like takeover in this country in a short time.  Does the Minister intend to do anything about it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 to 138 together.</P>
      <P>The immediate occasion of the recent complaints was a decision to discharge three members of the force who were found asleep on protection duty and, in respect of a fourth, to hold a sworn inquiry which, if the facts are established, would naturally be likely to lead to a similar decision. Of the first three I mentioned, one appealed to the Commissioner, before the dismissal notice expired, for a review of the decision.  The Commissioner thereupon suspended the dismissal notice to enable him to review the matter in the light of the case put forward by the member.  He has since completed his review and has allowed the appeal.  That member is therefore being retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another one of the three, a former recruit-Garda, has now applied for reinstatement on compassionate grounds, as has also another former recruit-Garda who was discharged in similar circumstances over a year ago.  The Commissioner has agreed with the Representative Body to consider their applications sympathetically on the clear understanding that he is doing so only on compassionate grounds and <Col N="1263" /> that his right to take similar disciplinary action if there is any recurrence is not being called in question.  The other one of the three members recently discharged did not ask for a review of the decision but has taken legal proceedings in relation to it.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Commissioner that he had inquiries made as to how these decisions compare with the practice in those commercial firms generally referred to as security firms and, in every single case, the answer was that it is the established and accepted rule in those firms that, if a person on protection duty were found asleep or missing from his post, he would immediately be dismissed.  I am confident that the great majority of the gardaí themselves recognise more clearly than anybody else that neither the public interest nor the standing of the force in the community would be served by a policy which accepted from members of the force a lower standard of responsibility than obtains in commercial firms and, quite frankly, I think that the complaints of harshness that were made in this regard do less than justice to the reputation and traditions of the force and to the standards which it maintains.</P>
    <P>It is only right that, as has actually happened on this occasion, the rules should be flexible enough to allow leniency to be shown where there are special reasons but, as a norm, it is necessary that everybody should understand that sleeping on protection duty &mdash;that is, duty at buildings or installations which the Garda themselves have decided are high on any list of potential targets&mdash;is so serious that nothing short of immediate dismissal can be expected if it should occur again in future.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt, however, that this question of dismissals was not the real or at all events the major cause of recent complaints, as indeed is clearly shown by the fact that a similar decision in July, 1970, did not give rise to any complaint.  It is therefore necessary to look further.</P>
    <P>There have been newspaper reports of allegations of delay in taking action on foot of the Conroy Report and an <Col N="1264" /> impression is given that nothing at all had been done.  The fact is that most of the recommendations have long since been implemented in full.  This applies in particular to the key recommendations on pay, reduced hours of work, payment for overtime where time-off in lieu is not allowed, new rent allowances and new night duty allowances.  The standard working week had been at least 48 hours.  It has been reduced to 42, a reduction of at least 12½ per cent.  At the same time, pay was increased by approximately 13 per cent&mdash;that is to say, an increase of 13 per cent in pay was given for the shorter working week.  The pay increases were of course additional to the increases given as part of the various national pay-rounds.  I do not for a moment suggest that these substantial benefits were not deserved&mdash;I am only recording the fact that they have been given and that the recommendations about them in the Conroy Report have been implemented in full. The Representative Bodies have been accorded the right to specify the order of priority in which they want to discuss the recommendations that have not been implemented.</P>
    <P>I must make it quite clear, however, that there is not, and obviously cannot be, an advance commitment to implement each and every one of the other recommendations of this commission. As I have said, most of them are already implemented but the question of the implementation of the remainder must be the subject of detailed discussion and negotiation.  For example, to take one recommendation that has been mentioned publicly in recent times, I would regard it as a grave dereliction of duty on my part&mdash;and I say this as much in the interests of the Garda themselves as in the public interest&mdash;if I were to set up another inquiry of the kind suggested in the Conroy Report without a full analysis being made as to what exactly it would be expected to do that cannot be done more efficiently and more quickly by other means.</P>
    <P>A report of such an inquiry by outside civilian personnel, if it were to be based on an adequate investigation, could take years to produce.  What is <Col N="1265" /> to happen in the meantime?  I, for my part, have every intention of pursuing a policy of maintaining constant progress in dealing with Garda problems. In fact several weeks before the question of an inquiry by some outside group was raised in any public way, I had myself taken and put into effect a decision which reflected my belief that there are&mdash;as there inevitably must be&mdash;a number of matters concerning the organisation of the force, including personnel policies, selection methods for promotion and so on, which at least need looking at and some of which I think certainly need to be changed.</P>
    <P>I therefore, with the full support and co-operation of the Commissioner, set up a special committee consisting of senior officers of my Department and of the Garda Síochána to supervise and direct the operation of the research and planning unit, and, in particular, to fix the order of priority to be given to various projects; to identify problems as they arise and to take steps to deal with them; to review progress at regular intervals and to ensure that there will be an effective implementation of decisions.  In all these matters the intention is that the committee will invite views and recommendations from the Representative Bodies.</P>
    <P>This committee has already recommended that priority should be given by the research and planning unit to the following matters: manpower utilisation, training, recruitment, promotion, equipment and clerical procedures. Officers of the unit are being assigned to each of these projects.  In addition, the existing scheme of joint action by the unit and by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for the rapid expansion of the communications network is to be intensified.  It is not to be expected that any of these projects will bear fruit overnight but in my view they should produce results more quickly and in a form more readily acceptable to the force than recommendations from any outside group, partly because the system adopted is such as to facilitate continuing consultation with the elected representatives of the members of the force up and down the country.  To my mind, this is a practical workmanlike <Col N="1266" /> scheme that will produce results.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question of alleged unrest, I have been assured by the Commissioner that he has had full and careful inquiries made both in Dublin and throughout the country and that he is satisfied that, while there are some feelings of grievance in regard to certain aspects of the present situation, allegations of widespread, serious unrest are unjustified.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I wish to refer specifically to Questions Nos. 134 and 135 which relate to a statement recently issued by the Dublin metropolitan area committee representing members of garda rank.  The position in fact is that the area committee issued two statements, the second of which made it quite clear that publicly-made suggestions that the first statement had alleged or implied that there had been political interference in the making of certain arrests were without foundation.  I am naturally very glad that the area committee have put an end to that particular type of speculation.</P>
    <P>It remains true that both their statements were strongly critical of officers of the force, as well as of the Government, and that, in addition, the courts came in for strong criticism especially in relation to matters such as bail and apparently lenient sentences.  Whilst I cannot but deprecate very strongly some of the sentiments expressed, and even more so the manner of their expression, and while I am quite satisfied the charges made were for the most part unsustainable, in the sense at least of being very greatly exaggerated, I think it would be wrong for me not to acknowledge and make allowances for the strain under which many members of the force have been working since they have had to deal with what appears to be an organised campaign of serious crime backed by actual or threatened violence.  I also acknowledge the goodwill shown by the Representative Body for Gardaí in their statement of Wednesday, 3rd November, which, while it did not go as far as I would have liked in various respects, did go a long way towards correcting wrong impressions <Col N="1267" /> that had been given elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, I do not propose either to embark on a detailed refutation of what was said in the statements of the Dublin area committee or to take the risk of appearing to take part in a campaign of recrimination with any section of the force, the overwhelming majority of whose members are well known to be loyal and devoted in the discharge of their duties, some of them indeed risking their lives in the course of their work, and I propose therefore to confine myself to stating the position as I see it.</P>
    <P>There is, as is perhaps inevitable in any organisation as large as the Garda Síochána, a very small minority of malcontents.  Apart from that, however, there is, I believe, a genuine feeling of discontent which is related to the present disciplinary regulations.  A new set of disciplinary regulations has been prepared with the assistance of delegates from the three Representative Bodies and the finishing touches are now being put on the text which I expect can be available to the force inside a fortnight.  These regulations will remove a number of acknowledged irritants from the regulations and I am confident that they will in all respects both be, and be seen to be, fair.  At the same time, in view of the extent of the powers and functions of the Garda Síochána, I would like the House and the public to know that this in no way implies that there is any intention&mdash;or any wish on the part of the force itself &mdash;that the force should either suddenly or gradually become any less a disciplined force than it has been.  On the contrary, the introduction of a new set of regulations that can be seen to be fair should boost morale and encourage the maintenance of discipline.</P>
    <P>There is one other problem and it concerns overtime.  I have stated earlier that the recommendation of the Conroy Commission on overtime has long since been implemented.  That recommendation was that, where overtime has to be worked, it should be compensated for by time off.  It is only where this cannot be done within three months that the question of payment for overtime arises.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1268" /> There are two aspects of the problem. The first arose from the fact that the recommendation was put into effect very quickly and at the same time as a substantially reduced working week was introduced.  In that situation substantial teething troubles were inevitable and it is accepted that in some cases, there were undue delays in payment. These difficulties have by now been very largely if not entirely solved. The second and more intractable problem concerns the circumstances in which overtime is authorised.  Very large differences became apparent between some Garda districts and others as regards the amount of overtime that was being worked and later claimed for because it was not being compensated for by time off.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, members are authorised to undertake overtime on their own initiative where an unforeseen situation arises in which their presence is needed and in some districts instances came to light where members claimed for overtime done on their own initiative in connection with duties that were of no special importance and that were known about for weeks in advance.  The resulting major differences between the take-home pay of members in different districts became a serious bone of contention within the force.  It also became clear that a serious temptation was being placed the way of some members to undertake and subsequently claim payment for overtime in circumstances which I shall content myself to describe as questionable.</P>
    <P>Finally, a serious problem of equity as between men, NCOs and officers was developing.  Some members were, over long periods, earning more money than members of higher ranks who were working equal or longer hours, and already cases have arisen where members of the force whom the Garda authorities would have wished to promote have declined to go forward for promotion because it would, in practice, mean a reduction in income.</P>
    <P>It is the considered view of the Garda authorities that excessive overtime, especially when it is, as it must be, very uneven in its incidence, is a menace to good morale in the force <Col N="1269" /> and that it must be got rid of with all possible speed.  Accordingly, some while back, a chief superintendent was specially allocated the task of investigating the matter and introducing consistency and equity into the operation of the system.  His report is now being implemented.</P>
    <P>The policy is to aim for a gradual, but not too gradual, elimination of arrangements under which some members have come to expect and to depend on paid overtime as a norm. The norm, as envisaged by the Conroy Commission, is that if and where overtime is necessary, it should be compensated for by time off.  If this cannot be achieved with the present strength of the force, we will have to face the need to increase the present strength.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I would say this.  The objections being raised to the elimination of excessive overtime&mdash;understandable though they be, because nobody likes to see a source of additional income eliminated&mdash;are not justifiable and, in the public interest and the longterm interest of the force itself, these objections must be disregarded.  Apart from that, I can see nothing that is arising at the moment or that is likely to arise in the near future that cannot be the subject of detailed and fruitful discussion.  And, in this context, I am deliberately using the word &ldquo;discussion&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo; for very often it is not really a question of the staff representatives wanting one thing and the official representatives another but of different ideas as to the best means of achieving objectives to which both sides fully subscribe.  My policy is to encourage, at all times, detailed and continuing private discussion in all these matters.  Despite the recent incidents, I am satisfied that both the elected representatives of the members and the vast majority of the members themselves are of the same opinion and, with the introduction in the next couple of weeks of the new disciplinary regulations, I believe that the outlook for the future is more than just hopeful.  It is, I believe, very good indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I, first of all, thank the Minister for his very comprehensive reply to the ten questions? I should like to ask him one three-part question.  In relation to the disciplinary procedure and the analogy drawn between the Garda and private companies, would the Minister not agree that it is entirely inappropriate that any such analogy should be made? Secondly, would he agree that notwith-standing the setting up of the research unit, which we welcome and which I understand is welcomed generally, there is still a major case to be made in areas not covered by the Conroy Commission's terms of reference and strongly requested as a top priority by the Garda Representative Body, namely the setting up of a tribunal to inquire into the role and personnel of the force?  Would he not agree that that should still be done, even by out-siders as the Minister chooses to call them?  Would he not also agree that the language used by him of classifying some members of the Garda as a small minority of malcontents was rather inappropriate?  Does he not agree that the frustration and the serious concern felt by members of the Garda do not come simply from a small minority of <Col N="1271" /> malcontents but that it is fairly widespread and indeed that the disciplinary procedure to which he has referred is not a question of irritants&mdash;that there have been major areas of total dispute in regard to the feudal system of discipline? Therefore, it is not just a question of the removal of irritants. Can the Minister comment on these matters?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt pretty fully with each of the points raised by Deputy Desmond.  As far as comparisons with outside bodies on security matters are concerned, I have already dealt with that in reply to Deputy Byrne's supplementary.  However, I would say that the comparison is valid and I would imagine the gardaí themselves would expect a higher standard from members of a disciplined force like the Garda Síochána than one might get from time to time in a purely commercial firm.  The gardaí are there as representatives of the people and I do not see at all that there was any error on the Commissioner's part in making this comparison or in making these inquiries.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second point raised by Deputy Desmond, there has not been by any means any universal request for a particular type of inquiry of the kind referred to at the end of the Conroy Report, one of the reasons for that is that the suggestion made by Conroy is extremely vague, to put it mildly, and neither I nor the Garda would wish to become involved in an inquiry of this kind unless the scope of it was very precisely set out.  The gardaí would have to consider whether in certain respects the recommendation that would be made by such an inquiry would be in what they would consider their own best interests.  I forget the Deputy's third point.</P>

I say there is and there has been political interference by Fianna Fáil Ministers, TDs, county councillors, and threats to gardaí.  There have been political promotions by men who are not fit to be chief superintendents today.  Will the Minister inform this House that from now on the Garda will be allowed to honour the oath they have taken, that there will be no more political interference allowed by any politician and that the Garda will be promoted not on their political affiliations but on efficiency and merit?  As regards the statement that was issued today, would the Minister not agree that the statement issued by the Garda a month ago was a truthful statement, that it had to be withdrawn due to political pressure from senior officers of the Garda Síochána who are in positions today to which they were appointed because of their political affiliations. Those people got them to withdraw the statement in order to safeguard their own positions and to try to get promotion for themselves in the future.</P>

      <P>On the question of unrest in the Garda Síochána would the Minister explain the strange anomaly that, in contrast to the practice in the law enforcement agency of the gardaí, the courts, the whole process of prosecution, defence, right of appeal to higher courts and so on, in the Garda there is a completely different approach to the whole enforcement or exhibition of justice, in which there are summary charge and conviction.  I would thus cite the Minister's own reply when he states that there were special reasons&mdash; and I would ask him if he would tell us what the special reasons are&mdash;in the sleep-on-duty charge.  If these were good and valid reasons which allowed the reversal of the decision, does it not appear that an injustice was prepetrated in the first instance?  Is it not a fact that the reversal of the decision took place only after this very disturbing protest by the gardaí, when the process of trial found that there apparently were special reasons, which the Minister says are valid and good, and <Col N="1275" /> that this should never have happened at all?</P>

      <P>The case in which the appeal was lodged and in which the Commissioner allowed the appeal against dismissal is the only one of which I am familiar with the details, because, of course, all these cases are ones for the Commissioner himself rather than for me.  However, in that particular case when the member himself appealed my recollection is that he produced medical evidence to the fact that he was suffering from a particular ailment.  That evidence had not been produced by him or offered by him at any previous time when he was asked for his observations on the matters that were under investigation. As far as I know, the matter which swayed the Commissioner was the existence of the medical evidence of a particular ailment from which the man was suffering at the time and which he was satisfied would have contributed to what had happened.</P>

      <P>On the question of overtime, would the Minister agree that a major irritant, and a unique practice in these islands&mdash;particularly now that the change in the Special Branch payments of overtime is likely to become general, I would hope&mdash;is the system of giving time off and payment perhaps three or four months after sanction? Would the Minister not agree that the overtime, if sanctioned, should be paid for as quickly as possible, and that the present situation is absolutely farcical?</P>

      <P>The present system is precisely what Conroy recommended. Perhaps an error that was made &mdash;and I can say this with the wisdom of hindsight and it is easy to say it&mdash;was that, having regard to the problems that were encountered, we implemented the system too quickly. If we had taken somewhat longer to implement it we could have worked out the procedures better, and the cause for complaint that did arise would not <Col N="1276" /> have arisen.  It is because we implemented Conroy's recommendation precisely as he made it and that we recommended it at the earliest possible date without working out the details of it, as one normally would in a case like this, that these problems have arisen but as I informed the House in my main reply, a chief superintendent has been spending some months looking into the inequities of the matter.

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the reason for so many bank robberies is because manpower in the Garda force has been allowed to decrease during the past few years and also that the gardai have equipment that is neither suitable nor adequate?  The cars which gardai in some areas must use are a disgrace. Also, would the Minister not agree, following three robberies, that within the past few months Garda cars broke down while gardaí were trying to apprehend the culprits?  The majority of Garda cars are more often in the garage than anywhere else.</P>

      <P>It is worth bearing in mind that the bulk of the overall increase is due to increases in a few particular types of crime.  Burglaries increased by 139, housebreakings by 1,510, larcenies from unattended vehicles by 1,853 and larcenies, not otherwise defined, of property of less than £50 in value by 703.

I have arranged for the recruitment of an extra 400 gardaí over and above the replacement of normal wastage, 200 of them this year and the balance next year. Some of this year's 200 have already <Col N="1286" /> completed their training and are on duty.  All of the rest of them are due to have completed their training by January.  Female clerical assistants are being recruited in order to relieve gardaí of routine office work and to enable them to concentrate on their primary task of preventing and detecting crime.  Over 60 have already taken up duty and the immediate target is the recruitment of 150.  The employment of traffic wardens to deal with parking restrictions is being extended and this also releases gardaí for other work. The garda transport fleet is being increased steadily and the estimate for the purchase of vehicles in the present year is £221,000, as compared with the provision of £116,500 last year.  A new garda communications system is being planned for Dublin as is a national radio network and these are being treated as matters of great urgency.</P>
    <P>The gardaí are utilising their resources in an increasingly flexible manner.  The Garda Research and Planning Unit is set up in order to ensure that there will be an active continuing review designed to secure the most efficient use of personnel and equipment.  In general the measures adopted must remain confidential, but I might instance the setting up of a garda task force in Dublin consisting of a superintendent and 26 other members, which has already proved to be very successful.  It is hoped to have similar units in some other areas in due course.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask for the help of the general public in making things harder for the criminal.  Crimes against property are the most frequent ones and a greater degree of care on the part of property owners would, I have no doubt, be reflected in a smaller incidence of larcenies and housebreakings. It is quite clear, for example, that to leave property exposed to view in an unattended vehicle is to issue an open invitation to the sneak thief and this is underlined by the fact that 18 per cent of all the indictable offences committed last year were larcenies from unattended vehicles.</P>

      <P>I agree that the present accommodation in the radio communications control centre in Dublin is very bad.  Planning by the Board of Works is going ahead as quickly as possible but, when I discovered it would certainly be over a year before the accommodation would be ready, I gave instructions that some type of prefabricated buildings should be used until such time as the permanent buildings are ready.  I was informed only quite recently that it was impossible to put that instruction into effect because it is impossible to operate this system from a pre-fabricated building.  The new equipment is too big for any sort of reasonable prefabricated building which one could get.  In any event, the value of it and the security aspect of it are such that it was felt, on reflection, by the Commissioner that it would be unwise, even if we could get a prefabricated building which would take it, to put it into such a building.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice (a) the number of patrol cars available to the Garda Síochána in Cork city, (b) the year of manufacture of these cars, (c) the mileage of each and (d) how often in the last twelve months they were not available because they had broken down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are seven Garda cars in Cork city, two of which are full-time patrol cars and all of which are radio equipped.  Of the seven cars, three are new and were allocated to Cork within the past two months, three others were manufactured in 1970 and the remaining one in 1969.  The 1969 car and the two 1970 cars, with the highest mileages, are due for replacement within the next two months when new cars at present on order are delivered.  At that stage also an additional patrol car will be allocated to Cork city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it would be appropriate to give information about the mileages of cars at a particular centre at a particular point of time or about <Col N="1289" /> the frequency of breakdowns over a particular period as statistics of this kind, unless accompanied by extensive supplementary materials, would be highly misleading, as an indication of the extent to which Garda patrols are carried out.  The mileages vary according as replacement cars are provided and, because breakdowns can cause a car to be out of service for as little as an hour or as much as a fortnight, figures of breakdowns could only give a distorted impression.  In conditions of continuous use, the liability to breakdown is not confined to cars with high mileages&mdash;indeed, each of the three new cars in Cork has had a breakdown already.  I should emphasise, however, that the fact that a patrol car is not available owing to breakdown, accident-damage or routine servicing does not mean that patrols are not being performed.  A relief car is generally available when the patrol cars are out of service.</P>

If I were to do this in reply to a Parliamentary Question or otherwise I would immediately prejudice the taking of proceedings against such a person. In spite of very definite feelings and views which I privately hold I am precluded from expressing them in order that, if necessary and appropriate, proceedings can be taken against such people.

      <P>However, I can say that I regard the Bridewell as quite unsuitable for the detention of young persons and, as I announced recently, the institutional provision to be made for young offenders is under urgent examination with a view to eliminating the difficulties sometimes experienced by the courts at present in finding suitable institutions for them.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that there have been very substantial increases in rents in Dublin? I am sure Deputy Andrews will confirm that in the constituency we both represent people are paying £8 or £9 per week as rent for flats.  The rents are spiralling.  There is constant revision by landlords of short-term leases.  There is need for some form of amending legislation to try to reconcile the people's interests with those of the landlords.  Due to the lack of housing people pay enormous rents for accommodation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am fully aware of the type of problem he speaks about.  It is not just in Dún Laoghaire but in other places also that one finds these rents. One has to look at the problems in the overall context of rent restriction in general.  It is a complex matter.  It is easy to clamp down with restrictions, but such action would have widespread social and economic consequences because if you do that you immediately divert all private investment away from housing.  I should like, while gradually easing rent controls in order to encourage investments in housing, to try at the same time to stop definite abuses that do exist.  I have had my Department look at this from many different angles to see if that can be achieved but we have not as yet been able to come up with any answer.  If we control the limited type of exorbitant rents to which Deputy Desmond refers the net effect in the long run would be to divert all private money away from housing.  All concerned would agree that would not be in the national interest.</P>

      <P>Accepting the enormous complexity of the problem and its many implications could we have <Col N="1296" /> some assurance from the Minister that his Department will give some special urgency to the examination of the problem?  Young married couples and individuals, including young civil servants, are being greatly exploited by drastic revisions of rent and have absolutely no redress.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cronin)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 and 161 together.  Recruitment is a continuous process, but with a view to improving the normal flow of recruits, local measures were put in hand some time ago to stimulate the intake of personnel.  No particular target has been set but it is hoped that there will be an appreciable increase in the strength of the permanent Defence Force in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that his reply to these questions is the same as his replies have been since he took over this Department, that recruiting is going on all the time and that he hopes for a satisfactory response?  Has the Minister looked into the matter seriously to see why people are not joining the Army?  Is it accommodation, or pay, or conditions generally? What new inducement has he to offer people to join the Army?  The Minister must admit, I think, that the Government have allowed Army strength to drop to a dangerously low level having regard to the circumstances <Col N="1297" /> of the present and, indeed, the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer I have given is not the same as the answer given on previous occasions in so far as I indicated that local measures were put in hand to accelerate and improve the intake of recruits.  This is having a good effect.  The Deputy also comments on the rundown condition of the Army.  I should remind him that the present strength of the Army is the highest in ten years.  I admit it is not good enough and we are seeking recruits. It is hardly correct to say the strength has been allowed to run down.</P>

In one instance they are 27 miles from a critical point on the Border.  Members of the Garda will be forced to take cover between groups of armed men.  This has already happened along the Border at Culloville.  In the interests of protecting the Garda who deserve our compliments the Minister should consider establishing a small unit in each area.

      <P>The interest rates charged to borrowers by building societies reflect the rates which the societies pay on moneys invested with them and, as I have indicated previously, are a matter for determination by the societies in the light of practice and the need to attract funds for housing.  I understand that most societies have been obliged to restrict lending for the present to persons who have funds invested with them because the demand exceeds the amount being deposited.  Any such restriction is a matter for decision by the societies in the light of their commitments and other relevant factors and not one in which it would be appropriate for me to intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might point out in this connection that the societies' commitments in respect of house-purchase loans are at a very high level, and applications with them for loans amounted to £21,862,000 at 30th September, 1971, compared with £12,783,000 and £7,448,000 at the corresponding dates in 1970 and 1969 respectively.  In these circumstances, any failure by the societies to attract and retain funds would have serious consequences both <Col N="1318" /> for prospective house-purchasers and for the building industry generally.</P>

      <P>Housing authorities were advised by circular letter on 14th April, 1967, to consider paying supplementary grants without inspections by them on being notified by my Department that the State grant has been paid.  Many authorities have taken that advice.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, it is not accepted that the payment of the State grant through the local authority would speed up payment of that grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I decided to wind up the derelict site grants scheme because I was satisfied that the scheme had largely served the purpose for which it was introduced, namely as an incentive to tidy up the more prominent eyesores throughout the country. I felt that the moneys hitherto made available for this scheme could be put to more positive and effective use if spent on the positive improvement of public amenities and community facilities. To this end, I announced last April that the derelict site grant scheme and the existing amenity grant scheme, which were administered out of the same allocation, were to be closed down, and that they would be replaced by a revised scheme of amenity grants. The revised scheme will come into operation at the beginning of the coming financial year, and one of the main features of it will be increased co-operation at local level between voluntary organisations and local authorities in the carrying out of works of public amenity and the improvement of community facilities.  The administration of the revised scheme will be devolved on the local authorities.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to restore the derelict site grants scheme.  All applications received prior to my announcement have been dealt with and payment on foot of the grants allocated are being made in the current year. The winding up of the derelict site grants scheme does not affect the powers of local authorities to deal with such sites under the Derelict Sites Act, 1961, if they wish.  Furthermore, if clearance of a derelict site is an essential part of a worthwhile amenity scheme, it can be embodied in any such proposed scheme.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his Questions Nos. 108 and 109 of August last in which I indicated the basis of allocation of the capital for local authority housing to Kerry County Council for 1971-72.  The assessment of housing needs and the adoption of a building programme are matters for the housing authority under the Housing Act, 1966.  I will consider any proposals they may make for an increase in their present level of construction.</P>

      <P>I asked local authorities by circular letter on the 16th March last for information on co-operative housing groups operating in their areas, including the numbers of houses being built or planned by the groups.  With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report, a table based on the replies to the circular letter showing the number of co-operative housing groups which have built in the last year or so, or are building, houses on sites provided by local authorities or are in the process of obtaining sites from them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my speech introducing the Estimate for my Department for the current year (Vol. 254 of 27th May, 1971&mdash;Cols. 431/433) and to the speech which I made in Galway last June on the occasion of the inauguration by me <Col N="1332" /> of work on a major project in Galway under the low-cost housing project.  In the course of the latter speech I gave a detailed account of my policy on the project and the outcome of its first phase.  A copy of that speech&mdash;and of the accompanying detailed schedule of the firms which had been short-listed at that time under the project&mdash;was sent to every Deputy.  I have arranged to have a further copy sent to the Deputy and to have copies of the speech made available in the Library.</P>
      <P>The appendix to the speech contains particulars of the house types at present available and their form of construction, and it details the firms which offer them.  I am not in a position to disclose details of the confidential prices offered by the individual firms but I indicated in the speech that the prices offered for basic superstructures in the selected proposals were less than £3 per square foot and that I hoped to achieve on a national basis, savings of up to 10 per cent on capital cost, where the project is used.</P>
      <P>The expected life span of the house types offered by short-listed firms, generally, is the same as that of normal local authority housing.  There will be no difference in the conditions and amounts of grants and subsidies as compared with normal housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that in very many instances in regard to those alleged low-cost housing structures prices are equal to, if not more than, the price of the traditional-type house? Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the words &ldquo;low-cost housing&rdquo; are misleading?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary satisfied that the prices being charged for these alleged low-cost houses are justified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the term &ldquo;low-cost housing&rdquo; is a misnomer when one considers the cost of a conventionally built house.  Many of the designs are conventional but, with the arrangements between contractors and the local authorities regarding continuation of work, costs can be cut by 10 per cent.  This does not mean we are cutting quality by 10 per cent, we are cutting costs by this amount.  They are in many cases of a standard equal <Col N="1333" /> to and may be higher than some of the traditional houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary assure me and the House that he is satisfied that the prices being charged are justified, especially having regard to the fact that it is the tenants who will be paying in the long run? The people who call these houses &ldquo;low-cost&rdquo; are obliged to justify that term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement here in the reply that in the main the cost is working out under £3 per square foot would determine the price, would it not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary agree that one of the incentives that was put forward to local authorities to accept this type of low-cost housing arrangement was the speed of the production of houses?  Will he agree that the time it has taken to produce these houses is disappointing in the extreme?  That is our experience in County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will admit that it is a new scheme.  It is intended to be a large, country-wide scheme.  It is difficult to get optimum results in the initial stages of any scheme.  First of all, we had to sell the scheme.  Now that the scheme has been sold and that we are getting it under way, we hope that the rate of progress in the future will be very much higher.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested in the first part of the question is not available.  The extent of non-native timber used in system building varies according to the particular system involved.

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the question relates to private housing, water and sewerage grant works.  It is not the practice to withhold the names of inspectors engaged on this work from Members of the Oireachtas seeking such information.</P>
      <P>It is, however, the practice to withhold the addresses of the inspectors, because it is felt that correspondence should more appropriately be addressed to my Department rather than to inspectors and that they should not be required to meet members of the Oireachtas or the general public at their private residence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my information.  My information is that the name was requested and it was given.  The supplementary question was: &ldquo;What is his address?&rdquo; That was refused, but the inspector in question was written to immediately and asked to deal with the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to bring to the Parliamentary Secretary's notice that that information is completely wrong.  He asked even for the name and he was told there were instructions not to give the name.  He then said he would get it by ringing somebody in the area who had a telephone. He there and then got the name and address but not from an official in the Department.  I was present while all this was going on. The Parliamentary Secretary should not be misled.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention was drawn to the statement made by the ESB in this case.  In making my decision regarding the siting of the transmission lines in the vicinity of Turlough Hill following appeals to me under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, I was restricted to considering the proper planning and development of the area including the preservation of the amenities thereof, and I took my decision accordingly. I had before me the case made by Bord Fáilte Éireann and residents of Valleymount and Hollywood against overhead lines, the case made by the ESB for them, the report of the planning authority and that of the Department's inspector.  In view of the importance of the case, I felt it necessary to inspect the site myself.  The order embodying my decision stated that the reason for it was that the erection of pylons and overhead transmission lines within the Wicklow Gap would seriously injure an area of outstanding natural beauty which is of major importance as a recreational and tourist amenity.</P>
      <P>It is natural that a person or body affected by a decision may feel aggrieved by it if it goes against them. I doubt if it would serve any useful purpose if I were to make it a general practice to take up a statement issued by such an aggrieved person or body on issues already considered in relation to the appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The planning application to which the Deputy refers related to the change of use of a house at Leeson Park and did not involve any alterations to the existing structure. The basic objection to the grant of permission was that the building is in an area zoned in the draft development plan as solely residential and should <Col N="1339" /> therefore be kept in use as a residential property.  I should make it clear that, in dealing with an appeal under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, I am restricted to considering the proper planning and development of the area regard being had to the provisions of the draft development plan.  While the building is in an area zoned in the draft development plan as solely residential, I also took account of the following planning considerations:</P>
      <P>(a) Because of the size and nature of the building, it would be most unlikely to remain in use as a single residence.  Conversion of the building to flats, or the erection of a new apartment block on the site would be the most likely result of restricting the property to residential use.</P>
      <P>(b) The building is in a street of fine architectural quality, and it has its own quality which should, if possible, be preserved as part of the street.  It was most likely to be preserved in its present form and condition if used as an office in suitable conditions.</P>
      <P>(c) Grant of permission for change of use in the case of a single building&mdash;in this case an exceptional one&mdash;is not inconsistent with maintaining the general principle of preserving the residential zoning of the street.  Individual exceptions to general rules&mdash;in appropriate cases &mdash;are not rare in zoning control, and indeed the 1963 Act did not envisage the same rigidity as the Planning Acts which preceded it.</P>
      <P>I also took note of the fact that the corporation had, in fact, granted permission under section 4 of the Housing Act, 1969, for the change of use of premises.  I therefore decided that, on balance, the proper planning and development of the area would best be served by granting permission for a change of use to offices, subject to the following conditions:</P>
      <P>(1) The existing building to be retained and no external alterations thereto to be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1340" /> (2) No sign or advertisement to be erected on the building or in the grounds thereof except with the consent of the planning authority and only one such sign to be erected and such sign not to exceed two square feet in area.</P>
    <P>(3) The existing front garden, including the grassed areas to be maintained as such, and no part of the said garden to be paved, concreted or tarmacadamed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the salient features of the Government's regional policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement issued by the Government on 19th May, 1969.  That <Col N="1341" /> statement indicated that it is an objective of the Government to check the tendency towards unbalanced regional development, that the Government are concerned to achieve broad-based regional expansion leading to a faster rate of industrial growth and a higher level of employment in industry and services and to keep population dislocation to the minimum consistent with these objectives, that the Government consider that the potential of every region should be exploited to the full, including the potential of those cities and towns which can develop as growth centres, and that the development and improvement of small towns and rural areas will be encouraged in order to improve employment in the smaller centres.</P>
      <P>The Government recognised the need to make provision in Dublin for the natural increase in the existing population, for new enterprises for which an alternative location is not feasible, and for an expansion in existing enterprises; beyond these limits, the policy is that the further expansion of the city should not actively be promoted.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Gaeltacht, Government policy is to encourage and expand suitable economic activities and to improve social conditions so that those residing there, who use the Irish language as their normal medium of communication, will have adequate opportunities of securing gainful employment and of enjoying reasonable living standards.  The positive steps taken to implement these policies include:</P>
      <P>(a) the establishment of the regional development organisations to co-ordinate the programmes for regional development in each region, their first task being the preparation of reports on the potential of each region, and the establishment of a regional unit of the Industrial Development Authority in each region,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  the wide range of special measures designed to favour development in the designated areas, including the county development teams backed by the special regional fund, differential aids and incentives <Col N="1342" /> for industry and infrastructure as well as measures in relation to agriculture,</P>
    <P>(c) the small industries programme of the Industrial Development Authority,</P>
    <P>(d) the programmes of Roinn na Gaeltachta and Gaeltarra Éireann, as well as the special attention given to the Gaeltacht by State Departments and public bodies generally,</P>
    <P>(e) the encouragement of industry to site itself outside Dublin through the administration of industrial grant incentives.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental committee are at present considering future regional policy.  They have before them the reports furnished by the regional development committee and are also aware of the work being done by the Industrial Development Authority on regional industrial planning.  I expect to receive a report from the committee shortly.  I would envisage bringing recommendations on future regional policy for consideration by the Government at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 247, 248 and 249 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of criticisms that have been expressed of the fire service, I think it right first to indicate what has been done in the development of the service. Annual expenditure on the service has increased over the last ten years from £428,000 per annum to £1,780,296 in 1970-71.  The strength of the service on 31st March, 1971, comprised 546 full-time and 1,919 part-time personnel. Local authorities have been encouraged to provide modern fire stations and standardised equipment and capital has been allocated for these purposes, over £1 million in the past ten years.  Since 1968 my Department have organised a series of training courses for station officers and sub-officers which have <Col N="1346" /> proved very successful in providing a corps of instructors to undertake the training of firemen at local level.  These courses are continuing as an on-going programme with a raising of standards as participants are seen to profit from more advanced training.  Two instructional films have been made by my Department and distributed to all fire brigade authorities for use in training.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the local authorities have made reasonable progress to date in providing an up-to-date service, but I am anxious to ensure that the process of improvement will continue and be stepped up as much as possible.</P>
    <P>The general organisation of the service will be reviewed in the context of local government reorganisation generally.  Concurrently I have put in hands a review of local authority staff structures and procedures, which covers the fire service as well as other local authority services, and to assist in this I have engaged consultants whose report I expect to receive shortly.</P>
    <P>I have also made arrangements to augment the professional and administrative staff of my Department engaged on fire service duties.  Functions of this staff will include a review of the position regarding fire protection and prevention, the need for and the form of new organisational arrangements, and the review of the Fire Brigades Act, 1940.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the seriousness of this whole question would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider that an all-out national effort should be made to improve our fire services in view of the fact that subversive elements have said it was their aim to burn, bomb, use the bullet, explosives, <i>et cetera</i>?  Would the Minister not, therefore, not look upon this as a serious question to be tackled immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>This function was delegated to me some time ago by the Minister and it is one in relation to which I regard steady progress as essential.  Over the last ten years there has been substantial progress.  The amount of money spent on the fire service in ten years increased from <Col N="1347" /> £500,000 to almost £2 million.  We can have a much better fire service if we are prepared to pay for it, but in training and equipment there has been and there will be steady progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Should it not be looked upon as a national question? In some counties they have a first class, up-to-date fire fighting service but in others they have not.  I am not an expert, but would the Parliamentary Secretary not think that all the fire fighting services should be brought up to date and made as efficient as possible and that there should be co-operation between the different counties?</P>

      <P>With regard to the financing of the pool, Drogheda Corporation have been unable to raise a loan on reasonable terms for the purpose of making their contribution and the question of making a loan available to them from the Local Loans Fund is being examined.</P>

      <P>While the Government's proposals in relation to local finance and taxation generally will be dealt with in a White Paper, several measures have been taken <Col N="1354" /> which have the effect of easing the impact of rates on householders.  For example, under the provisions of the Local Government (Rates) Act, 1970, all householders now have the right to pay their rates in instalments spread over ten months of the year and rating authorities have power to draw up and adopt schemes for the waiver of rates for necessitous persons.</P>
      <P>More than 11,300 domestic ratepayers have been afforded full or partial relief from rates under the terms of the rates waiver schemes adopted last year.  Of course, the principal way in which ratepayers in general are assisted is by means of State grants towards local authority revenue expenditure. The amounts of the State subvention to local authorities this year alone will exceed £90 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Any review of the remuneration for this grade would be a matter appropriate to be dealt with in the first instance under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for local authority staff.  The existing salary scale, which is of general application, has emerged following the implementation of an arbitration award made in 1967 and the application to the scale then approved of any &ldquo;general round&rdquo; increases in remuneration granted to local authority officers generally in the meantime.</P>
      <P>In order to broaden the field of recruitment it was agreed by my Department during last year, following consultation with the Department of Health, to reduce the lower age limit for appointment to the grade and to allow males to compete.  In addition, local authorities were allowed to provide in individual cases for entry to the salary scale above the minimum.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the usual practice, Macroom urban district council and other interested parties were consulted before a third kiosk was erected recently in Macroom.  No demands or requests were received for provision of an additional kiosk in the town.  It was erected on the Department's own initiative to relieve an existing heavily used kiosk in the Square.

      <P>There are about 18,000 applications for telephones awaiting attention, including about 8,900 in the Dublin area.  About 5,000 of these including 2,000 in the Dublin area are either in course of provision or will be attended to shortly.  The reason for the delay in providing service for many applicants is that it has not been practicable with the resources available and procurable to achieve the expansion of the system necessary to keep pace with demand which has exploded in recent years. The telephone service makes heavy demands on capital and as Deputies are aware there has not been sufficient capital available to meet the full demands of many highly desirable services, including telephones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 286 and 287 together.</P>
      <P>The terms of the directive are as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority&mdash;In exercise of the powers conferred on me by section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, I, Gerard Collins, TD, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, hereby direct you to refrain from broadcasting any matter of the following class i.e. any matter that could be calculated to promote the aims or activities of any organisation which engages in, promotes, encourages or advocates the attaining of any particular objective by violent means.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On 24th June last (Col. 2496/9) in answering a parliamentary question about a radio programme &ldquo;This Week&rdquo;, the Taoiseach made the Government's view clear that it is not in the public interest that members of an illegal organisation should be permitted to use such a programme for publicising their activities.  On 28th September, members of an illegal organisation were interviewed on a television programme &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; in a way which I, and the Government, considered to be prejudicial to the public interest.</P>
      <P>Following full consideration and with the approval of the Government, I issued the direction under section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no present intention of issuing a further direction under section 31 <Col N="1362" /> of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask why the directive was issued in such vague and generalised terms which must inevitably cause serious difficulty of interpretation and implementation for the Authority and which was the subject of a statement by the Authority and why the organisations or individuals referred to, or which were obviously under consideration by the Government were not named?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy could understand the difficulty in phrasing a directive, he would not ask me why this directive was vague&mdash;I do not think it was vague.  I am quite confident that the Authority will have no difficulty whatever in understanding what is meant and acting accordingly. Regarding the second part of the supplementary question, as to why I did not name individuals or organisations and spell out in black and white&mdash;I think this is what he was trying to ask &mdash;name these people so that they would be easily recognised, this is not an easy thing to do.  As the Deputy is aware, names of organisations can change overnight and the Deputy should also be aware that many of these gentlemen wear more than one hat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in fact within the RTE organisation there has been considerable difficulty in interpreting the directive and that this was indicated immediately following the issue of the directive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the RTE Authority to interpret the directive and suitably instruct the members of the RTE organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to recent interviews by RTE television and radio of members of the British forces, would the Minister not consider in the interests of fair presentation that both sides should have an opportunity to explain or give the facts as they saw them?  In the interests of fair presentation would the Minister not consider that RTE should refrain from interviewing British soldiers?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled this question at a time when two women were brutally murdered in Belfast, and it is now so long since that happened that the question may be irrelevant.  At that time the British officer who was interviewed gave his case; and if it was interpreted under section 31 that people who would supposedly give the other viewpoint should not be allowed to give their case on radio or television, would the Minister not consider that this represents an unfair advantage given to the British Army?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that a directive was issued by the Government in relation to a particular programme, I understand, mainly because of the feeling on the part of the Government that a privileged position was given on that programme to spokesmen of an illegal organisation and that apparently this provoked a reaction from the Government, would the Minister not now consider in good faith, having made the point to RTE under directive, in the national interest and appreciating the difficulties facing the Government and more particularly considering the tremendous difficulties facing the RTE in this matter, withdrawing the directive?  Having made the point and acting in good faith could it not be considered that the Authority will continue the general practice&mdash;it certainly emanated from the newsroom in many areas&mdash;of impartial, objective and thorough reporting of events and that it is undesirable in the public interest that a directive should be of such a general or continuing nature and hang like a cloud over RTE?  I would ask the Minister to respond on that basis if he can?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to assume, therefore, that directives are made without time limit, particularly as it now appears that RTE have implemented the directive.  Naturally, if RTE failed to take into account the views of the Government in terms of national security regarding the alleged privileged position given in one programme and if there was a recurrence the Minister would be free to issue another directive. I think it is unfair to the whole staff in RTE&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that <Col N="1366" /> about 25 per cent of RTE television transmission is in colour.  There are no proposals to increase this percentage. Of these transmissions in colour about one-tenth are produced by the RTE outside broadcast unit&mdash;mainly of sporting events&mdash;and the remainder are live relays from abroad or transmissions of imported films.</P>
      <P>I have stated before in the Dáil that RTE have no firm plans for the regular home production of colour programmes. This remains the position. Regular or studio transmissions in colour cannot be contemplated for several years ahead because of the heavy cost involved.</P>

      <P>We have no firm estimate of the cost of equipping RTE for full colour transmission.  We estimate&mdash;and this is a rough estimate&mdash; that it will be well over £1 million. Another question is involved.  Colour television sets are extremely expensive and, if RTE went into full colour television tomorrow morning, and if all the people with television sets changed over to colour in the morning, it would cost something in the region of £150 million, averaging about £300 a set. The Deputy knows well that these colour sets are not made in this country.</P>

      <P>I would hate to hazard a guess on that.  I am well aware of the criticism which I got as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for the 50 per cent increase in licence fees which I gave RTE over the past 12 months.  I am convinced that if we had to raise an extra £1 million, and possibly more, to go over to colour the fees would have to be increased rather sharply.</P>

      <P>I would be loath to accuse the Minister of waffling, but is he aware of the considerable public disquiet concerning the alleged cleaning of the tapes of a good deal of the work of the late Seán Ó Riada with the result that that work is not now available to the nation?  A great deal of his work is lost to the nation.  That is one of the reasons why I put down this question.  I wanted to make sure that historic material of this nature is retained for posterity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to clean the Ó Riada tapes was based on the judgment that the material involved was not of high significance in the context of the corpus of his work, and the expectation that there would be future occasions on which to record for television performances of a greater importance.  We all know that the composer's untimely death frustrated this latter expectation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to assure Deputy Desmond and the House that there are 15 hours of audio material of Seán Ó Riada's work preserved in RTE; 14 programmes of &ldquo;Our Musical Heritage&rdquo;, 12 programmes of &ldquo;Reactaireacht An Riadaigh&rdquo;, two performances of &ldquo;Banks of the Sullane&rdquo;, one programme of &ldquo;Composers at Work&mdash; Seán Ó Riada&rdquo;, two performances of &ldquo;Nomos No. 4&rdquo;, one recording of &ldquo;Nomos No. 2&rdquo;, one performance of an overture &ldquo;Olynthiac&rdquo;, one recording of &ldquo;Feararise&rdquo; and some other <Col N="1368" /> speech material relating to Moy, Kerry and Muskerry.  So, the RTE people have quite a lot of this material.  To correct an impression which may have been taken from some of the newspaper reports that many of these tapes were cleaned, the ones that were cleaned were cleaned back as far as 1966.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Questions I was speaking about working widows and their problems as a result of their State pensions being taxed as well as their earnings from whatever work they do.  I was suggesting to the Minister that perhaps this is an area he could look at in order to give some relief to these widows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in receipt of sickness benefit do not pay tax on that benefit, and yet it is quite likely that as a result of an <Col N="1371" /> accident people could be in receipt of a considerable amount of interest on compensation or moneys coming from that source.  The income from disability benefit would not be added to the interest from investments in making their returns for tax purposes.  That I believe is as it should be, and I suggest that the Minister should ensure that widows' earnings would be put in the same category and would not be considered for tax purposes.  I believe that very few of these widows are earning all that much when they go out to work for a short time in the week. Many of them have young families and their work is of a part-time nature. Any of us coming in and out of the House over the past few years will have noticed one lady who has kept up a one-woman protest at the main gate against the plight of widows, working and otherwise.  Widows are one section of the community who are badly treated under the social welfare code, and it is one area into which the Minister could bring a little more cheer and a little more hope.  These women, be they young or more elderly, live in genteel poverty, and in order to make life a little more bearable some of them, who are in a position to do so, go out to work.  Those earnings should be ignored for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>Turning briefly to children's allowances it is worth while to mention a suggestion made by Deputy O'Donovan. He made this suggestion to the Minister previously and it was received perhaps a little jocosely on occasions. He suggested that the first child in a family, or people with one child, should not be given any children's allowances and that the money saved be given to families with six or seven children.  The amount saved, since every family has to have a first child, would go to the benefit of the five, six or seven children in families.  I think it is not a bad idea; it is one worth looking at.  The amount saved would be considerable and would bring a greater amount of revenue to the larger families and help them to cope with the problems with which large families are faced.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with two small <Col N="1372" /> problems I have come across.  One of these relates to the term used in relation to a man seeking unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit as a result of being sacked.  This man is sometimes turned down because of what is described as &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo;. Misconduct is really the boss saying that the man has been sacked because he did not work, that he tried to get himself sacked, that he was not serious in his work, that he was not trying when he was in the job, that he really did not want the job and that he sacked him.  This excuse is often given when a man makes an application.  The official in the employment exchange rings up the employer and as it may sometimes happen that they have parted on bad terms and the employer feels that the employee has not treated him well, he does not give him the best of references when the exchange rings up.  The reason for turning down the application is given as misconduct.  The man may lose up to six weeks unemployment benefit as a result.  I know he has a right of appeal, and in many cases the appeal is upheld, but it is time-consuming and there is no income for that individual, be he married or single.  He has still to eat and to pay his way, and while he waits for the decision of the appeal board, he has no income in the world.  This term &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; can often be misrepresented and it is one of the problems I find cropping up.  It is one the Minister should look at to see whether, in every circumstance, the exchange gets the right information.  The method by which this information is sought, perhaps mostly over the telephone, is just not fair.  A written explanation from the employer should be obtained before his word is taken and before a man is turned down and referred to an appeal board.</P>
    <P>There is then the plight of the deserted wife.  The Minister has said that 1,500 people in this class have received help as a result of the Budget changes last year.  This is good to know.  There were complaints about the method by which a questionnaire was sent out and about some of the questions that had to be answered.  I believe that in order to ensure that the officials of the <Col N="1373" /> Department are adequately covered when paying out public finance, they have to ask a great number of personal questions, and I think they handle it with tact in all cases I am aware of, but there is one aspect of it which I would like to mention.  I had the case of a lady in my constituency who complained that she would have had to swear a warrant for her husband's arrest for desertion in order to receive the deserted wife allowance.  This is what she told me.  I have a letter which I got from the Department and the answer was that they felt that the husband was somewhere in the country and was contributing to her, and inorder to flush out, if you like, the information, they put this kind of pressure on her.  I do not know whether he was or was not&mdash;I cannot say.  I know that the woman was in a desperate plight when she came to me.  I disagreed with the method being used and told the Department so.  I certainly think that this is not the way to do things&mdash; it is a very extreme way of getting information. If it is the only way it can be done, I disagree with it and I hope that some other method can be adopted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience over a long number of years is that people who apply for a blind pension get a very rigid examination and it is one allowance that is really hard to get. The application goes before perhaps two local doctors and then before the Department doctor, if the Department are satisfied, but my experience is that it is a very hard pension to qualify for. In the case of a person, who is probably advanced in years, who may have to work hard to get a living from a farm and who loses an eye, which means that he is 50 per cent blind, there should be no question about the granting of the pension.  Only recently I had such a query.  A man whom I knew called on me.  He had to work hard to make a living.  He lost his eye but still he was turned down when he applied for the blind pension.  Such a person should have no problem.  There should be no hard and fast rule by which such a person is deprived of a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions to qualify for maternity cash grants are too stringent.  To <Col N="1374" /> qualify one must belong to the lower income group.  I meet quite a number of people who have a low valuation but when the home assistance officer reports on their stock and their home they are told that they do not belong to the lower income group.  This rule should not be applied to people living on small holdings or on a wage.</P>
    <P>An increase in the allowance of deserted wives should be considered. There are about 1,500 deserted wives in the country and it was a great encouragement to them when they were given the allowance.  The Department did a great job there.  However, the deserted wife finds it hard to fit in, she is just not in the same position as her neighbour and she needs more money.  Many of these women have families to look after and have many demands on them so they should be given an increase.</P>
    <P>One problem we meet in rural areas is the £20 to the £ of valuation.  One often meets a person who is very anxious to get unemployment assistance. He may have a valuation of £10. He may live in a mountainy part of the country and have a small stock, but because his income is based on the valuation of £10 which brings him up to 20 times ten the Department will tell him he does not qualify.  There might be no such income from this small mountainy farm and he may be rearing a family.  This has applied for quite some time and with costs rising speedily each year the Department should seriously consider this question.</P>
    <P>We meet cases of people laid off work and queries are raised about the lay-off, perhaps about the length of time they have been employed, the size of their family or something like that.  These people only come to elected representatives after eight or nine weeks when they are getting into serious trouble for the want of money.  I am sure that often the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary do not know about these things.  When I contact the Parliamentary Secretary I always get an immediate reply and he checks cases for me but there are people who never make contact with their elected representatives and they find it hard to get replies.</P>
    <P>There is often a long delay in the <Col N="1375" /> payment of old age pensions to people whose property is in the course of transfer.  Until the transfer is complete the Department take no chances and the full pension is not paid.  If an applicant had comfortable means before the application went in he is judged on that and he may get no pension for 12 or 18 months because, knowing solicitors as we all know them, it takes that length of time to get the documents out of their offices.  These Carlow County Councilpeople are very annoyed because they are deprived of their pension while the profits of the farm, business or premises are going to some member of the family.  When it has reached a certain stage the Department should be satisfied that it is a genuine transfer; and they should be able to get local information that a person is transferring his place to his son and should pay him his full old age pension.  I have one such case on my books at the moment.  It is a genuine application and the pension should be paid to this honest publican who worked hard and built up a good business. Having signed over there should be no delay in paying him his pension.</P>
    <P>I wrote recently to the Parliamentary Secretary about a pensioner who applied eight to 12 months ago for a widow's pension.  Whatever went wrong this lady has got no information from the Department.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary will deal with it in due course.  Occasionally long delays are experienced by people and often by people who are very much in need of money.  When the breadwinner dies the woman is usually left in dire straits if her family have grown up and left her.</P>
    <P>I had understood that reciprocal arrangements had been made between the Department of Social Welfare and the British Department of Social Security but recently I learned that this is not so.  A young man and his wife who returned from England to Sligo to look for work discovered that they could only draw benefit for 26 days despite the fact that they have been working in Britain for the last 14 years.  From the information I have got about Mr. O'Hagan I am anxious <Col N="1376" /> to know if the same rule will apply to another couple who want to return to Leitrim within the next few months, having spent 20 years in England.  If this is the case it is very sad that people have to live in England in order to get benefits or forfeit those benefits if they want to come home.  It should be remembered that these people were forced to seek employment in England, they were glad to get employment there, they did well, they looked after their families and gave them a good home but at all times it was their wish to come back and settle down here amongst their own people.  There are a number of problems as far as medical cards are concerned.</P>

      <P>If it were made clear that they were entitled to them they would apply for them but some query arises and that puts many people off applying.  We were all satisfied with the increase in the old age pension bringing it up to £4.50 but with the ever-rising costs old age pensions are as small now as they ever were.  When Budget time comes around again&mdash;we do not know who will be here&mdash;I hope whoever is here will give old age pensioners an increase which will keep abreast with the ever-increasing cost of living.  I was talking to a coalman recently who said that coal was costing £1 a cwt.  An old age pensioner would not keep very warm on a cwt. of coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am always being asked about free fuel but it is very difficult for people to understand why the free fuel scheme applies only to places like Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  There are people deserving of free fuel all over the country.  The Minister should consider <Col N="1377" /> making the free fuel scheme available in many more centres.  If it were not for the voluntary organisations like the St. Vincent de Paul Society many people would find it difficult to keep warm during the winter months.</P>
    <P>In the Social Welfare Acts it is stated that free radio licences and free ESB current can only be given if the aged person is living alone or with another aged person.  It is a pity this restriction has to apply.  People do not understand that the scheme is limited and they often make representations to county councillors and TDs to see if they can avail of those facilities but if they live with a son or daughter they cannot qualify.  These facilities should be available to the aged no matter with whom they live.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of talk about and a number of meetings have been held in connection with the aged.  We are trying to get away from the name &ldquo;county home&rdquo; but it is very difficult. Those hospitals are of a high standard and credit should be given to the Minister for the help he has given.  Despite the fact that the patients are living in comfortable surroundings many of them are anxious to live at home. When they are first sent to hospital people visit them every week, later on they visit them once a month and eventually their friends forget they are in hospital.</P>
    <P>The allowance of 55s given to a female relative to care for an aged person was of great benefit but the scheme was not wide enough in scope. It costs between £12 to £14 weekly to keep a person in St. Patrick's Home, Carrick-on-Shannon, or in St. John's Hospital, Sligo.  If the allowance of 55s were paid to a son, to his wife or some other relative it would mean that far fewer people would enter the homes. With the pension of £4 15s and the allowance of 55s the home could be run comfortably and the younger people could care for the aged person at home.  If the Minister would extend the application of this scheme he would discover many more aged people could be looked after in their homes.</P>
    <P>The treatment in the hospitals is good, as is the attention of the doctors, <Col N="1378" /> and this has prolonged the life of aged people.  It is my experience in my constituency that during the winter months it is almost impossible to get a patient into those homes.  There would be far less demand on the Nazareth Home in Sligo if this scheme were extended to include three or four more categories of persons.  It would be money well spent in that there would be happier homes.  The aged person would be happier in his own home and the allowance of 55s would help in the expenses of the household.</P>
    <P>Hospital patients who receive old age pensions are given £1 per week towards their expenses.  I would ask that this amount be increased.  The last meal of the day in many hospitals is at 6 p.m. but some patients would like to obtain a light meal at 8 p.m. or 10 p.m.  If those patients were allowed £1.50p instead of the £1 now given they could buy some extra foodstuffs.  This would improve their lot considerably.</P>
    <P>I hope that next year the Minister will not take the unemployment assistance from the small group of people as happened this year.  None of us realised this allowance meant so much until it was taken away.  We often criticised the dole but it was only when the weaker section of the community were deprived of it&mdash;people who could not obtain work&mdash;that we realised it was the wrong course of action to take.  I realise it did not give the Minister any pleasure to deprive these people of this assistance and I am sure he will consider the matter sympathetically.</P>
    <P>Special consideration should be given to the western counties with regard to unemployment assistance.  Around the Dublin area this form of assistance does not mean much and it is not availed of to a great extent.  People in rural areas around Dublin live on good farms or they are near towns where they can obtain employment; but in the Western areas, such as Counties Donegal and Sligo and around the western coast, employment is not available. Were it not for unemployment benefit many more homes in the western counties would be closed.  I passed through some of those areas on my way to Dublin yesterday and it was surprising to see the numbers who were <Col N="1379" /> signing for benefit.  Because of the lack of employment this benefit is a necessity for the people.  If employment were available the people would be only too willing to work.</P>
    <P>I particularly want to emphasise the problem of people coming from England who are not in receipt of any benefits.  I often travelled with elderly people on the train from Sligo and found they were returning to England after coming here from the homes of their sons or daughters in order to collect their three months due old age pension.  If the Minister has not done so I would ask him to change this regulation.  Many young people who have found a livelihood in England have comfortable homes and they bring their parents over to live with them. When these elderly people come back here to collect their pension by the time they go back after paying their boat and train fare and calling on some of their friends most of their pension is spent.</P>
    <P>We also have a section of people who have become disabled, some of them by reason of working on the land in all weathers and some of them through some other cause.  Many of them have no stamps so they find themselves without any means of support. There should be some scheme to cover those people.  Despite the fact they are not able to earn any money, they are told that because their land valuation is over £20 they are not entitled to anything.  All those people should qualify for some allowance.  This would pay us in the long run because it would save those people being sent to hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of us find ourselves in continuous correspondence with the Department of Social Welfare, and it is only natural, when it is laid down whether payments take place or not, that one is largely dependent on the officials of that Department. I should like to express my gratitude for the co-operation they have given me in the enormous correspondence I carry out with them and for the interviews they give me from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies have referred to <Col N="1380" /> the fact that the Minister made no statement regarding the possibility of a united Ireland in which there would have to be some equation of social welfare benefits.  I should like to go further than that and say that at the moment this country is supposed to be negotiating entry to the European Economic Community and that it is, therefore, very surprising that the Minister did not make a statement relative to our position for the future in our relations with the European Economic Community and in our relations regarding a possible settlement for a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>I should like, first of all, to deal with the social benefits relevant to a united Ireland.  It is quite obvious that in this country we are not able to pay the same benefits to our people that the United Kingdom are able to pay to their people, and it seems to me a rational line of thought that if we come to any type of settlement there must be a phase-out of our social welfare payments to bring them into line with those in the United Kingdom. Some discussion should be taking place between our Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Social Services, or whatever his title is, in the United Kingdom, with regard to the balancing and the equating of such payments.  It would have been, therefore, extremely informative for the House if the Minister had given us some idea what sum of money would be necessary to bring those payments into alignment.  I gather that some of the Deputies have asked questions on this line but have received no information whatsoever.  It should not be very difficult for the Minister and his very efficient Parliamentary Secretary to produce these facts.  A little information is better than nothing.  It seems entirely germane to this debate but we have absolutely nothing whatsoever to go on.</P>
    <P>With regard to the social benefits in the European Economic Community there is no doubt that the Minister for Social Welfare knows that there is a social fund and that fund is one of the great advantages of full membership of the EEC.  That fund is for the purpose of dealing with countries who are unable to live up to the <Col N="1381" /> high standards and the full payments of social welfare in other countries. There has not been a word from the Minister on this subject.  It is a known fact that in EEC negotiations anything that has to deal with a particular problem, whether it is social welfare, health, or industry and commerce is dealt with by the particular Minister concerned.  I, therefore, take it that in any discussions or negotiations that have been going on between this country and the Six there should have been some discussions relative to social welfare benefits, but we have no indication whatever that there has been any discussion on those lines.  We have no indication whatsoever that the Minister for Social Welfare has studied the social fund or has studied the issues relative to our social welfare benefits if we become members of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>Therefore I am asking the Minister to relate to the House any information he has on that point because up to date he has given us no information whatsoever.  It may well be that before we have another discussion on social welfare these matters will have become very live issues.  It is this lack of communication and information which is contributing so much not only to the political instability of the Government outside but within the Government as well.  I therefore ask the Minister to deal with this question of paramount importance not only to every political representative but to the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I shall come back to the social welfare problems of the country.  I think it was in the last Budget that a provision was made for payments to deserted wives.  Although I congratulate the Minister and the Government for even considering those people, I must point to one flaw in the provision.  It is that unless a deserted wife is 50 years of age she cannot get benefits.  Now, let us be reasonable and discuss this in a reasonable way.  Normally speaking, a woman of 45 who may have seven or eight children may be deserted and she is not entitled to get benefit.  She is not entitled to a widow's non-contributory <Col N="1382" /> or contributory pension because she is not a widow.  Therefore all she has to live on are children's allowances. Apart from that she has no means of livelihood.  If she is less than 50 years of age I suppose she is assumed to be able to go out to work. How can a woman with half a dozen children go out to work?</P>

      <P>By dependants the Minister means children under 16 years The Minister must appreciate that with the extension of education and so on, very often children of more than 16 are still dependent on the home.  They may have started their higher education before the husband, who had spent the best years of his life in the home, walked off leaving the wife deserted.  How can she go out to work?  It is a very small matter which would not cost very much.  I do not know why the age of 50 is chosen. It was probably somebody who did the thinking or who had stopped doing the thinking in the Department who advised the Minister.  With all the free-thinking on divorce laws and so on, the thought here should have been that this mainly happens in working class families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter I want to deal with is that of overpayment.  There are quite a few cases of, shall we say, payments that have not been justified.  It is very often an administrative error.  These cases mainly occur in the matter of old age pensions.  I have several in my constituency and indeed there is one case with the Department at the moment.  A dispute generally arises as to whether an individual has certain assets.  In most farming communities in this country it is very unusual for a will to be made.  It often happens that there is a farm of 50, 70 or 100 acres and which, because of the means test, renders the person ineligible for an old age pension.  Now the individual concerned does not own the farm&mdash;it is, perhaps, owned by half a dozen people.  In bygone days there may have been as many as ten people depending on a farm.  I mentioned a specific case <Col N="1383" /> under examination in the Department at the moment.  How a farm on which ten people are living can be assessed as being owned by one person is difficult to understand.  That person has absolutely no right to dispose of the farm or of the proceeds of the farm. If ten people are living on the farm it simply means that the person seeking a pension has ten acres of land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may remember this specific case.  When I first wrote to him he refused, but the matter is being reconsidered.  The man has been asked for a refund of something in the neighbourhood of £1,000. This man is 85 years of age and there is a sister aged 92 years.  They own a one-tenth share of the farm and they have been asked to pay back to the Department a sum of £1,000.  The Minister says they are presumed to be taking the profits from the farm.  Surely a man of 85 and a woman of 92 are not likely to get much profit from a farm.  They are not in a position to sell an acre of land to pay the Department what is owing.  They are honourable people and if they could sell the land they would do so and pay the Minister in the morning.  In one case, as far as I remember, they gave all the money they had available in the bank to the Department of Social Welfare.  I sent the money in on their behalf and I asked the Minister for Social Welfare to accept it in final settlement.  He acknowledged my letter, but they got a letter back to say that unless they paid the balance of the money due within 48 days or something like that they would be &ldquo;jugged.&rdquo;  They came to me and I said: &ldquo;You need not worry about that.  You will not be &lsquo;jugged&rsquo; as long as I can put the letters TD after my name.&rdquo;  However, it is still embarrassing for such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred on several occasions to the question of the removal of social welfare officers from local districts.  I have asked parliamentary questions about it, and the reply I have got from the Minister is that they have not been <Col N="1384" /> removed, that there are social welfare officers available, that more social welfare officers have been made available in County Wexford.  That is absolutely untrue.  The position is, briefly, that when there was a social welfare officer in the area concerned and where there was a claim made on the Department of Social Welfare the people could go to the local officer and discuss the the matter with him.  Now what they do is they send in the national health insurance certificate in a free franked envelope which they get for the purpose. What happens if the money does not arrive and there is no local social welfare officer?  I can tell the Minister what happens: they do not get their money.  They then have to write to the Deputy concerned.  Probably with their lack of knowledge of the official procedure they omit to send the insurance number.  The Deputy either has to write back to them to get the insurance number or go to see them if they are within striking distance.  That is a further delay and they do not get their money.  An investigation has to take place in the Department of Social Welfare. Letters have to be written.  A great deal of time is spent by paid officials looking up matters, which would be quite unnecessary if there was a local social welfare officer.</P>
    <P>Is this an example of the Government spending a shilling to save a halfpenny?  They have done away with local social welfare officers.  They probably have not done it in the west&mdash;I do not really know&mdash;but they certainly have done it in County Wexford.  The purpose is to save money, whereas it is costing more money because it takes three or four letters, which means time, research and so forth.  I would suggest to the Minister that every fairly large-size centre where there is a population of around 1,000 people should have a social welfare officer.  Far from this costing the State more it will save money.</P>
    <P>Deputy McLaughlin referred to the allowance for dependent people.  That is something on which the Department of Social Welfare could be really generous.  If they were, again they would save a lot of money.  It now costs a minimum of £12 a week for institutional treatment, and costs are <Col N="1385" /> escalating the whole time, with problems with regard to nurses, the difficulty of obtaining staff and so on.  I think it is true to say that next year, when perhaps we are all here with a different government, we shall find that the minimum for institutional treatment will be at least £14 a week.</P>
    <P>The question of whether an old age pensioner is entitled to somebody to mind him or not is one on which the conditions are very rigidly applied by an Act which was passed here.  One has to make sure that the State is safeguarded by legislation, but greater consideration could be given to old people. I am happy to say that everywhere in the country more geriatric associations are being formed.  They exist in practically every built-up centre.  They are carried on entirely by voluntary contributions and they could play a very good part in association with the Department of Social Welfare.  If they got semi-official recognition from the Minister, they would be in a position to indicate the particular cases that are eligible for benefit.</P>
    <P>In order to be eligible for the allowance the old age pensioner has to be able to prove that he is keeping somebody home from work.  That is possibly necessary for the purpose of making it look as if the Minister for Social Welfare is defending the taxpayer; in actual fact what he is doing is imposing an extra burden on the taxpayer by enforcing this inflexible type of legislation. I would suggest that the Minister would co-operate as far as possible with these geriatric associations and give them the right to advise him just as he has pension committees to advise him in regard to old age pensions, whether people are eligible to have a relation to mind them or not.  I think the amount is £2.75 per week, which is not an over-generous sum seeing that the minimum pay in any employment is about £10 per week.  Although a person may stay at home to mind an old age pensioner that allowance is not paid unless the person who is brought out of work is an insured person.  If that is not idiotic, muddled, bureaucratic thinking I do not know what is. If the Minister was liberal in that regard he would save many people from <Col N="1386" /> having to leave their homes and go into an institution.  This costs the State more money as well as causing unnecessary misery and suffering to the person concerned and furthermore causing odium to be thrown on the relation by other people who would say he was not prepared to look after his kith and kin. Perhaps the Minister would consider that point.</P>
    <P>I do not see why appeals should be heard only about every three or four months.  Is there any reason why there could not be, say, six officers who would go to different parts of the country to hear appeals?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <P>I am including appeals of all kinds.  Why should it be the case that one is told at, say, the end of August that the next appeal will be on 5th December?  There are delays of three and four months.  We must consider the human side of these problems.  The people concerned are left without any money and they cannot go back to work because to do so would mean the loss of the appeal.  In that case the appeals officer would say that there must be nothing wrong with the man.  In some cases a person may be due 12 or 14 weeks' money.  Surely the Minister can set up a particular section within his Department to deal with appeals.  Why should there be such delays while officials are sent from the Department to hear appeals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it is a doctor who must go out on those cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there not plenty of doctors falling over each other in the Department who have nothing to do and who are prepared to work but will not be allowed to do so because they are under the jurisdiction of the executive officials?  The Minister must break through the <Col N="1387" /> system.  He must be aware of the hardships that are caused because of delays.  I understand that in those parts of the country from which the Minister and Parliamentary Secretary come, there are many people dependent on social welfare benefits.  Therefore, they must be aware of the position.</P>
      <P>The only other matter I wish to deal with is that of personal insurance.  In the brochure issued by the Department of Social Welfare there is much information that is of great help to all of us but this brochure does not deal with the question of personal insurance. In this respect I am thinking of fishermen and other people too, such as teachers and those in the higher income bracket.  The introduction of the contributory pension scheme has brought many other people within the ambit of personal insurance.  These people like to be able to look forward to a pension when they reach the autumn of their lives.  Apart from ordinary working people there are many people in what we might call the white collar class who are not eligible for a pension from their employment and they, in particular, like to have a personal insurance.  I am often asked for advice on that matter and when I go to this booklet that I referred to there is nothing in it to help me.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to arrange for the production of some information on this matter.</P>
      <P>I can see that the Minister is very anxious to reply and, no doubt, he will be telling us about what he is doing in the Department.  I hope that in his reply he will remember that we are living in an international age and that he will not deal only with parish pump problems.  As an internationalist, as it were, I would like him to give some indication as to what will be the pattern in the future for social welfare in terms of the EEC and what I believe will come after our accession to the EEC, that is, a united Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time at my disposal I may not be able to cover all the points raised during the debate which was rather a mixed one.  There <Col N="1388" /> were many different approaches and perhaps this is understandable but I was amazed at the variety of references to the Department and, indeed, to the officials of the Department.  At the outset I must say that I was disappointed that in some cases these references reached even a vulgar level. Some Deputies suggested putting a bomb in the Department while others paid high tribute to the courtesy and attention accorded to them by officials of the Department.  In one case we had two completely conflicting references to them from the same party.  I shall come back to that point later.</P>
      <P>Before dealing in a general way with the question of social welfare and social welfare <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Six Counties, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the EEC which, incidentally, I visited recently, and in relation to the reciprocal arrangements that we have by agreement with the United Kingdom, I shall deal with some of the specific points raised.</P>
      <P>The question of old age pensioners usually gives rise to a good deal of discussion and, very often, sensible discussion.  During the time that Deputy Esmonde was speaking about old people's care committees I remembered a story that I heard a long time ago.  This told of a local doctor attending an old man and when the old man asked the doctor if he was very ill, the doctor said: &ldquo;You are geriatric,&rdquo; to which the man replied: &ldquo;Is that curable?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to pay tribute to the many committees who are dealing with the care of the aged throughout the country.  We owe to these people a great debt of gratitude.  Because of their intimate association with the people concerned, they are doing work that no Department or Minister could possibly do.  I am aware that the Minister for Health, too, is very conscious of the work being done by these committees.  His Department, of necessity, have greater contact with them than we do because much of the work they do comes within the ambit of that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the scheme whereby an allowance is paid in respect of a specified relative who looks after an old person, I would remind the House <Col N="1389" /> that when I introduced this scheme there was no provision for it in the Budget.  It could be extended only to those who could prove that they gave up insurable employment so as to care for their aged parents who, otherwise, would be left alone.  This category did not embrace a very large section of the community.  In fact, the number of persons who qualified under that original scheme was quite few but like every other social welfare scheme it was perfectly obvious that once it was introduced there would be an immediate clamour to have it extended to other people.  It was obvious that it would be extended as time went on.  The following year the scheme was extended to include uninsured persons if they were relatives in the particular category. It was further extended last year to include some more relatives who were not in the previous category.  I have been under pressure from my own party, among others, to extend this scheme to male relatives.  This is something which I would like to do because sometimes a male relative who looks after old parents who would otherwise be alone, or old uncles or relatives, has to undergo the same difficult experience as the female would in similar circumstances.  If I could afford it I should like to have the benefit extended to such category of persons in the near future.</P>
    <P>Many people who come with claims regarding this female relative care scheme for the aged do not appreciate what the scheme is all about.  The scheme was originally introduced to make some recompense to persons who, by looking after their parents, obviate the necessity of having them sent to a home.  If a family are living in the house, even though the wife may be a daughter of the old parents, she does not qualify.  The married couple have to live somewhere and they cannot show that they have been seriously inconvenienced by having the use of the house of the parents.  Usually it is quite a different case.  This is not a case which will come in for priority treatment in any future extension of the scheme.  I would be very much in favour of considering extending the scheme to the single male relative living <Col N="1390" /> with parents who would otherwise be alone if he was not there.  Whenever this scheme is being discussed it is always pointed out, with a great deal of justification, that these people would be in a home where the costs of their upkeep would be considerable, if it were not for the fact of having somebody at home to care for them there.</P>
    <P>An old person is happier at his own fireside than anywhere else.  However well the homes for the aged have improved in recent years, their own homes are the places in which old people can be happiest.  I should hope in spite of any social welfare scheme or anything we are committed to give to our aged that the family affection which binds families together until death will not be lacking in our homes yet.  When most of us were young our parents received no social welfare benefits.  We were happy to see them in their own homes until the end and to see that they wanted for nothing. They would get anything that was available in preference to anyone else in the house.  I hope that that spirit is not dead in this welfare age in which we are living.</P>
    <P>When we are complaining about the different categories of old people, we should remember that those of them who live in their own homes with their own families are better off than the lone pensioner who may not have friends or relatives.  A special case was made for this type of person in this House many times.  We have tried to help in many ways.  It is frequently asked now why we do not give the benefits we have given to such lone people to all pensioners.  Many Deputies have pointed out that there is a vast difference between various categories of aged persons.  There are those who live alone in rented houses.  They differ from those who are fortunate enough to have some of their own family living with them in the family home, and to have their immediate relatives to take care of them.  Everyone has agreed that there are two different categories here and that the destitute category merits special attention. They have been given the extra five shillings, the free electricity the free radio and television licences. People sometimes forget that these <Col N="1391" /> arrangements were made to help this particular category.  It was frequently suggested that these benefits should be extended to all the aged.</P>
    <P>I am dealing now with the little extras which were granted to old people and I would like to refer to the free coal scheme.  I was never enamoured of that particular scheme.  It applies only in a few large towns.  It was a product of the war when the case was made that the old could not easily find turf and that their position was difficult.  It was said that the city aged were in a more difficulty position than those in the country and that free coal should be made available to them.  We still have this scheme and it has been extended to coal supplies.  Originally turf was involved and I think there was a suggestion of a monetary payment at the time.  This scheme has continued to be operative long after the war.  Free fuel was given in cities and the scheme does not extend to the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>Free travel was given to pensioners. It costs quite a bit, but it was given to help people, as was the free electricity. Some people have asked why we have not given old people extra money instead.  Very often old people do not utilise money in a way that would benefit themselves.  We believe if they are encouraged to go out and use the free travel concession that this will benefit them more than anything else one could do for them.  The same applies to the free electricity scheme. More old people die of cold than from anything else.  One has only to read the death notices in July as compared with the death notices in February or March to see that this is so.  The death notice columns in the papers in the winter months are four times as long as they are in the summer.  This proves that old people are killed by the cold.  It hastens their deaths.  That is why we were concerned about electricity.  They can use it for their own comfort.  A male pensioner might buy some other type of &ldquo;anti-freeze&rdquo; with money if it was given to him.  The aged are the first to have any claim to social welfare benefits. We always say they are not getting enough and that we will increase their <Col N="1392" /> pensions as soon as possible.  It has been said that it costs £10 to £15 per week to keep old people in what has been referred to as geriatric homes.  It is frequently asked why we do not give them some extra money for a home care service rather than spend so much on keeping them in these homes.  My answer has always been that the local authorities, on whom the cost for the home falls in most cases, might usefully consider a scheme whereby they would pay something to those who look after old people at home.  I mentioned this to the Minister for Local Government recently and I think he was interested, as also is the Minister for Health.  It would be more their business than mine but I would not like a scheme whereby everybody could send a father or mother for a week to a home and then have them brought back and get money for taking them out again.</P>
    <P>From the tone of some speeches it would appear that it is necessary to mention the question of abuses of different schemes which abuses make it necessary to have regulations, ultimately referred to as &ldquo;red tape&rdquo;, and for which we in the Department are criticised.  I was at a number of social welfare conferences and recently at one where most of the social welfare or family affairs Ministers in Europe were present and in conversation outside conference business we discussed this emotive subject of social welfare. I can assure the House that it does not differ from one country to another. Everywhere there is a Parliament when there is a discussion on social welfare, everybody cries for the weaker sections and blames the Government for not doing enough for them.  The same type of criticism is made in every Parliament on the same subject, so far as I can gather in discussions with Ministers I have met from Europe time and again and even only a few weeks ago in Stockholm.</P>
    <P>That is understandable.  But we must take credit.  Perhaps I have been too much on the defensive on this Estimate at times.  When I consider what all of us do, because this is something which the country pays for, which comes out of your pocket and mine, I think <Col N="1393" /> there is no need to be on the defensive about our schemes, either their scope or rates of payment.  It is quite a new code and not many years ago we had nothing except a ten-shilling old age pension, a scheme handed over by the British.  Our social welfare code has been built up in the past 35 years.  Its rise is dramatic and shows a rate of expansion that compares favourably with countries that were pursuing this idea long before we had started.</P>
    <P>We have a relatively small Department carrying out a huge task.  Were it not for the repetitive element it would not be possible for them to cope with the volume of work involved. This should be considered when people are making &ldquo;smart alec&rdquo; criticism of mistakes or delays which inevitably occur from time to time.  I take nobody's part where avoidable mistakes are made; but one must deal with a code set out in an index of regulations and qualifying requirements, which must be examined.  As Deputy Coogan said, the officials do not make these regulations but are handed a book of rules which they must keep.  This House makes the rules; it enacts legislation and naturally it has its limitations. We have not reached the day of instant social welfare when somebody can walk in off the street and say: &ldquo;I am entitled to social welfare: give me a £5 note&rdquo;, and walk out with it.  That would be pretty simple but they must prove they have certain qualifications, which we lay down. While that is so we must have investigation before paying out anything.</P>
    <P>It is not fair for Deputies like Deputy O'Hara to go to extremes in talking of the &ldquo;scandalous system&rdquo; of social welfare and &ldquo;miserable pittances&rdquo; and &ldquo;lack of regard and respect&rdquo;.  That might be all right in Bangor Erris or when it appears in the <i>Mayo News</i> or some local paper; it may have some desired effect there but it does not do any good to anybody else.  A relatively small Department, taking current active insurance cases, is dealing with some 796,164 cases.  If somebody wants his insurance record without the number one can see what a task is imposed on some official with a figure approaching <Col N="1394" /> 1,000,000 registered for insurance.  I did not extract these figures until I had listened to some of the discussion. I think it was Deputy O'Hara who said that the Minister was bluffing with figures.  He did not use the word &ldquo;bluff&rdquo; but he implied that I was using figures that had no relevance to social welfare but sounded good without meaning anything.</P>
    <P>We pay non-contributory old age pensions to 112,500 and contributory old age pensions to 48,000, a figure which tends to grow.  We pay widows' pensions, non-contributory, to 17,400 and contributory pensions which now exceed the non-contributory, to 53,000 persons.  We pay retirement pensions, a new scheme for those aged 65 to 70, to 4,600 persons.  We pay unemployment assistance to 35,000; unemployment benefit to 37,000.  Invalidity pensions, which are comparatively new, are paid to 12,000 persons and disability benefit to 61,000, on a weekly average over the year.  Orphans' contributory and non-contributory pensions, which is always a small figure, is upwards of 1,000.  We have almost 1,000,000 children's allowances for 340,000 families.  Dependent children of widows, contributory and non-contributory, number over 28,000. Maternity benefits average 28,500. Deserted wives' allowances recently introduced are now paid to 1,500 persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told the figure was 2,200.  We have free electricity for 52,000; free travel for 184,000.  Death grants were also recently introduced and we have paid 850 already.  In addition we have marriage grants paid at intervals and maternity grants which we pay to some 39,000; we pay maternity allowances to 8,000 people.  I am not mentioning all of the persons to whom our system reaches out.  This does not include occupational injuries, redundancy payments and many of the benefits to sick persons.  I mention those figures&mdash;and I think it is good to put them on the record&mdash;for the benefit of those who say we do nothing.  That is a stupid statement.  The scope of our <Col N="1395" /> code gives cover virtually from the cradle to the grave and beyond it.</P>
      <P>The rates we are paying are by no means small.  I am not being smug or complacent about our schemes as they stand at the moment.  For a country with a population of less than three million we are paying £134 million currently in social welfare.  That does not take into account what other countries include in their social welfare figures.  It does not include redundancy payments.  Deputy Esmonde accused me of not giving some figures for the EEC countries.  When you make comparisons with those countries, as we have to do frequently, it is a pretty formidable task taking them country for country and item for item.  They include in their social welfare code many things which we do not.</P>
      <P>In some cases they include the salaries of the army and the police force and pensions for civil servants. We would be justified in including in the social services side the cost of education and free travel, and the building of houses for labouring classes. This would all come under the social services but we adhere strictly to the payments side of the Social Welfare Department without throwing in any medical costs.  I think that the figure of £134 million is a reasonable figure. I do not care how you take it as a percentage of GNP, or as a percentage of total revenue, or as a percentage of the total amount in the Book of Estimates each year.  You can take whichever figure can be argued most advantageously or most disadvantageously as the case may be.  It is a reasonably decent sum.  It shows that we have well and truly laid the foundation of a decent welfare code about which we have very little to worry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very recently I had discussions in Brussels with the commissioner directly in charge of this.  The officials of my Department were over there a number of times dealing with the technical adaptations which necessarily arise in relation to our application for membership. We talked in a general way about principles and about the question of harmonisation and standardisation about which a lot of tommyrot is talked.  I would hope that membership <Col N="1396" /> of the EEC would be the lever which would impel us and compel us to have better social welfare payments.  For that reason I am in favour of it.</P>
    <P>The six current members of the EEC have different systems.  It is not easy to compare them item for item.  Actually it is impossible.  Basically one can see at a glance that there is so much more employer participation in their schemes. Indeed, many of their schemes are almost entirely financed by the employers and practically all their schemes are related to wages.  In France a widow's pension is related to what the husband's pension would have been had he survived, and his pension would be based on the salary or wages he would have had, had he lived to retire. In other countries they have totally different systems.  Family allowances are based on different premises.  Disability, unemployment and other payments are quite different.  In most cases they are quite generous.  I am quite prepared to admit that they are generous.</P>
    <P>There is no compulsion&mdash;whether that is considered fortunate or unfortunate&mdash;on a new member state to harmonise with anything.  They expect you to have a certain minimum code of payments and, so long as it does not interfere with the competitiveness of the countries in their economic relationships, they do not worry.  They expect you to be working towards a code and now, through the International Labour Office in Geneva, it is very easy to know what country has what.  We are reasonably happy that our social welfare code is quite respectable in comparison even with the best.  I do not say that to justify our remaining at these rates when we become a member of the EEC.  I would rather hope that membership of the EEC would be the <i>raison d'etre</i> for better payments.</P>

      <P>Will it cost more because a higher percentage of our population are dependent on wage earners?  We have a higher rate of dependants to wage earners than European countries.  Is this not so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason social welfare costs us more in relation to <Col N="1397" /> our population is that on the assistance side the payments are 100 per cent financed from the Exchequer and there is no contribution from anybody.  This is a type of assistance that is not found everywhere, not even in the United Kingdom if you take away the supplementary benefits.  I want to deal with that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our children's allowances, pensions for the blind, non-contributory old age <Col N="1398" /> pensions, non-contributory widows' pensions and unemployment assistance are financed directly from the Ex-Exchequer without requiring any contribution whatever from qualified persons.</P>
