      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak as a supporter of amendment No. 8 in the name of Deputy Thomas J. Fitzpatrick. This proposed change may sound, perhaps, like a not very important change, not a very extensive change, affecting only two words but, yet, it stands at the very core of our opposition to this section.  We object, of course, to the entire section.  We object to the entire Bill, but it is this word &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; particularly which is the most objectionable feature of the whole objectionable Bill.  The Minister has claimed &mdash;it is a bold claim&mdash;that the word &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;advocates&rdquo; in this Bill are equivalent to the word &ldquo;incite&rdquo;, that they add nothing to the meaning.  That is essentially the claim I wish to investigate in some detail this morning, the claim that the words &ldquo;encourages or advocates&rdquo; are the same in their essential meaning as &ldquo;incite&rdquo;, the claim that they would give the Minister no new powers.  I want now to go into some detail about that.  As the Minister makes this claim we will have to see if that claim stands up in the light of accepted authority on the English language and in the light of usage.  To pursue that may, I am afraid, take some time.  As I mentioned last night, if there is objection to the consumption of time in this matter, we agree; we think we should not have to discuss this matter at all. There is a way of dealing with that; it is by withdrawing section 4.</P>
      <P>In my remarks on amendment No. 7 I covered a good deal of ground concerning the generally objectionable character of section 4 and the Chair extended to me a certain amount of latitude, for which I am grateful; I do not propose to seek any such latitude today because I shall be concentrating very, very closely indeed on the meaning of the words in the amendment and the meaning of the words in the section as it will stand without amendment and as it will stand if this amendment is carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make this point: we do not yet know whether or not the Minister will accept this amendment.  He could. He had an opportunity of speaking last night after Deputy Fitzpatrick's very able, very cogent speech introducing <Col N="2842" /> this amendment.  The Minister was here for part of that speech.  He looked in, looked at his own brief, and then he walked out again.  He is a rather restless Minister and we have not seen much of him during this debate.  He was not there when Deputy Fitzpatrick sat down, as he did, I believe, at about ten past ten last night.  There was an opportunity for the Minister to come in at that time and say what his attitude is to this amendment.</P>
    <P>Is he accepting it or not?  There is a rumour that he may be about to accept it; I sincerely hope that that is the case but we would not be justified on the basis of any rumour in dropping our sustained detailed support of this amendment and opposition to this section.  I would make the point that if the Minister does indeed accept this amendment he will be accepting a most significant change in his Bill and that his Bill as it will then stand will be frustrative of what I believe was his main purpose in bringing in this Bill.  I shall be coming a little later to the Minister's statements and to what I think his purpose is in bringing in the Bill.  I think that this word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; is the key to his intent, what I think may well prove to be his baffled and frustrated intent, as regards this part of the Bill that deals with the Press.  The word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; was intended to cast a wide net so that anyone against whom the Minister feels particularly strongly for some reason can be drawn into that net.  Before long, I shall proceed to demonstrate with all the resources which English lexicography permits&mdash; and they are very considerable&mdash;just how wide that net is.  That net in the hands of this Minister would be a weapon which we propose to strike from his hands if we possibly can.  That is the activity in which we are engaged.</P>
    <P>But before I proceed to that portion of my remarks which will take up most of my time I am obliged, for certain reasons, to look at some of the things which Deputies opposite have said about, in particular, the Labour Party, about the character of our support of these amendments, the character of our opposition to section 4.  It may be helpful to the House&mdash; and I want to be helpful to the House <Col N="2843" /> if I can at all&mdash;and to the Press also, to indicate the broad lines on which I shall be speaking.  First of all, I want to deal with a number of Fianna Fáil points made in the debate.  As these are very miscellaneous, very heterogeneous, sometimes very farfetched, I shall be obliged in this part of my speech, in dealing with these things, to range a little bit widely, but no more widely at any point than the debate has already ranged, than it has been carried by Deputies who did not stick very closely to the amendment and by one Deputy who admitted, after he had been speaking for half an hour, that he did not know what the amendment was on which he was deemed by courtesy of the House to be speaking.</P>
    <P>So, let me take up then some of these miscellaneous points, bearing in mind that I shall, after that, come to a different kind of exercise, much more closely bearing on this amendment, because I am in no way distracted from it by irrelevancies or semi-relevancies which have been introduced into this debate, though I may say with respect, a Cheann Comhairle, I am not at all questioning the Chair in allowing them.  I think the Chair deserves to be congratulated on the handling of this debate in realisation of the important, far-reaching character of the issues raised by this amendment, in not restricing the debate to too-narrow and technical description.</P>
    <P>The first point I would take up is a point&mdash;and this is not irrelevant at all; this is a point basic, I think, to the whole discussion of the amendments relating to section 4&mdash;made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Kennedy. Members opposite made the point yesterday&mdash;which was fair enough&mdash; that we should not purport to quote what people said unless we can quote from the official record.  This is good counsel and I shall follow it here.  Of course, it often happens that one is not able to quote from the Official Report because the Official Report is simply not available; it is not in printed form and it is not always easy and convenient to get one's hands on a typescript and, in those circumstances, I think a Deputy is justified, <Col N="2844" /> as Deputy Fitzpatrick certainly was yesterday, in quoting or paraphrasing at least from memory what one heard a Deputy actually say.  But I recognise that the method is fallible; for that matter the Official Report is sometimes fallible, but I agree it is the best source on which we can rely; so, let us consult it.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, the gentleman who holds that very responsible post in our Republic, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy. I propose to quote from our debates of Friday, 16th July, 1971, Volume 255, column 1790.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Kennedy referred to members of our party.  He brought in the question of civil disobedience and that is what I want to say something about here.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that this is an important principle and a somewhat difficult one and that it is relevant to the purposes at which the Bill purports to be aimed and therefore relevant to the discussion of any amendment of it, but the Parliamentary Secretary said, speaking of the Labour Party:</P>
    <P>They are so anxious now to ensure that the principles of civil disobedience be established in our law &mdash;these principles that derive from no source of authority&mdash;that they are prepared to create new criminal offences to accommodate those principles of civil disobedience.  That may be the fashion in other countries where some of the Labour Deputies in their various peregrinations may have met them, but it is not the fashion here ...</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Possibly what Deputy Cruise-O'Brien wants us to do here ... is to substitute for the principles of civil obedience the principles of civil disobedience.  Deputy Cruise-O'Brien appears to hold these principles of civil disobedience as sacrosanct. Whence they have derived we have never been told.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you are about to be told now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien referred <Col N="2845" /> to street protests in America, with which he is not unfamiliar.</P>
    <P>Correct, and I am proud of it.</P>
    <P>They have, apparently, been drawn from some unknown source, not indeed, from the consensus of society.  They have been drawn here from this unknown source and the whole purpose&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>is something or other which is not relevant.  Then, again, he says these principles derive from no source of authority.  &ldquo;No known source&rdquo;&mdash;I am very, very sorry that a gentleman should be Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, God help us, who says that the principles of civil disobedience have no known source, who hints they may be derived from Karl Marx or somebody whom no decent man, not even the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, would claim to know about.  I do not intend to waste much time on that aspect of the matter, but all this exercise was a genteel way of saying what some of those gentlemen over there have less genteel ways of saying, that is to say, that the Labour Party is a bunch of dirty communists. That is what this little belated, forlorn exercise in McCarthyism was all about.  Speaking on the amendment to this section, I shall pay the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education the dubious compliment of believing that he does not know what the sources are for the principle of civil disobedience and I shall proceed to tell him.</P>
    <P>Let me begin with the great classical source for the principle of civil disobedience.  Let me not be misunderstood here.  These gentlemen pretend that anyone who advocates or encourages the view that in certain circumstances civil disobedience may be justifiable and is justifiable are attempting to subvert all law, all organised society, the whole structure of civilisation.  This is what men in authority have eternally claimed about this, and equally eternally in every age the principle has been asserted that unjust law is not binding. Men and women&mdash;and women have done it as often as men&mdash;have <Col N="2846" /> taken it upon themselves to defy, to break a law which they believed to be unjust.  I do not say unjust in some minor way.  There are minor injustices in the law and the people are not justified in breaking the law for any minor reason.  It is only when some great principle is involved that a man or woman may have to stand up, or sit down, and say: &ldquo;No.  I will not put up with this, not even if it is the law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That principle, that theory, is probably as old as human society.  I grant that it is in a sense an alien doctrine. It is an alien doctrine to any man to whom the whole heritage of western culture, the whole of European culture, is alien; if that is alien, then so be it: the principles of civil disobedience are alien.  They did not originate in some parish in County Cork, County Limerick or any other county.  They are at the source of our civilisation.  I do not want to make any disrespectful reference to any county; it is not part of my purpose at all, but my purpose is to try to show that these principles of civil disobedience derive from and are as old as the great twin sources of all our culture, that is to say, all of the culture of Europe.  I say &ldquo;Europe&rdquo;.  I do not say &ldquo;western Europe&rdquo; because I believe the culture of Europe to be essentially one, and to spring from the same sources which have affected the Slavonic world quite as much as western Europe.  These two sources are, of course, the Judean and the Hellenic.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The Chair has allowed the Deputy to make these remarks, but he should come to the amendment, as Standing Order No. 46 forbids the re-opening of a debate.  That is what we are doing at the moment, re-opening a debate on an amendment that has been dealt with by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>May I crave your indulgence a little in this matter? It is of some importance for our group here.  The point is that the allegations which were made against us and, in particular, the insinuations that were made against us, which were very serious insinuations, were designed not only to discredit and disparage our approach to the last amendment and the whole of section 4 but to cast in advance a shadow on what we would say on this amendment or, indeed, what we would say on anything.  I think we are entitled to clear our names by defining the nature of the principles&mdash;and they are very great principles&mdash;which we have been accused of defending and which we have, in fact, the honour of defending, and I hope we shall be allowed to do it.  I do not intend to spend any very long time on this, a Cheann Comhairle; I appreciate your point, but I did want to establish the antiquity and respectable character of these principles.  The <i>locus classicus</i> in antiquity for the principle of civil disobedience is the play <i>Antigone</i> by the poet Sophocles. In that play a sister casts a handful of dust, which is, of course, a Greek <Col N="2848" /> ceremony of burial, upon the body of her brother.</P>
      <P>Her brother was an enemy of the State ruled over at that time by a man called Creon.  She, by casting that handful of dust, committed an illegal act.  The king made a proclamation: &ldquo;No dust to be cast on this corpse&mdash;penalty, death.&rdquo;  She unquestionably broke the law.  She was guilty of an offence under the law then in force at that particular place and time.  She was brought before the king and the following brief piece of dialogue&mdash;Deputies need not fear that Sophocles will be inflicted on them at any great length&mdash;took place.  Creon says, in a spirit which is present with us still, to Antigone:</P>
      <P>Tell me, tell me briefly;</P>
      <P>Had you heard my proclamation touching on this matter?</P>
      <P>Antigone says:</P>
      <P>It was public.  Could I help hearing it?</P>
      <P>Creon says:</P>
      <P>And yet you dared defy the law.</P>
      <P>Antigone replies:</P>
      <P>I dared.</P>
      <P>It was not God's proclamation. That final Justice</P>
      <P>That rules the World below makes no such laws.</P>
      <P>Your edict, King, was strong,</P>
      <P>But all your strength is weakness itself against</P>
      <P>The immortal unrecorded laws of God,</P>
      <P>They are not merely now: they were, and shall be,</P>
      <P>Operative for ever, beyond man utterly.</P>
      <P>That is the classical enunciation of the principle of civil liberty in that speech of Antigone to Creon.  Creon's answer is also the eternal one.  Creon says:</P>
      <P>I'll have no dealings</P>
      <P>With law-breakers, critics of the government:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notice how those categories run together. Creon said it 3,000 years ago and it is still being said that law breakers and critics of the Government are identical in the minds of men <Col N="2849" /> like Creon and in his humble and diminutive successor, the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I'll have no dealings</P>
    <P>With law-breakers, critics of the government:</P>
    <P>Whoever is chosen to govern should be obeyed&mdash;</P>
    <P>Must be obeyed, in all things, great and small,</P>
    <P>Just and unjust!</P>
    <P>That is the spirit of Creon and as I say it is the <i>locus classicus</i>; most things would come as an anti-climax after Sophocles.</P>
    <P>However, let us note on the other side of our Judean-Hellenic heritage the same holds good under the Egyptian, Babylonian and Roman power &mdash;I am not going into the history of all those places.  The Jews asserted the prime thing of the higher law time and again.  There is something above the laws of this place and time and where your law breaks that higher law will ignore it.  It may be a principle in which with the liability of humanity to err there is some danger of arrogance; there is that in the position of Antigone too, but there is also something important and essential to our human nature and essential also to the moral growth and development of our society.</P>
    <P>In the Christian tradition again and again priests, nuns, lay people and others have on occasion dared to break the laws of the places in which they found themselves where they thought those laws incompatible with the higher law.  They have often done that side by side with humanists and with people whose conception of a higher law is somewhat different from theirs.  They are doing it today.  There are bishops, priests, lay people, all kinds of people, who in South Africa day after day, are steadfastly breaking laws which they believe to be evil&mdash;the apartheid laws which are upheld there.  They do that although these laws are undoubtedly part of a code of law deemed to be binding on all the citizens of South Africa and on all those who sojourn there.  These men and women set a higher law above all that.  They are deliberately, persistently, day after day, hour after hour, in breach of the <Col N="2850" /> law.  We honour them for it, at least most of us do, because we too believe those laws to be wrong.  We are implying by that if we believe a law to be profoundly and utterly wrong on an important matter one has a moral right to break that law although one may have a penalty to pay for that.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this matter of civil disobedience let me put an extreme case.  Deputies opposite speak as if there are no cases in which civil disobedience could be necessary although they of course stand in a tradition which holds that something much more than civil disobedience can be not only proper but necessary, that is armed violence and armed rebellion. That is what they have said.  That is where their Partheon stands.  That is where their whole cult is and now they have the nerve to accuse us of improper behaviour for suggesting that civil disobedience may only sometimes be necessary.</P>
    <P>Let me put an extreme case to the House.  This position would have to be held by a man who said that civil disobedience is never justifiable, the law must always be carried out.  The German people, within living memory, had a code of laws known as the Nuremberg Laws and under those laws and under the regulations and practices which were encouraged by the legal German Government to grow up around them, it became a capital offence to be a Jew.  It was a similar offence to harbour a person; they were mainly Jews who were proscribed by the law.  What would a decent person do who was approached by a Jew fleeing from the operation of those laws, fleeing from murder?  Any decent person if he had any guts at all would harbour and shelter that fugitive and help him to escape from the operation of these iniquitous laws.</P>
    <P>What would a person who holds what seems to be Deputy O'Kennedy's principles on civil disobedience do? Since apparently he does not know even what the sources are for the idea, I do not know what he really thinks, but he speaks as if he believes that anyone who holds that civil disobedience is ever justifiable is a scoundrel, a crypto-commi and all the <Col N="2851" /> rest of it.  If he holds those views, and if he holds them logically&mdash;I do him again the limited honour of believing that he does not hold them or any other views very logically&mdash;and if he were approached by a Jew in those circumstances, he would of course as a law abiding citizen of the Third Reich do his duty, he would hand that Jew over to the officers of the law and the officers of the law would take that Jew off to the gas chamber.  That is the logical consequence of saying: &ldquo;No civil disobedience ever.&rdquo;  If a person would not hand over that Jew then he has no right to say or imply &ldquo;no civil disobedience ever&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The roll of civil disobedience martyrs includes not only Henry David Thoreau in America and Mahatma Gandhi but also Terence McSwiney. I have said enough about civil disobedience but it was important to make this point of principle and to make our clarification on it so that it may be seen in what general spirit we approach this amendment, not in the spirit imputed to us but in a quite different spirit altogether.  I am impressed by your admonition, a Cheann Comhairle, and will be guided by it.  I do not need to spin out time with Fianna Fáil amendments.  I have matter enough to keep me going for a considerable time without that and the object is not to spend time.  The object is to strip away the irrelevancies and innuendos which the party opposite have intruded into the debate and to make it as clear as we can how utterly coercive is the case in favour of the amendment.  This needs to be done.  We need to pare away the obstructions.  It will not be long before we get the main point which is the meaning of the amendment and of this section.  This amendment comes as a last resort after an attempt to delete the whole section was defeated. Some of these points must be discussed. One point which was made repeatedly in the debate concerned the visit of the South African Spring-bok team and the attitude taken to the team at that time.</P>

I accept that the Chair has made a ruling and I bow to that ruling.  I accept it, but may I in doing so register a protest that we have been attacked here.  The Springboks issue was raised by many Deputies, <Col N="2854" /> including Deputy Moore, Deputy Burke and Deputy Dowling.  How could they have been speaking with relevance to the amendment when one of them did not know what amendment he was speaking on?  It was part of a general attack on the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>The amendment in which you are interested hinges on the words &ldquo;encourages or&rdquo;.  It seeks to remove those words as particularly objectionable.  I have no legal training or experience.  The pressing of this amendment has been conducted with immense ability and determination by Deputies Fitzpatrick and Cooney of Fine Gael.  I shall not follow them or try to overlap in any way what they have said.  I suppose each Deputy who has spoken so far has introduced something of his own experience or of his training, competence or reason and that should be so.

      <P>Let me say something that may be a little heretical and which may even scandalise Members opposite: I love the second official language.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of this and this is pertinent to the point I was making.  The point I was making is a little complicated so I hope the House will bear with me.  If we had the Irish words of the amendment and of the Bill then Deputies who know Irish and use that language in the sense of discrimination, in the sense of distinction, these Deputies could elucidate for us the meaning of these words in Irish.  I agree, of course, that the meaning of these words in Irish has no bearing on the statute as such but if this Bill is passed one of the first things that will happen will be that its constitutionality will be tested. In the Constitution and in discussion of the Constitution it is the Irish text which will prevail.  The Irish text is deemed to be the true text of the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Constitution.  The English text reads:</P>
      <P>Where the President signs the text of a Bill in one only of the official languages, an official translation shall be issued in the other official language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gcás an tUachtarán do chur a láimhe le téacs Bille i dteangain de na teangthacha oifigiúla agus insan teangain sin amháin, ní foláir <Col N="2860" /> tionntú oifigiúil do chur amach insan teangain oifigiúil eile.</P>
    <P>So you have to have an official translation. The Bill will be judged on its constitutionality in the light of a text in the Irish language.  The Irish language and the English language are different in many ways.  They are rather remote from each other, branches of the Indo-European family. Their assumptions and systems of distinction are different.  We would have liked to have had a discussion on words like &ldquo;spreagadh&rdquo; and &ldquo;gríosadh&rdquo;, on their relative meaning, on the usage of these words in our ancient literature and to see whether &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; or &ldquo;advocate&rdquo; and a Gaelic word for &ldquo;incite&rdquo;&mdash;I am not sure what it would be&mdash;would correspond in that official version which I think becomes relevant through the fact that it is the Irish language which is used for the final test of constitutionality.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour that but the fact that these amendments and this Bill are not before us in the Irish language, in a text which is going to be subjected to close semantic scrutiny, is an index of the hypocrisy of our Government towards this matter, a purely ceremonial use of the Irish language. There is much more I could say there but I do not intend to do so.</P>
    <P>I wish to discuss the meanings of four words.  I think you will agree that these are words which are pertinent to our discussion.  The four words are &ldquo;encourages&rdquo;, &ldquo;advocates&rdquo;, &ldquo;or&rdquo;&mdash;those are the three words which are in the amendment&mdash; and the word which the Minister claims to be identical with them, the word &ldquo;incites&rdquo;.  Deputies who have spoken before have rightly drawn attention to dictionary definitions of these terms.  They have used dictionaries which are good working dictionaries, suitable for day to day purposes such as we all use almost every day, I suppose, but this is a matter where a Minister is claiming that a pair of words in the English language correspond exactly with another word in the English language, adds nothing, that &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; adds nothing to &ldquo;incites&rdquo;, that &ldquo;advocates&rdquo; adds nothing to &ldquo;incites&rdquo;, <Col N="2861" /> that these words are all the same. They may be all the same to him, and he has told us his view of that, and would have us accept on his authority that these words are all the same, change the law and let us go. It is our duty to be critical of this and for this purpose I have brought here the Oxford English Dictionary. This is the dictionary of which the Shorter Oxford Dictionary, in two volumes, is a reduction, the Concise Oxford Dictionary is a still further reduction and the Shorter Oxford Dictionary a smaller one still.  There is, I think, a Pocket Oxford Dictionary, the smallest of all.  The Pocket Oxford will do for some things but I am afraid it will not do for this. People talk about words as if they were exact synonymns.  The Minister is particularly cavalier in his approach.  Almost any word will do for another if the word will enable him to get at whoever he wants to get at. Let me look at what the Minister said on this subject.  Although he spoke in relation to a previous amendment it is of clear relevance here.  I shall quote from the Official Report for Friday, 16th July, 1971&mdash;Volume 255, columns 1782 to 1784.  The Minister for Justice placed on the record a letter which he apparently wrote to the <i>Cork Examiner</i>.  It is dated 9th June, 1971.  It has been quoted here before, but I wish to relate it to the rather detailed exercise of the examination of the meaning of these words. I quote:</P>
    <P>... The editorial sets out to explain to your readers that, because the effect of a section in the Bill is that it would be an offence for a person to incite others to commit a crime...</P>
    <P>He used the words &ldquo;to incite others&rdquo;. Notice that in informing the public about the Bill he does not tell the public in Cork what the Bill actually says.  He says what he says its effect would be.  I think Deputies will form their own opinion as to whether that is an entirely honest or candid procedure. He gets in the word &ldquo;incites&rdquo; which is not in the Bill at all for very good reason, because the Minister wants to extend the scope of the law to catch <Col N="2862" /> in its net people whom he has not been able to get at, as he says, so far.  He says:</P>
    <P>Obviously your leader writer must be unaware of the fact that it is already, and has from time immemorial been, a criminal offence for anybody&mdash;be he journalist or otherwise&mdash;to incite another person to commit a crime.</P>
    <P>This may be so but it is not incitement we have here, it is encouragement or advocacy.</P>

      <P>There is a point of order here which interests me.  It may be my lack of experience and, perhaps, the Chair would give me some guidance on it.  There are two words referred to in the amendment but the amendment refers to a particular line in the Bill.  In discussing the relevance and significance of the amendment, <Col N="2863" /> surely the words stand in a sentence of the Bill?  Am I correct in assuming that one is in order if one discusses the particular sentence the amendment seeks to alter?  Surely one would still be in order simply discussing not other sections of the Bill, or even the whole of the particular section, but the actual line it is intended to amend? Otherwise it seems to me one could not look at the sense of the amendment if one were confined to the formal words of the amendment.  Perhaps, the Chair could give us guidance on this matter.</P>

      <P>A person who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence under section 2 or 3 of this Act shall be guilty of an offence.</P>

      <P>I understand and respect the Chair's ruling.  The relevance at this point of the linking of the words &ldquo;encourages or advocates&rdquo; to the section is that we must <Col N="2865" /> show why we deem it advisable to get the words &ldquo;encourages or&rdquo; deleted. Part of the case for that is that the Minister in his defence in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and elsewhere has urged that not merely is &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; equivalent to &ldquo;incite&rdquo; but it is equivalent to &ldquo;advocate&rdquo;.  If it is relevant to discuss one of these things it is relevant to discuss the other because it is the Minister's claim that the terms are identical.  Therefore, because of the Minister's claim we may take it that the three word are identical and if we talk about &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; we cannot avoid talking about &ldquo;advocates&rdquo; or &ldquo;incites&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I was quoting from a letter the Minister deliberately read into the Official Report&mdash;at column 1782, Vol. 255 of the 16th July, 1971.  My point is that the Minister is arguing the terms are the same because he has stated that from time immemorial it has been a criminal offence for anyone to incite another <Col N="2866" /> person to commit a crime.  The Minister also said:</P>
      <P>It follows that there is no possible basis for what is said in the editorial.</P>
      <P>The Minister substitutes another word in his explanation for the word he has in the Bill and he says it follows from the other words he has used that there is no basis for the attack on the Bill. What kind of logic is that?  The Minister has made the claim that &ldquo;encourages or advocates&rdquo; is the same as &ldquo;incites&rdquo; and he has stated that the words &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; or &ldquo;advocates&rdquo; add nothing to the law as it stands.  The Minister then must meet the objection that, if this is so, why is he putting them into the Bill. Why does he put such an extraordinary price on keeping the Bill that he resists this amendment, if resisting this amendment is what he is doing?  We do not know yet what he is doing but, if he is resisting it, he is certainly wasting a great deal of time.  The Minister has made the claim that these words are identical. Then what is his case for introducing these novel words?  I think the only reason, so far as I know, that he has given here is the curious one that the words &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; or &ldquo;advocates&rdquo; are more modern words than &ldquo;incites&rdquo;.  He is apparently stung by having been accused at some time of archaism and he wishes to expunge forever this affront to his dignity by substituting &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; or &ldquo;advocates&rdquo; in this section of the Bill for &ldquo;incites&rdquo;, claiming they mean the same thing.  I do not think they do. You see, he implies at another point &mdash;he says they mean the same thing but he does not speak as if they do&mdash; that this is why he is holding on to section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall quote again now from the Official Report of 16th July where the Minister gives us his reasons.  He is, I think, rather candid in this about his reason for holding on to section 4 and making such a pother about section 4. Of course, in section 4, we must always understand that, when someone is talking about section 4, he is talking about it with the words we object to in it, &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; or &ldquo;advocates,&rdquo; and these words which we are now <Col N="2867" /> trying to get out form the entire gravamen of the case against the section of the Bill as well as the case for this amendment.  At column 1781 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It would have been very easy for me to introduce this Bill with sections 2 and 3 and without section 4. It would have been easy for me, when section 4 was objected to, to drop that section from the Bill but, if I had done so, I would have been failing in my duty to get at the subversive organisations and the people who made it their business to stay in the background but to encourage and advocate...</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that here the Minister says &ldquo;encourage and advocate&rdquo;, but that is not what he says in the Bill; in the Bill he says &ldquo;encourage or advocate&rdquo;.  With &ldquo;encourage and advocate&rdquo; you have to prove two things but with &ldquo;encourage or advocate&rdquo; you have to prove only one thing.  With respect to Deputy Cooney, when he spoke about this Bill creating an offence he misstated; I think it creates two offences, &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; or &ldquo;advocates.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Now, at one and the same time, this section means nothing at all.  It does nothing but it also enables the Minister somehow to get at these subversive organisations.  What is the key to that reply by the Minister?  I will show that the key is that the Minister knows that &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; is not the same as &ldquo;incites&rdquo;, that it throws a wider net, and he hopes to catch in that net some people he has in mind.</P>
      <P>We cannot solve this problem and neither can we solve a lot of other similar or analogous problems unless we get at those who are in the background and those who are members of organised subversive groups.</P>
      <P>So it enables the Minister to do something and it does not enable the Minister to do anything.  We do not know. That is the puzzle.  But he gave us that reason for the Bill&mdash;it will enable him to get at organisations which are subversive. We do not even know what these are.  I think it is highly probable the Minister would regard the Irish Labour Party as a subversive organisation. And he will get at us.  I am sure he would dearly like to, if he thought he could get away with it, and so would some of his colleagues.  This is a very literary session of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>We were at the point that we know that the Minister thinks that the section, an unspecified part of the section&mdash;it may be the word in this amendment, or it may not&mdash;will enable him to get at some unspecified people whom he dislikes and whom he describes as members of organisations which he considers subversive.  Is the word &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; the key to that?  We think it is.  The Minister has said very little&mdash;he could, of its nature, say very little&mdash;about his reason for putting in words he claims are identical to a word which is already a part of the law and the usage of which has been defined in various legal decisions.  My point is, of course, that that word is hemmed in by restrictions because of these decisions, but &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; is more flexible.  What specific reason has the Minister given for putting in these words &ldquo;encourages or advocates&rdquo;? The reason he has given is that these words are somehow more modern or swinging.</P>

      <P>More with it, more-where-it-is-at, than the word &ldquo;incite&rdquo;.  That is an interesting claim, but it does not happen to be true. The words &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; and &ldquo;incite&rdquo; are, in fact, of equal antiquity. Encourage is not a modern word at all.  It is as old as the English language in its standard form, as old as the earliest printed books in English. It dates back to the late 15th century.  It was used by Kett and so was &ldquo;incite&rdquo;.  They have been there all along, part of the English language for as long as we know it, from the time it emerged as a standard language out of the various dialects which had prevailed up to then.  This term which this Minister, who advises us about the meaning of words, tells us is a modern word is a 15th century word, of 15th century coinage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the word &ldquo;advocate&rdquo;, <Col N="2870" /> which is identical with &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; according to the Minister, is of more recent coinage.  It was first used by Edmund Burke in the 1760s and it was objected to as an innovation by Benjamin Franklin in 1789.  There is that to be said for the Minister's claim that this is a modern word.  It is not a modern word.  There is also the claim that the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There have been references to the use by an tUachtarán of a dictionary; I think it is all to his honour that as a scholar and a gentleman he had recourse to lexicography when matters of serious moment of definition were under debate.  One should do that, I think. It is very wrong for people to hold the practice of consulting a dictionary in disrepute.  We had the claim that these are more modern terms, that &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;, this 15th century word, is more modern than &ldquo;incite&rdquo;, that other 15th century word.  That is a reason given and it is as weighty as any of the other reasons we have been given for changing our law in this matter, putting in &ldquo;encourages or advocates&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is another reason for which we might have some respect.  At least on the surface it seems plausible.  That is the claim that this is ordinary plain language of the man-in-the-street. The Minister knows that in any pub you drop into you will hear people talk about advocacy and advocates and so on.  He claims that this is ordinary plain language and the Minister has this ambition to make this statute plain.  That is why I suppose we have in section 1 of the Bill:</P>
      <P>... any person having an estate or interest in land (including a person who remains in occupation of land after the determination of his tenancy therein), the owner of the servient tenement (in relation to an easement or profit <i>à prendre</i>), the owner of an easement or profit <i>à prendre</i> (in relation to the servient tenement) and, in relation to land or a vehicle,...</P>
      <P>That is right.  I mean, whenever the Minister drops in to see Deputy Gallagher there is talk of profit <i>à prendre</i>, I am sure.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a brief explanation of the principles on which the larger <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, the real authority on the English language, works.  It is based on the series originally known as <i>A New English Dictionary</i>, a great work of 19th-century scholarship.  It is described as a dictionary based on historical principle, that is to say, it examines the meaning of a word; it does not just give a pat definition.  It is conscious of the fact that language is a living web, that the shades of meaning change in different contexts, and it relates words to other words in ways which are extremely significant. In the course of this it is concerned to establish usage.  The whole system depends on usage.  You see before you this rather strange and wonderful panorama of the way in which a word has evolved.  Of course, like any lexicon, a dictionary is only an abbreviation or condensation of actual usage, and it is the usage that is important.</P>
      <P>The first meaning of the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; is &ldquo;to inspire with courage, animate, inspirit&rdquo;.  A reference is given in Caxton, 1489: &ldquo;They were greatly encouraged with good hope.&rdquo;  Smith, in 1637: &ldquo;God would have Joshua encouraged with all the encouragement that may be.&rdquo;  Another 17th-century use is that of Drumm.  Of Hawth: &ldquo;By encouraging those who for their own interest pretend religion.&rdquo; That is a rather interesting one.  It seems they were around in the 17th century too.</P>

      <P>Defoe, 1722: &ldquo;That which encouraged them was that the city was healthy.&rdquo;  Emerson, 19th-century usage: &ldquo;Whatever appeals <Col N="2874" /> to the imagination wonderfully encourages and liberates us.&rdquo; It is encouraging even to read some of these usages.  There is a subset of meanings, and there is an early usage in More's <i>Utopia:</i>&ldquo;This verily is the chief cause that hath encouraged me.&rdquo;  In 1647, Ward: &ldquo;Prayers to the God of power and goodness would encourage your hearts.&rdquo; Steele&mdash;and the gentlemen opposite will like this: &ldquo;Jack was encouraged at this success.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>What I completed there was meaning one of the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; according to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>.  There are four main shapes of definitions, shall we say, which the dictionary uses.  The second one will please the Minister very much at first sight: &ldquo;To inspire with courage sufficient for any undertaking; to embolden; make confident&rdquo;.  This is a somewhat more specific one.  I want people to try to see the point I am making here.  The point is that the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; casts a very wide net, that it includes terms with narrower spans such as &ldquo;incite&rdquo;, and it includes much weaker words; we shall be able to see that in some of these usages.  I have to quote the entire definition and to pursue the meanings also of the words used to define the word if we are to get exactly what will be done by including this word &ldquo;encourages&rdquo;. I shall faithfully read out definitions and usages which would seem to conform to what the Minister has said.  My point is, very roughly speaking, that it is not enough to be rough or vague in this matter as the Minister has been.  The nub of it is that &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; includes &ldquo;incites&rdquo; but &ldquo;incites&rdquo; does not include &ldquo;encourages&rdquo;. &ldquo;Encourages&rdquo; includes some wider, weaker usages which enable a net to be thrown, which enables people to be got at, to use the <Col N="2875" /> Minister's own words, who could not be got at if it were just left at &ldquo;incites&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This, therefore, is my purpose in pursuing with as much diligence as I can muster the span of meanings covered by this word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;: &ldquo;to inspire&rdquo;; the second meaning then: &ldquo;constructed to, with substantive as object&rdquo;&mdash;this is the kind of thing the Minister has in mind; you are encouraging someone to do something&mdash;&ldquo;transitive&rdquo;; &ldquo;to inspire with courage sufficient to any undertaking; to embolden; make confident&rdquo;.  We have a 16th-century use from Eden: &ldquo;That they might be encouraged to do the like&rdquo;.  A 17th-century usage in Hobbes's <i>Leviathan:</i>&ldquo;Presumeth on his force ... which encourages him to commit the same again&rdquo;.  That is the type of meaning the Minister has in mind. Notice about this modern word what its antiquity is, these 15th-, 16th- and 17th-century usages.  This is the word which the Minister intends to force upon us in order that his legislation may appear modern, that he may have a more modern image.  It is a very petty purpose in legislating anyway. Then we have an 18th-century use in Cooper: &ldquo;John Gilpin first encouraged you to write&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I shall have to make the point in my own defence that sometimes when I am interrupted I am likely to lose my place.  I am reading here rather fine print and I am constrained to use a magnifying glass.  Each time I am interrupted I am so very sensitive and it hurts me so much that I sometimes lose my place on the page and then it is necessary to look for my place again and in doing so there is a danger I might consume more time than I would wish.  I do not want to consume any more time than is necessary to demonstrate the danger of this word &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; and the related word &ldquo;or&rdquo; which I am coming to in a moment.  There is another early 19th-century <Col N="2876" /> use of this word which is very important in the link of meaning to this word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;.  Miss Ferrie, in 1824, writing a letter, says: &ldquo;I feel encouraged to the liberty I am going to take by the kindness you showed me.&rdquo;  Notice that if you show somebody kindness you may be encouraging him to do something.  It may be kindness to a potential law breaker, a kind act to a person engaged in squatting.</P>

      <P>I was making the point that this particular definition I am coming to which is 2 (b) in the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> set of definitions and usage is the one on which the Minister would rely.  The Minister says that &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; and &ldquo;incites&rdquo; are exactly the same.  I agree with him that &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; in 2 (b) and &ldquo;incite&rdquo; are the same thing or include the same things.  We have:</P>
      <P>to incite, induce, instigate; in weaker sense, to recommend, advise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I correct myself, and I would like to say that the Minister's claim that &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; means exactly the same as &ldquo;incite&rdquo; is true for this small bit, for the first half of the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> definition 2 (b), running up to incite, induce and instigate.  Then you have the weaker sense after the semicolon &ldquo;to recommend, advise&rdquo;. It means that this has the same meaning running out from &ldquo;incite&rdquo; at one end to &ldquo;to recommend, advise&rdquo;. Therefore, all these meanings are dragged into this statute by the use of the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;, the word we are trying to get out.  It would make it an offence not merely to incite but to <Col N="2878" /> recommend or advise.  These are quite weak words.  The Minister is trying to get at those who recommend and advise by pretending that they have incited.  This word has a wide span so the definitions are important here.</P>
    <P>The first usage is a very early one. It is 1483, Caxton's <i>Cato</i>.  It is exactly the usage the Minister has in mind. &ldquo;They encourage some persone to do euyl.&rdquo;  That is what the Minister has in mind.  He pretends that the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; which he would substitute in this Bill for the ordinary wording of the common law has only this meaning.  There is a more innocuous 17th-century use by Sir R. Dudley in the <i>Fortesque Papers</i>&mdash;&ldquo;to incurrage his Highnes to undertake a matter of that consequence&rdquo;.  John Dryden uses it, &ldquo;Water him and encourage him to thirst again, with Bran&rdquo;.  Jowett the classical scholar uses it in his <i>Plato</i> in 1875&mdash;&ldquo;We are not encouraging individuals to make right or wrong for themselves.&rdquo;  Another meaning is to encourage, to come, to invite.  I will not waste time on the usages of that because it is obsolete and rare.  There is a third usage of some importance&mdash;&ldquo;to stimulate (persons or personal efforts) by assistance, reward, or expressions of favour or approval&rdquo;.  Expression of approval comes in on that and it is very vital.  This is the lexical proof of what we have been saying and the lexical disproof of what the Minister has been saying about the effect of this to stimulate persons or personal efforts by assistance, reward or expressions of favour or approval, to countenance to patronise.  Even to countenance a thing, not to be angry, not to denounce people in the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&ldquo;The ruffian wrote an editorial in which he did not condemn the recent case of squatting&rdquo;&mdash;that is enough. These are the span of meanings, these are the set of meanings which the Minister has the effrontery to tell us are covered by the word &ldquo;incite&rdquo;.  I shall have to come to the word &ldquo;incite&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I shall look up the definition of that if the Deputy likes.  I do not think the Chair would patronise or countenance it.  I was answering a question raised by Deputy Browne.  A strong use in the sense in which I am using the term is a term like incite where there is a conscious, deliberate attempt to move a person in a given direction, which is known.  If you incite a man to a crime you are a partner in the crime, that is what you intend him to do.  You tell him to &ldquo;get up there and throw that bomb&rdquo; or as the Provisionals are saying in <Col N="2880" /> Derry now, &ldquo;Get out there and throw that stone so that the British troops will fire back and there will be somebody dead.&rdquo;  That is what we mean by incite but encourage can be done without voluntary intent at all.  Something an editor writes or says may encourage somebody whom he had never seen to do something he had never dreamt of. It is altogether wide.  We see in the structure of meanings of this under countenance and patronise even if he refrains from doing anything, even if he is just quietly countenancing something, if he is encouraging somebody by his example to go out and do something which may be criminal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Encourage&rdquo; looks just a little word like any other, a tiny change in the statute, but quite suddenly the floodgates are open and opening the floodgates is the intention here.  The Minister wants to throw out this net so that he may &ldquo;get at&rdquo; anyone he dislikes.  He dislikes a great many people and we do not know just who he wants to get at at the moment but &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; is flexible enough to let him get in his net a great many people.  I am holding up the meshes of this net, latent in this word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;, for the Chair's inspection, under this important section 3, to stimulate, to countenance, to patronise, and at the end, in bad sense &ldquo;to abet&rdquo;.  This the Minister says is what he means.  He means to abet, he does not mean to countenance, patronise, <i>et cetera</i>.  The word will be there, irrespective of the meaning the Minister for Justice may assign to it.  If this section is passed unamended it will have in it the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; and when that is being interpreted lawyers will look at their own legal precedents but they will also have in mind the common meaning of the word as generally understood.  It is these set of definitions, they are not something dreamt up from the sky by the pundits who prepared the Oxford English Dictionary, they are a reduction to order of the meaning of this word as it has accumulated through time based primarily on the speech and assumptions of ordinary people but carried to us in printed books, newspapers and letters.  That is the scope of the net and that is why the <Col N="2881" /> Minister wants it.  He does not want it because it means the same as incite, which it does to only a part of its extent, not because it is a more modern word which it demonstrably is not&mdash; I have demonstrated that&mdash;and not because it is in common usage, which is neither here nor there.  The reason he wants it in is that it includes all these other sub-meanings, any one of which can be used.</P>

I am not here to plead for anybody.  We should have an Irish text.  It has become the practice in this House, the majority of whom deem themselves to be the guardians of the great treasury of the Irish language, not to waste time with the Gaelic when there is business to be done.  The Irish is for commemorations and similar pious occasions. Since the constitutionality of this Bill is in doubt and will be tested and since the text of the Constitution that will have priority will be the Irish language, this text should be before the House in respect of the Bill and the amendments.  Of course, it is the Government who are responsible for this Bill.  Discussion on the Bill should be in both languages.  We should have before us Dinneen and other more modern authorities.  We should have, too, the Academy dictionaries and we should be searching these to find out what is the meaning of the Irish words that the Government are proposing because that would be very useful to the lawyers when they come to examine the constitutionality of the Bill.</P>

We have here, too, a 17th-century book, one that was not published to abate students industry but to encourage it, &ldquo;abate&rdquo; being the opposite of &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;.

      <P>I have been asked for an Irish usage and we have one here from Richard Brinsley Sheridan who, in this publication of 1777 said:</P>

We give them credit for anything they do that is good in the same way as we resist anything they do that is bad.  Then, we have Rogers writing in 1866:</P>

      <P>I think he meant birds in the ornithological sense.  Then <Col N="2884" /> there is an interesting usage in relation to our amendment and our Bill:</P>
      <P>Among the group who encouraged the Press of taxdom was Richard, Duke of Gloucester.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If somebody like Richard, Duke of Gloucester, were to encourage the Press and if it was a section of the Press which gave aid or countenance or patronage to the activities of squatters, then, the modern equivalent of Richard, simply by encouraging the Press, would fall within this great net which the Minister has sought to smuggle in here.  He has not told us candidly what he is doing.  If he had been honest he should have come here and said: &ldquo;People are getting away with things which they should not be getting away with.  Incite is not enough. I want you to untie my hands and give me a wider usage so that we can reach out and take in people we are not getting. In order to do that the word `encourage' is necessary.&rdquo;  If he had done that, while we would certainly have continued to oppose the section and press the amendment, we would have done so with respect for the honesty and the candour of the man who came forward and told us exactly what he was doing.  But we cannot have any admiration for a man who seeks to widen the scope of the law for a purpose that is quite unknown and who then tells us that the law is not to be changed in any particular because &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; is the same as &ldquo;incite&rdquo; and that he is only modernising.  He is just bringing in this word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;, which was first used in the 15th century, because it is a modern word and it is a good thing to do.  That is the only reason he has given for this word. He has given us another reason and a more honest one for the section which is that it enables him to get at people whom he cannot get at while the law remains as it is.  That is what he wants. That was what he said on section 4 as a whole.  What he said on &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; was not honest because he was not being clear and candid with the House. At least he was not being any more clear and candid with the House than Deputy Jim Gibbons, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, deemed it appropriate to be on a well-known <Col N="2885" /> occasion.  How candid that was each Deputy must judge for himself.  I have dealt with the third set of meanings for &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;.  I now come to the fourth.  No, I do not come to the fourth.  I do not want to skip over anything.</P>

I want Deputies to see that there is a serious purpose in this investigation of the range of meanings of this word, the word which the Minister claimed to by synonymous with &ldquo;incite&rdquo;, which has a different range of meanings.

      <P>I did not think he would have to be called for.  I thought he would be all agog in such a debate.  The word we are discussing is &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;.  I shall read that definition again: &ldquo;To allow or promote the continuance or development of a natural growth, an industry, a sentiment, to cherish, to foster&rdquo;.  Notice the span between the two words &ldquo;allow&rdquo; and &ldquo;promote&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Encourage&rdquo; can be feeble or it can be strong and the Minister wants to include the feebler range of meanings because it will enable him to get at people he would not get at otherwise, wording in an editorial which might not be incitement but might be encouragement.  Notice that extraordinary weak word.  I want to emphasise the weak usages here because it is the weak usages which distinguish this from &ldquo;incite&rdquo; which has only got strong usage.  The usages given of that&mdash;an early usage, 16th century, Yarnton: &ldquo;If the iron manufacturer be not encouraged.&rdquo;  Of course you can encourage good things as well as bad. What the Minister has in mind are things which he thinks to be bad but things he thinks to be bad we might well think to be good.  We do not know what is in the Minister's mind but we can find out what this word means.</P>
      <P>I have been accused by some Deputies of making a display of education. Nothing of the kind is involved here. If anything is being displayed and urged on Deputies, encouraged, advocated, it is willingness to learn, to go to a good source, see what is said, pursue the meaning of the word through all its different ranges.</P>

      <P>I would if I could incite them.  If I knew that the consequence of my act would be that they would learn something I would incite them to learn.  I do not think learning is yet a criminal activity.  Some of these Deputies behave as if it were. You have in Congreve: &ldquo;I have encouraged a pimple here too.&rdquo;  Then a relevant usage.  All these usages are relevant because they are part of a pattern of meanings of this word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; which we want to get out of this Bill.  We are willing to expend some considerable effort on getting this word out.  The Government could save themselves a lot of trouble if they omitted &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; from the Bill.</P>
      <P>The next usage is particularly relevant. It is Knox's <i>Winter Evening</i> in which it is stated: &ldquo;books of controversy are less encouraged.&rdquo;  If this Bill goes through with the word &ldquo;encourages&rdquo;, books of controversy will be less encouraged, or rather they will be less encouraged if they are on one particular side of the controversy.  The aim of this Bill is to ensure that people who think in ways the Minister does not like will not be able to speak out: the aim is to gag and that is what we are opposing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keating spoke recently on the scientific use of this term and this has a bearing on the subject.  A 19th-century usage gives us: &ldquo;sunshine encourages the perceptible growth of flowering plants.&rdquo;  The Minister claims that this term &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; is modern, but in fact it was used in the 15th century.  It is nonsense to suggest that the Minister is using this word because it is &ldquo;mod&rdquo;.  George Eliot in a rather sinister sentence&mdash;which one might expect from that dark and tragic mind&mdash;remarked &ldquo;he grasped at a thought more actively cruel than any he had ever encouraged before&rdquo;.  I do not think that sombre insight is relevant here although it might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; is also used in a humorous way&mdash;to put spirits into liquor.  I think it is rather unlikely that it would be made an offence in that <Col N="2888" /> context.  I should like to state I am not arguing that if this Bill becomes law all of these meanings will be applied indiscriminately.  I am trying to establish what might be called the ecology of the word, the structure of the word and its strength and reach.  There is a 17th-century usage in Hobbes's <i>Thucydides:</i>&ldquo;encouraging their want of knowledge with store of men&rdquo;&mdash; in this context it means to compensate for and this is part of the range of meaning.  In Fuller's <i>History of Cambridge</i> in 1655 we have the great humanist, Erasmus.</P>

      <P>I am drawing on the greatest, the fullest and most respected sources of information we have regarding the meaning of the <Col N="2889" /> word we are trying to get at&mdash;to use the Minister's vocabulary.  The Minister wants to get at some unspecified persons and we want to get at the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; in the context the Minister would have it.</P>
      <P>If it is a crime to encourage, by definition encouragement is a crime.  It is my pleasant duty to read a definition of the word &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo;. Incidentally, I forgot to mention the etymology of the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; which, I assume, Deputies know already.  It comes from the French word <i>encourager</i>, which derives from the word &ldquo;<i>coeur</i>&rdquo; meaning heart.  It means that it is not just a matter of deliberately inciting someone to do something but it means even to cheer up the person who is on his way to squat in Hume Street; it means to say &ldquo;Good Morning&rdquo; to Deirdre McMahon.  That is encouraging but it is not instigation and it is not covered by the present law.  However, it would be covered by this Bill and this is the intention to get at them.  I am giving a brief run through the usage of the word but I am sure other Deputies will develop this theme from the sources of learning which are available to them but not available to me.  I must look up the word in the dictionary.</P>

      <P>I did not know the Deputies opposite objected to the length of the debate and it certainly cannot be said that the word &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; is not on this amendment.  I know I have the protection of the Chair in pursuit of the meaning of the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; which is one of the two words in the amendment.  I know the Chair will protect me in the discussion of the words envisaged by the amendment, the words stated to be equivalent to them by the Minister and the words stated to be equivalent to them by the dictionary&mdash;though, again, it is a question of covering the area.  I would deal with this to that extent extensively.  There are others who will, perhaps, deal more intensively with the meanings of these words.  Encouragement then, the action <Col N="2890" /> or process of encouraging, the fact of being encouraged, see senses of the verb&mdash;I doubt if I would be justified by that injunction here, see senses of the verb.  Do you think that would justify me, this instructive dictionary would justify me, in beginning to read all over again?  I do not think so.  I think that would be taking up the time of the House unnecessarily.  This is a thing which I should never do.  But there was a reference from those benches over there to a joke&mdash;that this whole thing is a joke.  There have been jokes in the course of this debate and I do not see why humour should not be a part of our debates, if kept within reason.  But there is also something very serious.  We are trying to take out this word and we are trying to take it out because of its range of meaning and that is what justifies us exploring the range of its meanings, the vast ultimate unexplored range of its meanings, to show what we are letting ourselves in for if we let this word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; go.  We want to hammer it out.  We think we have a right to hammer it out.  We are given for this word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; a spurious excuse that it is exactly equivalent to another word to which it is not exactly equivalent and we are going to show that it is not exactly equivalent to that other word and it takes time to explore the full range of incite and encourage.</P>

      <P>We shall also have a look at &ldquo;incitement&rdquo;.  The Minister has made it appropriate that we should.  We are investigating a claim made by the Minister.  The Minister would, of course, like us to take that claim just on his &ldquo;I say so&rdquo;.  That is what it means.  But we will not do that, we will go to the source of it.  We are now at the source of it and I want to remind Deputies that is what we are at.  This has a purpose.  This is not, as it has been called, a filibuster.  It is a strictly pertinent, relevant inquiry into the meaning of a word.</P>

      <P>I pointed out that, if we make &ldquo;to encourage&rdquo; a crime, we also make related words criminal activities, so it is pertinent to discuss them in the context of this amendment.  The first related word is, I find, one which we discussed just a moment ago in the <i>Oxford English Dictionary:</i>&ldquo;encouragement&rdquo;: the action or process of encouraging, the fact of being encouraged.  Notice this duality.  Encouragement can be both on behalf of the person who is encouraged or the person who is doing the encouragement.</P>

      <P>You see the duality and the ambiguity of these words; you see the way the word reaches out to both the active and the passive in the transaction.  All of this, every bit of it, all these dualities, all these sub-meanings, they all widen this big net the Minister is trying to smuggle in here in a small package. You can put a big net in a small package and that is what he is doing here. &ldquo;Encouragement&rdquo; is also an old word. It will interest Deputies, I know, to hear that it is not as old a word as the verb.  The verb is older than the substantive. This is interesting.  Sometimes the contrary is the case.  I would not spend time here discussing the age of words&mdash;it is not normally pertinent to our debate&mdash;but this Minister makes the alleged age of this word his sole case and he is wrong about the age.  He does not know how old the word is. He thinks it is a modern word.  He thinks it was brought in in the &ldquo;Four Glorious Years&rdquo;, which is where his knowledge of history begins, but it was not.  It goes a bit further back as I am beginning to try to show.</P>

      <P>I shall try to do that.  I thank the Chair for his admonition and advice.  I read out the wrong date because my eyesight is not as good as it was.  I apologise to the House for this, as I hope I always shall, if in any respect, however small, I am guilty of misleading.  I shall not come here and make references to the penny catechism and try to get away with it that way.  If I mislead the House, I shall apologise and if I ever do mislead I shall do it unintentionally, as I did just now.  It was 1568.  &ldquo;King Edward purposing a light encouragement of noble and worthy knights...&rdquo; There is the usage and, in fact, it is the earliest usage of the substantive as distinct from the verb.  Then we have J. Dickinson, of course, in 1598&mdash;&ldquo;For his more encouragement viewing in his mistress' countenance no clouds of discontent...&rdquo; That was what encouraged him, that he saw in his mistress' countenance no clouds of discontent. The word &ldquo;mistress&rdquo; did not enjoy in the 16th century quite the same connotations as the Deputies opposite seem to suppose.  These are modern connotations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is Goring in the Hamilton papers which were printed in 1880 but the actual usage is 1776: &ldquo;What encouragement whatever those ill-affected with you may gather...&rdquo; That is an example of the kind of use of &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo; which the Minister says he intends.  It comes within the ring of meanings that belong to what the Minister says he intends.  There is outside that ring a largely unexplored area, which we are not trying to explore, of weaker meanings.  Yarnton has it in 1677: &ldquo;The encouragement of the iron and iron manufactors...&rdquo; and in the very beginning of the 18th century, in 1700, we had Wallace in a <Col N="2893" /> collection later published by the Oxford History Society, saying: &ldquo;This riding-master went hence finding little or no encouragement of anyone desirous to learn...&rdquo; That is a very good description of the present state of Irish education.  That was Wallace, but Shaftesbury has it in his <i>Characters</i> in 1737: &ldquo;Inward deformity growing greater by the encouragement of unnatural affection.&rdquo;  That is, again, the kind of usage which comes within the stamp which the Minister pretends is the only stamp that this word has but it has, as we have seen and, as in my summing up later on I shall be pointing out, a range of meanings which include much weaker meanings and enables, therefore, more people to be pulled in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>That depends on a number of factors, how vast the range of meanings turns out to be and, perhaps, to some extent my own individual possibilities.  Jowett has it in his <i>Plato</i> which is one of the main 19th-century sources for the great dictionaries. Plato, he says, gives no encouragement to individual enthusiasm. That is a weaker meaning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Plato gives no encouragement to individual enthusiasm.&rdquo; That is to say, it is possible to give encouragement to individual enthusiasm.  That is a possible meaning of &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo; which Plato would not produce for reasons of his own which we must all respect in the case of Plato.  He refuses to give this encouragement to individuals.  This is the sense of the wider use of &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo;. If you gave encouragement to individual enthusiasm, let us say, the enthusiasm of somebody who might, in certain circumstances, squat in a building, that would be encouragement within the meaning of this Bill, if our amendment is refused.  If you were to say that it was a scandal and a disgrace that Hume Street should be turned down, then you would be giving encouragement to the enthusiasm of <Col N="2894" /> people.  You would not be directly intending a criminal act but by giving encouragement to the disposition of those who might so be, you would fall within the meaning; so that not only those who are engaged in actual criminal acts or incitement to them, but the kind of people who, in general sympathise with the motives that have led them to undertake this, perhaps, misguided criminal act, are brought within the net.  I think that particular point is relevant from Plato.</P>
      <P>There is a legal use from the Law Reports in 1883: &ldquo;The object of this society being the encouragement of saving...&rdquo; Deputies opposite will say they do not want to do anything like making it illegal to encourage saving. Nobody is claiming they want to do that.  We are not saying that they do not want to encourage saving but what we are saying is that the kind of meaning of the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; which developed as in &ldquo;encouragement of savings&rdquo; is very wide indeed.  A general discourse on the importance of thrift would be encouraging saving just as a general discourse on the importance of preserving architecture would be encouraging people who were trying to defend such architecture by means that seemed appropriate to them.  Even if you had not incited it, there you would be caught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing the offence which the word in the Bill, &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;, would create, I have been led also in my exploration of this range of meaning to explore the contours of meaning encompassed by the noun because the noun, &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo;, becomes an offence under this section.  The other words linked with this are equally relevant to the amendment and these also in good time I propose to explore. As I have explained, it is a question of exploring the whole range of meanings covered by &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; and its related words to show that these overlap &ldquo;incite&rdquo; and go beyond it, that &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; is a much wider word that it does not conform to what the Minister says and is not just a bare equivalent of &ldquo;incite&rdquo;.  It is a bigger word.  I have also had to point out that the Minister has only given one reason for bringing it in since he says <Col N="2895" /> it does nothing and that it is a modern word.  I have established that it is not a modern word, that the verb derives from as early as the 15th century and the noun from, I think, the 16th or 17th century.  In any case, it is not a modern word.  We have been given no other reason for it than that it is supposed to be a modern word.</P>
    <P>The Minister, we have pointed out, was given an opportunity to reply to Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment last night.  He could have come in and said: &ldquo;I accept it.&rdquo;  That is what he would have done if he were a wise man.  As he is not a wise man, he did not do so and it is necessary for us, therefore, to go into the meaning of this word in some considerable detail in order to show in the context of this Bill just how dangerous such a word is.  If the Minister objects to that he has a remedy, which is to come here and tell us at last what he should have told us earlier, that he accepts this amendment. We do not want some other woolly substitute for the amendment; we want our amendment and that is the minimum we want.  The Minister will be very wise if he accepts the amendment at this stage.  I think many of his colleagues will most heartily congratulate him if he does accept it.</P>
    <P>Returning to the discussion of the meanings we have here in the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> on which I am drawing for the purpose of supporting this amendment which I have seconded and which seeks to remove the dangerous word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; from the Bill, we have not only a verb and a substantive but we also have an agent, a person who does this act of encouraging, a person who encourages.  This word is &ldquo;encourager&rdquo;.  It is not a word which is in very frequent use but it is a word which has been used, which is in the dictionary, and if this Bill becomes law and this section is retained unamended, then a person here defined as an encourager will become a criminal.  He will be a criminal by reason of having committed an offence created under this Bill and by falling within this enormously wide span of meaning which is covered by the several words contained here.</P>

When will certain questions which have been on the Order Paper for some weeks be taken? There should be some effort made in the conduct of the business of this House to take things in proper order. This matter would require only a few minutes' consideration so that certain questions addressed to the Minister for Local Government and, more particularly, to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, would be taken.  I understand that these questions will not be taken this evening.  All Ministers are of equal status in this House, except that the Minister for Finance is supposed to come after the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.

I regard the former statement as being directed against the use of violence in the North.  The main criticism of Mr. Royle seems to be that the timing of my remarks, rather than their substance, was unhelpful. In this connection I wish to remind the House again that I was speaking on the 50th anniversary of the Anglo-Irish Truce.  It was appropriate that I should, at that stage, assess the progress of Anglo-Irish relations, particularly in the light of continuing instability in the North and with a view to inducing a more constructive approach.  The timing of the Orange Parades was irrelevant to my remarks which on this and on all other occasions are solely directed to achieving peace and understanding between all Irishmen.</P>

    <P>I adhere to my view that the restoration of Irish unity is the ultimate political condition which will end instability in the North and this is pertinent at all times.  I believe that responsible opinion here and elsewhere will agree that the type of guarantee as to their constitutional position given up to now to the Northern majority is not conducive to progress towards reconciliation in the North and between North and South.  Therefore I believe that that <Col N="2899" /> guarantee should be reformulated in such a positive way as to encourage people to look for a lasting solution.</P>
    <P>This is what I asked for on July 11th. I want to assert that I was in no way indicating any change in the Government's view that Irish unity should come about by agreement reached through peaceful means.  I fully realise that this will take time and patience.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the minority have become concerned about the delay by the Stormont Government in implementing the Downing Street Declaration&mdash;a delay which is partially responsible for the disillusionment now prevalent amongst the minority.  Ultimate responsibility for its implementation remains with the Westminster Parliament and Government.  I am not aware of any change in British policy away from the Downing Street Declaration although I must confess to disappointment about the delay in implementing it.</P>
    <P>I hold no brief for those who engage in violence in the present grave situation.  Their activities are totally opposed to the interests and legitimate demands of the minority in the North and to any progress in the direction of Irish unity.  They have succeeded only in distracting British public opinion from their abhorrence of the customary intolerance and bigotry of right-wing Unionism to abhorrence of the reprehensible behaviour of intolerant individuals on the other side.</P>
    <P>I want to say also that I consider it to be an act of violence to peace and harmony in any community to arrange sectarian parades into areas where the people are known to be humiliated by them and to resent them.</P>
    <P>I ask the House and, through the House, the whole community to realise that a dangerous state of tension exists in the North.  We must act and speak with restraint, and do everything we can to secure peace while legitimate political means continue to be used to obtain justice and equality of treatment for everyone in the North.</P>
    <P>In reply to the last part of the Deputies' question, I wish to say that in accordance with the agreement reached last October in New York, <Col N="2900" /> Mr. Heath has invited me to visit London on 20th and 21st October and I have accepted his invitation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Taoiseach considered the situation in the North so serious in the early part of last year and seeing that he announced to this House that he would seek an immediate meeting with the then British Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Wilson, does he not now think it might be too late if he were to defer a meeting with Mr. Heath in view of some of the remarks he has made here today with regard to what I would describe as provocative parades?  Would the Taoiseach not, therefore, stress the urgency of a meeting between himself and Mr. Heath and to have not alone a redeclaration of the Downing Street Declaration but a declaration of intent to carry out the immediate reforms and concessions which were contained in that particular statement by Major Chichester Clark and by Mr. Wilson?</P>

Is this wide difference not the very reason why there was a ban placed on the importation of potash from East Germany a few years ago?  The story that what has been done is being done in the interests of the farming community does not make up the difference.

There is already legislation which provides for fines and imprisonment for those found in possession of drugs of this kind.  The legislation coming before the House will deal with the special problem of drug pushers.

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the question relates to the recommendations of the working party on drug abuse regarding legislation to control abuse.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to introduce legislation containing more comprehensive measures for the control of drug abuse. In general, the legislation would give more flexible powers to the Garda for dealing with drug offences.  It would also enable the Minister for Health to exercise certain additional controls in relation to such matters as the safe custody of drugs, the keeping of records and the availability of certain drugs liable to abuse.  In addition, provision would be made for dealing specifically with offences involving the forging of prescriptions or the use of such.</P>
      <P>The working party had endorsed these measures and had also made certain recommendations regarding &ldquo;scaled&rdquo; penalties depending on the drug involved and harsher penalties for drug &ldquo;pushers&rdquo;.  These recommendations are being considered in my Department in consultation with the Department of Justice and it is hoped to make provision for such penalties in the proposed legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that the drug LSD can cause insanity following its use and physical and mental deformity in the first and second generation of offspring; whether he is satisfied that present legislation can effectively deal with the illegal use of the drug; and, if not, if he intends to introduce amending legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the consequences of the misuse of LSD referred to by the Deputy are only two of the adverse effects which may <Col N="2913" /> result from the use of the drug otherwise than under responsible medical supervision; instances of suicide, paranoia, persistent psychosis and even homicide as well as spontaneous recurrences of effect resulting directly from taking LSD are well documented.</P>
      <P>In the report of the working party on drug abuse some young persons are reported as expressing the erroneous view that LSD was &ldquo;relatively safe&rdquo;.  I would like to take this opportunity to rebut this view and to emphasise emphatically that there are grave dangers involved even in a single experience of misusing the drug.</P>
      <P>As I previously indicated the controls provided for in section 78 of the Health Act, 1970, under which the unauthorised possession of LSD has been made an offence, are intended as an interim measure pending the introduction of the legislation, referred to in my reply to a previous question by the Deputy today, containing more comprehensive measures for the control of drug abuse.</P>

It is referred to in the report of the working party, on page 11, as also is a report on the subject submitted by the Medico-Social Research Board.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that on a previous occasion when this matter was raised the Irish delegation were in favour of their admission on the assumption, I presume, that it would be better to have China under the control of the United Nations rather than have them outside it, would the Minister say if the Irish delegation have changed their minds?</P>

      <P>The semi-State bodies under the aegis of my Department, with the exception of Irish Shipping Limited, are required by statute to furnish annual reports and audited accounts.  Although no such requirement exists in the case of Irish Shipping Limited, it has been the practice for that company to furnish an annual report and accounts.

Would <Col N="2925" /> he agree to look into this and to review the position under which this class-conscious system remains so that, for example, a messenger, no matter how well qualified he may be, because of his previous experience before entering the public service, for a higher post, can apply for no post through confined competitions other than that of paperkeeper?

      <P>Is the Minister aware that authors' copies are part of the remuneration of authors and are arranged in the contracts, together with royalties?  Can the Minister say how he justifies imposing turnover tax on that part of the royalties taken in <Col N="2927" /> the form of authors' copies.  Would the Minister agree to look into the matter?  Further, will he agree to look into the case of journals of learned societies, many of which have prices of a nominal character in regard to the odd copy sold outside, which bring them technically within the limit of the tax system?  This means that the exchange of such journals between societies here and elsewhere is seriously inhibited.  In the light of these points will the Minister reconsider the matter?</P>

Would the Minister agree that these operations would certainly take more than ten minutes and that if they were carried out by an official in the public service earning, for example, £1,000&mdash;which is <Col N="2928" /> probably below the average amount involved&mdash;that this would cost much more than the tax collected?

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The forest and <Col N="2930" /> wildlife service of my Department are concerned with the implementation of State policy on afforestation and with this end in view they are in the market for the purchase of lands voluntarily on offer to them and which are found suitable for afforestation purposes.  It is not the policy to acquire lands which investigation reveals may be more suitably devoted to agricultural usage, and there is no question of local farmers being debarred from acquiring such lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a coincidence that a deputation from Leitrim who were concerned with this problem have just left the House.  In many areas people who hold a small portion of land have been hoping at a later date to acquire further lands but they discover the lands have been sold to the Department of Lands for forestry purposes. The forestry section rarely give way when such land is signed over to them.  Before the present Minister's term in office a circular was received from the Department of Lands stating that any time a genuine case was brought to the notice of the Department it would be sympathetically considered. However, despite the fact that I have brought genuine cases to the notice of the Department I have never yet seen this happen.  In many cases the lands could be usefully taken over by local farmers but it never happened.  I do not want to make a speech on this but it is quite true that a deputation which came from Leitrim in connection with this matter have just left the public gallery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>

I am warning the Minister unless something is done serious action will be taken by those who are aggrieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the reason the forestry section are not getting land is due to the fact that they <Col N="2931" /> are not paying an adequate price for it?  I agree with Deputy Creed's point regarding the acquisition of arable land by the forestry section.</P>

      <P>Arising out of Deputy McLaughlin's speech and Deputy Creed's question, I should like to remind Deputy McLaughlin, who asked the question that this is about land not offered for public auction. Question No. 32 relates to lands not offered for sale by public auction and I do not know if there is anything I can do about that matter.  If the lands are in the market and offered directly to the forestry service, to the Department of Lands or anyone else, I do not think there is anything I can do about that.  Deputy Creed's question is totally different.  It is that having acquired land the Forestry Division are unsympathetic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the change in the structure of the board of management of the Raphoe comprehensive school has already been explained to the County Donegal Vocational Education Committee and no useful purpose would be served by my receiving a deputation in the matter.  A board of three members was originally envisaged for this school but at the request of the Donegal Protestant Board of Education I agreed that the board should consist of five members in order to bring it into line with the boards of management proposed for the new comprehensive schools for Protestants to be built in Dublin and Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps there has been some misunderstanding or oversight. The committee in Donegal were not informed, consulted or advised of the change.  The only and first knowledge that they got was when their nominee was notified of the inaugural meeting which inaugural meeting of the management board was timed to take place the day before the vocational committee meeting of that month.  They did not, as a committee, get any information before their meeting, they did not get any explanation of it, nor were they consulted about it despite the fact that in the previous January they had been notified that a board of three was to be appointed and asked to nominate a member, which they duly did.  They heard nothing further until the inaugural meeting was summoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am concerned I have the right, under the rules and regulations, in consultation with the Donegal Protestant Board of Education, to alter the terms of <Col N="2933" /> the scheme from time to time.  I do not think it is essential that I should consult with the Donegal VEC if I am making changes.  I would have hoped that the Donegal VEC would have known about this before in fact the meeting took place.  However, I have explained to the Deputy the reason why I made the change, that this request was made to me from the Donegal Protestant Board of Education to bring it into line with the proposals in relation to the Protestant comprehensive schools in Cork and Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will appreciate that a school in Cork is not necessarily a fair or proper criterion in dealing with a similar type of school in a county such as Donegal? Will the Minister not agree that, having advised the committee in Donegal in January of his intention to have a board of three and requesting a nominee from that committee, that would surely have indicated that he would consult with that same body if he proposed to make any radical change, which he subsequently did?  Without questioning his right to do so, surely it would have been dictated by courtesy, if nothing else, that that committee should have been consulted and/or informed in advance of any such change?  May I ask the Minister whether in fact such change of the structure of the board does not imply a great more than just the mechanics of the board?  This is what the committee wishes to discuss with the Minister because the outcome of the new change may have far-reaching effects on the existing vocational school in Raphoe side by side with the comprehensive school.  In order to get co-operation we wanted a discussion with the Minister.  We asked for it in May, June and July but there was nothing doing.</P>

      <P>In relation to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary question, while he may argue the difference between the situation of the school in Cork and in Donegal, nevertheless we are concerned here with three comprehensive schools catering for the Protestant pupils.  For that <Col N="2934" /> reason, I would see that the type of board applicable to one ought to be similar to the one applicable to another.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether, in the light of the fact that his decision to implement the provisions in <i>All Our Children</i> in respect of carrying forward three or more leaving certificate successes to subsequent examinations was made too late for candidates to enter in the 1970 examination, no provision being made for late entrance in these cases, he will now make special provision for these cases where the course has changed in the meantime, e.g. by recognising the E grade in an honours paper in the 1969 examination as a pass grade.</P>

      <P>The circular letter outlining the conditions for obtaining the leaving certificate by accumulation of credits was issued to schools on 6th April, 1970.  Entries for admission <Col N="2936" /> to the leaving certificate examination, 1970, were accepted subsequent to the issue of that circular letter.

He was then told it was too late for his son to enter for the examination.  In view of the fact, whatever date the circular was issued, the Minister did not reply to this particular person until the end of May, some provision should be made to deal with this particular case.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether, in view of the statement of his Parliamentary Secretary in reply to Question No. 36 of 30th June last that no instruction, other than that contained in his Department's circular of 12th May requesting schools not to enter into arrangements for the employment of additional staff without first seeking the authority of his Department, had been issued to school managers, he will state if officials of his Department have continued since that date to instruct school managers to cancel appointments of such staff made prior to the receipt of his Department's circular; and, if so, if he will immediately require a withdrawal of such instructions and prevent further similar instructions being issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy was informed in the reply given by my Parliamentary Secretary on the 30th June, schools were requested not to <Col N="2938" /> enter into arrangement for the employment of additional staff without first seeking the authority of the Department and giving a full statement of the reasons which made any additional appointments necessary.  Every application for additional staff was examined on its merits.  So far approval has been given for the appointment of 450 additional teachers in secondary schools and 242 such teachers in vocational schools.</P>
      <P>The main factors taken into account when making assessment of each school's requirements were the pupil-teacher ratio in the school, the curriculum being followed and, the necessity to cater for the various subjects. The extent to which a school might have been committed to making an appointment was also taken into account.</P>
      <P>The examination of the cases involved is still proceeding.  There is no question of the officers of the Department operating in this matter in any way which was not fully covered by the circular to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that he has in his possession details of three cases where appointments were made before the circular was issued.  They are therefore not additional appointments and here his officers have instructed that both teachers be dismissed?  Was not that outside the terms of the circular and would he instruct the managers in these cases to reverse the decision so that staff employed before the circular was received will be reappointed, of course when the staffs are within the proper pupil-teacher ratio?</P>

The whole matter will be discussed in the autumn by the school managers, the teacher organisations and the Department.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>The recent British arrangements for imposition of levies on imports of cattle and beef and duties on imports of mutton and lamb have been the subject of consultation between my Department and the British Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food over the past year.  While our carcase meat exports to the UK are excluded from these levies and duties, it is in our interests to co-operate with the British authorities to ensure that such exclusion does not lead to a disruption of British marketing arrangements. The undertakings, which we gave to the British authorities on 12th July, 1971, may be summarised as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)  If the British deficiency payments on fat cattle are reduced in any week because the average market price is below the target indicator price an equivalent reduction will be made in our rate of beef export support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2946" /> (ii)  In the event of our proposing to reduce the present differential of 1¼d a lb between the Irish and British beef subsidy rates we will consult with the British Government in advance.</P>
    <P>(iii)  If at any one time (a) our beef export subsidy rate falls below 1¾d a lb&mdash;&mdash;these are old pennies &mdash;&mdash;(b) a British beef import levy is in operation and (c) our exports of fat cattle rise to more than 200 head a week, we will impose an export charge on fat cattle to maintain an appropriate balance between our live and our carcase exports. The rate of this export charge will be the equivalent of the amount by which the beef export subsidy falls short of 1¾d a lb.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Our mutton and lamb export subsidy will continue to be at a rate not exceeding the British deficiency payment on fat sheep and lambs.</P>
    <P>(v)  We will not allow the import of meat or livestock from third countries to the UK through this country.</P>
    <P>I have seen a statement of 15th July made in the British House of Commons which I take it is the one referred to.  It is a fair summary of the arrangements agreed upon.</P>
    <P>The 1¼d differential between the British rate of deficiency payments on carcase beef and the rate paid here under the beef export guarantee scheme dates from 1969 and is not a differential introduced at the behest of the British Government.  The increase in the level of support payment given here in March, 1969, was 1d less than that given in Britain.  The remaining ¼d is an abatement of the subsidy rate to provide funds for Córas Beostoic agus Feola.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the effect of these arrangements is to put the southern Irish meat trade at a permanent disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> its competitors in Northern Ireland? Would he further agree that it is almost unprecedented that we should agree to put a surcharge on our exports in certain circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2947" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  On the contrary, I think it is to our advantage that we maintain a level supply into the British market in order to keep an even supply there so that the British market will not have to take corrective action which might have an adverse effect on our beef producers. Secondly, I do not think a combination of the circumstance of our beef subsidy rate falling below 1¾d while, at the same time, the British beef import levy in operation can, in fact, happen at all and, as the Deputy is aware, the shipments of live fats has been extremely low in recent years.  The relativities between the exports of live store cattle and carcase beef is another factor which must be kept under constant consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries why the net volume of agricultural output has fallen by 0.5 per cent over the past three years while at the same time inputs of farm materials (fertiliser, animal feed, etc.) rose by 14.7 per cent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>While the increase in the volume of purchased inputs resulted in an increase in gross agricultural output the fact that the former was relatively greater has resulted in the slight decline in net output in 1970 as compared with 1968 which, it will be recalled, was an exceptionally good year for agriculture.</P>
      <P>A feature of agriculture is that as it develops it becomes more a commercial business involving a higher level of usage of purchased inputs. In this country over the past decade the volume of inputs arising from outside the farm has more than doubled. This is due to the reduction in farm labour utilisation, less farm produced feeding stuffs and increased use of fertilisers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>That thesis would not stand up to any detailed examination.  What it more readily demonstrates is that the input expenditure and the outlay by farmers on fertilisers and other inputs has greatly increased and that the investment of capital by farmers in their own enterprises has jumped ahead very considerably. This has upset the old relativities and, generally speaking, this is a good thing because capital is being invested in farming.</P>

      <P>Government policy is to encourage the home grass seed industry as far as possible by, for example, providing for the certification of grass seeds, encouraging production of such seed under contract and by taking purchases of home grown seed into account in connection with the grant of licences to import ryegrass seed.</P>

      <P>On 23rd November, 1967 the Government made an order entitled &ldquo;Restriction of Imports (Fertilisers from East Germany) Order, 1967&rdquo; (S.I. No. 254 of 1967)&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy wants a reply.  I think I should begin again.  On 23rd November, 1967, the Government made an order entitled &ldquo;Restriction of Imports (Fertilisers from East Germany) Order, 1967&rdquo; (S.I. No. 254 of 1967) the effect of which was not to ban imports of fertilisers from East Germany but to bring them under licensing control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2953" /> The order provides for the issue of import licences by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  The main purpose in making the order was to endeavour to encourage agricultural exports to East Germany in exchange for imports of potash.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the answer given really refers to Question No. 50, that is how the Minister came to remove the ban that was imposed by decision of the Government and, while technically it would appear that this has been duly done, I am still asking the question: why if the Government made this order in full consideration of the adverse balance as between our exports and our trading with East Germany, the Government on May 13th should not likewise have considered the removal of that ban for which, in fact, the order was first instituted in 1967?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to remember that the effect of the Government order was not to impose a ban on fertilisers from East Germany but to bring them under licence.  I am not aware of the reasons which actuated the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries at that time in imposing the ban, but I am aware that on 13th May last year, on official recommendation from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and having examined the facts myself, as I outlined to the House last week or whenever the subject came up before, it seemed to me to be a sensible and wise thing for this country to draw its potash supplies from more than one source.  Up to this it was possible to get muriate of potash or any other potash salts from one source only.  This was plainly a bad situation from the customer's point of view and for that reason the licence was renewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the technical aspect of the answer given by the Minister, I still want to ask, since the order of 1967 was made after due consideration by the Government of the adverse balance of trade between this country and Eastern Germany, why the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, solely and without consultation <Col N="2954" /> with his Government should, in effect, abrogate the decision of that Government in 1967.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under two misapprehensions.  The first is that in 1967 the Government imposed a ban.  This is not so, as will be found by consulting the relevant order, the number of which I have quoted. However, they did institute a licensing system under which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries exercised discretion in that case.  The Minister at that time, for his own reasons, decided to ban the import of potash salts from Eastern Germany.  On 13th May, when I examined the situation, I made a decision that was different from my predecessor's decision for reasons that I thought sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The misapprehension is the Minister's not mine.  The decision to ban&mdash;and to me it was a ban, call it what you will&mdash;was taken after full consultation and discussion by the then Minister, myself, with the Government. Why then was it removed without such discussion and consultation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has no grounds whatsoever for that assumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on the basis of the answer to last week's questions.  That is why I put down this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has no ground whatever for saying that the decision of 13th May last was taken without consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be something wrong then, because the reply that I got to a question last week, I think it was, was to the effect that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, on the 13th May, removed or raised the ban or whatever he likes to call it, and that is what I am asking about here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In compliance with the order to which I referred already, the implementation of the order lies with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, and that was the office I held on 13th May.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is all very technical as to where implementation lies. When something is decided by a Government, surely one is entitled to know why the reversal of that decision is not also considered and decided by the Government, the same Government with a few changes, very notable changes, of course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;, can the Parliamentary Secretary enlighten the House as to how the reply to a Parliamentary question last week or the week before indicated in the list of expenditure under minor marine works that a sum of £64,000 had been spent out of that fund on the Howth harbour works?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure I have here of expenditure on harbour works in Howth up to 31st March last is £465,477.  In addition to that, £22,199 had been expended on preliminary technical investigations in connection with the surveys that were being carried out in relation to further works at Howth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary has not understood my question.  The reason I have asked this question is that according to a reply given here, probably by the Minister for Finance, there was expenditure under the Minor Marine Works Vote <Col N="2958" /> of £60,000&mdash;I speak from recollection &mdash;in respect of Howth harbour works. If these are major harbour works, as I understand them to be, how is it that minor marine works money to the extent of one-third of the total spent last year should have been spent in Howth to the detriment and to the disadvantage of the fishermen on other parts of the coast who are depending solely on a small amount of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">

      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government appreciate that the two jobs which were proposed on the coast adjoining Greencastle have not been carried out?  Part of their usefulness would be to give immediate relief to the congestion at Greencastle and this would enable the Government and the Department to do the major works at Greencastle.  These works cannot be provided for three or five years.  The jettisoning of the safe anchorage at Glengad and elsewhere has affected the livelihood of many and has prevented the development of Greencastle as a thriving fishing port.</P>

From the original reply it would appear to me, at any rate, as if an alternative type of industry which could be located there was being sought.  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that the type of industry already there is the one most likely to continue to succeed because of the fact that it is not purely for economic or viability reasons that the present works are closing down there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The centre of our contention, that which divides us from the gentlemen opposite, can be very simply expressed in a few words and it is this: The Minister says that &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; equals &ldquo;incite&rdquo;, all incite, nothing but incite, incite is already part of the law, encourage equals incite.  We say something quite distinctly different.  We say &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; equals &ldquo;incite&rdquo; plus many other things which are not in the law now.  I gave some examples of other things.  That is to say, of terminology, definitely weaker than &ldquo;incite&rdquo; but included in &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;. Language which extends a net would be put in the hands of this Minister if we were not to press this amendment and if we were to consent to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been accused of filibustering on this section and possibly that charge will be made on my remarks to this amendment; that is why I want to establish what I, in particular, am doing here.  Our contention being &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; includes &ldquo;incite&rdquo; plus.  I am out to establish the &ldquo;plus&rdquo; by definite, investigatory, exploratory action.  The plusses include so far such terms as &ldquo;to embolden&rdquo;, <Col N="2972" />&ldquo;make confident&rdquo;.  That is much more than &ldquo;incite&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Inciting&rdquo; is getting a person with deliberate intent to do a certain thing, but if one emboldens a person one makes him confident and one cannot be quite sure what a person will do when one does that.  A man who becomes confident may do anything, he may do some wise, courageous things and one would not know what it is.  It is vague.  One's whole relationship to the person he encourages is vague, whereas the whole relationship of incitement is precise and it is because it is precise and because it is binding that the Minister does not want it.  He wants something that will enable him to catch in the net somebody whom he cannot catch at the moment.  He wants all the vague usages.  To embolden and to make confident are other extensions of the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;; yet other extensions include to recommend or to advise which may be nearer to the meaning of incite depending on what is in sight.  These are colder terms than incite.  They have less of a flavour of pushing somebody about.</P>
    <P>Then, there are very much weaker usages&mdash;to stimulate by expressions of favour or approval which means that falling short of telling A to go and commit a certain crime, one gives some expression of general approval of him and his friends.  If, for example, one were to say that the Dublin Housing Action Committee were not a bad lot, that their intentions were good, that they were drawing attention to a very real problem, that they were an idealistic group and that they were diverting energies which might otherwise have gone into military efforts into non-violent channels, he might well be emboldening them or making them confident.  Certainly, he would be cheering them up and giving them a good deal of countenance in their activities.  Countenance is, essentially, not to discourage.  If one fails to say that the Dublin Housing Action Committee are a group of scoundrels who engage in crime which is what the Minister wants everyone to say, one is countenancing and, therefore, falling within the meaning of this blanket word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2973" /> Supposing one does not even embolden them or give them confidence or does not countenance or patronise them but just allows them to continue, one does not go out and get them but just sits and does nothing, he is encouraging them and consequently, technically, he falls within the scope of this word.  I am pointing out that these meanings are not included in the word &ldquo;incite&rdquo;.  This is very important &mdash;a person falling far short of inciting, say, this group or any other group to engage in forcible entry, far from inciting them, if he gives them any form of encouragement at all he is encouraging them even by allowing them to continue to exist.  That to us is extremely undesirable.</P>
    <P>In a moment I shall pass from &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;&mdash;I have almost completely explored the word but there are still one or two corners of it which I must clean up before moving on&mdash;to the word &ldquo;incite&rdquo; which the Minister says is synonomous with &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before leaving the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;, would the Deputy agree that it could be taken that a nod of approval is &ldquo;encouraging&rdquo; also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I take Deputy Flanagan's point.  I think it is.  If I wave cheerfully at the Parliamentary Secretary he might take it that I am encouraging him or giving him confidence regardless of whether that is what is intended.  I may be embolding somebody without ever knowing that I have done so, for instance, by something I have written which somebody may read differently to what I intended. That brings me within the net whereas the inciter, the man envisaged by certain statutes, is the man who knows all about it.  He wishes people to squat in buildings.  He wants other people to run risks which maybe he will not run himself.  The Minister claims there are such people.  Maybe there are but I think that most of the people who incite these actions are willing to partake in them themselves. That is my impression but it does not matter very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I finish dealing with &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; and move on to the word &ldquo;incite&rdquo; and other words that are <Col N="2974" /> relevant to &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; I should like to refer to one kind of objection made. No objection has yet been made specifically to this amendment but a type of objection has been made which I think will be made, too, to this amendment. This objection, essentially, is this: we can count on the courts to see that everything is all right.  It does not matter if we put bad and loose words in the laws that we make here because anything goes and the courts will see that everything is all right; they will not read any of the meanings that we have read here and they will carry on and administer the law in the way in which the Minister for Justice would have us believe he wishes it interpreted which, in fact, I do not think is the way he wishes it to be interpreted.</P>
    <P>With respect we consider this to be a very bad, a very unsound and a very dangerous approach to legislation.  Our task here is to make the law precise and not to put into it any words that are vague whose extent and coverage is like the one we are considering.  We should construct the law as precisely and clearly as we can with the advice of the Deputies here who have legal training and with the advice also of those Deputies who have no such training. This is precisely what this amendment is aimed at because we cannot count on good judges to correct bad legislation.  This is an entirely wrong principle.  A judge must take the meaning of the words used here and he has to interpret them but he is bound by the Statutes we pass here and, of course, judges are human beings.  We respect our judges in this country.</P>

      <P>The rather sedentary contribution we have just heard is the only contribution, as far as I know, that my colleague from Dublin North East has made on this debate and I think we can proceed without him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was making the point that we cannot rely on good judges to correct bad law.  That is not their function. They are there to interpret and <Col N="2976" /> administer the law as they find it and if we make bad laws the better the judge the worse the effect will be.  It is true, and we do not want to pretend that there are elements in our case that are not there, that the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; here will not bind any judge to go beyond &ldquo;incite&rdquo;.  There are judges who may be inclined to say: &ldquo;We take this as generally equivalent to &ldquo;incite&rdquo; but judges are not so bound and they are not bound either by anything that the Minister for Justice may have said in this debate.  That all becomes irrelevant once we have passed the law.  The Minister's intent is not in question. It is what the law says.</P>
    <P>What would &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; do in effect?  We do not want to make impractical, insubstantial, pedantic points.  It is a question of what effect it will have.  The effect it would have on a judge who wished the law to move in a certain direction, who thought, for example, there should be a firmer hand with the Press, that there should be a clamp down on certain things.  Such a judge, a judge perhaps of conservative temperament, a judge whose ideology and background had been formed by that party over there or by the more conservative wing of that party over there.  I am not attacking anybody here, I am speaking of an upright judge who wishes to administer and interpret the law as he finds it, who will not go beyond the law but who will, being human, adopt that interpretation of an ambiguity in the law which suits his inclination, his general philosophy of life.</P>
    <P>There are such judges on our benches.  As in every country there are judges who are relatively liberal and such judges would not give &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; much scope beyond the area where it actually does overlap with &ldquo;incitement&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are also judges who are of conservative philosophy and frame of mind, equally honourable, equally just, judges but possessing this philosophy which thinks that the freedom of the Press has been abused and ought to be limited.  Those judges, if we leave the law at &ldquo;incite&rdquo; would, being <Col N="2977" /> as we believe them to be just judges, be bound by the meaning of &ldquo;incitement&rdquo; but if we change &ldquo;incitement&rdquo; to this tremendously vague word &ldquo;encourage,&rdquo; if we give them that, then we give those conservative judges, a free hand to clamp down. Even our most conservative judges would not wish to gag the Press altogether.  The Bill will not have all the most terrible effects that we perhaps in the flights of our horrors described.  It is more limited than that but it does enable conservative judges to clamp down on certain things in the Press</P>
    <P>Deputy Carter said that this was designed not to clamp down on the respectable national press, the Press which is owned by people of property and so on, that it was aimed at the back street pamphleteer&mdash;a tough phrase.  In the history of the freedom of the Press and the Press generally in this country, as in other, a great deal of that freedom has been won and defended by the backstreet pamphleteers. John Wilkies was a back street pamphleteer, I suppose.  John Wilkes was, in many ways, I suppose, not a very admirable person.  Neither defenders of the Press nor exponents of limiting the liberty of the Press are necessarily either admirable or not admirable.  That is not relevant.  All the discussion on that question has been irrelevant, including the motives attributed to us which you, Sir, and I respect your ruling, would not permit me to reply to.  What is important is that if, through the use of the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; you give the courts the opening to clamp down on the back street pamphleteer, to run him in, to prosecute him and jail him for something he said in encouragement of squatting, if he emboldened a group which proceeded to a certain course of action, then certain judges will avail themselves of that lawful, legal permission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Timmons has charged me ten times, I think, with impugning the integrity of the judiciary.  I wish to declare that the Official Report will show clearly that at no time did I speak a single word reflecting on the integrity of the judiciary unless it be a reflection on the integrity of someone to say they are human beings.  Perhaps in a philosophical way that is so.  What I said, and I want to be precise about this because it is important, is that honourable, upright judges such as I believe we have&mdash;and I am glad this country has them because we need them&mdash;can differ about the interpretation of the law.  They differ according to their philosophy of life.  Everyone knows there are judges who are more liberal than others, just as there are judges who are more conservative. Frequently I have heard lawyers express the hope that a given case would come before a certain justice rather than another person because these men differ as human beings.  This is no reflection on them whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not suggesting they differ from one another for corrupt or venal motives.  Although many of them have risen from the ranks of political parties, we believe they have made a sincere effort to rise about party prejudices and party passions.  We are <Col N="2980" /> proud of our judiciary and none of us would wish to do anything that would undermine our legal system. However, it is not undermining to say we should not feed bad laws to the judiciary, which is what these gentlemen are asking us to do under the specious pretext that the words &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; or &ldquo;advocates&rdquo; mean the same thing as &ldquo;incite&rdquo;.  If we feed that to the judiciary, of course, they will make more sense of it than it appears to make because they will study it honourably and conscientiously and they will try to make &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; fit into the general framework of our laws.  They will try to interpret and administer it in a just way.  We can be confident they will do all of these things.</P>
    <P>However, the Deputy regards these observations as a savage onslaught on the integrity of the judiciary.  What will happen is that conservative judges will interpret this&mdash;as they have every right to do&mdash;in the light of their general philosophy and their concept of the law and this extends the law in a way that makes it possible for certain judges to apply the law in an admissible and honest way but in a way that will result in restriction of the freedom of the Press.</P>
    <P>Cases will be brought before judges and decided in this way or in that way.  However, in cases brought by the Attorney General and decided by certain judges they will be decided in a way that will extend the law, very con-considerably, perhaps, not as widely as in the wildest dreams of critics of this section, but still considerably.</P>

      <P>I was making the point that the real meaning of this Bill by adding &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; to &ldquo;incite&rdquo; is to give judges who may be interpreting it and who may be of a conservative disposition, elbow room within the law because they would take no elbow room outside the law.  What they can do depends on what powers we give them.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect to the Minister for Justice who puts forward this apparently plausible claim, that there is no extension, it is an extension of the law and this is evident from the plain meaning of the words.  We have only scratched the surface of the meaning of the words but it is already plain that they show there would be, by the inclusion in the Bill of the words &ldquo;encourage or&rdquo;, an extension.  We are not saying if this were done and the <i>Irish Times</i> had an editorial, which gave some kind of general encouragement to the Dublin Housing Action Committee, that immediately there would be a swoop on the <i>Irish Times,</i> that its editor would be brought before the courts and so on.  That is not it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would see relatively little utility in a test of the law by these major respected national dailies.  The assault will not begin on them.  No Government are so foolish as to start by attacking them.  That would be a grave mistake.  They will start with this poor little backstreet pamphleteer of Deputy Carter.  It will, in fact, be some poor man inspired by some passion to say certain things, who is known to be linked, perhaps, in some way, even if only by friendship, with some group regarded by the Minister for Justice as subversive.  There are subversive <Col N="2982" /> groups but we do not know what the Minister has in mind there.</P>
    <P>We are saying that the effect of &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; will be to include these in a possible net.  We think some of them will avoid the operation because some of the judges, before whom they may be brought, will not interpret &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; in the widest way or even in a very wide way.  However, in some cases the judges, finding the law so extended, will use that extension and thus make it easier to convict that poor man, that pamphleteer, that journalist and send him to jail.</P>
    <P>That is what the Bill is about.  The Minister has said that he wants to get at these people.  That is the most candid statement he made on this whole matter.  His statement on section 4 was: &ldquo;This will enable me to get at the people I want to get at.&rdquo; That is exactly what he said.  I do not think it is in the official record but it is what we heard him say.  That is the way it will work and these are the people intended to be brought into the net and some of them will be brought into it. It is a question of getting used to things.  Society is very much a question of habit and convention, of what you come to regard as normal as the German people came to regard the Nuremberg code as normal, as the South African whites regard the apartheid code as normal.</P>
    <P>This makes a different normality for the Press to live in than the normality which existed before and that is what we object to in it.  We are being very careful to avoid excessive language in relation to this.  We are not saying that this is equivalent to the Nuremberg code or to the apartheid code. It is not but it is a small significant step in the direction of curbing the freedom of the Press.  We are defending the freedom of the Press in this amendment not because we deserve or wish to be praised for doing so but because we and those we represent have an interest in the freedom of the Press being defended.  It is an important thing in relation to the citizen and it is not necessary to accompany it by any flattery of the Press.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to indulge in any flattery of the Press.  The Press use <Col N="2983" /> their freedom sometimes well and sometimes badly.  What is important is that they have it and that no unnecessary dangerous restrictions should be introduced into this very sensitive area here.  We have been accused here of trying to limit the freedom of the Press ourselves.  We do not think we did so.  The Chair's predecessor admonished me against replying to certain things which were said and I will not go against his admonition.  The only point I would like to make about that is that on this amendment, on this section, on this Bill, it is irrelevant whether our course of action in relation to these past events was this or was that.  As regards the judgement of history on the Labour Party, whatever that may be, no doubt it is relevant but these are not the matters at stake in this amendment.  Whatever the Press or anyone may think about the Labour Party here and now it is not the Labour Party who are endeavouring to restrict the freedom of the Press. We do not think we did it before either and I would defend our point of view there but I cannot defend it here because of the ruling which we had on that.</P>
    <P>I should now like to proceed, with the Chair's permission, to complete my investigation into the &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; group of words before proceeding to examine the group of words which the Minister would equate with them, that is, the group of words around &ldquo;incite&rdquo;.  I say &ldquo;group of words&rdquo; very advisedly here because a word exists in a crowd, a complex, of other words.  No word stands by itself.  If one wishes to explore the meaning of a word one must explore the meaning of the words associated with it.  I shall try to do that, or some of that, because it is a large task.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that I shall be able to complete it to my satisfaction or to that of the House, but I shall try, as shall other Deputies who will be speaking in the debate.  Deputy FitzGerald has a strong interest in the semantic aspects of this.  He uses such industry and this makes him an admirable Deputy.  I can see a further <Col N="2984" /> example of industry here on the benches.  It is most encouraging&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We must remind ourselves that the subject matter of the amendment is in itself no joking matter.  It is very serious.  If by the passage of section 4 without our amendment the law is extended and additional powers are put into the hands of conservative judges, the first victims will be the small men, the editors of small newspapers, newspapers whose views I do not share, for whose views on most things I have no time, but newspapers which have a right to express themselves within the framework of existing law.  If we move in on those by including the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;, if we enable the Minister and his friends to move in on those little men, that will be bad in itself. I should rather see those men expressing themselves on paper than going out shooting people.</P>

      <P>With these sustained interruptions it is difficult for me to continue without repetition.  I have avoided repetition as far as I possibly could and as far as any Deputy did in this debate but if I am constantly interrupted I shall have to re-gather my frame of thought and I can do that only by a measure of repetition. The point we are making is that the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;incite&rdquo; but &ldquo;incite&rdquo; plus.  The &ldquo;plus&rdquo; may be used by courts so inclined in order to clamp down on the small Press, the fringe Press, the mosquito Press.  In the first instance, that series of actions will put the national Press also increasingly on the defensive. They are very cautious in relation to the existing law, but I think they will in course of time, when they have seen it enforced, come to be anxious in respect of this law.  Should it be found constitutional we do not know whether or not this section will be <Col N="2987" /> found constitutional; we hope it will not, but it may&mdash;if it is, if it becomes the law, then editors who defy such a law, and I am sure there will be such instances, will perhaps cease to be editors and the Press will become in process of time more circumspect. Editors will cease to be editors.  It may not be a rewarding thing to disobey the law.  The movement then will proceed inwards from the mosquito Press, from the fringe, into the national Press itself, not by establishing a reign of terror but just by establishing precedents, which are a little more prudent, with a tendency to avoid running against the current of the Government. That is, in fact, what we are dealing with.  It is a turn of the screw, a quite large and significant turn of the screw.  If they get away with this, if they do this thing, if they refuse our amendment, steamroll section 4 through, and it becomes the law, then they will be encouraged&mdash;I am just coming back to that interesting word; we have not exhausted it yet.</P>

      <P>I was concluding on the words in the encourage group, one of them being the word to which I am now coming, which is an encourager, defined as he who or that which encourages.  Of course, the encourager, he who encourages, if what he is deemed to encourage is an offence under the earlier sections of this Bill, becomes a criminal, which he is not now, if that is all he does, if he just encourages.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the usage here.  The earliest usage is a 16th century one: &ldquo;An apology against the report that he should be maintainer and encourager of such as curse the Queen's Highness.&rdquo; Now that is very interesting because that usage is, in fact, the usage of the Star Chamber.  That is Star Chamber usage&mdash;an apology against the report that he should be a maintainer and encourager of such as curse the Queen's Highness.  It is the spirit that is important.  This word &ldquo;encourager&rdquo; was a great 16th century word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time the courts and the government were very anxious to get at, as the Minister says, anybody who looked sideways at the Queen's most excellent majesty.  Of course, the class of people especially envisaged as <Col N="2989" /> maintainers and encouragers of such as curse the Queen's Highness were gatherers and it was to get them in the net that this wide word &ldquo;encourager&rdquo; was there.  They wanted to get, not people who incited acts against the Queen, but people who simply encouraged other people to curse.  A Deputy curses.  I encourage him.  I countenance or I patronise him.  I even allow him to go on cursing.  I am an encourager.  That is what the scope of this word is and this is the word that had such a vogue in the 16th century, a time when freedom, as we know it today, and most certainly the freedom of the Press, as we know it today, did not exist.  This was a time when backstreet pamphleteers, about whom Deputy Carter speaks, were put in the pillory and had their ears clipped.  I suppose some subsequent statutes brought in here may return to that.</P>
    <P>Then, again, you have Forde writing in 1562&mdash;I think it is the dramatist Forde: &ldquo;Of which notable thing and great force of faith Mauritius himself was a great encourager.&rdquo;  In 1607, the early 17th Century, you have Topsail: &ldquo;My worshipful good friend and daily encourager unto all good labours&rdquo;. You have these two aspects of the verb encourage, encourage something good or something bad.  Then, again, in the 18th century you have this word: &ldquo;Mr. Gough begged leave to return the encouragers of his musical entertainment.&rdquo;  In Watson's Philip II, 1777 : &ldquo;They were considered as fomentors of the tumult and encouragers of heresy&rdquo;.  That is the kind of person, the encourager of heresy.  You see how this word works.  It is very interesting to explore how this word works It reaches out and it grabs you. It brings you into a net which would not otherwise be there: &ldquo;You may not be a heretic, you so-and-so, but you are an encourager.  Did you not say that Wvcliffe should not be hanged?&rdquo; or something like that.  That is the type of thing.</P>

      <P>I find it encouraging at least that that Deputy said a good word for him.  The final example is from Wilson's <i>British India</i> in 1844 and is again an innocuous one: &ldquo;He was an encourager of lessons in the arts.&rdquo;  Now that word &ldquo;encourager&rdquo; means that people will again become criminals under this Bill as they were in the 16th century under Her Gracious Majesty, Queen Elizabeth I, and His Majesty, King James, because it consists in about equal parts of innocuous usages which all exist in this great potent cloud of meaning around the word &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo;, these harmless things, and then also these things which reach out and get you, these Star Chamber things.  They make the words &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; and &ldquo;encourager&rdquo; comparable to the action of grapeshot or shrapnel; they spread out and hit many people.  You do not get just a particular man; you get almost anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is anxious to have these extended powers.  He admitted &mdash;I am glad he is present&mdash;in speaking on section 4 that it would enable him to get at people he cannot get at. That at least was a candid and clear admission, but the Minister has not said&mdash;I hope he will speak as soon as may be reasonably possible&mdash;what he means by including these words &ldquo;to encourage or advocate&rdquo;.  In what relation do they stand to the task which section 4 will enable him in his opinion to carry out, that of getting at certain people?  Do they or do they not play a role?  If, as he has told us, &ldquo;encourage or advocate&rdquo; are synonymous, not merely to one another but also to &ldquo;incite&rdquo;&mdash;they include no meanings that go beyond those&mdash;then these words at least give him no extended powers at all.  He is <Col N="2991" /> just putting them in to modernise, as he said, the language.</P>
    <P>I have been quite unable to understand how you modernise language by the introduction of a word which has been in the English language since at least the 16th century, which is the earliest recorded use of it, and which has been used repeatedly down the whole length of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.  This is not a very modern word but even if it were a really groovy word I cannot see why we need it, why the existing &ldquo;incite&rdquo; will not do.  The Minister has not told us why it will not do.  He has just given this reference to modernity.  We believe that section 4 would give him the extended scope which he candidly said he wanted, the power to get at certain people he does not like and whom he believes to be in subversive organisations and behaving in ways that he does not like.  But we think&mdash; and this is what he has not added&mdash;it is these words &ldquo;encourages or advocates&rdquo; and most particularly this word, the word this amendment is aimed at, &ldquo;encourages&rdquo;, that is the net which the Minister wants to cast&mdash;&mdash;</P>

No closure of debate can take place except on the Committee Stage of the Bill when the Chair proposes that the section debated stand part of the Bill or on the Fifth Stage of a Bill when the Chair proposes: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;  It is without precedent to accept a motion to close a debate depriving Deputies who wish to participate of their right to do so.

It may annoy the members of the Fianna Fáil Party that Deputy Cruise-O'Brien has spoken at such great length and so relevantly. How can you say there has been adequate discussion when neither the Minister for Justice nor any other member of the Fianna Fáil Party has attempted to make any comment except by way of ignorant interjection?</P>

      <P>I want to draw to your attention Standing Order 94 (1) which makes it clear that an amendment is not proposed from the Chair. It says:</P>
      <P>In Committee, when an amendment is offered proposing to insert a new section in a Bill, such amendment may be moved when the number of the section, before which it is proposed to insert the new section is read from the Chair ...</P>
      <P>The Chair's function is to read the number.  The amendment is then moved by the proposer.  This amendment before the House is not proposed from the Chair.  Therefore, it is not possible to apply Standing Order 53 (1) at this stage.</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 35, after &ldquo;offence&rdquo; where it secondly appears to add &ldquo;provided always and it is hereby declared that reasonable comment on a matter of public interest in any newspaper, magazine, periodical or book shall not constitute an offence under this subsection&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) of section 4 is a subsection which proposes to enact that a person who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence under sections 2 and 3 of this Bill shall be guilty of an offence.  In order to understand the section and the amendment it is necessary to refer very briefly to sections 2 and 3 of this Bill.  Section 4 as it now stands proposes to make it an offence for any person to encourage or advocate the commission of an offence under sections 2 and 3 of the Bill.  Section 2 is the section which makes forcible entry of land or a vehicle an offence and section 3 is the section which creates the offence of remaining in forcible occupation of land or a vehicle.  As I have said on another occasion, we are creating new offences by reason of these two sections. We are writing into the Statute Book for the first time the offences of forcible entry and forcible occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and I had some words as to whether we were creating new offences or not, but I do not believe that the Minister would be serious in contradicting me when I say that we are creating the new offences of forcible entry and forcible occupation. We are putting it beyond yea or nay that it will be a criminal offence for a person to take forcible occupation of land or a vehicle for any reason or to retain forcible occupation of land or a vehicle for any reason.  I have made it perfectly clear on previous Stages of the Bill and on previous amendments, that, so far as I am concerned, and so far as my party are concerned, we do not quarrel with the creation of these new offences.  I have pointed out previously that I object violently to the definition of <Col N="3002" />&ldquo;owner&rdquo; in section 1 and that for that reason, sections 2 and 3 are far from satisfactory but when we leave sections 2 and 3 and consider section 4, we see that this section makes it an offence for anyone to encourage or advocate the commission of an offence under sections 2 and 3.  We must consider the type of offences we are creating here.</P>
    <P>The act of forcible entry or forcible occupation, commonly known as squatting, first manifested itself in this country some few years ago and took the form of sit-ins for the purpose of voicing protest against social evils or social ills.  To be specific, one or more of these forcible squats, if one might so term them, were staged for the purpose of focussing public attention on the fact that the Government had failed in their duty to solve the housing problem in Dublin.  Its purpose was to demonstrate to the people of the country the appalling evils that resulted from people having to live in inadequate accommodation and that there was an enormous waiting list on the books of Dublin Corporation and that that waiting list contained the names of unfortunate families of three and four children who were living in one room in houses where there were no proper sanitary facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I was saying that the first forcible entry that was staged in this country was by way of demonstration so as to attract public attention to the problem of inadequate housing in Dublin city and throughout the country and to focus public attention on the fact that the Government had failed hopelessly in their duty to provide adequate housing for married men and their families in the city of Dublin.  The forcible occupation of <Col N="3003" /> one or more dwelling houses that were to be sold as hotels or for other purposes were staged in order to bring home to the Government and to the people of the country in a very dramatic way the need for housing and the necessity for doing something about it.</P>
      <P>Another such forcible squat took place to convince the Government that it was wrong to tear down Georgian buildings in Hume Street. That forcible squat succeeded because some members of the Government encouraged and comforted members of the squatting team by providing them with food and other necessaries and when the battering ram brigade had moved in the present Minister for Finance yielded and took steps to ensure that the houses would not be pulled down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet other squats, forcible entries and forcible occupations were held to protest against the action of foreign landlords who owned and own fishing rights in this country in refusing to permit Irish citizens to enjoy those fishing rights.  In so far as this amendment is concerned the important thing is that these forcible entries and forcible occupations in regard to Hume Street, Harcourt Street and fishing waters were not the beginning of a campaign to draw public attention and to persuade the Government to do something about inadequate housing, the destruction of beautiful buildings and the refusal of people to allow Irish citizens to enjoy the fishing waters of this country.  No, the national and provincial Press had been waging those same campaigns for years back to no avail.  We all read leading articles in every newspaper deploring the housing position, calling for the preservation of Georgian buildings in this city and demanding that Irishmen have free access to Irish waters.  That has been going on for years but if this section goes through without this amendment, it will mean that the newspapers will be guilty of a criminal offence if they continue to draw attention to bad housing conditions, if they continue to campaign for the preservation of Georgian buildings and if they express, <Col N="3004" /> in no uncertain terms, that Irishmen and Irish women should have the right to fish in Irish waters.  That will be an offence without doubt under section 4 (1) of this Bill unless my amendment is accepted which proposes to ensure that reasonable comment on a matter of public interest in any newspaper, magazine, periodical or book shall not constitute an offence under this subsection.</P>
    <P>This is a serious amendment and I am putting it forward in a serious way. It affects the right of expression of opinion in national and provincial newspapers.  I have gone on record before as saying that with the sort of administration we have here at the moment, with the exhibition we have just witnessed in this Chamber a few minutes ago&mdash;the imposing of a guillotine motion on a Bill of this sort it is true to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I was explaining to the House that the object of this amendment is to ensure that the newspapers will still have the right to comment on a matter of public interest without committing an offence. Unless this amendment is accepted it will be an offence for any newspaper or magazine to discuss matters of public interest which are the subject of agitation in the country.</P>
      <P>We are creating a new offence which is closely associated with agitation demanding the curing of social ills, such as bad housing, the preventing of people from fishing in Irish waters and the destruction of beautiful buildings. It is more important now than at any time in my political life that we should have a Press free to express views fully on matters affecting citizens of the country.</P>
      <P>I say that for two reasons.  We are living in an age when people are inclined to resort to violence; in an age where young people are not prepared to be treated as children; in an age when people will insist on reforms.  I do not believe in violence or force. The best way of discouraging people from resorting to violence or other unlawful methods in order to bring their views before the public is to ensure that there is a free and unfettered Press.  We must have a public Press that will champion worthy causes and will be at liberty to do so; a Press that will act as a mouthpiece for people who want to protest in a lawful way about injustices, social or otherwise, or who want to bring before the people reforms they consider necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is not freedom of expression, if there is not editorial freedom, we are embarking on a road that can end only in physical violence, in the younger people taking to the streets and resorting to violence&mdash;perhaps to the petrol bomb and worse&mdash;in order to get their views across to the people. We are living in an age when people, <Col N="3006" /> especially the young, refuse to be muzzled.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is one reason why it is absolutely essential to preserve freedom of expression in the newspapers, national and provincial.</P>
      <P>There is another reason.  Because of the administration in charge of the Government at the moment, and the events that have occurred in the last 12 months, and in view of the fact that the Government are determined to avoid facing the people, I cannot be criticised for saying that the Government at the present time are a different administration and a different cabinet from the Government that was given a mandate by the Irish people on 18th June, 1969.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> If I am to develop my argument it is necessary for me to point out that the offence created by subsection (1) of section 4, which I propose to amend, of encouraging the commision of a crime under sections 2 and 3 is the offence of forcible entry and forcible occupation.  If this Bill becomes law it will be an offence to protest by means of forcible entry and forcible occupation.  Protests are usually made to ventilate a grievance which affects a considerable number of people or to object to a wrong affecting a great number of people.  If a newspaper publishes an article on any topic, whether it be the withdrawal of the dole, internment without trial, the destruction of houses in Hume Street, the inadequacy of housing accommodation for families, or fish-ins, it will commit an offence.  They will commit an offence by publishing photographs or letters if, as a result of these activities, there is an illegal sit-in or an illegal occupation, and the editors of these papers, if the law is enforced, will be guilty of an offence under section 4 (1) of this section.  That is the position I want to avoid.  That is the position against which I want to protect the newspapers. They play a very important role.  Their protection is the whole point of my amendment.  I am not the only person who believes this amendment is necessary.  As far as I know, Deputy Vivion de Valera is the controller-director of the <i>Irish Press</i> group of newspapers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The article reads:</P>
      <P>Very few pieces of draft legislation have ever attracted such attention as the Forcible Entry Bill which today will apparently begin its final trundle through the Dáil.</P>
      <P>From being a proposal to deal with the circumstances created by the activities of certain persons who had used the housing situation to stage &ldquo;squats&rdquo; to further their own political ends a situation has been allowed to develop, over the retention of a few words in section 4 of the Bill, into a massive debate on the freedom of the press, with the Government cast in the role of a bogey man to undermine one of the bastions of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This should never have been allowed to happen, but it has and it is sobering to think of all the Dáil time and energy that has been devoted, not to discussing how the root cause of the matter, our housing problem, could be eradicated, but, when it comes down to it, nothing more than whose interpretation <Col N="3018" /> of the relevant section concerning press comment is correct, the Opposition's, or the Minister's.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Minister's interpretation is correct and that the law would be interpreted intelligently and without prejudice to responsible Press coverage or comment.  But on the other hand the future might also show that the contrary would be the case and that the law would in effect be inimical to the freedom of the Press.  This, of course, would be intolerable and when a doubt of this magnitude is raised the sensible thing to do is to leave out the cause of the doubt.</P>
    <P>Without going into legal niceties, it should have been possible before now to devise some formula of words whereby fair comment and reportage, be it pictorial or otherwise, on a matter of public interest would not be inhibited.  Some amendments of this nature have been proposed and at the beginning of this, apparently final, passage of the Bill through the Dáil, these, or some variant of them, should be put in effect.</P>
    <P>We have some enormous problems confronting us; the deteriorating situation in the North is but one. Having the Dáil's time taken up with one easily alterable section of a Bill, whose retention is being fought for and against with the ferocity of a rearguard action in the field, will not help us to deal with these problems.  Let us now have that suitable alteration, and let us get on with the Nation's business.</P>
    <P>Certainly, with the interruptions that I have been subjected to I could never be expected to make a clearer case, a better case, and to put in black and white what I am asking.  We are being told by the Minister and by some of the Government Deputies that section 4 does not affect the Press, that the Press is not mentioned in it.  They have been arguing that case here.  I suggest to the Minister for Transport and Power now that it is as clear as the noonday sun that section 4 catches the Press, that it will prevent the Press from doing anything that might be calculated to encourage illegal sit-ins, <Col N="3019" /> illegal squats or illegal occupation. Does the Minister for Transport and Power, as an experienced Parliamentarian and lawyer, believe we should pass this Bill while it contains a clause which will prevent the Press from expressing views or comment on matters of common concern and public interest?</P>
    <P>If he says that is going too far, does he believe we should have on the Statute Book a section in an Act which would prompt a newspaper editor to say: &ldquo;I wonder if I write about the housing problem will I be guilty of an offence because squatting is going on?&rdquo; I have tried to bring home to the House this might not only prevent our newspapers in the future from writing editorials on social injustices or matters needing reform but it would create a situation in which newspapers that have been campaigning for years past will now have to cry halt because all these matters I am talking about, the fishery problem, the Georgian houses, and the housing shortage have been the subject of a vast amount of editorial comment in our newspapers. Each one of them has at the same time been the subject of what will be illegal squats or sit-ins.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister for Transport and Power want to deny the <i>Irish Press</i> or the <i>Irish Independent</i> or the <i>Irish Times</i> the right to write a leading article calling on the Government to house the people?  Does he want to deny the Dublin newspapers the right to write leading articles calling for the retention of buildings they believe have an architectural value and are part of the character of the city?  Does he want to prevent our newspapers from campaigning for the vesting of our fisheries in a body like the Land Commission? I do not think he does but that is what he is doing in that section.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that this section has become the source of such a controversial debate here at this time of year.  It is a pity it was introduced into the House at this time and that it was not left over until October or November when it could be dealt with calmly and that we were not dealing in the past month or so with the Planning Bill or with the Landlord and Tenant <Col N="3020" /> Bill both of which would have got rid of some of the protests here.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> There are tactics.  I put it to the Minister that all I have said is the case, that this section unaltered will do exactly what I say it will do, prevent the expression of public opinion in the newspapers on matters of public interest. If the Minister says I am not right and that it would not be so interpreted in our courts I disagree with him.  I fall back on the reasoning in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 27th July: if there is this massive doubt, why not put an end to it?  Why not accept this amendment? Why, when the Minister's attention was drawn to this in the very first speech I made&mdash;a short one&mdash;on Second Stage of the Bill&mdash;was he not man enough to reconsider the position at a Government meeting or somewhere else and bring in a reasonable amendment to meet the objections from this side of the House,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would not be a party to putting in the hands of the Minister for Justice section 4 of this Bill unaltered in view of my experience of the way he treated a newspaper proprietor in this House because that newspaper proprietor dared to write in the newspaper.  This amendment is about freedom of the Press and I am pointing out that the Minister for Justice threatened a newspaper proprietor, without this section. What would he do if he had it? I leave that to the House.  I leave it to the newspapers and to the nation.  That is not the end of it.  The same little man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I could see the same Minister enforcing the law against a newspaper editor in this country to prevent him from criticising the Government, if he was given machinery to do so by this House.  He will never do that in so far as this party is concerned.  The Minister is steamrolling his way through the House with this objectionable section unaltered.  We will see to it that we have pointed out to the public what is involved here and that the records of the House will contain our views.  The record of this House is a valuable weapon to prevent the abuse of a measure.  It is necessary to say what we are saying because there are Ministers of this Government saying there is nothing objectionable in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 23rd July as stating in Thurles the night before that the Forcible Entry Bill threatens no one but those who despise democracy. He said that this Bill was an attempt to uphold democracy by backing up law and order.  The Minister for Finance told a Fianna Fáil meeting that.  He is a reasonable, responsible man and if he is sending in scripts to the newspapers in that tone I would hate to hear what the Minister for Transport and Power is telling the lads behind closed doors down the country. It is necessary for us to put on the record of this House what is involved here when we take as an example of this sort speeches made by Ministers and contrast them with what Deputy de Valera is saying in the <i>Irish Press.</i><Col N="3027" /> Surely the members of Fianna Fáil must be utterly confused.  The sad thing is that the present Government know perfectly well that this is a dangerous section to put into an Act of Parliament. If they knew as much before the Bill was introduced or appreciated the position then as they do now this section would never have been put in.  It is in here and this is one of the shortcomings that I see in democracy&mdash; practically the only shortcoming. When a measure is introduced by the Government in power it becomes a matter of principle and is regarded as a defeat for the Government if they amend it substantially.  They will do anything in order to resist any substantial amendment.</P>

I want to defy the Government to attempt to <Col N="3030" /> impose the closure on this amendment because this amendment is about freedom&mdash;freedom of expression of opinion in the public Press.  They may steamroll this section through but the best argument in favour of this amendment is the performance of the Government this evening in imposing the closure motion.  That is the best argument to date but the final and unanswerable argument in favour of it would be the imposition of the closure of this debate, the muzzling of this House in its effort to secure that the Press will not be muzzled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this amendment.  This amendment has suddenly assumed an immense importance in the context of this afternoon's activities because, as Deputy Fitzpatrick rightly pointed out, the amendment becomes highly relevant because it deals with freedom.  We saw here this afternoon a curtailment of freedom when the guillotine was applied.  Objection has been taken to describing the action of the Government as guillotining.  It is an expressive phrase which sums up exactly what has happened.  Freedom was chopped viciously and callously and that is what the guillotine does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering that amendment we cannot, no matter how much the Minister would like to consider it <i>in vacuo,</i> consider it without also considering the section to which it applies. The amendment seeks to amend section 4.  We have to have a close look at the section we are seeking to amend. Section 4 contains three subsections. The first creates what I submit is a totally new offence&mdash;the offence of encouraging or advocating.  The Minister for Justice has made the case that it does not, that it is merely expressing in modern language the old and longstanding offence of incitement.  My short answer to that proposition is that in that event this section is unnecessary if it is replacing something which is and has been adequate.  The second subsection creates a new and malicious legal concept whereby a person can be found guilty of a criminal offence and all that that entails merely by happening to have been associated with a group on whose behalf a statement <Col N="3031" /> was made under subsection (1).</P>
    <P>The two subsections have to be looked at together because it is in the second vicious subsection that we get the whole <i>raison d'être</i> for this horrible section.  If that second subsection of guilt by association was not part of this section which we are now seeking to amend I have no doubt that the Minister would not be bringing in the section at all under the pretence that it is merely the old offence of incitement dressed up in modern language.</P>
    <P>It is an elementary principle of drafting and a very general rule of draftsmanship never to change the form of words unless one is also going to change the meaning.  The form of words for the offence of incitement have never encompassed the words &ldquo;encourage or advocate&rdquo;.  There is a definite change of wording in the drafting of this section.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to ask why this change has taken place in view of the basic rule of draftsmanship that one does not change the form of words unless one is also going to change the meaning.  There we have the kernel of the situation in regard to this section because that principle reveals the thinking that was expressed to the draftsman as to what he was to produce. What we have to try to amend is that repressive type of power.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the idea the draftsman was asked to put into print was the idea of attacking the subversives and above all the backroom boys. The Minister has made no bones about that and it fits in when one considers his statements in the context of this section.  He wanted to get at the backroom boys by introducing this principle of guilt by association and by introducing this offence of encouraging. Everyone in this House, if he is honest, must admit that the connotations and meanings of the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; are so vast that if this section were to be applied in a situation which it is envisaged to deal with that vast application could harm a great many innocent people.  The Minister was prepared to take that risk and he was also prepared to take the risk of harming innocent <Col N="3032" /> people who might be associated with a perfectly respectable protesting group if, at the same time, he could get at his <i>bête noire</i>, the backroom boys he has been speaking about.  In his anxiety to get at them, he has caused the Parliamentary draftsman to draft what I submit, without fear of contradiction, is new law and an entirely new principle.  In disregarding the widespread effect of this new law and this new legal principle, the Minister has, perhaps, unwittingly at best, or carelessly at second best, or even deliberately at worst, had half an eye on recalcitrant journalists who might be inclined sometimes to show sympathy for these backroom boys.  Consequently, the section as drafted is in wide, loose terms which would enable the Minister to prosecute a respectable newspaper which might, unwittingly, make a comment and thereby be held to encourage an offence under either of the preceding two sections.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the mentality which asked for this section to be drafted was repressive in its thinking at that time and was quite careless in its outlook and as to what side effects this particular idea could have adversely on innocent persons acting <i>bona fide</i>.  The amendment, unfortunately, at this stage, can only hope to soften the ill-effect of this section. The only answer for this nefarious section is to kill it in the same way as free speech was guillotined effectively here this afternoon but the rules of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opening remarks I indicated that it was impossible to consider the amendment <i>in vacuo</i> and that we could consider it sensibly only in relation to the entire section because every Act of Parliament must be interpreted first, according <Col N="3033" /> to the letter and if the letter is defective or obscure or ambiguous, the court is then entitled to look to the spirit which appears within that letter. In considering the amendment as now proposed this House must at least be entitled to the same rights.  Consequently, I would submit that what I am saying is both pertinent and relevant.</P>
      <P>The point I was making was that this section has within it the possibility&mdash;I suppose one could say the probability&mdash;of inhibiting Press comment and, depending on the personality of the occupant of the Ministry for Justice at any particular time, it could have within it the certainly of inhibiting Press comment, the certainty of denying the Press the full freedom that it, like anything else in a free, democratic society, should be able to enjoy. The amendment seeks to soften this section in relation to the Press.  It seeks to exempt the Press from the possibility of committing an offence under this section and for the life of me I fail to see how the members of a party who pride themselves on the label &ldquo;republican&rdquo; can support a section which has the possibilities I have outlined and can deny an amendment, the whole spirit of which is designed to protect freedom.  The first hallmark of a true republican is a regard for freedom but I am afraid that the quality of republicanism as being practised by our colleagues on the other side of the House has changed or diminished and does not permit the acceptance of freedom in the fullest concept of that ideal if it might impinge on their activities.  That is the sad reality because if that were not the reality, this amendment would be accepted without question.  It would have to be accepted and no Minister of a republican party would be allowed by his colleagues to introduce a section such as this which has within it such potential danger to one of the basic tenets of republicanism&mdash;liberty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be a dichotomy of personal ideal within Fianna Fáil at this moment.  The Minister has shown himself to be a man of strength within that party by being able to persuade them to come here and support the <Col N="3034" /> chop but I would appeal to the other elements to realise the mistake that they have made and to appreciate the harm they have done if not to this Parliament at least to themselves and their ideals and to assert themselves on the side of freedom.</P>
    <P>That is all we are asking.  We are not asking them to assert themselves on any unjust or outrageous cause.  We are not asking them to support subversives, scruffies or queers but to assert themselves on the side of freedom.  It is a simple appeal and I cannot understand why a party professing proudly their republicanism cannot accept that appeal.  I suppose it is a matter of internal politics within that party as to the reasons why they cannot accept the appeal but if they are the only reasons, I would say that they are sordid reasons and that they are unworthy.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7, was akin in spirit to this amendment.  It was wider in the sense that it sought exemption for radio and television journalists.  The objections to that amendment put forward by the Minister were that it was unreal to exempt the Press on the offence of incitement, that they were always liable to be prosecuted for that offence.  I quite agree with the Minister; they were always liable and should be always liable; but I disagree with the Minister when he says that that is all that this section does&mdash;to create the offence of incitement.  It creates an entirely new offence and it expresses a new concept and a new mentality.  Because of its vast width, vast area of potential application, it is designed to get at the backroom boys, as the Minister calls them, and in that design it can get at perfectly innocent people, among them the Press.  I do not think that the end ever justifies the means and certainly the end of squashing the few scruffies conspiring in a backroom does not justify the means when the means involves muzzling the Press.  This consequence has been pointed out often in this House and has been pointed out by the newspapers themselves. As a result of all this that consequence must be well known to the the Government and to the members of the Government Party.  In spite of that we are no nearer a position in <Col N="3035" /> which the leopard might change his spots in regard to this amendment.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand the type of mind that can be so deaf to so much valid argument, the type of mind that can just stare valid argument in the face and completely ignore it.  I find it difficult to understand the personality, the ethos of the Fianna Fáil Party in this regard.  All this amendment wants is to ensure that the Press will be free.  I know the Minister's objections to the earlier amendment were that a person with a pamphlet or an irresponsible guest on television would be exempted under the terms of the earlier amendment and that that would be unfair.  That objection does not even arise on this amendment because this amendment is confined to giving exemption from prosecution under this section to comment appearing in a newspaper, magazine, periodical or book.</P>
    <P>I use the word &ldquo;comment&rdquo; but unfortunately the section as drafted could be applied to the mere reportage of news.  The way news was presented, the pictorial illustrations that went with it, cartoons that might be used to highlight it, those things could be alleged to constitute encouragement.  In addition to their first duty of reporting news, and I cannot see that there can be any argument in favour of a section which could curtail the right to report news, newspapers traditionally, and very properly, have always conceived it as part of their duty to comment on news, to put forward a point of view so that public opinion might be swayed by it, to accept it or to reject it, so that the attitude of the public would be educated as a result of the comment appearing in the Press.  What could be more relevant for a newspaper to comment on than matters of social grievance, the very types of thing that have given rise to this Bill initially&mdash; lack of homes, an inequitable situation with regard to the fishing rivers in Ireland?  These are matters of social grievance and if they overflow in protest, protest involving trespass or temporary occupation, perfectly justifiable protest in the thinking of very many responsible and what one would call conservative people, surely a newspaper <Col N="3036" /> must be allowed to comment one way or the other on such activities? If it comments in favour of them there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that that newspaper is committing an offence under this section unless this amendment is accepted and the newspapers are exempted from the effect of the section.</P>
    <P>I dealt earlier with the thinking that must have gone into this section.  I indicated, because of the type of drafting that appears in the section and of the novel legal principle of guilt by association, that that thinking showed a person determined to crush what he considered to be an irritant in this country.  It showed a carelessness in that thinking, a dangerous carelessness in regard to the ideal of freedom, because as I have demonstrated the section as drafted can catch innocent people.  Once it can, it must be repugnant to this House.  In its ability to do that it inhibits freedom.  We then have to consider that section and this amendment in the context of the ideal of freedom.  Especially when it is under potential attack, as it is in this section, we have to consider how that ideal can be protected.  We live in a free democracy and our basic freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and by the courts.  This Parliament is one of the organs of State under that Constitution and, knowing the guarantees of freedom the Constitution provides, it must be careful not to pass any law that would violate those guarantees. In addition to the guarantees, there are certain conventions of society which themselves have considerable force in acting as guarantors of our liberty.  One of those conventions is that our Press shall be free to report. The necessity for this is painfully obvious when we take the example of countries which lack freedom and when we consider the state of the Press in those countries.</P>
    <P>People will not tolerate their freedom being diminished provided they know the attack on their freedom is being made and this is where the Press assumes a major importance.  It is through the Press that the attacks by the Executive on the freedom of individuals can be made known.  It is through the Press, by its ability to <Col N="3037" /> comment on and sway public opinion, that the electorate&mdash;who are ultimately the masters of the politicians&mdash;can be informed of what the politicians are up to.  It is through the Press the politicians can be given the message to desist.  This convention of an independent and free Press is as important in a democracy as the written guarantees contained in the Constitution.  We should be as careful to preserve it in its entirety&mdash;to expand it if possible&mdash; as we are to ensure that basic constitutional rights are never infringed or impaired.</P>
    <P>Another guarantee should be Parliament itself.  Parliament is representative of the people and it should follow that the people, through their representatives, would never want to do anything which would in any way limit or inhibit their freedom.  I do not mean just basic freedoms; democracy means more than that.  The spirit should be free and there should not be any repression anywhere in our society. It would seem a contradiction in terms if Parliament, composed of representatives of the people, should ever seek to introduce legislation which would diminish any of these freedoms. However, the Parliamentary system has lost its independence in the sense that Parliament, in effect, is subject to the Executive.  There has been a further gloss on that in that the Executive frequently is subject to the will and the whim of a single man, the chief minister&mdash;in our case the Taoiseach.  Consequently, the people are not entitled to look to Parliament for the protection they should receive from it because Parliament has allowed itself to become subject to the Executive, and even subject to a Taoiseach.  This has been an unfortunate development in the evolution of parliamentary democracy in this country and in every country which has that particular system of government.</P>
    <P>It is a disturbing development.  I do not impute any particular malice to the Executive we have at the moment although there has been justification enough in today's &ldquo;chop&rdquo; to attribute malice to it.  The Executive does not like to see its will baulked and it does not like to see its proposals curtailed <Col N="3038" /> or diminished.  It has given thought to them and, in its wisdom, it has decided they are for the benefit of its subjects. The inclination of the Executive is to impose its will on Parliament.  We must consider what are the likely antidotes to this rather poisonous development. As I see it, there is one certain antidote&mdash;a free and fearless Press which will expose such an Executive to the people so that they may remove it from office.  If the Executive are not inclined to move, the Press can send a message via public opinion that the Executive is exceeding itself.</P>
    <P>There should also be the other antidote within Parliament itself in that Parliament should be a body that should reject such activities by the Executive.  Parliament is the repository of all things democratic.  It should rise up in wrath and turn on an Executive that would ask it to pass legislation of a repressive kind, legislation of this kind which, as drafted, is so wide that it could conceivably harm innocent persons.</P>
    <P>However, Parliament does not do that.  We had the sad and distressing spectacle of a majority of Parliament accepting what the Executive purpose. It is not just in this nefarious incident. Parliament is prepared to accept everything the Executive propose.  It is no substitute, within the context of a Parliamentary democracy, to say that the majority party have debated all these matters within the private confines of their party room.  This is the place for these things to be debated by all Members of this Parliament because every TD who is elected is elected as a parliamentarian first, and as a member of a political party, second.  Unfortunately, that is not the way we are inclined to look at our situation.  We have allowed the party game to intervene and to prevent Parliament from becoming as powerful an antidote to poison in this legislation as the Press is.</P>
    <P>It is only a mechanical majority, to be triggered off to pass any piece of legislation that the Executive decide ought be passed and which allows it to be passed.  It behoves the rest of us to look at our society and see what protection there is for us from that <Col N="3039" /> politically dangerous situation.  When we look around us the only protection we have is public opinion.  I equate public opinion with the Press.  Consequently, it becomes a matter of grave importance, a matter of great urgency, when the one real protection we have can be threatened, as it is threatened in this section.  The Minister, by implication, admits that this section can stifle newspapers from commenting. That implication arises from his argument that newspapers have always been liable to be prosecuted for incitement.</P>

      <P>That alone has been the law.  I suppose if one searches the law reports one might find a case but I have never heard of a newspaper so irresponsible as to find itself prosecuted or convicted for the offence of incitement.  It is perfectly valid for the Minister to say that newspapers are subject to the law but it is not valid to say that the proposed law does not change that situation.</P>
      <P>I have demonstrated the overtones, the implications and connotations of this section, of the potential width of its application and its efforts to get at the backroom boys, the people who are behind the scenes egging on the squatters, by bringing in the principle of guilt by association, a novel and nefarious principle and one again completely at variance with the spirit and tradition of our democracy and our rule of common law.  The Minister has expressed himself as being prepared to take the risk of hurting innocent people.  He is callous to all the consequences which this section contains within itself and that callousness was confirmed for us here this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It behoves us to protest and to plead with the Minister for goodness sake to exempt the Press.  What harm can it possibly do to this section to remove the Press from its ambit?  This obstinacy of the Government in not wanting to exempt the Press I suppose <Col N="3040" /> only confirms the repressive mentality that requested the drafting of this section. That undemocratic, totalitarian mentality would not want the Press to be exempted because they must recognise that the Press are their foe.  If they want to indulge in their own nefarious activities they realise they can do so with much more ease with a muzzled Press than with an active Press.  That is the mentality of the Executive who are asking this Parliament to accept this legislation.  The only thing I can do is to remind the Deputies on the other side, who have in the past provided a mechanical majority for that Executive that their first duty is not to the party but to the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of Deputy Cruise-O'Brien's speech he referred to a number of people and a number of words far outside the scope of the particular amendment on which he was speaking.  One of the references he made was in relation to Lady Montague, <i>Oxford English Dictionary,</i> volume 3.  In his reference to subsection (1) of the Bill he referred to this honourable lady in the following terms: Lady M. W. Montague stated that no woman dares encourage two lovers at a time.  How that refers to this Bill beats me.  He went further to quote Rogers in relation to this section and this is what Rogers had to say, as he was quoted: &ldquo;The famous were allowed to encourage venturous boys in bringing in young birds for the purpose of training.&rdquo;  How these particular quotations apply to the Bill I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they are on record.  The first one was in relation <Col N="3057" /> to Lady M.W. Montague: &ldquo;No woman dares encourage two lovers at a time.&rdquo;  I do not know to whom he was referring.  I cannot see any reference to that in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The other one is more important, and I hope the Labour Party will clarify the situation when they are speaking on the rest of the Bill so that other Fianna Fáil speakers will be able to understand the intellectuals of the Labour Party. Rogers, as he said, was around to encourage venturous boys in bringing in young birds for the purpose of training. How they refer to this Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill I cannot say.  Does he mean that the birds were brought in to squat?  Does he mean that the young men who encouraged these venturous boys to bring in the birds for the purpose of training&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would hate to prevent Deputy Dowling being picked up by an agent who might be in the Gallery listening to his comic turn, but I would point out that a closure was moved on the amendment on which Deputy Dowling is speaking; that was the one dealing with encouragement.  If we are to continue with that, then surely the closure motion which has been moved and carried has been wasted?</P>

Trade unionists like Deputy Michael O'Leary and his colleagues, Deputies Cruise-O'Brien and Noel Browne, wanted to ensure that the Press would be handcuffed by methods other than what they suggest here.  They wanted to ensure that visitors who came to the country were subjected to pressures to ensure that they would not be served meals, and that the Press would not publish reports about it.  They wanted to ensure when they endeavoured to see that facilities would be withdrawn from the tourists that that would not be reported in the Press.  The same thing applies in relation to hotel accommodation.  They attempted to cover up.  They used all sorts of pressures <Col N="3062" /> to ensure that visitors to this country could not get the facilities to which they were entitled.  They endeavoured to intimidate the Press.

I was not permitted to make more than a passing reference to newspaper comment on the dole <i>et cetera</i> and yet this Deputy is being allowed to roam over the entire area.</P>

The Press are able to deal with the situation as it affects them in a very effective way. Nobody has endeavoured to tie the Press in any way but there is an effort from this back-up service of the Labour Party to ensure that certain groups of people will be protected from legislation of any kind so that they can, when they desire, decide who will occupy either corporation or private dwellings.  For some time past we have seen people being deprived of their accommodation.  To my way of thinking any legislation that protects the rights of people to accommodation is worthwhile.</P>

This amendment is a tactic of the Labour and Fine Gael Parties in their efforts to bolster up and protect subversive groups who wish to operate freely throughout the country, to disrupt the affairs of local authorities and to take over houses, both local authority and private.

The subsection as it stands will ensure that people who advocate the commission of an offence will be adequately dealt with.  If the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party feel that they want to protect people who are entitled to accommodation, to protect the jobs and homes of Irish workers then they will be in favour of this subsection as it stands.

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I should like to support this amendment which provides for the insertion of the following words:</P>
      <P>provided always and it is hereby declared that reasonable comment on a matter of public interest in any newspaper, magazine, periodical or book shall not constitute an offence under this subsection.</P>
      <P>All we are asking is to allow &ldquo;reasonable comment&rdquo; on a matter of public interest.  If there is a housing problem, if houses fall down and people are homeless and an editor is prompted to write about their plight and to ask that some provision be made for them, or if some people find themselves in difficulty, out on the street or seeking shelter in some little hovel and an editor supports them and says they are morally justified in doing that he should not go to jail.  This is a safeguard we would like to see written into this Bill. It is one of the last attempts we will make to ensure that freedom of the Press is assured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that freedom of the Press has been guaranteed all along and all he wants to do is to spell out the law as it is for them.  The Minister <Col N="3079" /> said: &ldquo;I want it to be clear to people&rdquo; but there is no need for it to be clear because anyone who edits a newspaper knows about limitations, knows about reasonable comment, knows that he can speak about social matters; but the Minister by section 4 has made things completely different for him.  An editor, by the fear that it could be applied, could be prevented from commenting on matters of public importance.</P>
    <P>This amendment is not one that Fianna Fáil could reasonably object to. If Fianna Fáil object to this amendment we are on our way to a fascist State.  This is an opportunity being granted to them to ensure that the Press remain free.  It is an opportunity for them to say: &ldquo;We have no bad intentions towards the Press; we have no intention of stifling public opinion as expressed in newspapers; we have no intention of curbing them in their criticism or comment.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We seek to have this amendment included in the Bill so that when the present Minister for Justice and the present Government are gone and when the interpretation of the courts is sought they may read this reasonable amendment included in the Bill.  The last Deputy put forward no reasonable argument against the amendment.  All he said was that it would not be accepted.  If the editor of a newspaper wishes to comment on any social problem in this city he should be able to do so without fear of being brought to court.</P>
      <P>It is not inciting people to do wrong by asking that the words &ldquo;reasonable comment&rdquo; be inserted.  It is not encouraging people, as the Minister says, to break the law.  The words &ldquo;reasonable comment&rdquo; leave it to the interpretation of the courts to say what they mean.  Since the 18th century, when a newspaper is brought before the courts on libellous matters it can plead before a jury that it was reasonable comment. We believe that this freedom is being taken from them in this Bill.  The Minister has not convinced us otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3080" /> There would have been no need for section 4 of this Bill if freedom of the Press was guaranteed.  The danger to the freedom of the Press is there in that section.  It is not the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party who say this.  It is the newspapers of the country who say it.  They have been alert to the dangers of this section and have condemned the present Government. The <i>Cork Examiner</i> said in an editorial: &ldquo;It is not often that this newspaper takes a stand on an issue to criticise the Government.&rdquo;  They had their fears about section 4 of the Forcible Entry Bill.  They knew that the freedom of the Press was in danger. The <i>Irish Times</i> said that this section was so dangerous that they could be stifled altogether and that it was obvious that the Bill would have to be challenged in the courts because the Government had gone so far in section 4.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling thought it was wrong to put in this amendment.  If a Deputy of this House outside this House condemns a situation, condemns the pollution in Dublin Bay, and if he suggests that the people take action about it and the Press comment on that or support him and say, perhaps, he is right, unless this amendment is accepted the Press will find themselves in trouble.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and Government are so confident that the freedom of the Press is not at stake, why will they not accept this amendment?  This is the test, this is their opportunity to prove that this is not a fascist Bill.  This is their opportunity to demonstrate that it is not their intention to muzzle the Press.  I do not believe for a moment that they will take it because in the past year the Press have found it necessary to criticise the Government.  Even the <i>Irish Press</i>, a servile organ of the Government Party&mdash;as a matter of fact the circulation of that newspaper depended on cumann subscriptions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the question refers to upkeep grants for national primary and for other main roads.  These will be payable at the normal rate, that is to say 100 per cent of approved expenditure on national primary roads and 50 per cent of approved expenditure on other main roads.  The amount of the upkeep grants approved for Donegal County Council rose by more than £51,000 last year and grants of the same amount as last year have been allocated in the current year. These include the increase from 50 per cent to 100 per cent in the rate of upkeep grant for national primary roads brought into operation for the first time last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county council have asked that the amount of upkeep grant for main roads, other than national primary <Col N="2969" /> roads, should be further increased this year, to match an extra provision from rates revenue, but it will not be possible to make any supplementary grant, as anticipated Road Fund income has already been fully committed.  I do not expect that this decision will have a significant effect on the council's overall road programme, having regard to the substantial rise in the amount of the upkeep grant over the last two years.</P>

Subsequently, it was decided to defer construction of this particular section of the road network until a housing layout was being prepared for the area where the pitch and putt course is situated.  It will be some time yet before such a layout is prepared, as housing development is starting at the other end of the valley.  I have no doubt that the existing amenities will be taken into account by the corporation when they are having the layout prepared.</P>
