      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in this House in reply to Questions on the 10th July, 1968 and the 4th February, 1970, that I would be prepared to facilitate the setting-up of an all-party committee to see how best we could commemorate those who died during the civil war period.  There has already been some correspondence with the parties opposite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach <Col N="3" /> not have regard to the fact that the question concerns the birth of the founder of Sinn Féin whose philosophy and outlook gave rise to and is one of the most fundamental beliefs of our independent nation?  On that account, would not the Taoiseach have regard for the special status and special position of Arthur Griffith in all Irish history and ensure that he is honoured and respected by the State without having regard to any divisions that may have arisen between him and others during what the Taoiseach has referred to as the civil war period?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The 100th anniversary of the birth of Arthur Griffith has already passed but, in any event, my offer still stands.  Arthur Griffith was a civil war figure and I think it would be inappropriate to single out any civil war figure for special honour.  I think that the suggestion I made was a proper one, that between us we could devise some means whereby all those who died in the civil war can be honoured suitably.</P>

      <P>There has been some correspondence with the Whips of the two Opposition parties.  In the meantime, a committee was established for the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Truce.

      <P>I have the file before me and there is no such suggestion thereon.  I am not aware that any information on those lines was given verbally but, as I have said, what I think happened was that my original suggestion was put aside in the light of the establishment of the special committee to which I have referred.  In reply to Deputy Corish, a special committee was established to draw up a programme to commemorate the Truce, the 50th anniversary of which will occur in July this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Was not the question of landing rights one of the main topics under discussion between the Taoiseach and the Secretary of State for Commerce of the United States? Further, is the Taoiseach aware that there has been a considerable amount of speculation, of uncertainty and of fear regarding the possibility of a change in Government attitude in relation to this matter and would he clarify the situation by stating whether any change in Government policy is contemplated <Col N="5" /> regarding the vexed question of landing rights?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be improper for me to give in any detail the subject matter of my discussions with Secretary Stans but I did outline the Government attitude towards landing rights&mdash;an attitude that has been expressed many times and which is well known to the Deputy and which has been stated publicly on several occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not the Taoiseach agree that any change in policy at this stage regarding landing rights would be fraught with very serious consequences not only for Shannon but for the whole economy of the west as well as for our tourist industry and the welfare of our national airline? Can I take it that the Taoiseach did indicate this and spell it out clearly to Secretary Stans?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if the implementation of expanded health services, as reported on 1st April, requires new legislation; if not, the existing legislation and the sections of such legislation under which he intends to implement the changes; and the cost of such changes to the Exchequer and the ratepayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 31st of March I issued a statement to the effect that I had made the necessary statutory instruments to transfer the operation of the health services from the existing local authorities to the new health boards from 1st April.  I also indicated that few changes had been made in the provisions relating to services, the most significant of these being the removal of charges for out-patient services for eligible persons. The estimated cost of this measure is in the region of £100,000 a year.</P>
      <P>On the 1st April I stated that legislation was being prepared to introduce a scheme of contributions by the middle income group towards the cost of the health services available to that group.  I hope to bring this legislation before the Dáil soon.  On the introduction of this scheme the present hospital charges on the middle income group for public ward accommodation, up to 50p per day, would be abolished.</P>
      <P>As a separate measure to this, I propose to introduce as from 1st October a scheme by regulations under the Health Act, 1970, sections 52 (2), 56 (3) and 59 (3), whereby in-patient and out-patient treatment will be provided free of charge for children in all income groups for specified long-term conditions, and drugs and medicines <i>et cetera</i> also free of charge for such conditions for persons in all income groups.  It is expected that this scheme will cost in the region of £150,000 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will make a statement concerning the appointment of a permanent cardiologist to the Cork Health Authority; and why the present post has been filled for almost 12 years on a temporary basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is presumed that the post referred to in the question is that of permanent physician-cardiologist to the Cork Health Authority.  This post was created in lieu of a temporary post of cardiologist which was first filled in 1958.  When the question of making a permanent appointment was raised it had to be considered in the light of the decrease that had occurred <Col N="9" /> in the amount of specialised cardiac surgery that was being carried out.  The alternative of appointing a physician with a specialised interest in cardiology was then considered.  A decision on this was delayed by the difficulty of arranging for an appropriate allocation of hospital beds to the new consultant post.  This difficulty was eventually overcome by the allocation of beds between St. Stephen's Hospital, Glanmire, and it was decided to create the new office of physician-cardiologist.</P>
      <P>A competition for the post was conducted by the Local Appointments Commission.  The person recommended by the commissioners decided not to accept the appointment.  The Cork Health Authority made a further request to the commissioners for an alternative recommendation.  The Southern Health Board, which has replaced the Cork Health Authority, is awaiting the recommendation of the commissioners. Meanwhile the temporary appointment of a cardiologist has been continued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say for what the £19 million will be paid? Will it be just for administration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; of the Community&mdash;the Community would be entitled to receipts from agricultural levies, receipts from the customs tariffs and a yield from the value added tax not exceeding 1 per cent.  The estimate made in the White Paper is on the basis that £4.5 million would come from the receipts from levies, £5.4 million from the customs tariffs and £9 million from the other, giving £18.9 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that in the post-transitional period £19 million will not be the maximum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>That is our estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is your estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Our contribution, yes. But you cannot be accurate.  As time goes on it will depend on the level of the Community budget which will change and as time goes on we will make new assessments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say at what stage in the next five or six months will this particular item be negotiated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that the contribution to be made by Britain&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is being negotiated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;during the transitional period is being negotiated and is causing delay in negotiations but if this is overcome the negotiations with the others would be dealt with quickly after that.  The contribution after the transitional period will be an automatic contribution related to the levies <Col N="12" /> you take up in agriculture, customs tariffs collected and a percentage of the value added tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will negotiations by Britain have any effect on the amount we will pay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  No, the negotiations by Britain are not on the post-transitional contribution but are concerned with how much they will give during the transitional period to phase them into the full contribution for the post-transitional, &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; system so that it should not have any effect on our contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the figure of £19 million as our post-transitional contribution is now a very conservative figure in the light of the developments which have taken place since the publication of the Government's White Paper?  Would he agree that, perhaps, it would be £25 million to £30 million now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The assessment at this time is that it is possibly somewhat less than the £19 million mentioned in the White Paper but if circumstances change we shall make a new assessment and publish it.  As of now, the estimate of £19 million as our contribution in the post-transitional period would stand.</P>

      <P>The rural electrification <Col N="15" /> planned post-development scheme is being carried out by the ESB on an area by area basis so as to keep the cost of the work to the lowest possible level and thus ensure that the maximum number of connections is made with the capital available.  Capital contributions are sought by the board only from unconnected householders who are unwilling to wait until the planned scheme reaches their area.  In such cases, if it is possible to make the connection without diverting staff from planned work, the board will offer to extend supply but only on payment by the applicant of a substantial contribution to the cost of the work, as the board's current budget for rural electrification will not have provided for the expenditure.  Otherwise, some one or more householders who are already in the planned scheme would lose their place until a later date.</P>
      <P>Persons who make capital contributions in these circumstances are reimbursed when the planned scheme reaches their areas.  The present policy could not be altered without adversely affecting the progress of the general programme; to do so the average cost of supplying consumers would inevitably increase and slow down the overall rate of connection.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether, in view of the increasing number of passengers using rail commuter services in the Dublin area, CIE has sought financial help or is otherwise taking steps to acquire new rolling stock especially suited to give speedier and more frequent services and easier entrance to and exit from carriages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE have not sought financial help for the specific purpose of acquiring new rolling stock for commuter services.  The board propose to convert existing diesel rail cars to carriage stock with additional seating and standing accommodation for use on the Dublin suburban rail services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister have regard to the need to encourage commuter <Col N="16" /> traffic by speeding up the trains and to the fact that a considerable amount of delay arises by reason of the construction of the existing rolling stock which requires each door to be manually opened and closed?  Would the Government, with CIE, work to ensure automatic opening and closing and a modern rolling stock so that the number of halts could be increased and additional services provided to encourage commuter traffic?</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>The Shannon-Dublin air service was introduced by Aer Lingus in 1966 at the request of the then Minister for Transport and Power.  This was done to improve the service to and from Dublin for passengers of other transatlantic airlines serving Shannon.  No commitment to provide or maintain the service was sought or given and the provision of the service is not a condition of the bilateral air services agreement between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus indicated in December, 1970 that they wished to discontinue the service because of heavy losses on it.  The Aer Lingus estimates showed that the estimated loss on the operation of the service, taking only direct costs into account, would amount to £43,000 for the summer of 1971.  The aircraft, if employed on other more profitable routes, would make a surplus of £100,000 on operating costs and make a substantial contribution to overheads and could be expected to bring in a worthwhile quota of tourist business. Figures as to the actual user of the service and other relevant information were sought but were not then readily available.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus was not in a position to produce actual figures at the time.  It was not until March, 1971 that all the relevant information had been extracted. The user of the service estimated by Aer Lingus amounted to-only 4.3 per cent of the passengers carried to and from Shannon by the American airlines in 1970.  The US Airlines were unable to provide comparable statistics. This meant that the service was being operated at a loss of approximately £75 per transatlantic passenger carried between Dublin and Shannon. The information also indicated that the user of the service was diminishing steeply.  As between 1969 and 1970, the user dropped from 7.2 per cent in 1969 to 4.3 per cent in 1970.</P>
      <P>In terms of passengers per flight the figures were 10 in 1969 and 8.5 in 1970, while the Aer Lingus forward bookings for 1971 indicated an average of 3.6 per flight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> When the necessary information to enable a decision to be taken was available in late March, 1971, the matter was submitted to Government.  Following the decision of the Government Aer Lingus were informed on the 2nd April, 1971, of agreement to the discontinuance of the service.</P>
    <P>Representations in the matter have been received from the Ambassador of the United States of America to Ireland, from Transworld Airlines and from Bord Fáilte.  The Ambassador discussed with the Minister for Transport and Power the problems arising for US passengers already booked on the service.  The other representations were on similar lines&mdash;namely, that the US airlines and US travel trade are already committed this summer to passengers booked on this service.  The estimates now furnished to the Department of Transport and Power by TWA of the number of passengers who used the service in 1970 and expected to use the service in 1971 differ very substantially from the estimates of Aer Lingus.  It is not possible at this stage to reconcile these differences and I have, therefore, decided in deference to the representations made that the service should be maintained for the coming summer.  During the summer accurate checks will be made to establish precisely the extent to which the service is being used and the whole question will then be re-examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's detailed statement I should just like to ask him one supplementary question: Can the Minister say why this decision could not have been taken three or four months earlier so that the American airline timetables could have been synchronised with the Irish airline's timetable?  No problem would have arisen if this had been done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, the detailed statistics required were not available until late March of this year. The decision would have been taken earlier but for that.  It is primarily because of the inconvenience involved for those who have made bookings on the basis of the existing services that the decision has been made to carry the service on for the rest of the summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that two applications for grants in respect of extensions and improvements to existing hotels were approved by the board in the period from June, 1969 to April, 1971; 57 projects in this particular category were carried out satisfactorily during the period; and grants are outstanding in six cases, all of which were certified in 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to holiday accommodation grants in general, in 1969-70 there was <Col N="23" /> a rapid acceleration in the building up of grant commitments with the result that the demands on Bord Fáilte exceeded the amount which could be made available by the Exchequer for this purpose.  I secured Dáil approval for a supplementary estimate of £500,000 for holiday accommodation in December, 1969, bringing the total provision for 1969-70 to £1,500,000. This additional sum was used by Bord Fáilte to ease the most pressing cases but some commitments had to be carried forward.</P>
    <P>With a view to clearing the backlog of grants as quickly as possible and having regard to commitments already in the pipeline, Bord Fáilte decided as a general rule not to enter into any new commitments as from July, 1969. While £1,500,000 was also provided for accomodation grants in 1970-71, there is still a residue of commitments to be met and the board is still not taking on any new commitments except in very exceptional cases.</P>

      <P>The present ordinary overdraft rate in Ireland is 9½ per cent. In 1970, ordinary overdraft rates in Europe and America, as published in the OECD Financial Statistics, ranged from minimum rates of 8 per cent to 8½ per cent in the U.K., 8.07 per cent to 8.86 per cent in the United States, 9½ per cent to 10½ per cent in Sweden, 9½ per cent to 13½ per cent in France and 10¼ per cent to 12¼ per cent in Germany.

      <P>Where separate assessment has not been claimed and a wife applies for a certificate of tax-free allowances, it is the practice to issue to her a tax-free allowances certificate for the wife's earned income relief plus the allowable portion of any social welfare contributions and expenses.  In practice these combined tax-free allowances come to about £2.25 per week.  If a husband wishes to have some further part of the tax-free allowances to which he is entitled transferred to his wife, the inspector of taxes will apportion the allowances and will issue separate certificates of tax-free allowances accordingly.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to rural land and property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> The Land Act, 1965, initiated a system of direct control by the Land Commission over the purchase of rural land by non-qualified persons, of whom non-citizens are the principal category.</P>
    <P>The position generally under the Land Act, 1965, is that no interest in non-urban land can vest in a person who does not come within the categories of &ldquo;qualified person&rdquo; defined in section 45 (1) of the Act except with the written consent of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Each application for consent under section 45 is considered on its merits but, on the whole, the general guideline in force, in so far as non-citizens are concerned, is that permission will not be granted to them to purchase land in order to engage in those forms of production commonly practised by Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>In the year ended 31st March, 1971, &mdash;apart from transactions (a) arising solely from mortgage interests, (b) involving areas not exceeding five acres and (c) representing transfers between one non-citizen (individual or company) and another&mdash;the total acreage in respect of which the consent of the Land Commission was given to the vesting of interests in land in non-qualified persons was 3,045 acres.</P>
    <P>A substantial portion of this acreage consisted of the types of property which could hold no attraction for the ordinary Irish purchaser.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will arrange to have all habitable houses on Land Commission property given to people who are badly in need of housing as many of these houses are left unoccupied for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission's <Col N="39" /> primary function is, of course, land settlement.  Very often, the disposal of houses is inextricably bound up with the disposal of the lands on which they stand.  The Deputy himself will appreciate that this is especially the case where the rearrangement of fragmented holdings is envisaged when lands, and any houses thereon, are necessarily held on hands pending the accumulation of a pool of land to facilitate the formulation of a scheme for rearrangement.</P>
      <P>Normally where houses on lands acquired by the Land Commission are not required for ordinary land settlement purposes they are offered for sale by public auction and there are standing instructions that such houses should be disposed of promptly.</P>
      <P>Indeed, I am greatly concerned to achieve a more rapid disposal of houses on hands and am looking into this whole matter at the moment.</P>

      <P>Intensive searches are made by my Department for unlicensed bulls as they offer a serious threat to our livestock industry. The inspectors engaged for this work, which is neither easy nor pleasant, must be given some latitude in handling difficult cases.  It is a matter for each inspector, while being courteous and discreet in his inquiries, to decide how best to make his search as effective as possible.  The instructions given to the inspectors are in general terms and have not been changed in recent years.</P>

      <P>I looked at the Standing Orders but I was not sure what the procedure was.  I will indicate what I have in mind.  Yesterday <Col N="80" /> the Minister for Finance, as a matter of courtesy, which was appreciated, gave to the leader of the main Opposition Party a copy of the Capital Budget and a copy of the Book of Estimates.  I understand also that a similar concession was given to the leader of the Labour Party.  There was an embargo on comment on these documents until 12 o'clock midnight. Nevertheless, yesterday the Minister for Finance held a press conference at which he commented on the contents of both the Capital Budget and the Book of Estimates, thereby preempting the rights of Deputies in this House in relation to a matter of considerable importance.  This directly affects the question of privilege of Deputies and I ask you, under the terms of Standing Order No. 74, to consider whether this should not be reported to the Committee of Procedure and Privileges for investigation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Before section 2 to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> 2.  &mdash;Any provisions of the Principal Act and this Act which effect or relate to the preservation or the continuity of an employee's employment shall apply to periods of employment before the 1st day of January, 1968, as they apply to such periods after that date. </P>
    <P>In relation to section 2, it is agreeable that we should take amendments Nos. 1 and 49 together.  We are suggesting that before section 2 there should be inserted the following new section:</P>
    <P>2.  &mdash;Any provisions of the Principal Act and this Act which effect or relate to the preservation of the continuity of an employee's employment shall apply to periods of employment before the 1st day of January, 1968, as they apply to such periods after that date.</P>
    <P>This may appear to be a rather tortuous piece of statutory legalism. Nevertheless, the Labour Party are very concerned that this amendment should receive every sympathy from the Minister.  We feel that the amendment by and large would broaden, or rather connect, the general statutory means for preserving the continuity of an employee's general service under the Bill.  We submit that, because the amendment will not in any way impose any financial obligations on employers generally and will not do any harm to any individual, it should be acceptable to the House.</P>
    <P>We had a situation in relation to the debate on the Principal Act and we noted that there was a gap of 23 weeks, between May, 1967 and January, 1968. The Minister may recall the debate in the Seanad at the end of 1967 when this matter was raised.  On the general suggestion in relation to amendments Nos. 1 and 49, we would be happy if the Minister were to accept either amendment.  This would meet our views in relation to the proposed extension of continuity of employment and either amendment would meet the wishes of Labour Deputies in this respect.  I feel that a general strengthening of the continuous employment provision in the Schedule of the 1967 Act would be of considerable benefit.  We would be interested to hear the Minister's view on these amendments because <Col N="83" /> we feel there is a gap at present which needs to be bridged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with what appears to be the spirit of the amendments but I am not quite sure that the Deputy has revealed what exactly he intends to achieve.  In relation to the entire Bill and the provisions on the preservation of continuity of employment and in relation to the most important principles on what I might call the technical side, there are a number of amendments.  As I have said, the first amendment relating to the preservation of continuity of employment has my sympathy but I should like to hear that the amendment is proposed on the understanding that any provision of this kind written into the legislation would become operative only after the date of commencement of the Act&mdash;in other words, that continuity be preserved but that it applies only in relation to cases after the date of the commencement of the Act.  If this is not already clearly established in the Bill, I have already asked the draftsman to have a look at it to ensure that that will happen.  I think this will satisfy the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would seek a slightly broader assurance from the Minister.  The general assurance we want is that the definition would go backward and would go forward.  The Northern Ireland Act seems to contain this broad provision.  Having regard to the assurance given by the Minister I would not be inclined to press our amendment.  The only problem about amendment No. 49 is that it appears to apply to the Schedule as such which is an aspect of concern and amendment No. 1 is more appropriate in that regard.  I would point out to the Minister that in Schedule 3 there is inserted by the Government the words:</P>
      <P>was or is transferred from one person to another,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This may or may not be adequate as far as the Labour Party are concerned. It is the kind of contingency in regard to which we are very anxious to close <Col N="84" /> loopholes but if the Minister can give a general assurance that, by and large, continuity is effectively assured under the Bill we will not unduly press the point with him on the technical basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy understood me properly and he will have an opportunity of looking at this amendment on Report Stage.  I would like to have a discussion with the draftsman regarding an amendment which would put this matter right with regard to continuity of service but it would not enable past cases to be reopened; it would apply only to new redundancy claims arising, in other words that the right to continuity of service be preserved. I think this meets the Deputy's point unless I misunderstand him.  He will have an opportunity on Report Stage to have a look at this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>Before section 2 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>If an employee was in continuous employment on/or subsequent to 1st January, 1968 and during the period of continuity he was insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, the Act shall apply to that employee in respect of that period during which he was so insured, provided that his weekly remuneration shall be taken to be the remuneration at the time when the change in insurance occurred and that redundancy payments (if any) arising from this section may be paid from the Redundancy Fund. </P>

      <P>Perhaps with amendment No. 2, we could discuss <Col N="85" /> amendment No. 20, which is a related amendment, if the House agrees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we would be agreeable to discussing Nos. 2 and 20 together.  No. 2 refers specifically to giving greater coverage under the social insurance system to certain categories of employees.  If I may make a particular case, there were some 30 employees affected in the recent Palgrave Murphy receivership because they were over the £1,200 limit.  It seems that the Act discriminates against clerical employees because they do not get credit for previous insurance contributions as do manual workers.  In effect, if one goes out of insurance one goes from under the benefits of the Bill itself.  This amendment would give that essential retrospection, not of a formal kind, but it would give even a consolation prize to the insured worker and he would not lose unduly by virtue of the change in the insurance statutory limits.  It is difficult to frame an amendment to meet entirely the wishes of the Labour Party in this regard but with the recent proposed decision, for example, of the Minister for Social Welfare to raise the insurance limit to £1,600 per annum this question will inevitably, under existing legislation, loom again and inevitably anomalies will tend to develop under the law.  Therefore we are suggesting to the Minister that:</P>
      <P>If an employee was in continuous employment on/or subsequent to 1st January, 1968 and during the period of continuity he was insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, the Act shall apply to that employee in respect of that period during which he was so insured, provided that his weekly remuneration shall be taken to be the remuneration at the time when the change in insurance occurred and that redundancy payments (if any) arising from this section may be paid from the Redundancy Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would stress the last part of the amendment.  This means, in effect, that no employer would be unduly affected retrospectively.  The redundancy fund at the moment is in a healthy condition and it would not suffer an excessive burden if a small number of employees <Col N="86" /> who do not come under the scope of this measure were covered.  I have in mind very much the Palgrave Murphy employees who were kicked out from under the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter how sympathetic I may feel and I know how the Deputies opposite must feel about people who will not get the benefit of the improvements in this Bill I must at this stage say that I shall set myself against any retrospection. There are many cases which have been brought to my notice privately and otherwise which do not benefit under the provisions of the parent Act and while the fund at the moment would appear to be capable of standing up to some largesse in the way of retrospection I am afraid it is not possible to put the stress of retrospection on the fund.  In the terms of the Bill generally we are flirting very generously with the fund.  Apart from that, the idea of retrospection is difficult.  One could hardly introduce it in regard to one aspect and reject it in regard to another.  One could hardly decide from what date it would be acceptable.  I do not wish to be awkward on this point but I have decided to reject any retrospection. I would be opposed to any policy that involved the introduction on a highly selective basis of a new principle, that the benefits be related to insured service rather than to actual service with a particular employer so that a person who ceased to be insurable should be eligible indefinitely for benefits by reference to insured service. Formerly in the cases of persons who went beyond the limit of £1,200 and of non-manual workers, there was provision in the principal Act to leave them in for two years, which period it is proposed to increase to four years, even with the proposed change to the £1,600 limit.  Without going into any further details on this point, I think the principle is wrong having regard to the fact that the coverage given to non-manual workers under this Bill will be improved to a substantial degree.  The principal point is that I am not in favour of retrospection in this case.</P>

      <P>While I agree that <Col N="87" /> the fund should be maintained in a satisfactory state and appreciate that this provision might consume some of the fund I doubt if this would amount to a very considerable amount.  The Minister has stated that he does not believe in retrospection and I am not 100 per cent in favour of it.  However, when other Government Departments are collecting money, for instance income tax, they have no objection to the principle of retrospection.  The Minister of Finance has no objection to imposing taxes retrospectively.  There is one law for the Government and another law for the people.  Where a person has remained in the same job and where increases in his salary have been obtained by trade unions, I consider he should be eligible for redundancy payment.  When a person has got promotion in his job this is a different matter but those who remain in their jobs should be covered.  This would save quite a few people.  I would also point out that the cost of living has soared.  The ceiling should be increased to £2,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the Minister's emphatic statement that the main objection he has to accepting this amendment is the question of retrospection. The Department and the Minister himself have already accepted this principle, and wisely so.  The Minister stated here a short time ago in a case where approximately 30 persons were rendered unemployed that he was making provision that they would come within the scope of this Bill when it was passed.  We agreed with that principle. However, if the Minister could then accept this principle, I cannot understand how he can now be so emphatic about the principle of retrospection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Retrospective legislation would not appear to be a new principle for the Government.  When we had long and heated discussions in this House regarding the then proposed Prices and Incomes Bill, the present Minister for Finance was emphatic that it would be retrospective.  Therefore, having regard to these facts I do not think the Minister's objection to retrospection would bear examination.  On 1st October, <Col N="88" /> 1969, a statement was made by the Department of Labour that the scope of and payments under Bills would be retrospective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Belton that an example of the Revenue Commissioners making something retrospective for collection would justify retrospection in the case of a Bill of this kind.  I would remind Deputy Cluskey that I have conceded already the importance of retrospection with regard to the qualification of applicants in relation to past service but not in relation to cases of persons who failed to qualify under the previous Act who could now be made to qualify under this Bill as from a particular date or in certain circumstances. Too many such cases could be cited and this is one of the reasons I am opposed to retrospection.  One could hardly make provision to suit 30 persons without thinking of another 20 who, by considering different dates and means, could be made to qualify retrospectively. I have decided that I could not accept the principle of retrospection in relation to cases that have been decided in the past.</P>

However, by not having foresight when the Bill was introduced, the Minister excluded persons who should have been included.

I think it can be accepted that the drafting as it stands, without our amendments, prevents an <Col N="89" /> extension to certain clerical employees of the same credit for earlier continuous employment as applies to manual workers.  I am sure the Minister does not want us to accuse him of having a discriminatory aspect in the Bill but it seems to be inbuilt in the Bill and this is very serious.  The retrospective aspect is also serious and both these matters merit further consideration by the Minister prior to Report Stage.

      <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that the new benefits will apply from 21st January, 1971. If the Minister accepts No. 3 and/or No. 46 it will effectively prevent an employer from anticipating and avoiding <Col N="90" /> the provisions of the Bill and thus damaging a person's entitlement to redundancy.  There is nothing new in this.  We have advocated this before and it will help employees made redundant after the new rules have been published.  The provision would not impose any retrospective liability on the individual employer as it is proposed the amount involved would be paid from the Redundancy Fund.  As the fund has approximately £1.75 million in hands it can afford these benefits.</P>

      <P>I am afraid my argument is the same here, that I could not accept any period of retrospection in relation to this.  I do not think the argument that employers would take advantage of the interim period is relevant. Most of the improvements in the Bill will be met out of the fund.  It is unlikely that anybody would try to jump the gun.  There may be hard-luck cases of people having been caught in the interim period.  One can have sympathy with them but it would not justify my accepting the amendment.  I would like to tell Deputy Belton that this is a complicated Bill involving a great deal of technical drafting.  Many amendments have been submitted, over 50 of them by the Labour Party.  All these amendments have had to be processed and I have looked at them as carefully as I could.  While we are very happy that there is a surplus in the fund we are not too sure that the fund could be played around with to the extent of conceding retrospection.  I believe the Bill before the House is reasonably generous and it could put a great strain on the surplus, indeed might erode it to the extent that we would find ourselves with a deficit.  I hope that will not be the case but I will not take any chances that there is sufficient in the fund to do all these things, and I said on the Second Stage that retrospection is one of the principles <Col N="91" /> I would not be prepared to concede.</P>

      <P>The Minister must be aware that in relation to the Principal Act a number of firms jumped the gun. I distinctly remember one case in which the gun was blatantly jumped and in regard to which I had to make representations to the then Minister.  Surely this will happen again.  I wonder if the Minister has any record of the number of complaints made before the passing of the Principal Act to the effect that employers did use the opportunity to bring about redundancies before the Act came into effect.</P>

      <P>I have no such record but I do not think there were anything like the number of cases that were predicted in the House.  There could have been cases; I am not sure, but I would point out that redundancy payments were originally introduced in the Principal Act and many people were not quite clear as to what was entailed.  There may have been cases where small employers or a few irresponsible employers thought they could circumvent the provisions of the legislation, but it certainly did not happen, so far as I am aware, to the extent that would justify my being worried about the period prior to implementation of the legislation.  I am talking now only from memory.  I have no statistics readily available as to the number of cases that were involved at the time.</P>

      <P>Surely there are other aspects involved besides firms jumping the gun.  The Minister even brought in a special Bill, involving the expenditure of £70,000, because one firm jumped the gun.  Maybe there was no choice but to jump the gun but this did happen.  The period involved in this amendment is a maximum of three months, so it will not affect businesses. If it were going back a long period I could understand the objection.  It takes a year to liquidate any business, so a period of three months would not have any significance.  When I referred to delays in regard to this legislation I was not trying to be smart.  If the Government had not been arguing among themselves, this Bill, which I presume <Col N="92" /> the Department had ready earlier, would be law by now.  Because of the delay certain workers will lose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister rightly said that, while the fund was in a reasonably healthy condition, it could not bear too many demands upon it that have not been foreseen, but the number that this amendment would include would not be very great because we are not asking that everyone be included in this arrangement. There is a definite qualification of 104 weeks continuous employment at the time at which interruptions occur or a person would have had 104 weeks continuous employment if the interruption had not occurred before the commencement of the Act provided that redundancy payment, if any, should be made from the Redundancy Fund.</P>
      <P>The improvements inherent in this new Bill were published some time ago. Deputy Belton mentioned that for various reasons, legislation cannot be pushed through this House in a speedy manner but this is very poor consolation to the 200 men in Ballingarry who were laid off last week.  It is a poor consolation to them to know that we in this House have so much legislation on the books that they will be deprived from benefiting from the provision under this Bill.  In tabling this amendment we in the Labour Party did so in a responsible way.  We did not ask that everyone should come under the provisions. We specified definite cases.  I would suggest to the Minister that we would make far more progress and not do any great damage either to the employers or to the Redundancy Fund if he would relax his attitude and not refuse retrospection regardless of the justification for it, if he would consider each amendment on its merits and think of these people in Ballingarry who, only very recently, but long after the provisions of this Bill had been made public, find themselves caught between the employers in Ballingarry and this House.  I should remind the Minister that there is a lot of employees' money in the Redundancy Fund and that it is not all employers' money that has gone towards building up this healthy stockpile.</P>

      <P>In his opening remarks on these two amendments, the Minister suggested that very few employers would avail of the interregnum to take advantage of the lower rates of contribution.  It is in this respect that these two amendments are so important. If they are accepted by the Minister, we will be able to debate the remainder of the amendments in a constructive way, giving sufficient time for argument in an effort to persuade the Minister of the benefit of including these in the Bill.  On the other hand, if the Minister does not accept these two amendments, and if the debate on this Bill continues for a number of weeks, more people will be affected by it&mdash; those people who become redundant between the date mentioned and the date of the coming into effect of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cluskey has mentioned those people who have been laid off at Ballingarry.  We hope that there will be no other such occurrence either now or in the future but this case illustrates the importance of these amendments. If, after we have dealt with a few more amendments, we adjourn this debate at 6 o'clock and are unable to resume the debate for some time because, for instance, of the introduction next week of the Budget, we have no way of knowing when the Bill will be concluded. It may not be concluded for several weeks or even some months. The few people who would be affected would be assured of the proper rate of redundancy payment if the Minister were to accept both the amendments. Such acceptance would allow for proper debate on all the other amendments.</P>

      <P>Nothing that the Deputies have said would lead me to reconsider the matter which, as I said, is fundamental to the whole Bill. Indeed, it affects a large number of the amendments that have already been tabled.  There must be a period from the time of the circulation of the Bill to the enactment of it and I do not think there should be any question of going back.  There is reference in the Bill to one specific case which we are rectifying. This relates to the definition of <Col N="94" /> redundancy to bring into line with the spirit of the original Act arising from a definition given by a High Court decision in relation to a specific case.  This could not be regarded as being restrospective because, as I announced in October, 1969, amending legislation would be brought in to cover this particular case and any similar cases that have arisen since have been dealt with as if this legislation had already been in force.  Other than that, I could not agree nor have I any authority from the Government to agree to any retrospection, irrespective of what the date may be.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister would agree that, in relation to a piece of social legislation of this nature, it is desirable that there should be some commencement date other than the date on which the Bill might be passed?  This gives ample opportunity to any employer in the State to evade the provisions of the Bill if he so desires.  We are being rather conservative and modest in suggesting that a Bill which was published in July, 1970 should have as the operative date for the application of new benefits the 21st January, 1971.  That gives a fair crack of the whip to any employer in terms of application.  We are going further and saying that in respect of those cases that might be involved between the 21st January, 1971 and the date of the passing of the new Bill the interim period be covered by payments from the Redundancy Fund so that no employer would be at any undue loss during that period.  That is reasonable and it facilitates employees, especially those made redundant after the publication of the new rules.  At the moment I know of numerous cases of industrial workers who can only qualify under the old Act but may not <Col N="95" /> benefit under the new one as they are involved in redundancy that is pending. I think there is a case to be made in that regard and while it may be a precedent in some respects I do not think it is of such massive proportions that it should upset the Minister unduly.</P>

It is a fairly gigantic task to make legislation like this retrospective to any date.  Several hundreds of cases would be involved and one has also to consider the case that might qualify under the Bill when it becomes an Act and of the people who knew that they did not qualify under the old legislation and did not apply at all.  It would be impossible to estimate the number of cases even since the 21st January.  Then one cannot help thinking of the people who missed out as from the 1st January.  I have considered this from every angle.  There is nothing to stop me from having a look at what is involved again but I am giving no undertaking whatever to give way.</P>

Now we have £1,750,000, which is not a great deal of money.  There is a great deal of unemployment and the number of redundancies has gone up this year. Somebody at some stage said that a Redundancy Bill was in the offing last July.  The way it is going, will it be in operation by next July?  Surely the date on which it was introduced should be the date, within a month or a fortnight? There may be many employers who held on so that employees who would be made redundant would get the new benefits under this Bill but now they just cannot hold on.  Surely when it was the Minister's intention to bring it in at a certain date and that date has passed it should operate from that date?  I would ask the Minister to change his mind about this.</P>

I was asked about our experience on the last occasion, if there were any evidence of people jumping the gun, from the time the Bill was introduced until it became law, and the position was that there was no proof, but there was some evidence that firms did hold on to their employees until they were able to get the benefit of the new legislation.  I hope that that will be the case here too.  There was some delay since the Second Stage.  I think I mentioned the 10th March, or the 3rd March, as the date for the Committee Stage and it was not possible to have it then.  However, I did mention in my Second Stage speech that I would totally oppose retrospection.  I said that deliberately because I thought that otherwise I might be misleading.</P>

It should be remembered that the Minister for Finance went back a couple of years in regard to one aspect of profits tax <Col N="97" /> and a company which had already fixed their payments had to go back and re-check and provide for three years instead of one.  Nothing like that applies here at all.  There are only two or three months involved and retrospection would do no harm at all. It may be a little complicated but no great cost is involved.  This is like selling a cow where there is a difference between £3 and £1 and you split the difference and make it £2.  This is what we are asking.  We are not even asking for the full amount.</P>

      <P>Is there any great necessity for having section 2 at all in view of the decision taken by the tribunal?  I would refer the Minister to the fact that the tribunal have decided in two cases, Nos. 95 and 97 of 1969, that the Act does not apply to persons aged over 70.  The tribunal have in fact already ruled on this matter and therefore the question may be asked as to whether the section is required.  Secondly I should like to thank the Minister and the staff of the Department for the very comprehensive document with which they have provided us and which outlines the amendments and the nature of the amendments.  This is an explanatory document which is very helpful in considering the Bill.</P>

      <P>There was some doubt about the clarity of the Principal Act in regard to the over 70s and this is merely for clarification. Payments will not be made for the first time beyond the age of 70.  However, there is provision in the Bill for persons who have already been in receipt of benefits by the time they reach 70 and they are allowed to exhaust the benefits even though this carries on until they are over 70.  I am grateful to the Deputy for his remarks about the work the staff have put into this to try to simplify it.  Nobody is better aware than I am of the work involved here and the vast amount of material that had to be processed in relation to the amendments and I know <Col N="98" /> that the Deputy is cognisant of that fact.  The classification in section 2 puts the matter beyond doubt.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete line 21 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  the substitution for subsection (2) of the following:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(2)  Subject to subsection (1). an employee who is dismissed shall be taken to be dismissed by reason of redundancy if the dismissal is attributable wholly or mainly to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the fact that his employer has ceased, or intends to cease, to carry on the business for the purposes of which the employee was employed by him, or has ceased or intends to cease, to carry on that business in the place where the employee was so employed, or&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We brought this amendment to the attention of the Minister and if he is unhappy about it we will not press it unduly but we suggest that if there is a general consolidation measure the Minister might be wise to print the Act as amended as a general Departmental document.  I have in mind that with the Bill going through the House, the many sides of industry, employment exchanges, trade unions and various tribunal members could usefully have in advance the amendments as they are agreed or rejected by the House in view of the very complex nature of this Bill.  Apart from that we regard amendment No. 4 as a consolidation suggestion on our part.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 4 and 5, to add to section 3 (1) the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or</P>
      <P>()  the fact that, in the opinion of the Tribunal the employee was dismissed (or is taken to have been dismissed) in circumstances of redundancy other than those prescribed in paragraphs (b) to (e) of this subsection.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We are suggesting that the tribunal should enjoy under the Act a certain latitude in the definition of redundancy. One of the problems facing the House is that we did pass the Act in 1967: it came into effect in 1968 and now we are here a couple of years later redefining various sections of the Act in the light of decisions by the High Court and the tribunal.  We, therefore, suggest as a general provision a new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;()  the fact that, in the opinion of the Tribunal the employee was dismissed (or is taken to have been dismissed) in circumstances of redundancy other than those prescribed in paragraphs (b) to (e) of this subsection.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his senior officials are well aware that at this stage this legislation is a lawyers' paradise in regard to interpretation.  It is extremely complex but it is very difficult to envisage the multitude of circumstances surrounding the redundancy of an industrial worker.  With that in mind we have produced a piece of drafting which can be found I suggest, in the Northern Ireland legislation and Northern Ireland and British parliamentary draftsmen are well known for their precise statements of intention. <Col N="100" /> Yet, they decide in regard to statutes that it is rather unwise to try to envisage every particular circumstance likely to qualify under the definition of redundancy.  Accordingly, we have suggested that broad latitude should be given to the tribunal in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are designed to provide that power should be given to the Redundancy Appeal Tribunal or the Minister to extend the definition of redundancy provided in the Act.  This is not a power that any Minister would like to have and I do not think it is good legislation.  Redundancy is pretty widely defined here now and should cover all possible cases envisaged in the original legislation but if a case similar to the Limerick case should arise I should prefer to come to the House by way of amendment rather than give these powers to the tribunal or the Minister.  I am opposed to the idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister agrees that it is possible to define the overall general circumstances relating to redundancy?  I have been assured by members of the tribunal on both the employer and worker sides that it is beyond human ingenuity to define the multitude of circumstances which may affect any employment.  That is why we propose this amendment&mdash;to avoid a number of amendments coming before the House again&mdash;by suggesting that the tribunal or the Minister under section 5 of the principal Act may apply regulations giving particular definitions.  I am as reluctant as anybody to give regulatory statutory power to any Minister but I see that a case can be made that amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are worthy of the Minister's consideration.</P>

      <P>A couple of months ago a charge hand carpenter came to see me.  He had been given notice of dismissal and had asked for his redundancy money as he said the Act applied to him.  He received what I regard as an extremely &ldquo;snotty&rdquo; reply: &ldquo;You were not discharged because of redundancy.&rdquo;  I do not think <Col N="101" /> he would have any difficulty in establishing that he was, because a number of others were discharged at the same time and if that is not redundancy I do not know what it is.  He told me that the owner of the business was, he thought, a decent man but a &ldquo;whizz kid&rdquo; had come into the business and was making his mark on the place. There is no use in pretending that this kind of thing cannot happen.  Although I have no doubt this man would win his case before the tribunal, he was first of all given no reply; he was told he was not discharged because of redundancy and when he filled in the appropriate form, they sent it back to him.  I do not know if the Minister is as innocent as he pretends to be on occasions.  In fact, I have begun to have grave doubts about it.

      <P>I do not think this confers any special benefit on anybody, except that it puts at the disposal of the Minister a means by which, if certain situations arose, he could have the tribunal define &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo;.  The definition of &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo; in the Bill is pretty wide and in cases of doubt the tribunal is there to see if any of the many situations outlined would apply to a particular case.  I think this meets it generally and I do not think it is necessary to take such wide regulating statutory powers in this particular case.  I would rather not have them.</P>

      <Col N="102" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to consider the overall relevance of section 3 and how this Bill will affect employment at this point in time.  It is important not merely to pass legislation but to see how it is going to affect industrial workers.  It is significant that notifications of redundancy to the Department of Labour have riser sharply in 1971.  Notifications in 1970 totalled 3,896, an increase of some 200 over 1969.  In the first eight weeks of 1971, 1,149 redundancies were notified to the Department, three-quarters of which were men.  This was exactly double the weekly rate for 1970.  These notifications of redundancy relate specifically to workers with over four years service&mdash;workers with less than four years service who are declared redundant are not included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is relevant to point out on section 3, which is amending section 7 of the principal Act, that the unemployment rate among insured persons last year averaged 7.2 per cent, which was double the British rate.  It is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in the rate in 1971.  It might be asked how then will this Bill apply during the remainder of this year?  I would suggest it is going to apply in a number of directions and we might as well be prepared for them.  Firstly, it is going to apply in relation to the continuing rationalisation in industry which went on quite considerably in 1970.  Secondly, there will be an increase in unemployment arising from tariff reductions.  This is already evident in relation to the footwear industry and I have no doubt that this Bill will have a continuing application to employees engaged in that particular industry.  Thirdly, the recession abroad in major industrial sectors, such as the heavy textile sector and the general electronic component sector, cannot be discounted.  This major recession has already had an impact on this country. Added to these three factors must be the major question of cost inflation. The relative cost competitiveness of certain exports will most certainly have an impact.  I am not being a Jeremiah now; I am speaking of the effects on <Col N="103" /> Irish industry today.  We may also have redundancies through bad management&mdash;the Hibernian group is a classic example.  These various factors mean that the rate of redundancy will continue at a substantial figure during 1971.</P>
    <P>At this point in our economic history we need a much faster rate of general economic growth to offset these factors and to ensure that employment is maintained.  If this can be done I think it will be one of the major achievements of the 'Seventies.  The present situation has not arisen solely because of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement: it is a combination of factors of management rationalisation, the effect of tariff reductions and of recession abroad, particularly in the electronics and engineering side in America.  All these factors have combined to hit many of the 800,000 insured workers at the moment.  We on this side of the House are very concerned about the impact of these factors.</P>

    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>Before section 4 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.  The following subsections are hereby inserted in section 4 of the Principal Act and shall be deemed to have been enacted in that Act:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(2A) If an employee was or is in continuous employment on or subsequent to 1st January, 1968 and his normal weekly hours of work in the period of 208 weeks ending on 1st January, 1968 were not less than 21 hours, but were reduced below 21 by reason of redundancy, or in periods of redundancy, that employee shall be deemed to have been employed for at least 21 hours per week on 1st January, 1968.</P>
      <P>(2B)  Payments (if any) to employees affected by subsection (2A) by reason of redundancy before the commencement of this Act shall be made from the Redundancy Fund&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="104" /> The Minister is already familiar with section 7 which has resulted in the introduction of a new word in connection with redundancy, a word coined by the redundancy tribunal, namely, &ldquo;creeping&rdquo; redundancy.  One can have a situation in which workers can have their hours systematically reduced below 21 hours per week and the employer in that case can effectively reduce the workers' qualification for redundancy.  The Minister is familiar with the decision of the tribunal in the case of Noonan v. Dwyer, page 384.  In that case the employee's appeal failed because of what one might describe as &ldquo;creeping&rdquo; redundancy. He had less than 21 hours and he could not, therefore, qualify.  I make no particular allegation against the particular employer.  I merely state the decision of the tribunal.  There was a systematic reduction in the hours of work below 21 hours and the employee, therefore, did not qualify. There was another case, Deasy v. the B &amp; I, 240 of 1970.</P>
    <P>The Bill was introduced in May, 1967.  Under section 4, workers could have a &ldquo;creeping&rdquo; redundancy imposed on them and could suddenly find themselves out on a limb.  This amendment clarifies the section, which is rather silent in regard to this particular type of case.  The present situation is not cricket; the worker should not lose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to bring within the scope of the scheme persons not covered by the 1967 Act.  It was never intended that persons who would normally expect to work for the requisite number of hours for the same employer should be covered by the Act.  This is a rather clever amendment but I could not accept an amendment at this stage applicable to cases prior to 1968.  There are cases in which people did not qualify for straightforward redundancy since that time.  Despite the subtle case made by the Deputy, I could not accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

      <P>This type of redundancy could have a particular application to dockers, for example, in whose employment there would be an element <Col N="105" /> of casual employment.  It could apply to them with a good deal of force.  I am not sure that we can accept the Minister's statement that this goes back to the 1968 period.  It is conceivable that this could happen following the passage of this Bill.  That is why we urge the Minister to consider this amendment.</P>

      <P>This does not arise on the amendment, but I mentioned to the Minister privately the case of workers who work less than 21 hours, who work for, perhaps, 18 hours.  The number of hours might be lowered. Office cleaners and women workers in some factories could never claim from a redundancy fund and they would be wasting money by contributing to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may have a point about dockers.  Some of them may manage quite well.  There are others who do not.  However, there are other categories of workers who have suffered quite severely as a result of this 21-hours requirement.  Office cleaners are hit by this provision.  This kind of work is usually done, though not invariably, by young widows with families.  They come in at an early hour in the morning before the office staff comes to work and they very often return again in the evening.  A number of agencies employ women and send them out to clean firms and offices.  If their average week is 24 hours that could very easily be reduced to 20 hours in order to exclude them from the provisions of this Bill. There are quite a number of workers who are forced at certain periods to go <Col N="106" /> on short time and they might find that at a particular time they were not working a full week and were, in fact, not punching in the 21 hours.  These people are being excluded by the Bill. I have only cited one case in relation to women office cleaners.  I am sure there are a number of other cases of people in this category.</P>

      <P>The only reason I <Col N="107" /> did not mention 18 hours instead of 21 hours was that I did not think of the case of the women cleaners mentioned by Deputy Cluskey where people could be paying in and they might not collect at all.  The reason I did not put down an amendment to reduce the hours from 21 to 18 was that women cleaners would pay in and not get their money back.  A business might employ 50 cleaners to do five hours a day and they might reduce the hours to three per day, and the workers would be forced into a position in which they could not contribute towards redundancy payments.  The Minister's Department might make money out of this.</P>

The Minister obviously came into the House this afternoon with orders.  I get the impression that he was told that under no circumstances was he to give anything. Although this is not the Government's money&mdash;I should like to emphasise that it is the money of the employees and the employer&mdash;Fianna Fáil do not care about the workers.</P>

      <P>And even though it is <Col N="108" /> not coming out of the Exchequer and the fund is at present in a very healthy condition financially, the only conclusion I can come to is that the Minister and the Cabinet foresee such large-scale redundancies that they are afraid to give anything, no matter how small, because they foresee in the near future that the fund will be very rapidly eroded.  If I am wrong about this, will the Minister give us some concrete reason why he is refusing to concede anything?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is wrong.  These amendments, which are trivial in a sense, could be rather controversial and certainly unfair to others in so far as they are retrospective in relation to a particular section.  It is wrong to say that I came into the House in any Molotov mood.  I immediately conceded to have a redrafting of the first section in relation to the first amendment which was very important and more fundamental than all the others.  I do not think that the amendment here is necessary to take in a few people prior to 1968 which some Deputy may have in mind, and the type of category to which it refers is well covered since then.  Their case has been strengthened in this Bill. When the Deputy talks about excess redundancies I hope he will keep in mind the overall generosity of this Bill which virtually doubles the benefits available to redundancy cases in so far as it shortens the period to two years.  That in itself is tremendous.</P>

      <P>I move.</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann records its grave concern at the continuing increase in the price of building land and the consequent cost of houses to private house purchasers and local authority tenants and calls on the Government, if necessary by taking steps to amend the Constitution, to designate now the land required for house building and bring it under community control at prices determined by its previous use.</P>
      <P>We in the Labour Party have been urging the Government to put an end to land speculation.  It has gone on, unheeded by the present Government, for far too long and I do not think this anti-social behaviour of land speculation is in the interests of the country or the community. The Constitution never intended that one section of the people should be permitted to exploit another section but speculators are permitted to exploit young married couples and other people with families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, I heard the Minister for Local Government speak about the wonderful progress in house construction throughout the country.  He quoted figures to support that claim. However, I am aware that there are literally thousands of people in Dublin alone who are living in subnormal, substandard accommodation, that families are separated and that as many <Col N="111" /> as 15 people are living in two-bedroomed houses.  Deputies on all sides know that thousands of people cannot find accommodation.  They are people who would make every effort to provide their own home if houses could be bought at realistic prices.  They are responsible people anxious to provide homes for their families but they are being deprived of that opportunity by this society, because land speculators are exploiting them by raising the price of building land to such an extent that it is impossible for people who need houses to provide the deposits required.</P>
    <P>If anybody cares to look at the property sections of the national newspapers he will see that for new houses in County Dublin and extending as far as County Kildare a person is required to have a minimum deposit of £1,500.  I am not exaggerating when I say that.  How could a young married man with a wife and one or two children be expected to provide a minimum deposit of £1,500 when he is being taxed to the present extent by the Government?  It is utterly impossible. If it were possible I would be able to advise the many constituents who come to me each week seeking any way in which they could provide deposits for houses.  They ask me if I can tell them of any way in which they can raise these deposits and I have to confess that I cannot.</P>
    <P>Those people are unable to provide these high deposits.  No man with a young family could do it on present income levels.  If the Minister for Local Government thinks he has a remedy I shall be glad to direct all those constituents of mine to the Department. When the previous Minister, Deputy Blaney, was in charge of the Department I badgered him every day in the Dáil about this problem and I told the people who came to me to write directly to the Minister, but it did not make any difference.</P>
    <P>Those people who exploit so many young families are not paying taxes. They are parasites and I do not think any Deputy would disagree with me when I say that such parasites should be penalised at all costs.  Article 43 of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" />  1.  The State acknowledges that man, in virtue of his rational being, has the natural right, antecedent to positive law, to the private ownership of external goods.</P>
    <P>2.  The State accordingly guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish the right of private ownership or the general right to transfer, bequeath, and inherit property. </P>
    <P> 2.1 The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regarded by the principles of social justice.</P>
    <P>2.2.  The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good. </P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government has said that the Government have been trying over many years to consider how they could acquire land or make it simple for authorities to acquire land without conflicting in any way with the Constitution.  I understand that the Minister has set up a commission to inquire into this.  I think it is called the Kenny Commission.  The main thing is that the Government feel that it would not be possible for them to do this. They feel that any attempt by the State to take over land for building purposes would be unconstitutional.  What I say and what we in the Labour Party say is that the use of land for social purposes should be subject to community control.  The present system of dealing in building land leads to speculation and exorbitant profits.  We say that society is frequently held up to ransom by being forced to pay greatly inflated prices for building land and the cost of securing such land has seriously limited the ability of local authorities to secure adequate pools of land to meet their requirements.</P>
    <P>Local authorities service land fully and speculators take advantage of this fact by raising the price of land and making it impossible for houses to be built at economic prices.  The Minister has said that the site accounts for roughly 20 per cent of the total cost of a house.  The Minister has said he <Col N="113" /> is anxious to bring about a situation in which builders and persons seeking building land will go to the local authorities for sites.  The Minister admits that there is land speculation and he says he is anxious to call a halt to it.  He says it has been going on in recent years.  We in the Labour Party know it has gone on unhindered despite our protests, despite the fact that we brought it to the attention of the Government over the years.  Each and every Minister for Local Government has allowed it to continue and I am saying in the House that friends of the Government, members of the party, have been involved in this land speculation. They have cashed in on it, these parasites that attach themselves to the Fianna Fáil Party.  Knowing the inside information, they have acquired this land and are now the millionaires of our country.  These are the people we have now in our midst.  These are the upper classes, the <i>nouveau riche,</i> who have availed of this and have exploited to the fullest the people who are most in need.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for Local Government how soon will this Kenny Committee report on this and how can we acquire land within the framework of the Constitution so that land can be made available to people and to builders at economic prices.  It is wrong that land speculators should be provided with facilities by the local authority, have fully serviced land available to them and sell this at exorbitant prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech on the Supplementary Estimate for Local Government said that there are other factors involved, but the main factor involved is the cost of the site.  The Minister said that local authorities have been given permission to acquire land but they are acquiring land at competitive prices, land which has been serviced by them, and they are acquiring it at full market value.  It is wrong and it is morally unjust that they must acquire land which has been serviced by them from these speculators.</P>
    <P>We hear again and again the boasts of the present Government that they are building more houses than ever before.  They say that 14,000 houses were built last year.  I do not doubt <Col N="114" /> that, but 20,000 houses and more were needed last year and if we take into account the number of substandard dwellings in Dublin city alone we would need at least 80,000 houses. This is a phenomenal figure but it is the exact situation.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Dr. O'Donovan, mentioned to me Hollyfield Buildings. I do not know whether the Minister for Local Government or his secretary were ever in Hollyfield Buildings.  It would be a revelation for anyone to go into Hollyfield Buildings and see people existing in 1971 in such circumstances. They have no toilets except communal toilets.  People are living in hovels, in substandard dwellings that should have been demolished 20 years ago.  I have visited every single flat in Hollyfield Buildings and I can tell you what the conditions are like there.  These flats have no proper locks on the doors. They are owned by Dublin Corporation. One particular flat has no electricity supply.  A man and his mother live there.  There never was electricity connected to this place.  They are living in primitive conditions.  I brought this to the attention of the Minister for Local Government and pleaded with him quite recently in a letter to make representations to Dublin Corporation to have electricity connected to this flat.</P>

      <P>I am only referring to the fact that there are so many houses and flats in Dublin which are substandard.  Despite the fact that the Government say they have built so many houses last year, I say that the record is far from being up to standard in so far as 80,000 houses would have to be provided to cater for people who are living in substandard dwellings. At the rate you are permitting houses to increase in price there is no hope of accommodating these people. The rents for these Corporation tenants are exorbitant due to the fact that the houses are costing so much. The Minister for Local Government last session speaking on a motion tabled by us, when we said that the rents charged for local authority houses were exorbitant, said it was due to the fact that houses were costing so much. <Col N="116" /> I say the houses are costing so much because the land is costing so much and the only answer to it is that, if the Constitution makes it difficult or impossible for land to be brought under public control, we should change the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I know Article 43.  What is the Deputy's alternative suggestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible without changing the Constitution to make land available.  Article 43 2º states:</P>
      <P>The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
      <P>It is possible to take over land where it is in the public interest to do so and to prevent exploitation by speculators. I do not think anyone has the right to demand colossal prices for land simply because it is required for buildings to accommodate people.  It is wrong that speculators should cash in on this need.  If a Constitution permits exploitation of the people by any section that Constitution is wrong.  If it is necessary to amend the Constitution so that land may be acquired for the provision of houses at reasonable cost the necessary amendments should be made to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government referred to the Kenny Committee and he said that the Government are concerned about the increasing prices.  I am wondering when this committee will make its recommendations.  It should be possible to acquire land without violating the Constitution and, at the same time, ensure that the common good is served.  The Minister mentioned that so many sites are available but he did not state in his reply on the Supplementary Estimate the prices at which the sites were supplied.  We should have been given this information. <Col N="117" /> The price of the site accounts for 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the cost of the house and in many cases the cost of the site is at least £2,000.  If a site costs £2,000 we are paying £12,000 or more per acre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has moved from 20 per cent to 30 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned 20 per cent to 30 per cent.  We are finding that sites are costing £2,000; they are being offered in the newspapers, as I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it depends on where the sites are offered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>They are around Dublin and as far as Leixlip in Kildare. When one considers that there are from six to eight houses per acre one realises what a colossal price is being paid for land when it is designated for building purposes.  The Minister is aware that exploitation is taking place and I do not think he has any alternative but to accept our motion which calls for the acquisition of land for building purposes.</P>

      <P>The motion we are discussing states:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann records its grave concern at the continuing increase in the price of building land and the consequent cost of houses to private house purchasers and local authority tenants and calls on the Government, if necessary by taking steps to amend the Constitution, to designate now the land required for house building and bring it under community control at prices determined by its previous use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the sentiments of this motion and the necessity for it.  I do not know what the proposers of the motion had in mind when they referred to &ldquo;community control&rdquo;.  I would be 100 per cent in agreement <Col N="118" /> with this motion if it stated &ldquo;Government control&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;community control&rdquo;.  I consider the Government would be in a position to bring the land required for house building under control at prices determined by its previous use.</P>
    <P>In any form of business transaction a fair and reasonable profit must be allowed.  Without allowing a certain amount of profit, initiative would be stifled and people would not be prepared to accelerate their efforts in particular directions.  It is essential that builders be prepared to take over building sites and erect houses.  It is essential that, with proper control, these people should be allowed to purchase land and erect buildings and they should be allowed a fair and reasonable profit.  However, speculators have, through prior knowledge and information, been in a position to purchase land which they develop and eventually obtain enormous profit in the sale of sites.  People have been able to make vast profits without any effort on their part.  This practice is wrong for the people who engage in it and it is wrong for the Government which tolerates it. The speculators are able to prevent married couples from purchasing sites on which they could build their homes. They are in a position to withhold land so that local authorities are unable to acquire it and develop housing schemes.</P>
    <P>This practice is occurring daily in this country.  Speculators are buying up land on all sides of this city and in the larger centres throughout the country. They sell the land at enormous prices to local authorities and to individuals throughout the country. Deputy O'Connell mentioned figures in the region of £2,000.  It is a very common occurrence to see sites offered for sale at figures ranging from £1,000 to £2,000.  It is often around £1,500 that couples must pay for sites on which to build their own houses.  Anybody will realise how difficult it is for young married couples to obtain such an amount of money to purchase a site. Unless they can do that they must coop themselves up in small flats at exorbitant rents in Dublin and some towns throughout the country.  Their life is one of misery and dreariness in which <Col N="119" /> love and the proper relationship that should exist between young couples are stifled.  This is all due to the fact that building land is being held by small groups of people throughout the country.  This is wrong and should not be allowed to continue.  Local authorities should purchase pools of land for building.  They are moving in this direction but far too slowly.  They should have this land available not only for local authority development but also so that they can sell it to private individuals who wish to purchase it.</P>

      <P>I am coming to that, too.  This is a move in the right direction but the pace could be accelerated. A circular was sent out recently by the Minister for Local Government in regard to ribbon development.  It has been difficult to get planning permission and this is a further restriction on people who wish to build their own houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, and if you will bear with me while I develop my point you will recognise its relevance. The Government are curtailing ribbon development at the present time.  It had been difficult enough to obtain planning permission but I know a number of people who purchased sites that were available on main roads and who were refused planning permission.  Because of this there are fewer building sites available.  People in the larger towns, and certainly in Dublin, who had obtained planning permission are able to sell those sites at a much greater profit now than heretofore.  This decision will increase the price of sites because it will reduce the number of sites available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

      <P>There are many thousands of acres of suitable land available along these roads.  These sites are now more valuable and builders who got planning permission for such sites can sell them at higher prices than prevailed heretofore.  Another problem at the present time is that people who wish to purchase sites and who must obtain an overdraft find they must pay the highest bank rate in Europe.  This is a national scandal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that if a married couple are lucky enough to be able to get land they are saddled with a bank interest rate of 9½ per cent.  The Parliamentary Secretary and the Government should have serious consultations with the directors of the banks throughout the country in an effort to have this national scandal erased.  The bank rate has been reduced in Britain.  It has been reduced in Germany and throughout Europe. Our present rate must be the highest in Europe.  If this state of affairs is allowed to continue, people will not be able to borrow money from the banks.</P>

Therefore, the rate of interest on such moneys is linked with the cost of land for building purposes.  For the past couple of years, the bank directors have had things all their own way and, unless they have the Government in the palms of their hands, the Government should <Col N="121" /> consult with them now so that the interest rate would be reduced.</P>

      <P>The motion refers also to the subsequent cost of houses to private house purchasers and local authority tenants.

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  The building societies should be asked to release more money for young couples wishing to purchase their own sites and to build their own houses.  During the by-election campaign in the Dublin South West constituency, I visited many houses in that area and I received many requests from people for help in obtaining suitable accommodation. I was appalled to find that in many cases there were two, three or four sets of families living in two or three-roomed houses.  In many cases, there were as many as 20 people living in one such house.  I was asked in several instances to get in touch with the Dublin Housing Authority to see if accommodation would be provided.  In all honesty, I must support this motion tonight.  The problem of the cost of building land is not confined to Dublin; it is common throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some weeks ago, when speaking here on another housing motion, I mentioned those people who were living in caravans at Newlands Cross.  I saw these caravans on the roadside on a <Col N="122" /> Tuesday as I was coming to town but, by the time I was going home on the Friday, most of them had been removed. At the time, I wondered whether the Minister for Local Government had waved a magic wand and provided houses for all these people but I read in the newspapers the following day that this had not been so but, rather, that the Minister had succeeded in providing them with a new site elsewhere.  They are now out of vision of people travelling that road to and from town.  Neither is this an isolated incident because there are people living throughout the country in conditions that closely resemble conditions of animals, conditions that might be described as being prehistoric.</P>
    <P>There are many married couples who, because they have no families, cannot be provided with housing and, because they are living on an average weekly wage, they are unable to save enough money to provide themselves with a site on which to build their own house.  Many such couples are to be found living in hovels and tenements in conditions that are appalling.  Each of us passes through this world only once and if there are some who must live under such awful conditions as I have mentioned, those who are in a position to improve the lot of such people but who do not do so fail in their duty.  The Department of Local Government must take immediate action to remedy this situation.  I might add here that the Forcible Entry Bill is no answer to the problem.  So long as the present situation is allowed to continue, there will be people who will make every effort to focus attention on the plight of those who do not have the comfort of a home.  Everything possible should be done so as to provide sites for people who wish to build their own homes.  Everyone who passes through this Dáil will have failed in his duty as will have everybody in the Department of Local Government who is concerned with land for building houses if he does not do everything in his power to remedy the present situation.</P>
    <P>There is reference here to price being determined by the previous use <Col N="123" /> to which the land was put.  In this connection, while I would agree with a reasonable profit for those builders who develop the lands, I would suggest that a committee be set up by the Minister for Local Government to ensure that while people who had purchased land and were developing it would be allowed a reasonable profit the making of exorbitant profits must be stamped out because so long as this is allowed to continue the poorer people and those who are unable to defend themselves will not be able to provide themselves with homes.  In saying this, I support fully this motion.  I believe this motion will not be like any other that is put down, discussed and then forgotten.  The Parliamentary Secretary and his advisers are dedicated men who are discharging their duties and I hope that they will consider fully everything that can be done to ensure that cheaper sites will be provided for building throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As the two previous speakers have said, this is a very important motion.  It is important for many reasons one of the main reasons being that if something is not done in the near future to solve this problem then the building of houses, not alone in Dublin city and in the larger towns but in the country areas, will almost certainly grind to a stop.  We have been complaining, and rightly so, about high interest rates and the fact that the cost of building sites in rural Ireland now averages somewhere between £600 and £1,000 for a relatively small site in rural areas, up to and over £1,000 in the villages, and between £1,000 and £1,500 in the sizeable towns, is evidence enough that the matter has become extremely serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the way inflation is developing at present this is only another round of the prices because it would appear that within 12 months time there may be another 12½ per cent increase added on to these prices.  I know of sites which were available a few years ago at £400 and which are now fetching £1,000.  I am sure everybody in the House will be aware of similar examples in his own area.  From time <Col N="124" /> to time we have had complaints about the excessive cost of house building and in my opinion these complaints were right in many cases.  Every time there is an increase in the wages of buildings workers we have a song and a dance about how this is going to put up the cost of houses and usually we find that those who employ them take as much extra for themselves as they do for the increase in workers' wages.  This seems to have become an accepted thing.  Add to that this new racket of charging an excessive amount for sites and we have an almost impossible position.</P>
    <P>For a number of years many local authorities decided that they would build houses for people who were eligible for rehousing on condition that those people would have sites made available for them.  To show how ridiculous the whole thing is, if the owner or the vested tenant of a council cottage has a site which he wants to give to somebody who requires rehousing, the local authority will give him £25 for it but if his neighbour, a farmer, has a similar site he will not blush at all when he asks £700 or £800 for that site which may not be as good. What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.  I see no reason why people should get rich at the expense of the poor.  Some people may not like to be described as being in the poorer classes but somebody who needs a house and is unable to provide one himself cannot consider himself terribly rich. These are the people we are talking about.  Unfortunately local authorities have reached the stage where they can say to somebody who needs rehousing &ldquo;If you get a site we will build a house for you&rdquo; and if that person cannot get a site then for two reasons the house will not be built. The first is that they are unable to build it because there is no building land on the market in the area and the second is that the price which people who own the land ask for the site is so much that the local authority will not pay it.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was quite correct when he said that some local authorities are making provision for this matter by trying to acquire <Col N="125" /> land for building but if they acquire land in one area in a county then they feel they are doing all that is required and they seem to forget that right over the county a similar situation can exist and no land is being acquired.  If we ask why no effort is being made we are told &ldquo;Oh, the necessary money is not available&rdquo; and then we come right back to the price of sites.  Anybody who thinks that sites are being sold at a reasonable price anywhere in Ireland at present just does not know the facts.</P>
    <P>During the last general election much play was made, particularly by the Fianna Fáil Party, about an item in the Labour Party's programme which suggested exactly what this motion is suggesting.  I bet that nobody in Fianna Fáil will stand up tonight and say, &ldquo;Oh, the Labour Party are proposing that the land of the farmers should be taken from them.&rdquo; This is the sort of dishonest thinking, the dishonest approach to sites for houses which has been used by the Government for so long.  They must be prepared to face the truth of this because a lot of the responsibility for what has happened lies on their shoulders.  They have been long enough in Government to have done something about this.  The mere fact that they went around the country accusing their political opponents of attempting to take over farmers' land because they suggested that building land should be taken over where required showed that they had not got an interest or did not understand.  The big trouble about it is that having said that, they will find it extremely difficult now to come back and say, &ldquo;Well, that is our policy also.&rdquo;  I would admit that in this matter Fianna Fáil are in a rather difficult position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is not talking about what I am talking about, that each local authority should have the onus on them to acquire the necessary land for the development of houses in their particular area, whether they are an urban council, a county council, town commissioners or what have you.  The second point is that when there is land in an area which would be useful and which may be acquired at some future date, then even without taking it over the onus should be on the local authority to earmark that land as building land and to say that they are going to acquire it, just as the Land Commission can do.  If the Parliamentary Secretary can tell me that that stage has been reached and can produce concrete evidence that that is being done by the local authorities then there is no merit in this motion.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;must make up their minds that this sort of thing has got to be done.  What are they doing around this city?  Is it not true that they have allowed speculators to take over land earmarked by the Corporation of Dublin when the members were here, and build on it and have not carried out the regulations which were made in regard to the building of houses?  Is it not true that in every town the local spiv builder is going around buying this and that bit of land, <Col N="127" /> something which the local authorities could do but will not do.  When the need arises and people want houses, the houses are built at the builder's price and he adds on perhaps five times what he gave for the original sites when he purchased them.</P>
      <P>This is too serious to be glossed over by saying that everything is grand and that we are now doing that and therefore there is no need for anybody to suggest a motion.  If there was no need why should the Minister for Local Government brag a couple of weeks ago about his Kenny Commission investigating this very matter? What have they done since?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to believe it because I have listened to people in the front benches of that Government again and again say &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;. We are told it means &ldquo;some time soon&rdquo; and when you ask what that means you are told it means &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;. The present Minister who is now coming in has, I think, indulged in that sort of play-acting as well as his predecessor. &ldquo;Shortly&rdquo; was made a byword here by a former Minister for Local Government.  He is not a Minister or a Member now but he makes statements occasionally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is here to listen to it being said that we are <Col N="128" /> reaching a stage when the price of sites will be so high that private house-building will cease completely unless something is done to control site prices. If in the past three or four years the price of sites has increased 200 or 300 per cent we can expect the same thing in the next two or three years unless definite Government action is taken to prevent it.  All over Ireland we find that when a water and sewerage scheme is put into an area, land which was agricultural land worth £100 or £200 an acre, overnight becomes worth £2,000, £3,000 and in some cases £4,000 an acre as building land.  Only those able to pay fancy prices can purchase such land to build a house.  If we must add on the substantial price that must now be paid for a building site to the cost of building a house and the present rate of interest we find it is nearly impossible for the ordinary working man, no matter what his wage is, to cope with repayment of loans he may get to build a house.</P>
    <P>I encourage, and I am sure the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary would also encourage, people who reach the stage when they feel they can build their own house, to take the necessary steps but it is very disheartening when some of these people, having looked for a site, come back and say: &ldquo;We cannot even afford the site.&rdquo; There was a time, not too long ago, when the local government grant would more than pay for a site; it can now scarcely cover the deposit on a site. The Parliamentary Secretary smiles but I am sure he knows that this is exactly the situation and there is no point in trying to gloss over this by saying that people are building houses.  People are building houses but I say the situation is being reached in which they will very soon be unable to continue to build houses because they will be unable to pay for them.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, can acquire land compulsorily but the legislation is far too cumbersome.  This legislation was designed for the purpose of getting specific cases dealt with and purchasing land for single or group schemes of local authorities but in very few cases has any consideration been given to acquiring land, as the Minister's predecessor <Col N="129" /> said, in advance of need.  That was written into legislation and I should like to know from the Minister, if he speaks in this debate, how many times this legislation has been found workable and how many times have local authorities made provision in advance of need, to acquire a substantial amount of land.</P>
    <P>I live in a village where some land was available some years ago.  Most of it was bought and houses were built on it.  A field which was left was bought at a much higher price later and houses were built on it.  We are now at the stage where we have a demand from people who would like to have houses and the local authority would like to house them.  We have the necessary services but we cannot get land.  If we can persuade somebody locally to sell land to the local authority the price which would be charged is so high that it would be impossible for the tenants to pay the outgoings on the houses when erected.  For this reason necessary housing is held up and in an area scheduled to have 400 houses we stopped short at 100 and there is nothing anybody can do about it so long as the legislation stands as it is at present.</P>
    <P>I am well aware the problem is a big one but unless it is approached in the proper way and unless steps are taken and followed through by the Minister &mdash;not as previously happened with legislation which looked well on paper but did not do what was expected of it when tested&mdash;with legislation which will have teeth enough to ensure that it will carry out the intentions of this House, we shall not have the houses we require.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker referred to the circular about ribbon building particularly along arterial roads, holding up housing.  It holds up housing in this way&mdash;and I found this is true of planning generally&mdash;that if ten sites are available in an area and five of them are rejected for planning permission as one can understand the other five become twice as valuable.  This is one of the biggest snags I find in rural areas. When planning permission is refused for certain sites the remaining sites go up in value and eventually if it comes to the point that only one site is available, <Col N="130" /> everybody wants that site, and therefore the owner can ask a fantastic price for it.  I recently saw one-third of an acre in a rural area being sold for £1,500.  Water was available but there was no sewerage except a septic tank.  If one adds £1,500 for land to the price of building a house one realises the situation an ordinary person wanting to build a house finds himself in.  If a local authority want to build a house, particularly an isolated house, the first thing they ask the person wanting the house is to make a site available to them.  A site cannot be made available if the land is too dear because the council will not pay a fancy price for it in the first place and, secondly, the house will not be built if, as happens in very many cases, no land is offered.  There are still people snobbish enough to think that a county council cottage on their land will lower the tone of the area which will mean they will get a smaller price for the remainder of it when they come to sell it.</P>
    <P>During the last general election the Minister's party made big play of the suggestion in the Labour Party policy seeking to do what the motion asks. We suggested that local authorities should have the right to designate and buy building land from landowners. The Minister's party gave the impression that the Labour Party were saying that all land should be taken over from the farmers.  I am sure that many of the fellows who were saying this down the country simply did not know they were telling lies but the people who told them to say it knew they were telling lies.</P>
    <P>I would suggest the Government have no option but to accept this motion; and they will, in effect, be accepting that what they said during the last general election was wrong. One often comes across people in the country, generally well-housed themselves, who say that there is no housing problem in rural Ireland.  I am afraid it is like the dole&mdash;it is as big a problem in rural Ireland as it is in the cities and the Department of Local Government have got to face up to it.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister <Col N="131" /> gave his blessing to it, but I recently saw a suggestion about the lengthening of the period for loans.  Those of us who know what it means know that the amount finally paid in interest does not matter: what does matter is whether or not the weekly outgoings can be met.  Even if it means increasing it to 100 years, it is far preferable to what is happening at the present time.</P>
    <P>However, that has nothing to do with this motion, which suggests that the Government should give authority to local authorities to acquire necessary building land which is at the price appropriate to its former usage.  It is ridiculous to find the price of agricultural land going up from £200 an acre to £2,000 an acre.  Just because a pipe is run down the road and water is put on the site the land is classed as building land.  I seriously suggest the Government should do something about this.  If they do not like the wording of the motion they can reword it themselves. As far as we are concerned we do not mind how it is done so long as it eases the situation which exists in the country at the present time.  The city is bad enough, the country towns are bad enough but when one finds it is almost impossible to get a site at a reasonable price in rural Ireland the time has come for the Government to do something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not receive much notice that this motion was being taken this evening.  I have dwelt on this matter at length on numerous occasions already, but as the motion is before the House it gives me another opportunity of dealing with it.  However, I should have liked more notice of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposers of the motion should recognise that I accept that the price of houses on the open market today is increasing at a rate which is causing me some concern.  It must be recognised that, although land prices are most often mentioned as the factor which contributes in a big way towards the increasing cost of houses, the cost of land is not the only factor.  There are numerous factors which I have <Col N="132" /> dealt with in the House not so long ago.  Even if we were able to control the price of building land, either by legislation or by some other measure, we would not find ourselves in the position where house prices were not increasing, although I admit it would make a substantial contribution.</P>
    <P>I have made my attitude clear on so many occasions that I am surprised I am asked to speak on it again.  Since I have become Minister I have undertaken a detailed study of this problem. I have gone into every aspect of house prices and the land factor as an element in the cost of houses.  I have explored every avenue in an effort to find solutions.  The personal experience I had as a Deputy before becoming Minister has helped.  I have put the full resources of the Department of Local Government working on this problem and, after many months of study, with great consideration given to it, at top level, we did not come up with an effective solution to it.  It was in that situation that I decided to seek the advice of others outside the Department so that the Government and I would be finally advised as to whether there was any way of doing this under the present Constitution.</P>
    <P>In a last ditch effort to find some practical solution and to find some measure of control over land prices, I established the Kenny Committee.  I am grateful to Mr. Justice Kenny for accepting the onerous task of chairman which he readily did, already having expressed a keen interest in the problem, and I am grateful to the other members of the Committee.  I am quite happy at the pace of their work.  I believe Deputy Cunningham has indicated to the House that the Kenny Committee has already met 14 times in a very short space of time.  My final statement to the Committee before they embarked on this task was that I was very anxious that they should come up with a recommendation as quickly as it was possible for them to do so but I am not going to put a gun to their heads and demand a recommendation or a final report tomorrow, next week or next month. They must be given time to examine the problem fully and to make their suggestions with full knowledge of all <Col N="133" /> the facts.  I am satisfied they are working diligently and I await their findings.</P>
    <P>The idea that all building land should be brought under public control at prices determined by existing use was, of course, suggested to me; it seemed an attractive idea and, on the surface, it might appear the best way of dealing with the problem.  This is Labour Party policy, but there is a wide difference between the Labour Party adopting a policy and my approach to that policy.  I have gone a little deeper into this.  I was not able unfortunately to be here for the full debate and so I did not hear everything that was said, but I have not heard any Deputy come out with any ready solution.</P>
    <P>As I say, I have taken the trouble of considering the proposition in depth from the point of view of the provisions of the Constitution and the legal position with regard to the compulsory acquisition of land and the assessment of compensation for land compulsorily acquired for public purposes. Apart from the legal aspects, I had to consider whether it would be feasible to build up the elaborate administrative and technical machinery which would be needed if a comprehensive system for the control of the supply and the price of building land were decided on.  I had also to consider what a land acquisition programme on a comprehensive scale would cost.  Where the money would come from is a perennial problem.  The resources available are not unlimited and there has to be a judicious distribution of all the moneys available in order to ensure adequate protection of the economy and of the interests of the community as a whole.  Economic expansion will not continue if there is too heavy investment in one sector at the expense of another.  We all know that that kind of financing can create enormous problems with large-scale unemployment.  One is not free to pour huge sums into one sector; one must pay heed to the effect such a withdrawal of moneys from other sectors may have on the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>I considered all these various aspects and I obtained the best legal advice available to me and, having done so, <Col N="134" /> I came to the conclusion that a solution was legally, administratively and financially impracticable.  The Articles in the Constitution which govern the position are Articles 40 and 43.</P>
    <P>Article 40.3.1º states:</P>
    <P>The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.</P>
    <P>Article 43.1.2º states:</P>
    <P>The State accordingly guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish the right of private ownership or the general right to transfer, bequeath, and inherit property.</P>
    <P>The rights thereby guaranteed can, of course, be restricted or delimited with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.  I was advised that, while the exigencies of the common good can require the exercise of powers to acquire land compulsorily from an unwilling owner. Article 43.2.2º could not be interpreted as meaning that the State could assume itself or confer on local authorities the power to confiscate or expropriate land at arbitrarily fixed prices.  This, of course, is in essence what the Labour Party have been asking the Government to do.</P>

I will await the outcome of Justice Kenny's deliberations on this particular problem.  The whole crux of the problem is the question of compensation. Under existing law the basic rule for the assessment of compensation for land compulsorily acquired is that <Col N="135" /> the value of the land is taken as the amount the land might be expected to realise if sold on the open market by a willing seller.  The owner is entitled to expect to get from the acquiring authority the sort of price he would receive if he sold his land freely on the open market.  This may seem a fair principle but, when the supply of serviced land in any area becomes scarce because of population pressures, the price of serviced land rises as a result of the operation of the supply and demand principle and the competition between the various private builders; and the various local authorities acquiring land in those circumstances are forced to follow the market trend and pay compensation accordingly.  If it were possible to empower local authorities to acquire such land at less than the prevailing market value, there would then be a two-tier price system in operation and the man selling in the open market would get one price, the market price, while the man whose land was being acquired compulsorily would get considerably less.  It should be obvious, even to the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think the Labour Party would approve of a discretionary system of that kind.  It would be very difficult to defend it. However, if local authorities were given this power, then it would be equally logical to give it to other authorities; State and semi-State bodies should have the same compulsory powers of acquisition.</P>

      <P>Most of the land acquired by local authorities is acquired by agreement.  After the usual haggling the buying price is finally settled.  Even though there may be a threat of CPO proceedings the vast bulk of the land acquired is acquired by agreement between the purchaser and the seller.  If the compensation for land acquired compulsorily were to be arbitrarily fixed at a low value it is obvious these private deals by local authorities would not be countenanced at all.  The result then would be that local authorities would have to use compulsory powers to acquire all the land required by them and anyone who has knowledge of the compulsory purchase machinery and the delays inherent in it will readily appreciate the problems and difficulties that would arise in that situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on section 12 has taken up a very considerable amount of time and for that reason I shall confine myself to stressing once again what is basically involved. <Col N="137" /> In accordance with the provisions of subsection (1) of this section two global amounts will be shown in the Book of Estimates by way of Grants-in-Aid, one for current expenditure and the other for capital expenditure. Therefore the word &ldquo;amounts&rdquo; must remain in the subsection.</P>
      <P>When I introduced the amendment to subsection (2) I stated that I was doing this because it might be felt that under the original draft the discretion of An tÚdarás would be unduly inhibited. Again let me repeat what is visualised under subsection (2).  There will appear in the Book of Estimates, by way of appendix, for the information of the House, a statement showing how the global sums have been arrived at.  I have already explained why I believe that this should be so. This will take the form of showing the current and capital sums proposed for each institution of higher education. An tÚdarás will be empowered to make payments of these sums in such manner and subject to such conditions as it may think fit.  I am convinced that without this latter power An tÚdarás could not perform one of its main tasks which is to assist in the co-ordination of State investment in higher education.</P>
      <P>As part of the co-ordination process it will be necessary for An tÚdarás to allocate moneys for specific purposes and it must at the same time be given the necessary power to ensure that such moneys are expended for the puposes for which they were provided. There could also be a situation in which moneys would be provided for a specific project within the total sum proposed for any of the institutions.  It might happen that progress in relation to that particular project within the year was such that the expenditure was considerably less than had been expected.  It might happen at the same time that progress on an approved project in some other institution was greater and the expenditure higher than had been anticipated.  In such an event An tÚdarás should have the power to allocate the money not expended on the first project to meet the higher cost of the second project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I see it, the amendments which Deputy FitzGerald has been trying to formulate would reduce the power of <Col N="138" /> An tÚdarás so drastically as to make the suggested amendments wholly unacceptable. Incidentally, in the course of the discussion Deputy FitzGerald stated that he had never heard of a situation in which a breakdown of a Grant-in-Aid would be shown in the Book of Estimates.  I have here a copy of the British Supply Estimates for Education and Science.  From these it can be seen that the current grant for institutions of higher education in Britain is by way of Grant-in-Aid and that the distribution of this Grant-in-Aid as between the various institutions is shown in an appendix to the Estimate. Of course, I have already mentioned this previously.  It is also true that the same applies in some instances to some of our own Estimates.</P>
    <P>Having listened to all the arguments, and we have had a very considerable discussion on this whole matter, I must hold that the section, with my own amendment, should stand as it is set out in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I must apologise to the Minister for being up to one minute late and congratulate him on the promptitude with which he started the debate.  I may have missed something as a result but I have not heard from the Minister anything to refute the points that were made.  It seems to me that he is, on the one hand, saying that An tÚdarás must be given certain power to act flexibly and, on the other hand, he is saying they must be tied down by the Book of Estimates to the amounts allocated to particular bodies.  Either the annotation in the Book of Estimates is binding or it is not.  That is to say, either they are bound to allocate the money in these proportions to these bodies or they are not.  If they are so bound then it is the Minister who is removing their flexibility; if they are not the exercise is both pointless, and, on the face of it, misleading.  I am not clear&mdash;perhaps the Minister could guide me&mdash;as to whether it is intended that these annotations in the Book of Estimates should be binding.  Is that the case?</P>

      <P>I have, in the change I made in subsection (2), given power to An tÚdarás to make certain changes in allocation.  I have gone into certain instances when this would be likely but in relation to the vast bulk of the money there will not be any change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case what would be in the Book of Estimates would be potentially misleading because it would purport to indicate to whom the money is allocated when in fact it could go somewhere else.  I do not think there is any precedent in our Book of Estimates.  The Minister refers to what happened in Britain.  I was talking about this country.  He did say there are instances in this country too, but are there instances in this country of allocations of grants-in-aid? First of all, what are the allocations and, secondly, are there cases where the money is allocated and then can be re-distributed in defiance of the allocation shown in the Book of Estimates? I am not aware of such a precedent but I am always willing to learn from the other side of the House.  Would the Minister like to tell me in what cases money is allocated in a grant-in-aid in the Book of Estimates for a particular purpose but that that can be varied by some outside body?  What precedent have we for that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The ones in relation to this country are grants, simply grants, but what I am concerned with is the fact that in Britain there are Grants-in-Aid&mdash;I do not think the Deputy was referring to this country when he spoke originally&mdash;where the amounts for the individual institutions are made available in an appendix to the Book of Estimates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be clear on this.  The Minister is now saying there is no precedent in this country for the sub-allocation of a Grant-in-Aid. It is only grants that are broken down, not Grants-in-Aid.  Am I right in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I understood the Minister to say and he can produce no example to the contrary. Secondly, is he saying that in Britain there is an annotation in the Book of Estimates allocating money to a particular institution and that this can be re-allocated by some other body subsequently without informing Parliament? Is that the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <P>Despite being in the Book of Estimates?  I have to reflect on the practice of the British Parliament but I think they have departed from proper parliamentary procedure in this and I do not see why we should follow them in that respect if this is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential in our case if An tÚdarás are to carry out their functions in assisting in the co-ordination of State investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister explain how it is essential to assist An tÚdarás to carry out their functions when it appears, on the one hand, that the freedom given to An tÚdarás to allocate their resources is limited and, on the other hand, that we are told to ignore that limitation?  This seems an utterly pointless procedure that cannot lead to any useful results. Can the Minister state in simple language why something is put into the Book of Estimates as an allocation which, in fact, may not be the way in which the money is spent and which potentially may mislead Parliament when the money can be allocated in <Col N="141" /> a different way?  The Minister must have some reason for doing this.  He may defend it as a practice&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard it. Unless I missed it at the beginning, I have not head from the Minister any reason for putting it into the Book of Estimates.  If An tÚdarás are to be free to use the money in accordance with their decisions there can be no purpose in putting into the Book of Estimates an allocation which may mislead the public and Parliament as to how the money will be spent.  Can the Minister give any reason for including it in the Book of Estimates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall speak on this matter again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point is that, while An tÚdarás should have the power to earmark capital expenditure, it is wrong that they should be in a position to bind a college as to the way in which it spends its current funds.  If the university or college finds that during the course of the year the balance of its requirements is somewhat different, it should be free to change the money around marginally to meet that situation.  The idea that it must refer back to An tÚdarás in regard to every minor change appears to be completely wrong, if that is the intention. If it is not the intention, the Minister should make it clear that An tÚdarás are not to have the power to impose conditions with regard to expenditure of current sums, but only capital sums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not heard from the Minister any explanation why he wants An tÚdarás to have this excessive power to lay down conditions on the expenditure of current sums which would infringe completely on the autonomy of a university in a manner without precedent. At the present time when a college or university puts in their claim to the Minister he decides what money to give them, except for the historical anomalies of payments in respect of agriculture and veterinary medicine and a small sum in respect of the <Col N="142" /> Irish language&mdash;which anomalies have arisen because of past arrangements in respect of particular institutions. Apart from these there is no precedent. The global sum which is voted in our universities is available for them to spend in accordance with their requirements. They make a case for the money they require, they get a proportion of this money and they make use of it as they require during the course of the year.  If the university decides to spend the money in a different way from what they expected when they submitted their claim, the university is free to do so.  It is not necessary that they refer back to the Minister for permission to employ a person to teach Italian rather than French when the need arises.  The Minister has not justified such a striking and totally undesirable departure from the present practice which confines the earmarking of grants to capital grants.  If the Minister has reason for making inroads into the autonomy of the universities in this very sensitive area he should inform the House.  In the absence of an adequate explanation we have no alternative but to press the amendment. However, I am willing to hear the Minister on this matter if he is prepared to answer this specific question. There is a danger of Members on this side of the House talking of one thing and the Minister answering on a different point.  I should like to hear the Minister give specific answers to these specific questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might briefly revert to what I said on the previous day.  I mentioned the method by which An tÚdarás would arrive at the amounts for each of the various institutions&mdash;that, having had discussions with the Minister and receiving information from him regarding the amount available, An tÚdarás would go back to the institutions and discuss with them the re-allocation of this money.  I pointed out that they would not have to return to the Minister to have any further discussions but that they would inform the Minister as to the amount that would be made available for each institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke for a considerable time today and I pointed out that there <Col N="143" /> could be&mdash;and it has happened&mdash;instances where certain moneys were provided for a specific project within the total sum allocated to a university or an institute of higher education.  It might happen that the progress in relation to that project within the year was such that expenditure was considerably less than had been expected. At the same time, it could happen that the progress on a project in another institution would be greater and expenditure higher than had been anticipated. In such instances An tÚdarás would have the right, according to my amendment, to allocate the money not expended on the first project to meet the higher cost of the second project. This is one reason I consider they should have the right to transfer moneys.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, so far as the recurring grant is concerned, it is not expected that there will be any significant variation between the amounts which will be published in the appendix and the payments actually made by An tÚdarás to an institution.  It is not true to say that the amounts published in the appendix of the Estimate would mislead the public.  It must be stated that the great bulk of the payment must relate to the everyday expenses of the institution and that any variation between the amount that appears in the appendix for an individual institution and the amount ultimately paid would not be significant in relation to the total payment.  The variation in relation to capital possibly might be more significant since greater or lesser progress in relation to a large capital project might have a substantial effect on expenditure.  However, in relation to current expenditure there would be very little change.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I am convinced that An tÚdarás should be in a position to transfer moneys in this way and also that they should be able to ensure that moneys that have been allocated or earmarked for a specific project should be spent on that project.  It is not true to say that there has not been in the past any earmarking in relation to current expenditure or to current grants.  Such grants already contain elements that are earmarked.  For <Col N="144" /> example, as I said on a number of occasions already&mdash;I do not think I need to keep repeating this because if we do not agree on it we simply do not agree on it&mdash;specific sums are earmarked for temporary building, for adaptation work, or for equipment of laboratories, and these are paid only when vouchers for expenditure are made available.  However, again the difference between the amount which will appear for each individual institution in the appendix of the Book of Estimates will vary very little from the amount which will be spent on that institution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in saying it will vary very little, is making it clear that An tÚdarás will in practice have very little autonomy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy wants to have it every way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are concerned with is the autonomy of An tÚdarás and, as far as practicable and desirable, the autonomy of the universities and other institutions of higher education.  As regard the autonomy of An tÚdarás the Minister was saying that, although it must have power to transfer payments from the capital side if it was a question of slower progress on one project than on another, except for that and a very minimal adjustment on the current side, An tÚdarás will not have the power to allocate the total sum voted by the Dáil but will be bound to expend it, in principle, along the lines set out in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole purpose of setting up An tÚdarás is to get away from the present situation where the Department of Education are fulfilling this function of allocating funds between different institutions.  That is why An tÚdarás was proposed.  That is why it has been supported by the university institution and the various teaching bodies.  That is why it has been supported by the Opposition here in this House.  To say An tÚdarás will have to clear the allocation with the Department and will only be able to depart from that minimally on the current side and on the capital side in respect of such <Col N="145" /> matters as different rates of progress on different buildings is to defeat the whole purpose and intent of this Bill, and this is something we cannot accept.</P>
    <P>It was the Government's intention, as originally stated, that An tÚdarás would be an autonomous body.  It was vital that it should be so.  The present situation in which a Government Department are directly involved in negotiation with individual institutions is unsatisfactory.  It impinges on the autonomy of these bodies to be so directly under the control of the Department.  In recent years there have been increasing in roads on the autonomy of these institutions as the Department have sought, directly or indirectly, to earmark different kinds of expenditure and to play a direct role in such matters as the determination of fees and salaries.</P>
    <P>It is because of the dangers of this situation and precisely for that reason that An tÚdarás were thought desirable. Most of us, perhaps, unwisely in the light of past experience, took the Government's statements at their face value.  We thought the intention was to create an autonomous body, to take this matter out of the hands of the Department and to create a situation in which this body would determine what were the needs of university institutions and other institutions of higher education, would put their claim to the Government and the Government would allocate whatever proportion of that they felt able to do in view of the current economic circumstances and An tÚdarás would then have the function of distributing that money.  If, of course, the money given by the Government was exactly that sought they would, in the ordinary way, allocate it in accordance with the submissions made; it would be illogical to do otherwise. But if the Government were unable to provide the full sum, then An tÚdarás, and only An tÚdarás, would have the function of deciding who would not get their full amount.  In that way the buffer to preserve the autonomy of the universities of higher education from Government interference would operate.</P>
    <P>That was the clear intention, and once you get a situation where, in fact, that does not happen and where when <Col N="146" /> the Government do not provide the full amount sought it is the Government who determine who gets the money and not An tÚdarás, An tÚdarás become merely a channel for pushing money through and simply an extra stage in the whole process.  There are other functions which An tÚdarás may usefully perform.  Their sole function is not the putting forward of claims for money and allocating the sums involved but it is their principal function; indeed, but for that requirement, but for the need for this buffer to preserve the automony of these institutions I do not think An tÚdarás would ever have been set up or if anyone would have thought of setting them up, because the other functions they have to perform, while useful, are not all that vital; they are not ones for which most people would have thought it necessary to establish such an institution.</P>
    <P>The Government, have, therefore with the decision which appears to have been taken, which we have slowly dragged out of the Minister in this House, undermined the purpose of setting up this body, undermined its autonomy.  I do not know if this was intended.  I do not know from where it originated, but I do not believe it was the Minister's original intention. It seems to me that at some stage in the last couple of years a good decision was taken by the Minister for Education to take this matter out of the hands of the Department and to establish an independent body and that in the years in between the Department have gradually clawed back from subsequent Ministers the power which the decision of an earlier Minister took away from them.</P>
    <P>The alternative explanation is one which I am loath to accept in the present circumstances and in relation to the present Minister, that is, that we were all along deceived as to the purpose of this body, that it was never intended to be autonomous.  I do not think that is the case but that an honest decision was taken to set up an autonomous body, that it has been sabotaged, that the Minister would appear not to have appreciated the significance of this and to have, to <Col N="147" /> some degree, fallen for it.  In that I am disappointed.  I can only hope that given the opportunity to rethink this, the Minister will see the force of the argument I am putting forward and will agree to look at this matter again.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of having a body to perform this function if it is not allowed to perform it.  If, in fact, the ultimate allocation between the authorities is determined by the Department what is the body for? What is the vital necessity of having it? I am puzzled that the Minister should lend himself to that.  I can only think he did not fully understand what was involved and ask him very seriously to reconsider it.  I am prepared, because I am anxious to get results here rather than score points, to withdraw the relevant amendment if the Minister will say that, having heard the arguments, he is prepared to reconsider the matter having seen that the proposal he is making is one which, in the light of further consideration, is producing a situation different from what was originally intended.  If the Minister did not intend to undermine the autonomy of An tÚdarás I think he can see now how this is being done.  If he is prepared to have a look at this between now and Report Stage I will certainly withdraw the amendment, but if he says there is no question of that, then this is a vital element in it; if he is determined to push this through and to hang on to this power for the Department and to take away from An tÚdarás the function of allocating those funds, then we have no alternative but to press the amendment.</P>
    <P>The second point&mdash;and there are two aspects of the problem facing in two different directions and we have to consider them separately&mdash;is the question of the autonomy of the universities <i>vis-à-vis</i> An tÚdarás.  The Minister has not given any convincing reason for wanting An tÚdarás to have the power to impose conditions and earmark current moneys.  All the examples he has given are in respect of sums which are, in fact, capital sums.  He may well argue, and correctly technically, that some of them are not treated as capital for budgetary purposes, that the sum <Col N="148" /> paid to universities in respect of equipment, for example, is a current item financed out of taxation.  That is a very interesting technical budgetary point and economists could debate whether it is justified or not.  It is just a piece of cautious budgeting.  The fact is that the sums that are earmarked for equipment, adaptation and the rest of it are all capital sums in relation to capital activity, whether it is buying capital equipment or whether it is adapting capital assets, buildings.  He has not been able to mention any other case in which at present there is power to allocate genuine current sums, that is, the lump sum grants which are given to universities and which they are free to use in accordance with their own needs having made their case and got the money.</P>
    <P>Clearly, therefore, unless the Minister is prepared to accept our amendment or another amendment drafted for this purpose&mdash;I am never wedded to the particular form of my amendment &mdash;which limit this earmarking to things that are capital in character, whether or not they are capital from the point of view of the Book of Estimates, again we have to press the issue.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the fact that there is a separate earmarking for agricultural and veterinary medicine but this originated from the historical situation of the money coming from a different Department.  The Minister has said that this is to go and that in future there will be one payment from the Department of Education. Therefore, the justification for that, if ever there was a justification, no longer exists, and as the only other instance he can give of a case in which it would be desirable to allocate current expenditure or in which it is now done is an instance that relates to current expenditure which is capital in form, I feel our amendment must be pressed. However, if the Minister is willing to say that he sees our point but that our amendment, because of the reference to capital expenditure, is so worded that it might not take in the particular items he is thinking of, I am more than willing to consider an amendment of his that would extend it into the field of equipment and adaptation <Col N="149" /> if these are, for technical budgetary reasons not covered by the phrase &ldquo;capital expenditure.&rdquo;  I would have thought myself they are covered by it.  I would have thought myself that there is a clear distinction between the classification of items in the Budget and the Book of Estimates, which is an internal Government administrative matter, and a legal interpretation of expenditure in relation to an institution such as a university.  To my mind, money spent on equipment or adaptation is clearly, in law, capital expenditure, however the Government classify it in the Book of Estimates, which is irrelevant from that point of view.  If the Minister does not agree or if he has already got legal advice that my phraseology does not meet this point, we can look at it again but as he has made no case whatever for giving to An tÚdarás power to allocate genuine current sums, and as he has not been able to show that this is in fact the practice now, I can see no reason for introducing a practice that would diminish the autonomy of these institutions <i>vis-à-vis</i> the authority from whom they get money just as I can see no case for diminishing the intended autonomy of An tÚdarás <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>On the whole, I support Deputy FitzGerald but I do so with certain reservations.  I find myself in some slight difficulty here.  Unlike my colleague, Deputy O'Donovan, who no doubt will participate in this debate in a few moments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I, on the whole, welcome the establishment of this authority and when the Minister says that Deputy FitzGerald is trying to have it both ways, there is some grain of truth in this as regards amendment No. 22.  However, I think that both sides are trying to have it both ways, the university on the one hand and the Department on the other.  We are confronted here by two negative propositions. In saying that, I am not suggesting that Deputy FitzGerald's proposition is one of these but that of the universities as against the Minister's. <Col N="150" /> Broadly speaking, it seems to be that the position of the university spokesmen is that if they have to choose between dealing with the Minister on the one hand and the authority on the other, they will choose the authority.  If they could possibly get out of dealing with either, so much the better.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not be right.  However, the Minister's point of view seems to be that where he can diminish the autonomy of the universities, <i>vis-à-vis</i>, for example current expenditure, he will take the role of dignifying and establishing the function of the authority but where, in turn, it suits him to reserve to himself certain final decisions, he will diminish the status of the authority and if, for example, the Minister accused Deputy FitzGerald and myself of being inconsistent in having advised him to accept the authority's recommendations on teacher training, he is in the same position himself.  He is accepting the autonomy of the authority where it diminishes the authority of the university and he is rejecting the autonomy of the authority where such autonomy diminishes his own autonomy.  He is having it both ways too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On subsection (12), amendment 22. I was at a loss as was Deputy FitzGerald to understand the Minister's distinction between what actually appears in the Book of Estimates and what is actually done.  It seems to me that the Higher Education Authority are to possess a remarkable degree of autonomy to fiddle the accounts which will already have appeared before the House.  In endeavouring to have it both ways, the Minister says he does not anticipate that there will be any major variances on current expenditure. He speaks of the possibility of a project varying in success from one university to another and being changed.  Can he really argue that something termed a project fits within the context of what he describes as <Col N="151" /> current expenditure?  I agree fully with Deputy FitzGerald; all the examples that the Minister gives in relation to the manner in which projects may exceed or fail to reach their predictable expenditure, for instance, laboratories and temporary buildings, would seem to me to fall within the realm of capital expenditure rather than current expenditure.  For that reason, I support amendment No. 22 but I support more particularly amendment No. 24.</P>
    <P>Let me make it quite clear that I do not seek to diminish the power of the Minister who is the spokesman for the community in this regard.  He is the person who must find the money in consultation with the Minister for Finance and a three-tier arrangement by which the Department and the Minister would determine the overall budget that was available for higher education would be perfectly satisfactory to me and on a second tier where the Higher Education Authority would determine the divisions, on both the capital and current level, between the institutions, the authority rather than the Minister, would be acceptable to me.  I do not think that the authority should go so far as to determine the divisions in current expenditure.  This is a kind of three-tier procedure which, unlike many of my academic colleagues, I would accept.  I agree with what Deputy Tunney said when he spoke on the last occasion on which this Bill was being discussed, that, in effect, ultimately the fiscal buck rests on the Minister's desk. This is as it should be but the details of expenditure should be only supervised broadly by the authority and should be supervised in detail in relation to current expenditure by the universities themselves.</P>
    <P>I have before me the report of what the Minister said on the last occasion on which the Bill was discussed and I quote:</P>
    <P>First of all each institution will make its application to An tÚdarás in an agreed form.  An tÚdarás will then have discussions and consultations with each of the institutions concerned.  It will then make its recommendations to the Minister and <Col N="152" /> more than likely have discussions with him.  When the capital and the current amounts which the Government would find possible to make available have been determined An tÚdarás will be notified.  It will then be for An tÚdarás to have further discussions with the institutions wherever such may be necessary in order to make whatever changes in priority they think essential.  When these discussions have been completed An tÚdarás will notify the Minister as to the amounts it proposes for each institution.</P>
    <P>This is not a three-tier process; rather it is a six- or seven-tier one.  The universities talk to An tÚdarás; An tÚdarás say &ldquo;no&rdquo;; the universities say &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;; An tÚdarás say &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo;. They agree on a figure&mdash;X&mdash;which they take to the Minister but he says &ldquo;no&rdquo;; An tÚdarás say &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;; the Minister says &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; and An tÚdarás says &ldquo;why?&rdquo;; An tÚdarás go back to the universities and say &ldquo;the Minister says `why?' &rdquo; and the universities say &ldquo;not bloody likely&rdquo; and the universities go back to An tÚdarás who agree on a figure Z.  An tÚdarás then go back to the Minister and the Minister says not Z but A, so that it is a seven-tier process.</P>

      <P>I can sympathise with the Minister in not understanding academics. I am not sure that I understand them myself.  The only way in which this process can be shortcircuited is to make certain that effective budgetary control, at least at capital level, rests in one particular spot and the spot where Deputy FitzGerald and I would like to see it rest is with An tÚdarás. The only alternative to making it legally stated that this is the way it is going to be, is, in my opinion, that this whole process will be shortcircuited <Col N="153" /> by one form or another and that in fact while the elaborate machinery contained in the Bill maintains a superficial uncomplicated structure of university education, the sensible university politician will ring the private telephone number of the Minister and make sure that his representations are heard in a direct rather than in a filtered form.</P>

      <P>The point I am trying to make is that if Deputy FitzGerald can be accused to some extent of trying to have it both ways the Minister can be much more stridently accused of trying to have it both ways. I have seen this attitude in relation to amendments put down by Deputy FitzGerald, for example, to insert the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, but the Minister invariably took the line that we know they are going to be reasonable so we do not have to say so.  In the same way he says here we do not anticipate variations in current expenditure but that we anticipate them only in capital expenditure and that it is not intended to go as far as to make it specific in the Bill to limit the authority to the Higher Education Authority <i>vis-à-vis</i> the universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not go along with those who would like to have as an ideal an authority autonomy <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Minister and a university autonomy <i>vis-à-vis</i> the authority.  It is ultimately, in terms of broad fiscal policy, on the desk of the Minister for Education and the Minister for Finance that the buck remains.  What Deputy FitzGerald and I are suggesting is a more clearly defined three-tier process.  We are not denying to the Minister the right to determine the overall expenditure for higher education.  We are not denying to the authority the distribution of finances as between specific institutions. What we are objecting to is that the Minister should retain his overall authority to divide within his total Budget as between institutions which would seem to nullify the point of <Col N="154" /> having the HEA at all.  Deputy FitzGerald and I are at one in feeling that the HEA is given excessive authority in respect of the current aspect of expenditure towards universities.  I do not know whether Deputy FitzGerald intends to press these amendments or not but if he does not get the kind of assurance that he is looking for from the Minister &mdash;and I think for once we are being extremely reasonable, neither of us is splitting hairs&mdash;then if he does not press for a division on these amendments I will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to approach this matter in a slightly different way from that of my colleagues.  We are talking about money.  One can make any abstract argument one likes but that, in fact, is what we are doing.  It is extraordinary that ever since the universities left the careful hands of the Department of Finance, and they were very careful about money, there has been nothing but argument, trouble and difficulties.  I want to go back to what Deputy Tunney said about my remarks. He said that I was illogical, that I wanted a Committee of the House to oversee bodies like the IDA, Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus and so on.  So I did but what was wrong with that? In such circumstances here I would again have a committee which would look after an tÚdarás because that would be the body that would come to the committee.  The great objection I have all the time to this is that it reduces the autonomy of the universities.  In that connection I did some research this morning.  Let us for the moment forget about the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons and the new third level education bodies and let us think of the old established bodies.  There are two kinds.  We have Maynooth and Dublin University both of which, by the way, are in this.  I may be wrong but I understand that the Hierarchy are the trustees for Maynooth College which means that, in fact, it is entirely self-governing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Dublin University they were kind enough this year to publish a very fine annual calendar and under <Col N="155" /> the heading &ldquo;Constitution of the College and University&rdquo; it states:</P>
    <P>The board is the principal governing body both of the college and of the university and its consent is required for all enactments, changes or appointments of any consequence.  In matters of property and finance, discipline, domestic arrangements, administration and relations with outside bodies, the authority of the board is subject to the statutes absolute.</P>
    <P>In other bodies disciplinary matters and the like are in charge of the registrar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should read the statutes as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much, but we have not got all the year to talk about this.  We will only take until the summer.  It goes on:</P>
      <P>In strictly academic matters, that is both in relation to teaching, examinations, degrees and the appointment of academic staff, it can act only in conjunction with the University Council Divinity School, Council of Senate of the University. It consists of the following members&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>And this is coming to the nub of the matter&mdash;</P>
      <P>the Provost, the seven Senior Fellows, the Bursar, the Senior Lecturer and the Registrar, whether they be Senior or Junior Fellows&mdash;</P>
      <P>There was a famous Paris revolution some years ago when the juniors took over these appointments&mdash;</P>
      <P>four representatives elected by the junior fellows from among themselves; two representatives elected by those professors who are not fellows&mdash;they may be chosen either from among themselves or from among the junior fellows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, it is an entirely internal kind of thing.  I could understand why you might have to have a body like An tÚdarás to look after that kind of concern.  I am all in favour of university institutions being entirely independent but I can understand why another person might want to have An tÚdarás.  Let me come now to the <Col N="156" /> three colleges of the NUI.  Let me start with the smallest, University College, Galway.  The governing body consists of the President, four members elected by the Senate of the National University of Ireland, four members elected by the academic council of University College, Galway, four members elected by the graduates of University College, Galway, seven representatives of local authorities&mdash;six of the local county councils, including the County Clare, in that spectrum &mdash;and one by the Borough of Galway; three nominated by the Minister for Education, strangely enough&mdash;and I notice a vacancy among them in the calendar I saw; I do not know if the Minister has still allowed it to be there&mdash;and finally three are co-opted. This country is a democracy and that is as good an example of democracy as I have ever come across.</P>
    <P>Let us move to Cork where there are slight differences.  The President is appointed by the Government, not by the Minister for Education, two elected by the Senate of the National University of Ireland, six elected by the academic council, which consists of the professors and lecturers, four elected by the graduates of University College, Cork, and three <i>ex officio.</i> Who are these <i>ex officio</i> people?  They are the three mayors of the southern cities, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  Finally, five are elected by the county councils of Munster, excluding Clare, which is in with Galway, and four are co-opted.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the institution which is as large as all the others put together.  In University College, Dublin, the governing body consists of a President, four members nominated by the Government, three appointed by the Senate of the NUI, six elected by the academic council, which consists of professors and statutory lecturers, six elected by the graduates of UCD, the Lord Mayor of the city of Dublin, a member nominated by the County Council of Dublin and eight elected by the General Council of County Councils and four co-opted.  It amuses me when I think of the regional health boards, legislation for which has just gone through the House.  Why are we not consistent?  Why is one Minister legislating one way and another Minister <Col N="157" /> legislating another way?  We all know the great care that was taken to keep the control in the hands of the representatives of the local authorities in connection with those regional health boards.  Going by the newspapers, I see that there has been a tremendous rumpus going on and there was great interest among Deputies as to who would be put on these boards.  There was great canvassing of opinions and so on but when we compare this situation with the other one what do we find?  We find, again in relation to money, that this year about £10,200,000 has been voted directly for universities. This year there has been a marginal improvement in the amount given to UCD.  Let me get back to the question I raised and on which the Minister threw cold water with one sentence: &ldquo;We all know that some faculties are more expensive than others.&rdquo;  Does he know that?  I have been at many universities and each faculty is as expensive as you want to make it.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a very bad example when he took engineering.  I shall give the Minister some free information. Engineering could be a very expensive faculty if up-to-date machines were bought but if the Minister goes over to the basement just behind us he will find steam-engines of 1911 there. A student with whom I was friendly who was doing mechanical engineering told me: &ldquo;These old engines are completely out of date.&rdquo;  They do theoretical work to a very high standard.  The Minister took a very bad example when he mentioned the engineering faculty in relation to expensive faculties in this country.  Any faculty could be expensive. This is what I object to in the present set up.  The position will become worse.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the general question, the Industrial Development Authority is to be voted by Grant-in-Aid this year according to the Estimates volume we got yesterday, £23 million.  It is quite independent; it consists of a chairman and five other directors none of whom is elected. They have not this broad representation I have indicated.  They are more like Trinity College than University College, Cork.  They have the right to spend £23 million.  The Minister may <Col N="158" /> say they will have to come to the Government but the Higher Education Authority went to the Government in the last 12 months seeking £24 million for a long-term capital programme.  I got this information in the newspapers, not officially.  To the best of my recollection they were told by the Government&mdash;the Minister can correct me if my information is not accurate but it is not very far out&mdash;that all they could make available was £14 million. Is that wrong?  Has the Minister an answer?  If the Minister will not listen, I shall go back on it.</P>

What amount of money did An tÚdarás&mdash;as I pronounce it; the Minister pronounces it slightly differently, nearer to what I should like to call it, An tÚdar-ass&mdash;ask from the Government for long-term capital development for the university institutions? According to the newspapers they sought £24 million and the Government said: &ldquo;We cannot give you that: all we can give is £14 million.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This is the second time the Minister has given himself away in this debate.  I made a note the other night when he spoke about no change being made in the present position.  I attached a special meaning to this and the Minister has come out with it openly now: his men know everything better than everybody else. That is what he has told me.  The Minister does not appear to appreciate what he has said.  I could use an expression about these people that would not pass the Leas-Cheann Comhairle but in fact An tÚdarás were told: &ldquo;We have men who can do for £15 million what you thought would take £25 million.&rdquo;  If that is so let us hand the universities and students entirely over to the Department of Education.  I suspect that is partly the game here.  The Minister may not understand it that way.  I defend my attitude absolutely; it is perfectly right: there is no comparison with Great Britain, with the universities grants committee.  In England there is an enormous number of these institutions, some as old as Oxford or Cambridge or Durham and others built only the day before yesterday such as Nottingham and North Staffordshire or the University of Lancaster which have only recently come into existence.  I wanted to put these words into the Minister's own amendment which I would then accept; &ldquo;shall have regard primarily to the number of students pursuing studies leading to a degree in that institution&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All our universities are alike subject to two considerations.  All are fundamentally liberal arts institutions with UCD being rather more technological than others.  Still sticking to my figures, the grant for the coming year for the agricultural faculties, the Faculty of General Agriculture in UCD, the Faculty of Dairy Science in Cork and the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in UCD and Trinity, is practically £1.5 million.  How many students are there? In each institutions you must take out first-year students because they are catered for in the Faculties of Science <Col N="160" /> and, give or take a few, the figure is 600 students, allowing a margin for error.  Therefore, every student is costing £2,500 a year at least.  I object to this kind of thing.  You have the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries with these special faculties attached to it scooping all the money.  You have a staff/student ratio&mdash;I do not know what it is in Trinity&mdash;in UCD now rapidly approaching one head of staff to every four students.  At the other end of the spectrum you have the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Commerce in UCD which varies with one head of staff per 30 students and in the case of commerce per 36 students.  Yet, the Minister talks of one being more expensive than another.  Of course, if you do it that way it is more expensive but that is not the kind of thing I believe in.  In my opinion a Faculty of Commerce is more important than a Faculty of Veterinary Medicine.  I am not saying that because I am attached to the Faculty of Commerce.  I am only marginally attached to it now; I am primarily attached to the Faculty of Arts.  The most important faculty in any university institution is the Faculty of Arts and anyone can disagree with that opinion if he likes. The Minister has more or less said I was a &ldquo;bad hat&rdquo; for talking about composition, but we are putting a Bill through this House with An tÚdarás already in existence.  It is already there. There is a pretence.  Nach mbeidh na daoine céanna ar An tÚdarás?  Nach mbeidh siad go léir ann?  Sin é mó thuairim.  Will they not be exactly the same people?</P>

I would accept the Minister's amendment if he would put in those words.  I am looking for equality of treatment right through the university system but perhaps I am asking too much.  How could I expect them to fix up this figure of £2,500 per student in the faculties associated with agriculture in the next year or two? Certainly I would not care to do the job myself although it could be done by transferring staff to other faculties and so on.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald made a very good remark when he said, and I am quoting him as best I can, that he wanted to take this matter out of the hands of the Department.  I am with him 100 per cent.  I believe in the complete independence of university institutions, but I would not like them to be as autocratic as our neighbours in College Green.</P>

      <P>It is true that the Minister has his own sufferings at present, and perhaps it behoves us not to make life too difficult for him.  As I have said already I have let him off the hook a few times during the course of the discussion.</P>
      <P>As a young man I spent eight years at some of the best universities in the English-speaking world, and I am not going to admit other people know more about universities than I do.  I have been teaching in UCD for 20 years and I am not going to admit that other people know more in general about universities than I do. Why should I admit it?

      <P>That is rule number one in politics.  I had to learn that the hard way but other people learn it by instinct from their mother's milk.  I appeal to the Minister to think this over again.  I would be prepared to support the Minister's amendment if he inserted the words I have indicated instead of throwing them out as he did on the last occasion with the phrase, &ldquo;We all know that certain faculties are more expensive than others.&rdquo;  The great complaint at Oxford University in recent years particularly by the physicists has been that they do not get enough money because classical philosophy and classical languages still have control.  I must say, if I were giving people control of universities, I would give the control to classical philosophy long before I would give it to experimental physics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment.  We have discussed this at some length and I have explained as clearly as I possibly could <Col N="164" /> what I have in mind.  I can only hope that those who are interested will read what I have said.  It is understandable, I suppose, that I should feel a little muddled having listened to the various speakers on the opposite side debating this particular matter.  Deputy FitzGerald has been trying to have it both ways.  When he was not satisfied with the powers I propose to make available to An tÚdarás, he immediately claimed serious interference with the autonomy of the universities.  When this particular argument was answered he immediately took the opposite stand and said that An tÚdarás would, in fact, have no autonomy at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>How is that the opposite?  I am concerned that both bodies should have the maximum autonomy.  That is entirely consistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in this particular instance.  The fact is that I am not interfering with the autonomy of the universities.  The fact also is that An tÚdarás is an autonomous body.  I have pointed that out on many occasions.  I have explained the <i>modus operandi</i> from the point of view of the dealings of An tÚdarás with the institutions of higher education and with the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Deputy quoted what I said in relation to the <i>modus operandi.</i> He quoted correctly so far as he went, but he then played on the word &ldquo;proposals&rdquo; as if there were some sinister significance in it.  I should like to re-state what I said to show clearly that An tÚdarás will be an autonomous body.  I said at column 2104 of volume 252 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>It is on this the main argument hinges because it has been suggested here, and I do not know why, because I certainly did not suggest it, that, after An tÚdarás has been notified of the amount which is, in fact, available, not only will they have to have discussions with the institution concerned as to priorities and so on, but they will have to come back and ask the Minister's approval for the particular priorities.  This will not be so.  The fact is that they will simply notify the Minister of the amounts for each institution and any democratic assembly is at least entitled to that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> Deputy Thornley suggested that the proposed methods of operation would be very much more complicated than those which are at present in operation. In fact, that will not be so.  I have already explained that the institutions will make their applications for finance to An tÚdarás, An tÚdarás will consult with them before making its recommendations to the Minister, the Minister will have consultations with An tÚdarás in relation to priorities, and so on, and when the total amount of money available has been determined, An tÚdarás will go back and consult <Col N="166" /> again with the higher education institutions and it will not have to come back and consult further with the Minister.  It will simply inform the Minister as to what the various allocations are and these will be put in the appendix to the Book of Estimates.  An tÚdarás will be an autonomous body and it will not interfere with the autonomy of the universities.  It should not be necessary to explain that again. I am providing here the proper procedure and I do not propose to change it.</P>

      <P>I should like to explain why we are opposing amendment No. 23.  We regard this amendment as an improvement in the existing position as set out in the Bill.  Unfortunately, for technical reasons beyond my immediate comprehension, if amendment No. 23 is passed, amendment No. 24 cannot be taken.  As amendment No. 24 is very important and is preferable to amendment No. 23, in order to get this amendment taken we will have to oppose amendment No. 23.

I am extremely unhappy about opposing amendment No. 23 but I gather that if we do not oppose this amendment it passes and amendment No. 24 falls.  If we oppose amendment No. 23 and if we are defeated, in turn amendment No. 24 falls as well.  This is an unfortunate set of circumstances but when I vote against amendment No. 23 what I shall be doing, in effect, is voting for amendment No. 24.</P>

      <P>While the Minister's amendment has effected some improvement we are very concerned about the consequences that flow from the Minister's refusal to accept our amendments. In respect of amendment No. 24, this is a matter we will take up again on Report Stage.  I hope that in the meantime the Minister will consider whether there is not some validity in some of the points we have made that even if he does not feel able to accept the full burden of our contention, he will consider looking into some of the points and adopting a more welcoming approach to our amendment when we come to Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I do not understand this kind of thing in a piece of public legislation:</P>
      <P>An tÚdarás may institute and conduct studies on such problems of higher education and research as it considers appropriate and may publish reports of such studies at its discretion.</P>
      <P>Surely if it is a public institution, as it is, it should either publish them or not publish them?  Surely you are not going to have the kind of action they have in police states and publish certain things, and not other things as you see fit?  In other words, if you do not get what you are looking for, you keep it quiet.  If the Minister were to take out the phrase &ldquo;at its discretion&rdquo; I would have no objection.  I do not understand what the purpose of this is. Do not forget that this is public business. An tÚdarás is not the private property of anybody.  It may be the private property of the Department of Education, which is obviously what is being attempted right through this Bill, but it is a bit blatant here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certain that the membership of An tÚdarás itself might not include all the expertise necessary on all the various aspects and problems which arise from time to time and the authority will require a provision in order that it may commission experts to carry out studies and inquiries at its discretion.  The authority would be most likely to commission studies of this particular kind and to have them carried out by other agencies.  I do not think there is anything in this section that is not particularly clear.</P>

      <P>There is no limit <Col N="172" /> to what Ministers will tell the House nowadays.  They are incapable of realising the picture they are painting of themselves.

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not agree with it.  What I have been saying for the past few minutes is that I do not agree with it at all.  We may be in a hurry here but we are not in that much of a hurry.  This section says:</P>
      <P>An tÚdarás may institute and conduct studies on such problems as higher education and research as it considers appropriate and may publish reports of such studies at its discretion. </P>
      <P>In other words, if it does not like them they can keep them secret but if they suit, they will be published. Is that the meaning of it?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It could quite possibly mean that in some matters which might be of a comparatively minor nature it would not be necessary to publish them.  If these words, &ldquo;at its discretion&rdquo;, were not included, it would be incumbent on the authority to publish everything whether it was of a minor nature or otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not meet Deputy O'Donovan's concern in the matter if it were worded slightly differently? The Deputy's suspicions are aroused by the fact that the question of publication is brought in as an afterthought, as it were, at the end of the clause.  If it were the wording that An tÚdarás would conduct studies for publication or otherwise I do not think any suspicion would be aroused.  There is a suggestion of a <i>post hoc</i> decision on the question of publication after the authority have seen what is in a report.</P>

      <P>If the Minister wishes us to continue this debate on the basis of there is there is not, I am prepared to continue on those lines and we will see which of us will make the better job of it but in the meantime we must discuss it on the basis of rational thought and on the basis of what words mean.  The authority can publish at is discretion.</P>

      <P>It is not.  In the first place why would it conduct research on problems of higher education unless such problems were serious? The Minister said that it might find it necessary to conduct a research on some minor matter but I would not refer to that as research.  For example a fellow might put his head in his hands for a night or something like that but I would not regard that as a matter for research.  Maybe some of the troubles of the present Government are caused because of their failure to put their head in their hands for a night.  I am letting the Minister off the hook on this occasion but one of these days I shall not be so easy in dealing with Ministers.  I shall put down an amendment for Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), page 4, line 10, to delete &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;for causes stated&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendments put down here are all of a piece.  I regret that some of them are thought to be out of order and I shall explain the reasons for my regret when we come to the section. At the moment, I shall confine myself to amendment No. 27.  In this particular instance there are two problems in relation to subsection (3).  One is that the autonomy of An tÚdarás is impeded or affected by the fact that it has not even the power to remove any member of the staff without the consent of the Minister just as it has not the power to appoint any member of the staff without the consent of the Minister.  In the case of appointments the withdrawal of approval by the Minister might conceivably lead to appointments being made that would not otherwise be made.  This creates hypothetically a charge on the Exchequer and so we are precluded from amending it but, when it comes to the removal of someone, such removal cannot put a charge on the Exchequer but would remove a charge from the Exchequer and, therefore, this amendment is being allowed to stand.  It seems to me to be quite undesirable that in any of these instances the autonomy of this body should be interfered with in this extraordinary way.  It is remarkable that throughout this Bill the autonomy of the authority is impeded and affected adversely by the particular wording used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the simplest things that any State body can do is to dismiss a member of the staff but, yet, uniquely, this body cannot even dismiss a member of the staff nor indeed appoint any member or decide on the terms of his conditions.  Here, there is extraordinary interference by the Minister's Department.  Not only will they intervene considerably in the manner in which funds are to be spent but there will be intervention in the internal affairs of the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> The second aspect of this with which we must concern ourselves is the protection of the autonomy of institutions and the rights of individuals.  For that reason I am concerned also that this body should not be able to remove a member of the staff with or without the consent of the Minister except for reasons stated.  There is no protection in this for the individual concerned other than the Minister's consent being required but I would not have considered that to be much protection for the employee.  It is important that any removal of a member of the staff of this body should be for causes stated. That is why the amendment proposed is one which performs a dual function. By deleting &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo; we extend the autonomy of the body and by inserting &ldquo;for causes stated&rdquo;, we ensure the protection of the individual.  I would ask the Minister not to suggest once again that I am facing both ways.  I am facing in the same direction all the time.  I am concerned with protecting the rights of the individual and the autonomy, on the one hand of the universities and secondly of An tÚdarás.  This amendment fulfils this dual function.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to say that this is an amendment which I cannot support.  Anticipating the remarks of the Minister I do think that Deputy FitzGerald is making a considerable mountain out a molehill here for two reasons.  First, specifically, &ldquo;the consent of the Minister&rdquo; reduces the Minister to a passive role.  At least he is not in a position of himself seeking here to remove an officer or servant; the initiative rests with An tÚdarás.  The phrase &ldquo;for reasons stated&rdquo; is virtually meaningless.  If I were an officer or servant of An tÚdarás and I became a notorious alcoholic would that mean An tÚdarás had to inform the nation that the reason I was pensioned off was that I was a notorious alcoholic? I do not think the amendment makes much sense and I think the Deputy is trying to have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Stabbed in the back. Just to clarify a point.  The phrase &ldquo;for causes stated&rdquo; is one which had a particular function because it is a protection <Col N="176" /> of the individual because once a body have to state the causes then they have to justify them in a court if necessary.  If there are no causes stated then they are able to dismiss a person and they cannot be got at so easily by that person for unjust dismissal.  The phrase has a legal force of some consequence. The causes do not have to be stated to the nation but to the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would tend to look at this matter in a somewhat different light from Deputy FitzGerald.  I feel that &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo; is a measure of protection for officers and servants in that decisions to dismiss them must be referred to the Minister for his consent.  In that way I am endeavouring to protect to the greatest possible degree the rights of the individuals concerned.  With regard to &ldquo;for causes stated&rdquo; this is not necessary in the Bill.  In fact I would be inclined to think that something like this should be, or rather could be, covered in the contract of service with An tÚdarás.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could be but need not be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, say, should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If it should be why not say so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the whole I am with Deputy FitzGerald but I disagree entirely with his wording &ldquo;for causes stated&rdquo;.  It could be a single cause.  I think &ldquo;for cause stated&rdquo; is the usual phrase.  The point is that as it is it gives a blanket power.  Under the Constitution each Minister of the Government appoints his own civil servants but they can be removed from office only by the Government.  In this case all that is required is &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo; and both Deputy FitzGerald and the Minister are right that that is a passive role, so to speak.  At the same time I feel there is a blanket power there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not thought about the wording of this but I am quite clear about the idea I have in mind.  It is that they should state to the person concerned why he is being sacked.  He should be <Col N="177" /> entitled to get a statement &ldquo;You are being sacked because...&rdquo;&ldquo;You are being sacked because you are continually drunk&rdquo;, since that has been mentioned. Essentially we have to go back to the point that this is a board, using that word in the sense that Deputy FitzGerald will understand it.  A board have their rights and duties laid out in the Act which constitutes the board. We can call it An tÚdarás or anything else.  In this case the document setting up An tÚdarás will be an Act&mdash;much later than April of this year I hope&mdash; and the Act must set out all the rights and duties of the authority.  This is quite common and it is not something which I have just made up.</P>
    <P>I will have a look at this again before the Report Stage so that if the Minister is not prepared to say that he will have a look at it I will be able to put down an amendment to say what I think should be said.  This is absolute; there is no qualification whatever.  We have all sorts of qualifications in the Bill, with the consent of the Minister, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, and all this kind of thing interleaved through the Bill, and yet we come to this which really involves the removal of a person from An tÚdarás.  I grant that the Minister has to give consent and that is the only safeguard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the reason I am anxious to keep it in the Bill, that it is a safeguard, and&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with regard to the &ldquo;causes stated&rdquo; aspect of it that should be covered in the contract of service.  It would not be at all proper that the reasons why a person was dismissed should be made public.  If I were to insert this in the Bill it could happen that questions would be asked and, while this also could be a protection in some instances, generally speaking the vast majority of people concerned who would be justifiably dismissed would certainly not want to have the causes published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>A question can be asked anyway.  The Minister can be <Col N="178" /> asked a question in this House: &ldquo;You gave your consent and why was the man dismissed?&rdquo; The Minister, of course, can refuse to answer but he is not going to safeguard himself from having a question asked.  However, I will put down an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to consider an amendment which confined itself to inserting &ldquo;for cause stated&rdquo; or words to that effect? I do not understand the Minister's point that if it goes in then it will be made public.  This would not follow at all.  In all kinds of contracts there is a provision that dismissals must be for cause stated and this does not imply that this is made public.  I wonder if the Minister has any reason for suggesting that interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would feel that certainly there would be the risk there that it could be interpreted as something which it would be proper to make public.  I do not feel I would be entitled to take that risk.  I feel that this should be covered in contracts of service and not inserted in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister look into the question between now and the Report Stage as to whether something could be put into the Bill that cause should be stated in the contract without giving any right of publication? I am not sure if the Minister has any grounds for his fear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>So that all contracts will, as the Minister thinks desirable, contain such a provision.  If we do not put it in the Bill there is no guarantee that the authority will ensure that such provision is in these contracts.  The purpose of legislation is to require things to be done which we think ought to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the resort lies in the individual employee's hands?  If he is so stupid as to accept a contract which can cause him to be fired without cause stated, then bad luck to him.  If he has any intelligence he will not take the job on those terms.  I think really <Col N="179" /> you are trying to dot the i's and cross the t's of human relations which the Deputy will agree is quite impossible in legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I never expected to hear such a sentiment expressed on those benches.  We all know that there is not full employment in this country and people are forced to accept employment on unsatisfactory terms because of the fact that there is inadequate protection due either to inadequate trade union action or inadequate legislation.  The whole purpose of legislation is to protect people in this way.</P>

We are not talking here about the secretary of the body who has £3,000 a year or so but about every employee of the body.

Is it in that function he will operate here and not as Minister for Finance as we have always understood the words?  What is involved here is that every type of appointment will have to get the approval of the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The overriding power remains with the Minister for Finance.  An official in the Department of Finance can write to an official in the Minister's Department saying: &ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Finance to say that he does not consent to such and such conditions.&rdquo; That can only be rectified by the Minister for Education writing to the Minister for Finance who will send for the file and they will then clean up the matter.  This gives rise to a great deal of paper work which serves no useful purpose.</P>

      <P>I regard this as one of the most objectionable sections of the Bill.  The body we are setting up is one which should have a considerable measure of autonomy but one finds that it has virtually no power to do anything without the approval of the Minister.  If it wants to appoint a messenger or doorkeeper, first it must go to the Minister and get his approval under subsection (1) to making this appointment because they &ldquo;may appoint such and so many persons to be its officers and servants as, subject to the approval of the Minister, it from time to time thinks proper&rdquo;.  They cannot take a decision to appoint a messenger without the approval of the Minister.  They must then go to the Minister to get approval of the terms and conditions of this messenger's appointment.  Having got that they must then clear with the Minister, who has to clear with the Minister for Finance, the remuneration of this messenger involving two Government Departments.  Again, if he is dismissed the Minister is also brought into it.  Is there any semi-State body in the country whose autonomy and authority is so circumscribed?</P>

      <P>The first one set up was the Agricultural Credit Corporation, then the Dairy Disposals Board, the Pigs and Bacon Commission, the Electricity Supply Board.  I cannot recall any body of which this is true. So great is the autonomy of one of the first of those bodies, the Dairy Disposals Board set up in 1927, that until the Companies Act of 1963 they did not even have to submit a profit and loss account or report to this House.  We never knew what profits they made. This was how keen on autonomy they were in 1927.  I doubt if in the early days provisions of this kind appeared in any of the legislation.  I have worked in a State body.  It would be utterly inconceivable that in a body like Aer Lingus the terms and conditions of staff, the remuneration and appointment of staff would ever get near the Minister for Finance or that he should have anything to do with it.  While we may argue that Aer Lingus is a commercial body in that it derives its revenue from commercial sources and not just Grants-in-Aid, when one looks at bodies like Córas Tráchtála and Bord Fáilte, is it suggested that they must get the approval of the Minister for every appointment and for the terms and conditions and remuneration and the right to dismiss somebody?  I have not the Bills dealing with these bodies before me but I very much doubt if there is any such provision in them.  Here we have a body which, above all those bodies, should be autonomous, a body which is set up for the purpose of hiving off from the Government this activity of supervising and organising higher education, of trying to secure and protect the autonomy of these institutions from direct Government intervention and which, above all, therefore must be autonomous. That was the original intention before it got into the hands of the Department. Yet, we have this body set up and of all the bodies for the Government to pick on they pick on this one from which to take away every scrap of autonomy.  They cannot move an inch without the approval of the Minister.  They cannot decide to appoint a messenger, they cannot decide his conditions of service, they cannot decide his remuneration and they <Col N="183" /> cannot without the Minister's approval dismiss him.  Would the Minister like to say why he decided in this instance to take away all autonomy in staff matters and have this body under the tight control of his Department in respect of all its staff?  Nothing said either in this debate or prior to it has suggested any good reason for this course of action.  I should be glad to hear the Minister on that.  I do not want to waste the time of the House by continuing along that line until I have heard the Minister's views.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy's interpretation of the section were a fact I suppose we could regard this as a rather peculiar situation but it is not.  Again, the Deputy is endeavouring to cross all his t's and dot all his i's.  The position is that the Minister's approval is required only for the type of post and the number of posts, but not for the individual appointments.  Once a decision has been made in relation to various categories of posts and positions then An tÚdarás will make the individual appointments themselves. Where the costs of such posts have to be met out of public funds there has to be some co-ordination is achieved is to make the creation of the posts, the conditions and so on subject to ministerial approval.  I do not see anything peculiar about this.  It will be accepted there is a need to preserve some degree of uniformity in the matter of salaries and allowances throughout the public service and this is a way in which this can be achieved. To suggest that once categories have been decided on and salaries for these categories agreed on An tÚdarás will be tied down in the appointment of individual persons to these posts is ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just read what the words say: &ldquo;An tÚdarás may appoint such and so many persons.&rdquo; The &ldquo;and so many&rdquo; could fit in with what the Minister has said.  The question of how many persons are appointed would be a matter for the Minister to approve, but I do not accept that there is any case for that.  The <Col N="184" /> insertion of the word &ldquo;such&rdquo;, and I quote:</P>
      <P>(1)  An tÚdarás may appoint such and so many persons to be its officers and servants as, subject to the approval of the Minister, it from time to time thinks proper</P>
      <P>cannot be interpreted as meaning the number of persons or the categories of persons.  &ldquo;Such persons&rdquo; means such individual; it does not son&rdquo; means individual; it does not mean such people but such individual persons and if that is the Minister's intention his draftsmen have singularly failed to translate it into legislative thought and it is necessary to amend it to achieve that result.</P>
      <P>Even if the Minister were correct in saying that the wording he has used achieved the somewhat more limited effect he mentioned we still find the autonomy of this body is closely circumscribed. The number and category of its employees are laid down by the Minister; the conditions and terms of service are laid down by the Minister; their remuneration is laid down by the Minister and the question of their dismissal is a matter for the Minister. Even if the Minister were correct in saying that is all that is involved, it would involve grave incursions into the autonomy of these bodies.  The Minister had the gall to tell us, and I wrote it down when he said it, that this is the normal way of co-ordinating the activities of bodies of this kind in respect of remuneration.  The word &ldquo;normal&rdquo; to me means that in the great majority of cases this is what is done.  I am aware of about 70 State bodies and if it is the normal way it must be the way adopted by 50 of them.  Would the Minister like to name State bodies in respect of which this kind of State control exists in this phraseology and carried to this extent? He would need to name 50 to justify the phrase he has used, but can he name ten or five?</P>

That is the only body that I know of in which there was something remotely resembling this.  Deputy FitzGerald is 100 per cent right.  You have the first body set up here, the ESB.  You have the Agricultural Credit Corporation away back in 1927, 45 years ago.  You have Aer Lingus.  There is none of this stuff in relation to these.  We are told this body will not interfere with the autonomy of the universities.  But it is itself tied up in knots and it will, of course, tend to tie the universities up in knots.

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  A country is not run by Ministers taking into their hands the decision as to who will be employed by every State or semi-State body in the country, their remuneration and terms and conditions of employment.  The way to run these things is by appointing bodies to do the necessary work, giving them a budget and telling them to get on with the job.  It would be utterly inconceivable that these bodies, with their 65,000 employees in the public sector, should be controlled by the respective Minister in the appointment of staff, the fixing of their remuneration and the terms and conditions governing their employment.  But that is what Deputy Tunney suggests.  If that were the position no category of staff could be set up in Aer Lingus and no individuals appointed to the ESB without the terms of remuneration and conditions of service going before the Minister. This sort of thing has never been suggested, even by Fianna Fáil, before tonight.  It is an incredible suggestion. Deputy Tunney must realise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course we must have control. That control was invented some years ago through budgetary control.  If capital is required in a State or semi-State body those in charge of that body must justify the need for capital and, if the Government are dissatisfied with the way the body is being run, they can refuse the money or dismiss the board. They have dismissed boards, and quite rightly, in several cases.  If a body is dependent on State funds for the bulk of its requirements, as this body will be, as Córas Tráchtála is, and roughly 40 of the 70 State bodies fall into this category on my calculation, if they are in that position they must each year go to the Government and seek the money they need to carry on their functions.  The Government are entitled to express their views on the legitimacy of their demands for money. If the demand is they need more staff and the Government think they do not <Col N="189" /> need more staff, they do not get the money.  If the Government think the demand is unreasonable and the body is incompetently and extravagantly run they dismiss the board.</P>
    <P>In no case is a State body in the position in which it cannot appoint a member of the staff, set up categories of grades, set out terms and conditions of service, decide on remuneration, or dismiss staff without the approval of a Minister.  Why then pick on this body? This body is being set up to protect and safeguard the autonomy of the universities.  The Government could have gone on with their policy of dealing directly with each university and college.  They did not do that because the case was made so strongly by the Higher Education Authority for having a buffer body that the Government decided to introduce this Bill and that decision has now been, as so often happens in Church and State, sabotaged lower down the line and some people are dragging back this autonomy, which is the whole purpose and function of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister where are all these bodies in respect of which all these conditions apply.  There may be some.  Deputy O'Donovan claims there is one where remuneration is subject to this kind of control.  This may well be true in regard to a couple of these.  There may be some bodies so closely part of the Public Service that this is the case. The Industrial Development Authority for many years, although given some autonomy and power to recruit staff outside the Public Service, was, in respect of the bulk of the staff, an integral part of the Public Service but it had a separate board and some of the staff it recruited from outside.  Most of the staff were seconded temporarily and moved backwards and forwards to and from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It would not surprise me, therefore, if the Industrial Development Authority were in that position because it was an extension of the Civil Service.  As in so many cases, bit by bit these bodies have been hived off, given their independence and autonomy and a board of their own and power to run their own affairs. <Col N="190" /> When this change was made the staff were given the opportunity of remaining there or going back to the Public Service.</P>
    <P>This is true of bodies depending totally on State grant as it is true of bodies earning their revenue in the market place.  That is the position and I should like to hear from the Minister some justification for what he has done here.  I hope I can drag some example out of him where this is done.  When he says this is the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; way of co-ordinating such bodies, &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, I repeat, means that which is done in the great majority of cases.  There are 40 State bodies virtually totally dependent on State funds.  I checked.  I wrote on the subject about ten years ago.  At that time here were 34 and there probably has been an increase since.  I would need to be told the names of 30 of them in respect of which this clause applies before I would accept this is the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; way of handling it.  I have not yet heard from the Minister.</P>

      <P>Vocational education committees at the moment are engaged on very important work.  I would be prepared to make the case that the field of education in which they are engaged is as important as this particular field.  In the matter of co-ordination, the committee in Dublin is not allowed to employ all the available teachers and deprive other counties of teachers that may be required there.  I see that as being a worthwhile exercise.  Here I am confining myself solely to the field of education.  I am not terribly concerned about what is happening in the Dairy Disposal Board and if they have to date been operating in fields which give them certain freedoms there may come a time when I can examine whether I am satisfied, in the matter of the expenditure of public moneys, that they should so continue.</P>
      <P>I see in this not something which will be examined from day to day.  I can see submissions being made, rather global submissions, and I assume that the Department of Education and the Department of Finance will not examine them in any tremendous detail and will not set out to thwart or to deny to An tÚdarás that which they may justifiably claim.  I see in what is proposed here the safeguard that is required and I should be very disappointed to see it removed.</P>

      <P>In fact it does not interfere with the autonomy but where in my view An tÚdarás really needed autonomy the Deputy was very anxious to prevent it having that particular autonomy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; in section 14 (1) I am informed that <Col N="192" />&ldquo;such&rdquo; in this case relates to categories of persons and not to individuals but in any case I want again to emphasise that while the Minister will have discussions in relation to the various categories and remuneration with An tÚdarás, An tÚdarás will, in fact, employ the individuals and the Minister will not interfere in any way with them.  I visualise An tÚdarás sending proposals to the Minister as to the categories and numbers they deem necessary and once these categories and numbers are decided then it becomes a matter for settling remuneration. After that the appointments will be made and An tÚdarás will have full autonomy in making these appointments. This basically is the really important matter.</P>

      <P>They are exempt from that requirement?  Deputy Tunney suggested that in choosing examples of messengers and doorkeepers I was in some way reflecting on these people. <Col N="194" /> I do not think he could have been here when we first began to talk about them because the way they came in was in relation to the fact that it had been suggested that the people appointed were of such seniority that they could look after themselves.  Deputy Thornley suggested this and I pointed out that the section applies to the servants as well as to the officers and they included people who would not be able to look after themselves.  I suggested to Fianna Fáil and to Labour, without apparently any effect, that the function of Parliament is to ensure the protection of people like that against possible exploitation.  I cannot see how Deputy Tunney could think that such a point of view on my part, even if he does not share it and shares with Deputy Thornley the view that exploitation does not matter in these cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be interested to hear the Deputy on section 15. Deputy Tunney also said that there must be some questioning of these bodies and the way they carried out their functions.  He must not have listened to what I said.  Of course there must be some questioning and I emphasised that.  They must, in so far as they depend on State funds, submit their requirement each year, state why they need the money, have that money approved or partially disapproved if the Minister thinks the money is not needed, and if the board are not behaving themselves or are extravagant they should be sacked.  I do not know what more questioning he wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither he nor the Minister answered the basic point that there are not precedents for this.  The only precedent adduced so far significantly comes from the same Department.  As far as I can recall there has not been any legislation from that Department between <Col N="195" /> 1940 and today except for a Bill last year covering two particular points, one in relation to vocational education or both perhaps in relation to it.  It is significant that after a 31 years gestation period the next Bill they produce is also unique in containing these provisions and this Department's determination to retain tight control over any educational body in respect of which it legislates at intervals of a generation or so contains these provisions but that the other Departments of State also concerned with autonomous bodies, entirely dependent on State funds, do not feel it necessary to introduce similar provisions.  I think we have here unearthed something highly significant.  I find the attitude on the other side of the House deeply disturbing. I hope, though it is late in the evening, that Deputy Tunney's remarks will be given full prominence in the press tomorrow.  I hope the Fianna Fáil view of centralised ministerial control of every detail, especially in the sphere of education, will be blazoned forth and that everyone in the Irish educational sector will know explicitly the point of view held by Fianna Fáil on this matter.</P>
    <P>When I heard that view put forward by someone whose views I always listened to with interest and respect it made me realise clearly why I was on this side of the House.  It made me more anxious than ever before to get to the other side of the House and thus be in a position to do something about this appalling centralisation of control. The bureaucrats and Fianna Fáil Ministers wish to have control of every detail of administration and to prevent autonomy in any kind of body.  This is more marked in some Departments than in others.  We have seen in the only example of legislation we have had from this Department how this feature has intruded.  In this area above all it is objectionable.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Tunney has missed my remarks which were directed very much at him.  I would repeat to him that I advocated that the press should publish his remarks fully tomorrow so that all will know the view of Fianna Fáil on this subject.</P>

      <P>Sometimes I do, and often I do not.  However, I can claim to be speaking for the whole spirit of Fine gael in the point of view I am putting forward tonight.  We believe in the devolution of authority. We are against centralised control.  We believe there are modern methods of budgetary control that give adequate control over subordinate bodies without it being necessary for Ministers to interfere in individual appointments.</P>

      <P>Occasionally we all express our individual views.  We make it explicit that we are so doing; in public and on other occasions we make it clear when we are speaking for the party and I am always careful to do so.</P>
      <P>It is interesting and valuable to have the Fianna Fáil view stated so explicitly but it is very disturbing that this point of view should be held on the subject of education.  When I heard Deputy Tunney who has been involved in vocational education not merely accepting the lack of autonomy in that area but exalting it, my mind boggled. All the people whom I know in the vocational education sector are frustrated by the fact that they have not got even the kind of autonomy that exists in the secondary education sector. Every move they make in the vocational schools must be approved by the Department and this lack of autonomy is the greatest bugbear in vocational education.  I have not met any teacher or administrator in this sector who has not complained to me about this matter.  Although Deputy Tunney is involved in vocational education, he does not appear to share this view and I do not understand this.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy read some of my speeches on education or read the Fine Gael policy on education he would find this viewpoint expressed explicitly.  Our concern to secure autonomy in the educational sector and to give the institutions full freedom within the general overall control of the capital budget and the current budgetary conditions is the thread that runs through the entire Fine Gael policy.  We believe that the educational system should be in the hands of educators, that examinations and curricula should be determined by educators&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is relevant to the section before the House.  I am entitled to express the general philosophy of my party in regard to education when it is so explicitly contradicted by the provisions of this section.  I have been challenged by Deputy Tunney on the matter and I consider I am entitled to speak briefly and to the point on the subject.</P>
      <P>This section offends against the basic principles of good administration and of good educational practice which require that in the delicate sphere of education the role of the State should be that of providing facilities, ensuring standards and co-ordinating to avoid waste of finance in an area which is highly expensive.  It is not the function of the State to interfere in matters of detail.  That it should be in this section that the Government Department concerned should insist on tight control over individual appointments and terms and conditions of remuneration is something I cannot accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that in section 14 (1) the words used mean &ldquo;categories and numbers&rdquo;.  In view of the fact that it is quite obvious from Deputy O'Donovan's citations where the inspiration for this section comes from, and in view of the fact that in respect of the other matters the wording runs closely parallel to that in the Bill for the Institute of Advanced Studies.  I should like to ask the Minister how he explains the change in the phraseology in <Col N="198" /> respect of subsection (1).  As he heard from Deputy O'Donovan, in respect of that subsection the wording in the Bill relating to the Institute of Advanced Studies explicitly makes it clear that what is involved are categories and numbers of staff.  However, someone in his Department in going over that decided it was not good enough and, while accepting the phraseology in the Bill almost word for word in respect of other matters such as remuneration and conditions of appointment, they changed the wording here to get rid of categories and numbers and introduced this vague phraseology of so many persons.  Perhaps the Minister may not have been aware of this; the staff may not have brought his attention to the change in phraseology.  Now that he knows they have changed it and modified it to get rid of categories and numbers, perhaps the Minister would look into the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

If I hear the words &ldquo;autonomy&rdquo; again in this debate I think I will commit hara-kiri in public In every intervention by the Department on this subject Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy O'Donovan appear to see the shadow of bureaucracy.  Twenty years ago we had a Department of Education that did nothing and we screamed murder that it should do something.  Now that the Department are doing something we are all screaming that it is bureaucratic.  I think this is quite ridiculous.</P>
      <P>While I accept the sincerity of Deputy FitzGerald's involvement with the level of porter or doorkeeper employment in such an authority as this, to suggest that the Labour Party lack interest in such a person is very unfair and untrue.  As spokesman of a party affiliated to the major body of the trade union movement, I can assure Deputy FitzGerald we will do our utmost to protect the terms and conditions of porters.  I fail to see how their conditions are in any way improved by deleting reference to the Minister and leaving it entirely to the authority.</P>

      <P>The form referred to is prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners for use in applications for grants of probate or letters of administration, and becomes a public document in the Probate Office of the High Court on the issue of the grant.  It does not therefore seem appropriate to make provision for the insertion of reference numbers which are not strictly relevant to the ultimate function of the document.  However, I see no objection to the adoption of the Deputy's suggestion if it serves a useful purpose for applicants or their solicitors, and I have asked the Revenue Commissioners to bear it in mind when this and similar forms are being reprinted.</P>
