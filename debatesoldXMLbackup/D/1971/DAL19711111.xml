    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress on Thursday last I was dealing with some of the points raised in the course of the debate.  I dealt, I think, with most of the major matters raised in relation to the Estimates.  Many speakers referred to the scheme relating to deserted wives and quite a few expressed the hope that the Minister would look into the question of the age limit in the case of deserted wives with dependants.</P>
      <P>When the Bill was going through the House I pointed out that the age limit of 50 was not sacrosanct as far as I was concerned and, if it is thought that it is too high, I will be prepared to bring it down.  The scheme is under review at the moment.  The scheme came into effect in October of last year and the review now taking place may reveal that certain changes are necessary for the purpose of greater latitude. It is not a scheme easy to administer since the essential information is difficult to procure and one cannot always accept just any kind of evidence.  A great deal of latitude has been exercised so far in the operation of the scheme but I will be prepared to go as far as possible towards further relaxation of the regulations should this make it easier for genuine cases to benefit. Amending legislation may be necessary as a result of the review&mdash;possibly amending regulations will suffice&mdash;in order to make the necessary changes. This I will gladly consider in the New Year.  The scheme has been welcomed by those who benefit under it.  The same means test is applied as in the case of widows' pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the arguments advanced during the debate was that increases <Col N="1819" /> in social welfare were eroded by rising prices.  Deputies made this assertion apparently without regard to what the actual figures are.  I have had the figures taken out over two important periods.  From August, 1969, to August, 1971, the increase in social welfare expenditure amounted to 39 per cent and the increase in the cost of living over the same period was 18 per cent. From 1957 to 1971&mdash;these are significant figures&mdash;the increase in social welfare expenditure was 298 per cent and the increase in the cost of living over the same period was 80 per cent, admittedly a steep rise but nothing like the significant rise in social welfare benefits over the same period.</P>
    <P>In that 298 per cent lies the whole story of the progress made in social welfare.  I doubt if any other country could show the same steep rise.  We are rapidly moving towards the point at which we hope to achieve parity with those countries with which adverse comparisons are made.  I have dealt with the comparison with the EEC countries, so far as it is possible to do that, and I have pointed out that harmonisation of social welfare codes will not necessarily mean that we will have to change anything in our scheme.  The code we have is acceptable. It is comprehensive.  That is not to say that the Government are satisfied we should now call a halt to the progress we have been making.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I visualise acceleration in the years immediately ahead of the progress indicated in the figures I have given for the period from 1957 to 1971 when we had a 298 per cent rise.  I must insist, as Minister for Social Welfare, as far as lies in my power, that any increased cost as a result of membership of the EEC&mdash; many assert that this is inevitable&mdash; must be countered by bringing our social welfare figures up to maintain the weaker sections in relative security. I hope membership will enable us to do that and generally improve our rates as well as the scope of the schemes we have been operating.  I shall deal with comprehensive reforms of the scheme later on.</P>
    <P>Complaints were made about the difficulty of contacting the Department <Col N="1820" /> by telephone.  Since a section of the Department moved to Phibsboro' we got new numbers and these have been published in the daily newspapers in conspicuous positions.  When the available telephone facilities were found inadequate the Department of Posts and Telegraphs installed extra lines.  As I said in the debate this only indicates how busy the Department is and the big number of calls being made.  This is understandable when dealing with thousands of people daily.</P>
    <P>Somebody suggested the Department should be known as the Department of Social Security.  That could easily be done without legislation under the Ministers and Secretaries Act by making an Order.  The Department of External Affairs recently changed its name to the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I am not sure that there will be any great demand for a change of name but if there was good reason to change, it would be a very simple matter and could easily be done.</P>
    <P>I have already pointed out the scope of social welfare in this country in so far as it gives cover from the cradle to the grave.  At the same time we had the usual demands from the Opposition that a new social welfare code should be produced.  This demand is repeated each year.  As Deputies must be aware we are at present engaged in a review in depth of the whole social welfare system with a view to making improvements.  There is no real need for a new code.  I gave a litany of the benefits and the persons covered and listed those benefiting under assistance schemes as well as under social insurance schemes.  This is a fairly comprehensive list which would all be embodied in any comprehensive social welfare code.  Asking for a new code would imply that there was not sufficient cover given under the present code and that would be completely untrue.  There are some weak spots but these are very few and, naturally, they will be included in the improvements&mdash;I hope.</P>
    <P>In recent times we have provided invalidity pensions, retirement pensions, death grants and deserted wives' allowances and extended to old age pensioners care by female relatives. <Col N="1821" /> These were some additions to the code which is being filled in by bringing in such benefits rather than by introducing a new code.  Looking over the code and comparing it with those operating in other countries I find no need for a new code but a section of my Department is at present engaged on and will, I hope produce some positive scheme in the near future in relation to the payments on the assistance side.</P>
    <P>The need for this became very obvious with the reintroduction of the Employment Period Orders last year.  I was very interested in the number of people appealing on behalf of those who were deprived of unemployment assistance as a result of the reintroduction of Employment Period Orders which had been a common feature of unemployment assistance schemes since they first came into operation in 1934.  I thought this was good because the appeals came mostly from people who never failed to sneer at the scheme and speak cynically about it; people who accused the Fianna Fáil Government, which was responsible for the scheme in the first instance, of using it for the purpose of ingratiating themselves with the electorate.  Because of the unanimous appeal we had for its restoration we gained, for the first time, acceptance of what is commonly known as &ldquo;the dole&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the examination of cases which were inconvenienced or suffered hardship as a result of the scheme one was forced to conclude that a total revision of that scheme was overdue.  In other words, we had been making payments under the guise of unemployment assistance to persons who, on a strict interpretation of the statutory regulations, were not entitled to that money but who were entitled to some welfare assistance.  One had to come to that conclusion after examining the scheme following the reintroduction of the Employment Period Order.  I found many people who could not qualify under the requirements of being capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work, and yet they were people who had been in receipt of unemployment assistance and could easily demonstrate <Col N="1822" /> that without it serious hardship would be caused.</P>
    <P>This is the type of people I wish to include in my new scheme but not necessarily under the heading of unemployment assistance.  The other part of the new scheme will deal with what is commonly known as &ldquo;home assistance&rdquo;, a term which is not very acceptable at present but which can be one of our most useful schemes.  It is particularly useful in that it can get benefit quickly to cases of hardship.</P>
    <P>I hope that when this scheme is nationalised and operated by local persons as it is at present it will be a most useful scheme in giving supplementary assistance to people who suffer undue privation for short or long periods and will mete out assistance to those who do not qualify for any of the other schemes operated by the Department.</P>
    <P>The other category which the Government have given me authority to have examined and which is now undergoing examination for presentation to the Government is the small farmer category.  Many of these people have long since come to look on their weekly payments as merely a supplement to their uneconomic holdings.  I am afraid very few people come to regard them as unemployment assistance cases, and, indeed, many of them do not relate these payments in any way to the unemployment position.  It was quite openly demonstrated when the Unemployment Period Order was brought in that any employment that could be provided would not meet the requirements of these people in regard to supplementing the income of their holdings at all.  Many of them were not prepared to take up work except on a rather temporary basis, perhaps during the winter months.  This is another category that must figure in the new scheme in that assistance is very definitely needed, but I am afraid, if we are to continue to call it unemployment assistance requiring the weekly certification of these people, we will be continuing to apply a scheme which is not appropriate to the section that needs the assistance at all.</P>
    <P>These are some of the matters that <Col N="1823" /> are under review and I would hope to have a scheme to present to the Government in the not far distant future. I believe it is one that will be welcomed by everybody.  That scheme must, of course, be directly associated with but does not necessarily involve an undertaking I have given the House before now that pay-related social insurance benefits will be brought in as soon as it would be possible to operate them.  This is something which will mean a rather important change and a considerable amount of extra work in the Department.  The insurable limit was raised recently from £1,200 to £1,600 and when that limit is abolished altogether and social insurance extended to other categories who do not come under the scheme at present, such as self-employed people, then with related benefits I think we will have embarked on a rather comprehensive scheme which will require a considerable amount of extra work in the Department.</P>
    <P>Recently when I went across to sign the reciprocal agreement in London we took the opportunity of bringing some of the officials over and we went up to Newcastle-on-Tyne with the very kind co-operation of the officials of the Social Security Department over there.  We were given a good insight into the working of the computer system there where over 10,000 people look after the claims of 26 million people on a computer system which operates quite efficiently.  This was of tremendous benefit to the officials of my Department.  We spent a few days examining the whole system with, I am very glad to say, the complete co-operation and assistance of the officials of the Department over there.  They could not have been more helpful and gave us every possible facility to study the computerised methods used in administering their scheme.  This is by way of preparing ourselves for the more comprehensive and completely extended work we will have when social insurance is extended to other categories and when the insurable limit is abolished and pay-related benefits introduced.  It will be absolutely essential to have automation, <Col N="1824" /> to have the computerised system in operation in order to carry out these schemes effectively.</P>
    <P>I should like if more members of the House would give serious consideration to the amount of work involved in the Department of Social Welfare.  It was for that reason that I gave a list of the huge numbers for which the Department have to cater daily, weekly, monthly, round the year. Inevitable delays occur from time to time when it is not possible to get the necessary information and I should like if some members of the House particularly would not make capital out of these delays.  I was very pleased with those Deputies who paid tribute to the courtesy and efficiency of the officials.  Sometimes the attacks that are made on the Department would lead one to believe that for some reason or other it is less efficient than any other Department.</P>
    <P>I am deeply concerned about the elimination of avoidable delays and we have recently gone to the trouble of appointing some extra officers in exchanges throughout the country for the purpose of giving information to people at these employment exchanges. We have appointed quite a number of officers already for that purpose alone and I hope that more will be appointed in future so that, at these different points where employment exchanges are established, there will be people to give anybody who seeks it the necessary information.</P>
    <P>I wish that many of those seeking benefits and finding difficulty in getting the necessary attention would go and discuss the matter with the managers of the exchanges or, in cases where we have these officers appointed, with them rather than writing letters to the newspaper.  It is quite understandable that newspapers have all sorts of gimmicks to increase their readership and maintain their circulation.  One of their most important gimmicks is that they have somebody purporting to give a service on different matters.  You write in to Angela MacNamara if you want to know what is going to happen in your romantic life.  This is an understandable thing for the increasing of their readership.  When the Department <Col N="1825" /> of Social Welfare are being lashed by these people who purport to give a service I should like to point out that when these cases are brought to my attention almost unfailingly they are cases where the people cannot succeed in getting benefit anyway.  It is as simple as this: if one requires 156 stamps to qualify for something and one has only 155 one just does not.</P>
    <P>One has a grouse about it and one writes to the press saying that it took the Department months to find it out. Officials go to every possible extreme before a person is rejected to see if, as a result of illness which was not certified at the time or as the result of an employer who failed to stamp, that person may qualify.  If it is a marginal case the person concerned is quite sour and annoyed.  We shall, for all time, have these complaints irrespective of which Minister is administering the Department of Social Welfare, but that is not to say that we do not do everything possible to eliminate the avoidable delays or errors that might occur.</P>
    <P>I want to finish with a reference to the question of failure to stamp cards. Some Deputies spoke as if we had done nothing about this.  Failure to stamp cards has been a sore point for many years but we have taken the necessary steps through regulations in the last Social Welfare Act to eliminate the cause for complaint where people have failed to pay the necessary contributions for an employee or employees. Where we can show that there has been no collusion between an employer and an employee and where failure to stamp has occurred to the extent that it deprives the employee of the benefits to which he might be entitled the Department have power to credit the contributor in question with the necessary contributions.  That should put an end for all time to the complaints about our not taking proper action against persons who fail to stamp their employees' cards.</P>
    <P>In that respect I would like to say that quite frequently we prosecute employers who do not stamp cards.  In most of the cases when prosecution is pending Deputies from different sides of the House come to me asking <Col N="1826" /> that the case should be adjourned or deferred until the person has a chance to pay up.  We exercise the greatest possible leniency with regard to prosecution if they show signs of paying up. In many cases prosecution is the only way.  We have to be seen to be concerned about this and for that reason quite a number of prosecutions take place and quite a number of fines are imposed each year.  It has been necessary for the Department to have a stricter watch over this matter, since the Department now has the right to credit the contributions.  We consequently suffer the loss and for that reason it is necessary that we keep a careful watch on the stamping of cards for employees.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the points raised and I do not think it is necessary to delay the House any further other than to say that, in spite of some criticism, we are very grateful to those Deputies who have given co-operation, who have shown an understanding for the problems involved and who have been helpful in the role of an ombudsman in securing the necessary assistance and co-operation in the operation and administration of the many schemes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We are for ever grateful to and conscious of the great work that the voluntary organisations do particularly in the geriatric field.  I have time and again stressed the value of these voluntary local organisations which are operating in co-operation with us in many cases in local schemes for the assistance of the aged or other weaker sections.  We regard these voluntary organisations as being necessary at all times irrespective of what standard we may bring our welfare payments to because they are doing a type of work which no Department could possibly do due to their local contacts and intimate knowledge of the cases concerned. No compliment I could pay would be too great about the worthy causes that are pursued and the work done by these people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The important progress, as revealed by the figures I have given in reply to this debate, will be continued and accelerated in the years immediately ahead.  One has only to look at the rate <Col N="1827" /> of progress to appreciate that the day is not far distant when we will not be adversely compared with any of our neighbouring States in the matter of social welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question relative to the extension of that part of the County Cork area which is within the 12 western counties for the purposes of qualifying for unemployment assistance on a land valuation basis.  The Minister appreciates that not more than 50 per cent of that part of the county which is deemed to be within the 12 western counties is included.  I would ask the Minister to deal with that question expeditiously.</P>
      <P>I have submitted a map to his Department indicating the areas concerned.  When is a decision likely to be made on my representations?  It is completely unfair to a section of the people of South West Cork Constituency who are entitled to the same kind of facilities if they qualify for this assistance, as are obtainable by those people living in the remainder of the 12 western counties</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £28,823,000 (Twenty-eight million, eight hundred and twenty-three thousand pounds) be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st March, 1972 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>In the Book of Estimates the net Estimate of £28,823,000 for the year 1971-72 compares with a sum of £23,805,000 granted in 1970-71 (including a Supplementary Estimate of £250,000).  The principal increase arising in the financial year 1971-72 is the increase of £4.5 million in the provision for capital expenditure for the Industrial Development Authority.  Other increased provisions are: £174,000 for Córas Tráchtála; £106,000 for the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards; £101,000 for the salaries and wages of the staff of my Department; £83,000 for Shannon Free Airport Development Company, Ltd. to cover administration, etc. (£49,000), housing subsidies (£21,000) and housing grants (£13,000).  There is an increase of £75,000 in the provision for administration and general expenses of the Industrial Development Authority and £54,000 for technical assistance. The provision for the payment of interest subsidy to Shipping Finance Corporation Limited shows an increase of £39,000.  Increases in other subheads, after taking into account savings used in the Supplementary Estimate for £250,000 passed by this House in March last, amount to £42,655.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a decrease of £64,000 in the provision for shipbuilding subsidy after <Col N="1829" /> taking into account £36,000 included in the Supplementary Estimate to which I have already referred.  There is no provision this year for Castlecomer Collieries Ltd. for which £57,000 was voted last year bringing decreases to £121,000 to which must be added greater appropriations-in-aid of £35,745. The total decrease is therefore £156,655.  The net increase in the Estimate is £5,018,000.</P>
    <P>The performance of the industrial sector was the main determinant of overall economic growth in 1970.  The low increase of 3 per cent in industrial output resulted in the slow growth of total national output in 1970.  Employment in transportable goods industries in 1970 rose at a slower rate than in the previous year.  The total number employed increased by 3,600&mdash;1¾ per cent&mdash;in the full year.  This pattern has continued for the first six months of 1971 when the increase in employment in the transportable goods industries has been 1,900.</P>
    <P>Industrial exports have continued to grow in 1970&mdash;the increase over 1969 being of the order of 18 per cent and at the same time constituting 53 per cent of total exports.  The Government recognise that our economic growth for 1971 will be below the potential growth rate of the economy and are particularly conscious of the problem of redundancy to which I shall refer later.  In order to provide a stimulus to economic activity and to encourage business confidence the Government have announced a reduction in the level of company taxation and have also made available an additional £6 million to the Industrial Development Authority and £500,000 to the Shannon Free Airport Development Co.</P>
    <P>The Government propose to publish a White Paper shortly setting out the terms negotiated for our accession to the European Communities and the whole matter will be fully debated in this House.  I feel that it would be inopportune for me here today to go into detail on this question but, on the other hand, it would be unrealistic to talk about my Department without at least referring briefly to the impact accession to the Communities will have. <Col N="1830" /> Our negotiations for membership have reached the final stages and we are, therefore, on the threshold of an historic era, which will have wide-ranging implications for all spheres of our industrial and commercial life. The overall benefits of membership of the European Communities will be both short-time and long-term, but a point to remember is that much will depend on our own ability to turn opportunities into achievements.  Our industrial base has widened considerably over the past decade; an indication of the progress made is that export industries now account for about one-third of total industrial output.  We have every reason to feel confident, therefore, that our accession to the Communities will help to accelerate further the widening of our industrial base.</P>
    <P>Some people have the idea that Ireland will be &ldquo;out of her depth&rdquo; in the European &ldquo;Big League&rdquo;.  To this I would argue that it is the small member States which have gained most from membership of the Communities. The benefits have not been limited to any one member of the Six; they have affected the entire Community, bringing about a great increase in economic and trading activity.  I can see no good reason why Ireland should not repeat the success of these smaller countries. It is natural, I suppose, that there should be some apprehension about our joining.  Human nature being what it is, there is always nervousness about change and a fear of what is new.  It must be remembered, however, that there were similar apprehensions in the present member States of the Communities. These fears, as we know, have been proved to have been groundless and the people of these countries are now glad that they did not heed the prophets of doom.</P>
    <P>The stage now reached in our negotiations for entry to the EEC brings into sharp relief the question of adaptation of Irish industry to conditions of free trade.  As Deputies are aware, adaptation is a process which has been proceeding for some years now.  The pace of adaptation is something that is sensitive to various factors, such as the conditions of trade, <Col N="1831" /> technological changes and finance.  It is not a matter of achieving a certain degree of fitness for a single big occasion. Rather is it a matter, through continuous endeavour, of striving to reach at least the same degree of fitness as our competitors are likely to have and from there on, matching every improvement that they make.  For that reason, it is difficult at any given time to be specific about the adequacy of our efforts at adaptation.  True, a great deal of progress has been made over the past ten years in improving the productive efficiency of our manufacturing industry.  One has only to compare the figures for our industrial exports for 1970 with those for 1960 to realise this.</P>
    <P>But our industry will not be able to get by in the future on its past efforts at adaptation.  Indeed, these efforts will, if anything, have to be intensified. In so far as this may not already be apparent, we have been reminded of it by the reports which have been published in the course of the past year-and-a-half by the Committee on Industrial Progress.  The industrial sectors covered by these reports, including clothing, leather, paper and printing, fruit and vegetable processing and the metal trades, and by further reports which are in course of preparation can be said to cover a representative area of Irish industry and particularly its older and more traditional elements.</P>
    <P>The work of the Committee on Industrial Progress must be regarded as a further increment in the guidance and assistance which the State has provided for the adaptation of industry. In its case, the emphasis is on getting firms to think in terms of the products and markets that are likely to be most advantageous in the changing conditions of the 1970s.</P>
    <P>These reports contain a number of recommendations which are addressed to Government Departments and State agencies but, primarily, the message in the reports is one for industry itself and for organisations catering for industry. I hope the message will be taken seriously. <Col N="1832" /> There are many facets to adaptation, namely, re-equipment and modernisation; better management; improved technology and training; and greater attention to and sophistication in product policy and marketing.  In all of these areas the State can by various services and incentives do a certain amount to spur industry on but, in the last analysis, adaptation, or the progress of adaptation, can only be as effective as the people in industry are prepared to make it.</P>
    <P>Eight years ago when the Committee on Industrial Organisation was concluding its examination of Irish industry it saw the need for what it called &ldquo;a revolution in existing attitudes&rdquo;, if adaptation was to be fully effective.  I have already said that there have been considerable changes for the better since that time but the improvements can best be described as uneven and capable of being improved on. That this should be the case is, in my view, due primarily to our being insufficiently attuned mentally to pressing on with the necessary changes.  To some extent, this is attributable to a reluctance to face the fact that free trade has become a reality.  Fear of the unknown is something many people have and it cannot be denied that, as I have said earlier, there is an element of the unknown in moving into a larger trading area.  But fear of the unknown should be a spur to action rather than the reverse.</P>
    <P>Our attitude towards the approaching free trade should be neither defeatist nor complacent.  Membership of an enlarged EEC will certainly provide us with far greater opportunities than we would have if we were to remain outside the Community.  As I have said already the use we make of these opportunities depends on ourselves. We must face the future with a determination to prove that what other people have done successfully we also can do.</P>
    <P>The fact that the redundancies which have arisen during the past year are at a rate double that of 1970 and earlier years is a matter of the utmost concern to me and to the other members of the Government just as it is to the trade unions.  As Deputies may be aware, the <Col N="1833" /> Taoiseach, the Ministers for Finance and Labour and myself have had discussions on this very serious problem with representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions recently and further talks are to be held.  There are, however, a number of points in relation to redundancies which I think I should highlight at this stage.  Firstly, there tends to be an impression that redundancies arise largely, if not entirely, through the close down or curtailment of activity in manufacturing industry.  True, this is a major factor but almost half of the redundancies which have taken place in the past year have arisen in areas other than manufacture, that is agriculture, distribution, services, <i>et cetera.</i> I say this, not in any attempt to minimise the seriousness of the problem, but to put it in its proper perspective.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the impression seems to be widespread that the redundancies arising through closures in manufacturing industry were due primarily if not entirely to the removal of protection under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  I will not deny that the freeing of trade has been a factor in some of these closures but it is only one of the factors involved. Indeed, in some cases it has not been a factor at all.  For example, one of the sectors of manufacturing industry where the incidence of redundancy has been greatest this year has been the food industry which, as Deputies are aware, is exempt from the provisions of the Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
    <P>Other factors leading to redundancies have been product obsolescence; difficulties in external markets (a number of well publicised cases of closure earlier this year involved firms which were selling entirely in export markets); market depression externally and at home (this has affected the textile industry in particular); cost inflation; and management difficulties highlighted by more demanding trading conditions and by the incidence of free trade.</P>
    <P>In addition to the problems caused by redundancies I am seriously concerned at the incidence of short-time working which has seriously affected the textiles industry, particularly wool <Col N="1834" /> textiles, in the course of the past 12 months.  Wool textiles as an industry is notoriously subject to cyclical depressions and short-time working but, up to 1970, the industry in Ireland had, for more than a decade, been largely free of this difficulty.  However, the industry, world-wide, has recently been subjected to what is stated to be the worst depression for 40 years and this has affected most of the Irish mills in varying degrees.  The continuously growing competition from materials made from synthetic fibres and from materials made from processes other than weaving, does not help the situation.</P>
    <P>On top of this, there is the fact that excess capacity exists in this industry and, so far, efforts to induce the industry to rationalise its production have not succeeded.  One obstacle is the likelihood that no such rationalisation could be achieved without the closure of some mills.  Unpalatable though this may be in particular cases. I am afraid that it must be faced.  If not, there is a danger that mills, which might otherwise be viable, would be forced out of business along with weaker and less efficient units.</P>
    <P>The argument has been put to me that the answer to the problems of redundancy, short-time working and increasing competition from imports which are at present besetting the textile and other industries, should be dealt with by recourse to some form of protective measures.  People who advocate this course seem to me to want to have a type of arrangement in which we have complete freedom as regards the outward movement of our exports but can restrict readily the inward flow of imports from the very countries to which we export.  This, of course, is not realistic.</P>
    <P>Regardless of free trade, however, we cannot expect Irish industry to remain immune from the factors I have already mentioned such as changes in technology, the obsolescence of existing products, and the development of new ones; changes in fashions; and the general tendency for industry to become more capital-intensive.  The recently-published reorganisation plans <Col N="1835" /> of one of our largest manufacturing enterprises is a very striking illustration of this.</P>
    <P>Last year I mentioned the reorganisation of the Industrial Development Authority and the new functions which had been assigned to it under the Industrial Development Act, 1969.  The Authority have completed their reorganisation and are now a most sophisticated body, geared to tackle the very difficult task of the development of the industrial sector of our economy.  They have set up a new Regions Division which is in the process of completing draft regional plans that will be used as a guide for the regional development of industry over the next five years.  Their Research and Planning Division has prepared the framework for assessing future patterns of industrial development and, through their overseas offices and their New Industries, Promotions and Research Planning Divisions, it has been enabled to adopt a more selective approach to the attraction of industries from abroad.  The new IDA, with their special brand of expertise, can be expected to operate on equal terms with our competitors abroad for the attraction of industries to our country.</P>
    <P>This is not an easy matter but with our attractive package of incentives we should be able to match the success of previous years.  I should perhaps mention, as an instance of the pace of development, that last year the IDA operated with a capital allocation of £18½ million, and during the current year the initial allocation of £23 million is, as already mentioned, being increased to bring the figure up to £29 million.</P>
    <P>In the year ended 31st March, 1971, grants amounting to about £24 million were approved in respect of 78 projects.  These figures include grants totalling £7½ million for projects in the designated areas and grants totalling £16½ million for the non-designated areas.  Grants amounting to about £94 million for a total of 847 projects have been approved since the grants scheme was started.  The total investment <Col N="1836" /> involved in these 847 projects is estimated at over £300 million and the estimated employment potential is 75,800 workers.  Of the total of £94 million £32½ million was for designated areas.  The total amount actually paid out to date for designated and non-designated areas is £44 million.</P>
    <P>The small industries programme, which now covers the country as a whole, continues to make satisfactory progress.  During the year ended March, 1971, grants approved amounted to £1.2 million and involved an additional employment potential of 1,140 workers.  Since the commencement of the scheme in 1967, the number of grants approved was 593 totalling about £4 million up to March 31st, 1971 and involving additional employment for 7,400 workers.</P>
    <P>The re-equipment grants scheme which was introduced with effect from the 1st March, 1968, provided for grants of 35 per cent in the designated areas and 25 per cent in the remainder of the country towards the cost of fixed assets involved in plans for re-equipment, expansion or modernisation. Up to the 31st March, 1971, a total of 1,018 projects had been approved for grants, aggregating £10.9 million of which £3.7 million has been paid.  The total capital investment involved is estimated at £46 million.  In the year ended 31st March, 1971, 81 grants were approved for the designated areas at a total of £900,000 and in the non-designated areas 363 at a cost of £4.2 million.</P>
    <P>Work on the industrial estates at Galway and Waterford continued successfully during the past year. Since this scheme commenced, a total of 916,000 square feet of factory space has been constructed and at 31st March, 1971, 131,000 square feet of factory space was under construction. At the 31st March, 1971, there were 30 firms operating on the estates with a total of 1,123 workers employed.  At that date, a further three projects had been arranged for siting on the estates giving employment at full production to 283 workers.</P>
    <P>A panel of consultants was set up to advise on the implementation of the advance factory programme of the <Col N="1837" /> IDA and a team was appointed to prepare factory plans.  The Authority are in the course of finalising a comprehensive programme of advance factories for various areas throughout the country and meantime they have announced an interim programme for the provision of advance factories in about 30 different locations.  This programme of advance factories is intended to form part of the overall regional plans for industrial development of the IDA.</P>
    <P>Under section 17 (3) of the Industrial Development Act, 1969, an aggregate amount not exceeding £100 million may be provided from the Exchequer to enable the Industrial Development Authority to perform their functions, including those taken over from An Foras Tionscal.  At the 31st March, 1971 the aggregate amount so provided was £70,225,446.</P>
    <P>Total capital expenditure to 31st March, 1971, on the development of the industrial estates was £4.58 million. The Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd., under its new mandate, continues to administer the affairs of the mid-west region, which involves Clare/Limerick/North Tipperary, as well as the affairs of the industrial estate.  They are going ahead with the provision of advance factories in preparation for what it is hoped is a continued development of the operations in the area.  Admittedly there have been some closures and redundancies in the estate but the company are confident that this was due to a temporary recession&mdash;which is world-wide&mdash;and that, taking account of projects in the pipeline and others which they hope to attract to the estate, an improvement in the situation will come about within the next year or so.</P>
    <P>One of the State aids available to both manufacturing industry and the distributive trades is the technical assistance scheme.  It has, as its objective, the promotion of productive efficiency in industry and the increasing of efficiency in the distributive sector.  The need to review and adapt the systems and practices of these sectors continued over the past year with the progressive removal of tariff protection under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement <Col N="1838" /> and in the light of our expected membership of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>The technical assistance grants scheme is specifically designed to provide incentives to our industry to cope with present and future pressures. Groups in the distributive trades may also avail themselves of certain services where such services are sought on a collective basis.  In addition, grants are available under certain conditions towards the costs of visits abroad by representatives of management and of management and labour jointly.</P>
    <P>The Government have, under this scheme, endeavoured to meet their commitment to assist industry in its efforts to prepare for free trading conditions. Those firms in the sectors concerned which have faced up to their responsibilities in up-dating their business methods have had substantial financial assistance from my Department towards the cost of the productivity improvement schemes undertaken. This is evident from the fact that since the scheme commenced in 1957 the total amount of grants paid was approximately £2 million.  I am fully satisfied that the expenditure incurred both by the firms and the Government has proved to be a sound investment in helping energetic and forward looking companies to prepare to meet the challenge of the 70s.</P>
    <P>The Irish National Productivity Committee was initiated in 1959 by agreement between its constituent bodies and with the full support of the Government.  It has the special value of bringing together, at industry level, representatives of labour, management and education.  The active involvement of labour is important in encouraging industrial productivity.</P>
    <P>In the course of the past year, the Committee have achieved an expansion of the activities of its regional joint committees in their efforts at local level to stimulate firms' interest in the concept of productivity and in developing a climate designed to increase labour/management co-operation.  The Distributive Trade Productivity Committee, which is involved extensively in education, training and research was <Col N="1839" /> substantially assisted in its work by the INPC advisory service.  The Committee engaged in a number of projects, for example, the promotion of productivity ideas amongst students, and these efforts are expected to result in a wider knowledge of the concept and desirability of productivity.</P>
    <P>Certain differences of opinion arose in regard to the role of the committee over the past few years and, as a result, a firm of international consultants, versed in productivity matters was commissioned to carry out a survey of the operations of the INPC.  The consultants duly reported to the INPC with certain recommendations.  Only recently, the INPC submitted to me their views on the recommendations of the consultants and these matters are now under consideration in my Department.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out earlier one of the ways in which industry should prepare itself for the new conditions which lie ahead of it is by improving its technical efficiency.  In this technological age, it goes without saying that an industrial concern that is not technologically up-to-date cannot hope to survive.  While the main effort in this regard must come from industry itself, a vital role is played by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards. The Institute's annual report for 1970 shows that recourse by industry to its services is continuing to increase.</P>
    <P>In the current year, I am providing £948,000 by way of grant, an increase of £106,500 on the previous year's figure.  I am satisfied that the time has now come when substantial capital investment will be necessary to enable the expansion of the Institute to continue at the rate provided for in its first five year plan which was approved some years ago, and as envisaged by the Institute in the second five year plan which was put before me during the summer.  I have asked the National Science Council for its views on the plan, but, while I do not wish to anticipate their conclusions, I am aware that the Council agrees in general with the proposition that substantial further growth will be <Col N="1840" /> necessary.  I will have the whole question examined when I receive the National Science Council's report.</P>
    <P>In 1970, following the pattern established over the previous decade, total exports and exports of industrial goods continued their upward trend, reaching record figures.  Total exports amounted to almost £468 million. While exports as a whole increased by some 16 per cent, industrial exports showed an increase of 23 per cent over 1969.</P>
    <P>The rate of increase in industrial exports reflects further progress towards industrialisation, which is important because it is industrial goods which sell in more distant markets and which will help in attaining a more diversified export trade.  Over the decade, total exports showed a value increase of 207 per cent while industrial exports rose by almost 500 per cent.  As I mentioned earlier they now represent 53 per cent of total exports.</P>
    <P>Export growth in 1970 fell somewhat short of expectation, partly because conditions in the British market did not improve as much as had been hoped and also because of a decline in buoyancy or depressed trading conditions in other markets.  Nevertheless, there were increases in all sectors, and manufactured goods showed an increase of just over 20 per cent.  These goods are still the fastest growing category.  They amounted to £199.1 million, as against £165 million in 1969. There were increases, also, in exports to all the main markets, including USA, and the EEC countries.  Diversification of markets continued and, in 1970, about 37 per cent of all exports went to markets other than Britain.</P>
    <P>In the first half of 1971 all classes of manufactured exports continued to grow, showing an overall increase of about 25 per cent.  Exports to Britain in particular showed an upward movement, increasing by some 28 per cent. Provided that we can maintain competitiveness in cost, there is every reason to feel optimistic about the future, in Europe and in other export markets.</P>
    <P>Total domestic exports to Britain and Northern Ireland continued to increase <Col N="1841" /> in 1970 and a more favourable balance of trade is now evident.  Developments in both imports and exports are being kept under review.  In the context of free trade, of course, the effective answer to rising imports is an increase in exports, and this applies to trade with Britain as well as trade in general.</P>
    <P>Provisions exist within the Anglo-Irish Agreement for seeking remedial action in the case of any particular sector of industry which may be seriously threatened by increased imports resulting from the operation of the Agreement.  During the year ended in June last the review provided for in Article 1 of the Agreement to identify sectors of industry where particular difficulties may have been caused by the operation of the Agreement, was carried out.  Following discussions with the UK authorities interim arrangements for the modification of the rhythm of tariff reductions in the case of a number of products were put into effect.  Details have already been published and I need not repeat them here.  Discussions with the UK authorities aimed at reaching agreement on more long term measures to deal with the difficulties should be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>In 1970 Irish exports to the USA were valued at £60 million.  This was equivalent to 13 per cent of our total exports to all areas, with the result that the USA is now, after the UK, our next most important market.  In the circumstances the pressure by US industry for further restrictions on imports has continued to be a matter of concern for Irish exporters.</P>
    <P>In 1970 legislation restricting the importation of textiles, clothing and footwear into the USA was a serious possibility, which fortunately did not materialise.  However, so far this year quota restrictions have been imposed on the importation of stainless steel flatware and certain sugar and chocolate confectionery products.  The most serious development, however, for exporters to the USA has been the series of economic measures announced by President Nixon in August.  These include a 10 per cent import surcharge on all dutiable items not subject to US <Col N="1842" /> quantitative limitations.  The surcharge applies to about two-thirds of our exports to the USA and could seriously affect some at least of these.  In the circumstances it was decided to introduce more liberal conditions for the provision by Córas Tráchtála of travel incentive grants for the US market for exporters affected by the surcharge.</P>
    <P>In addition, Córas Tráchtála will keep in touch with exporters to the USA with a view to assisting them to overcome any problems they may meet with.  I understand that following the introduction of voluntary export controls by Japan and other suppliers to the US markets the US Government proposes to remove the surcharge on textiles; this is a welcome development. We are maintaining close contact with the US authorities in an effort to secure the most favourable possible arrangements for our sugar confectionery products under the new regime being introduced by the US.</P>
    <P>Trade agreements were concluded with Bulgaria and Rumania in 1970 and 1971 respectively and talks to review the operation of the trade agreement with Bulgaria are to take place shortly.  Talks about the development of trade have taken place between Ireland and the USSR, Poland and Czechoslovakia.  Further discussions regarding trade with these countries, including the question of possible trade agreements, will be arranged.</P>
    <P>During the past year Córas Tráchtála have continued to assist, financially and otherwise, an increasing number of exporters.  The operation of the special diversification measures which I have already mentioned has brought about a noticeable increase in overseas promotions.  In 1970, Córas Tráchtála dealt with well over 1,000 firms, a quarter of which participated in 25 co-operative promotional activities such as national pavilions, group showings, and so forth, some of which were held in Britain, North America and throughout Europe.  The business placed at these amounted to £2 million with a potential follow-up value of £6 million.  Comparable figures for 1969 show that almost 200 firms participated in 20 co-operative activities <Col N="1843" /> realising £1.5 million with a potential follow-up value of £4 million.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála are the Government agency responsible for development of industrial design and the promotion of design standards in Irish industry. Their design section provides a wide range of design services for industry, including incentive grants covering design consultancy and package design and design training, as well as consultancy, advisory and information services&mdash;such as the maintenance of a register of design consultants and a technical reference library.</P>
    <P>One of Córas Tráchtála's early steps in design development was the setting up of Kilkenny Design Workshops Ltd., as their subsidiary, to provide design and prototyping services chiefly for craft-based industries.  The Design Advisory Committee, which was set up on the initiative of Córas Tráchtála, has resulted in a further strengthening of liaison with industrialists and other bodies concerned in design development.  It is most advisable that exporters should make the utmost use of both these services. Many exporters, in this country particularly, must depend to a great extent for continued export success on the attraction of high-quality goods which can retain their place in world markets against competition from cheaper mass-produced articles.</P>
    <P>The Export Award Scheme was introduced in 1968 and has been continued on an annual basis since then.  The scheme is intended to give State recognition to successful effort in exporting.  The stress laid in the criteria on design, product development and adaptation, modern marketing methods and general enterprise further emphasises the importance of these factors from the point of view of export development.</P>
    <P>The Government have extended, for a further period until April, 1972, the operation of the Prices Stabilisation Order, 1965 under which I am empowered to investigate and control prices and charges.  Deputies will be aware that, last month, I established the National Prices Commission to <Col N="1844" /> keep under review prices and charges and to advise me in relation to all prices and charges.  The commission has, as its members, representatives of employers, traders, workers and consumers with an independent chairman. All proposals to increase prices will be submitted to the commission for consideration and the commission will furnish me with a recommendation on each such proposal.  In addition, the commission will furnish me with monthly reports on the cases and other matters dealt with by it, and I will publish these reports.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, I introduced, in July last, a Bill to extend the scope of the Prices Acts.  I hope to have the Bill circulated to Deputies in the near future.  This Bill will, in the main, extend the Prices Acts on the lines envisaged in the Prices and Incomes (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1970, and will cover such areas as new houses, professional services and insurance charges.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be interested to know that in the 12 months from October, 1970 to September, 1971, I indicated in a total of 339 cases that I would raise no objection to certain price increases to compensate for unavoidable cost increases.  The total of the cost increases claimed by all the applicants in these cases was roughly £49 million.  The total of allowable cost increases in these cases as computed by my Department, was about £33 million and the total of compensation given to the applicants by way of price increases was £32 million.  In this period of 12 months, therefore, the price increases conceded by me represented, on average, only 65 per cent of the cost increases claimed by applicants.</P>
    <P>With the advent of free trade I cannot over-emphasise the urgent necessity for management in all concerns to explore every possible prospect of increasing productivity, and to keep existing procedures under continuous review with a view to effecting progressive improvements towards this end.  I must also ask workers to lend their wholehearted co-operation to management's efforts in this regard, so as to enable the maximum amount of unavoidable cost <Col N="1845" /> increases to be absorbed and thus mitigate the effects of these cost increases on prices and on the cost of living.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised nowadays that the law must provide the consumer with certain additional forms of protection which, in modern conditions, he is no longer able to provide for himself.  There is, of course, already in existence a large body of law aimed at giving protection to the consumer&mdash;I may mention the Weights and Measures Acts, the Merchandise Marks Acts, the Sale of Goods Act, the Food and Drugs Acts, the Hire Purchase Acts and the Prices Acts amongst others.  New conditions require new measures, however, and my predecessor announced some time ago a programme of consumer protection which would be undertaken.  Progress has been made through the reactivation of the Merchandise Marks Commission and, in particular, with the passage last year of the Merchandise Marks Act, 1970, which provides for the marking of quantities on prepacked goods, a most necessary requirement today.  It is my intention to make a very comprehensive order under this Act, and consultations have taken place with a wide range of manufacturer, distributor and consumer interests on the details to be included.  I expect to be able to make the order shortly.  I have also made arrangements which should enable good progress to be made with other aspects of the programme in the time ahead.</P>
    <P>Last year I indicated that legislation to amend and consolidate the Restrictive Trade Practices Acts was in course of preparation.  The amending Bill was introduced in the Dáil by long and short Titles in July and I expect that the Second Stage will be taken during the current Dáil session. The Bill has two main features&mdash; extension of the scope of the legislation to services, including professional services, and the introduction of institutional changes, chiefly the creation of a special post, the holder of which will be given statutory powers to exercise the investigatory functions hitherto discharged by the Fair Trade <Col N="1846" /> Commission.  These changes will mean that the whole range of commercial activity, with a few exceptions for services already subject to separate legislation, will come within the purview of the commission.  In addition they will provide for more speed in the operation of the legislation and ensure that the commission can undertake inquiries with the appearance, as well as the reality, of complete detachment.</P>
    <P>I am preparing legislation to provide for the investigation and control of monopolies, take-overs and mergers. I feel that these powers should now be made available in present circumstances of ever increasing concentration through mergers and take-overs in manufacturing industry and distribution.  I recognise, of course, that the circumstances of Irish industry are such that some re-grouping of firms is necessary, and it is not my intention that the proposed legislation should inhibit such necessary restructuring of industry.</P>
    <P>The proposals I have in mind would enable me to make orders providing for the prohibition of a merger or take-over or, in the case of monopoly, completed take-over or merger, for the breaking-up of a business by a sale of assets or otherwise.  The criterion to be applied would be whether a monopoly, take-over or merger restricted competition in a manner contrary to the public interest.</P>
    <P>The distributive trades form a highly complex and fast changing sector of the economy.  The rapid growth of supermarkets and multiples in recent years has given rise to fears that the days of the small independent trader are numbered.  However, all the evidence points to the fact that efficiency is the key to survival and that the efficient trader has nothing to fear.  It will continue to be my policy to ensure that there will always be a place in the distributive sector for the efficient and competitive small and medium sized business.</P>
    <P>There has been an amount of discontent in the distributive sector, and particularly in the grocery trade, about a number of practices which have become common in recent years and <Col N="1847" /> which some traders consider are unfair or even anti-social.  The Fair Trade Commission has carried out a very painstaking inquiry during the year into conditions in the grocery trade, and I am awaiting its report, which, I feel, will be one of more than usual significance for Irish distribution. While I cannot, of course, come to any specific conclusions in advance of the commission's report, I may say in general that, where the report indicates that action needs to be taken, I shall be very ready to take such action as is open to me, specifically, of course, the making of an order.</P>
    <P>I have had the opportunity on a number of occasions during the year of meeting representatives of various branches of the distributive trades, and of the Federation of Trade Associations with its overall coverage.  I have made it my practice to try to keep before their minds that it is not only their national duty but their personal interest to &ldquo;Sell Irish&rdquo; wherever there is a suitable Irish made product available. I am glad to say that the majority of traders seem to appreciate the force of this truth but there are still some who do not or will not recognise it. The message is one which I must keep hammering home.</P>
    <P>The change-over to the metric system of measurement is making satisfactory progress in a number of sectors.  Quite a few of the main industries have done most of the work of changing over; for instance building, pharmaceuticals, flour milling and paper making.  Many others are well ahead with their arrangements.  There are still, however, a number of areas where there does not seem to have been much progress.  I am aware that some industries feel that the change-over can be effected with very little preparation as soon as trading conditions make it desirable and it is not at present my policy to dictate to industries how or when they should effect this change.  Accession to the EEC may, however, render it necessary to accelerate the change; meanwhile, industries should in their own interests, re-examine their position.  The prospects are that the metric system will be in general use in Britain within a few <Col N="1848" /> years.  The existing members of the EEC already use it.  A very high proportion of our trade will, therefore, be with countries that use metric measurements and it would be foolish for us not to follow suit.</P>
    <P>Problems may exist because of the close inter-relation between industries, and one sector may be held up because of lack of progress in another.  For this reason, a committee was set up under the Minister for Local Government and An Foras Forbartha to facilitate the introduction of metric measurements in the building and building supplies industries.  I have set up a committee to help with the problems of distributors and consumers and the officers of my Department help to smooth out liaison problems which may arise in other sectors.  I propose in the near future to introduce legislation to give legal validity to the national prototype standards for metric measurements.</P>
    <P>The volume of insurance business has continued to expand.  Total premium income increased from £40 million in 1965 to well over £60 million in 1970.  The increasing cost of claims in fire insurance and motor insurance and the high level of premiums in these sectors has been causing me considerable concern.  The Committee of Inquiry into the Insurance Industry, which was set up a little over a year ago, is pressing on urgently with its examination of motor insurance and has made considerable progress.  I understand that the report on motor insurance should be available within a matter of a few months.</P>
    <P>There is no slackening in interest in minerals exploration and development. Some 633 prospecting licences were current in mid-October, 1971, compared to about 650 at 31st December, 1970.  Exploration activity is now becoming intensive with companies concentrating on the detailed investigation of small areas rather than general surveying of larger areas. Some 383 applications for prospecting licences were received up to mid-October, 1971, compared to 367 in the whole of 1970.</P>
    <P>Total production of concentrates in <Col N="1849" /> 1970 at the lead/zinc/silver mines at Tynagh, County Galway and Silver-mines, County Tipperary and the copper/silver/mercury mine at Gortdrum, County Tipperary amounted to 374,540 tons and exceeded that of 1969.  Due mainly to a sharp decline in metal prices and to marketing difficulties experienced by one mine, the financial return was less than expected. Nevertheless, the value of exports of metal ores and concentrates in 1970 was £18.5 million compared to £17.3 million in 1969.  Production commenced in mid-November, 1970, at the re-opened copper/pyrites mine at Avoca, County Wicklow and the mine has commenced trading.  To supplement the underground source of ore, the operators have proposals to mine open-pit material from one area of the deposit.  Other discoveries, including a promising lead/zinc deposit at Nevinstown, County Meath, are still under detailed investigation.  The value of exports of barytes rose from £929,710 in 1969 to £1,122,000 in 1970.</P>
    <P>There is considerable interest in petroleum exploration and development in the country's area of continental shelf.  Under the terms of the 1959 Oil Agreement, as amended, Marathon Petroleum Ireland Ltd. hold exclusive petroleum exploration and development rights in three offshore areas.  Following completion of detailed seismic surveys, the company were granted petroleum leases in 1970 in respect of areas off the coasts of Cork and Waterford.  The company has drilled three test wells in these areas.  As the Deputies are aware, Marathon has announced that the latest drilling about 28 miles from the Old Head of Kinsale has revealed apparently significant results from an initial test of a gas zone and that further testing will be required to properly evaluate the well's potential. While considerable further exploration will be necessary before it can be established that there is in this area a gas field capable of commercial exploitation, this is encouraging news and if a commercial gas field is proved it should be of great benefit to our economy.</P>
    <P>Non-exclusive petroleum prospecting <Col N="1850" /> licences for general surveying of the balance of our designated shelf area are about to be granted to 16 companies.  Re-organisation and expansion of the Geological Survey to meet the present and future needs of mineral development in this country are proceeding.</P>
    <P>The sum provided in the Estimates under the head of shipbuilding subsidies for the year 1971-72 is £150,000. This is a continuation of policy which has existed since the establishment of Verolme Cork Dockyard.  The total subsidy payments which have been made since the inception of this scheme up to 31st March, 1971, is £1.5 million.  The subsidisation of shipbuilding is a general practice throughout the world and the present level of subsidy here is less than that obtaining in many countries where shipbuilding is a major and long-established industry.  The employment given at Verolme Cork Dockyard is substantial and the building of new ships is the main factor in maintaining this.  The shipbuilding facilities at Cork are at present fully employed.</P>
    <P>Shipping Finance Corporation, a subsidiary of the Industrial Credit Company, has for a number of years been making loans at low interest rates to shipping companies to finance the purchase of new vessels from Irish shipyards.  It is necessary to recoup the Shipping Finance Corporation to the extent of the difference between the rate charged on these loans and their borrowing rate plus something for out-of-pocket expenses and to build up a reserve.  A provision of £100,000 for interest subsidy is made in this year's estimate.</P>
    <P>The past year has been one of mixed fortunes for Irish industry.  On the one hand, our rate of growth has slowed up in line with what has been happening in other countries around the globe and redundancies have increased in number.  On the other hand, if the rate of growth is not quite as fast as before, industry is continuing to grow and there are signs that the rate is accelerating once more.  A particularly bright spot has been the growth in industrial exports.  There can be no <Col N="1851" /> doubt that the end of the year will show a substantial net increase in the numbers employed in industry and distribution.</P>
    <P>In this speech I have outlined the principal ways in which I am helping, through my Department and the various bodies under its aegis, to speed up development.  I have already indicated that it is intended to make additional money available during the year for industrial development.  I shall be presenting a Supplementary Estimate in due course for this purpose, but meanwhile I commend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>I do this not by way of complaint about the amount of money provided for the expansion and encouragement of industry but because the Government have not succeeded in providing the number of new jobs necessary if we are to halt emigration and proceed along the lines indicated in the <i>Third Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> Failure by the Government must be referred to on these benches.  I shall give evidence now of failure but, before I do so, I should like to say that there is something else which is militating against progress.  People's faith in this country as a base for future new industry has been badly shaken by the behaviour of this Cabinet, certain members of it, in the last two years.  We do not know the number of decisions taken by boards or by individual industrialists all over the world not to come to Ireland, and that at a time when there was the prospect of membership of the Common Market ahead, the progression of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and, concomitant with that, the opportunity to manufacture goods here and get them into larger export markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These decisions have been made that these people will not come here for the very good reason that they do not regard it as a very safe bet.  That is something that has little to do with the day-to-day work of the Minister, <Col N="1852" /> but it is entirely relevant to the expansion and development of new industries and something that must be mentioned at the very outset by anybody speaking here on these benches.  It is a sad business and its full effects will not be felt this year but over the next decade.</P>
    <P>The industrialist who now sees the Common Market countries&mdash;now moving towards a membership of ten&mdash;as a very big market must decide where to make his products within that market so as to avoid the common external tariff.  The behaviour of the Government, or some of its members, in the last two years has meant that Ireland has not been made very attractive as a place to operate.  It is sad, but that is so.  It is one of the horrible things we must face.  People will not come to a place where there is danger of government instability.  If one were to think of a place in Europe where, to the outside observer, there is every evidence of government and national instability, I am sorry to say this is the country.  Boards of companies have responsibility to their shareholders and the worthwhile companies are largely publicly owned and have responsibilities also to their own reputations.  They will not come here as things are at present.</P>
    <P>That is a general statement on the expansion of industry and it was not mentioned by the Minister.  I would not blame him for not mentioning it but it is a major factor in the slowing down that is taking place and which the Minister mentioned in the concluding part of his speech&mdash;he spoke of it as a slowing down in line with other countries.  The factor I have mentioned and the cost factor are the two major factors in this slowing down. These are the things that make people decide not to come here.  In my view, the grants offered are most attractive and the work done by the IDA, the Industrial Credit Company and the work now being done by various regional development organisations is good work which should bear fruit. It is, at least, inhibited by the cost factor and the sad factor of political instability which is directly related, in this part of the country I am sorry to <Col N="1853" /> say, to the behaviour of members of the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>We must accept, first, that the new jobs needed to replace jobs being wiped out in agriculture by modernisation must come largely from new industry.  I quote from the first paragraph of the IDA report:</P>
    <P>The principal generator of economic growth in Ireland in future years will be investment in new and expanding export-based manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>They believe that and they are quite right.  On Page 13 of that report you find:</P>
    <P>The gross number of new jobs created in manufacturing industry in 1970 was approximately 5,350 of which 5,237 derived from start-ups of IDA grant-aided industries. Redundancies in industry amounted to an estimated 1,800 so that the net increase in manufacturing employment was 3,500 or 1.8 per cent on the record level of manufacturing employment of 193,200 in 1969.</P>
    <P>The position is that we provided only that number of new jobs last year.  We had 1,800 redundancies and the expected redundancies this year, which is also included in this report, is 3,500.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that there is a slowing down to the same level as other nations.  I have mentioned the first reason for that; I now come to the second.  I refer the Minister to something he did not mention.  On page 12 of the IDA report are shown the wage cost trends in manufacturing industry from 1963 to 1970.  Ireland is at the top of the league table.  Our unit wage cost increased from base 100 in 1963 to 144 as compared with Italy, 116; France, 108&mdash;they have corrected themselves considerably&mdash;USA, 112; the United Kingdom, 129.  We are at the top of the league table not as regards paying wages but as regards unit wage costs.  The article we exported in 1963 is costing 44 per cent more now than it did then.  These are the things that industrialists considering coming here will look at.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be a &ldquo;Weary Willie&rdquo; and spend the time this morning <Col N="1854" /> repeating that things are bad but these are facts we must face and facts, in my view, entirely within the control of the Government.  First, the Government failed absolutely during that period to achieve any agreement between trade unions and employers on a fair wage rate and a proper prices and incomes policy.  I am aware that there is an agreement on the £2 increase and that some degree of stability has been attained, but it was the Government's job to sell to both sides the idea that, if on the one side the employees could live a little better individually, and, if at the same time we had goods to export that cost a little less, that was the best situation possible for this country.</P>
    <P>Decades of Fianna Fáil rule have seen to it that we are perhaps a decade away from that desirable position no matter how hard we now try.  The best possible position would be if a man in industrial employment rearing his family here was earning for the same work a few pounds less per week than his counterpart in Europe or in Britain but, on that few pounds less, could live a little better, be a little happier and have a little more real money to spend.</P>
    <P>I have said something there which is perhaps politically quite dangerous, something that could be taken out of context at election time, but that is the situation that should exist and which would exist if the Government, over the years, apart from other activities to which I have referred and which have real relevance to our industrial problems today, had not been prepared at all times to settle things to suit themselves politically.</P>
    <P>Elections, by-elections and crises will come.  Modern life just happens to be that way.  Fianna Fáil's answer during that entire period from 1963 to 1970 and before it, was that politics came before people, that, if it was necessary for them to remain in office, there was an inordinate wage increase.  Then a few prods were given here and a few prods were given there.  The salaries in semi-State companies and various other places went up.  Naturally in line with those increases the trade union organisation demanded, quite properly so, <Col N="1855" /> that in ordinary manufacturing industry there would be a parallel and there was a parallel.  This was not the prices and incomes policy that Britain, for instance, had been talking about for so many years.</P>
    <P>If we go back to the time of the Right Hon.  Barbara Castle, who was the great speaker there on a prices and incomes policy, and while they are second in the league of unit costs over the period 1963-1970, it is true that her particular words on the matter are still correct, that, to be beneficial, a proper prices and incomes policy does not have to be 100 per cent successful.  In other words, if you can get even a part of the way towards a realisation by workers, by management and by government that there is a wage that can be paid, that there is a comfortable living that can be enjoyed, and that any excess over and above that will result, probably in the short run but most certainly in the long run, in a falling off in industrial production in a situation whereby exports will become more difficult, a situation whereby a Minister for Industry and Commerce may have to stand up and say that it was a year of mixed fortunes, and that there is no way of getting away from that except by becoming more efficient.</P>
    <P>The work of the IDA and various other bodies in that effort to become more efficient has been commendable, but it has been negatived by the two main items which I have mentioned, namely, the preparedness of the Government to prostitute anything for power and politics and the fact that the actions of the Government here or some of its members have been a grave disincentive and inhibiting factor in establishment of new industry.</P>
    <P>One thing about this is that the decisions made in Birmingham, Chicago or anywhere in the world not to come to Ireland but to go to another country to set up their new manufacturing bases will never be heard of, because the decisions taken inside a room are not advertised to us here or through any government publication. I do not want to labour that point any more except to say that those <Col N="1856" /> two factors are most important.  The most important thing that could be done here would be that first of all there would be a coming together of people to see to it that a proper prices and incomes policy is developed and sold to everybody involved and, secondly, that there would be every sign of political stability in a Cabinet. These are two things that are paramount in our future industrial expansion and any delay in providing those two things will result in non-expansion.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the question of the designated and non-designated areas in a rather broad and general way.  I made a point last year on this debate which was not taken up by anybody but which I believe I can prove to be true.  It is that there is a minimum infrastructure of Garda, hospitals, roads and all the other things that a modern state must provide for its every citizen.  That minimum infrastructure must be provided in Leitrim, in parts of Donegal, in the far western areas of Kerry, west Cork and places where there is little industrial employment.  The cost of such infrastructure, at its minimum, will produce for the inhabitants of Grafton Street, of Foxrock, of Rathgar and of Castleknock, if one wants to go to the ultimate, such a tax situation that this country cannot go on.  The crushing burden of tax on industry and on people cannot be relieved by anything, except by the development of the designated areas, for the simple reason that, if one adds up all that has to go into those areas to enable them to survive at a minimum level, one reaches a figure of millions of pounds that cannot be afforded by the industrial base that we have along the east coast.</P>
    <P>We could go even further than that and say that areas of the Minister's own constituency would be in the position of receiving far more from central funds than they are sending by taxes, rates and other payments direct and indirect towards those funds.  The people who are enjoying the lowest standard of living&mdash;they are not the people with the big cars, the people who can go out at weekends and spend £10 or £20 and forget about it&mdash;people who are living very modestly indeed, <Col N="1857" /> are the same people who are the burden upon the State.  That is no insult to them, no criticism of them whatever.  It is a criticism of the Government over the past decades, of course.  The fact is that unless we can develop those areas the burden of tax that will have to be imposed on existing industry and people in the non-designated areas will prove so heavy that our exports will fall, our manufacturing industry and the opportunity to live in this country in comfort will fall, as well.</P>
    <P>We, in Fine Gael, produced a document last year called &ldquo;A Policy for People&rdquo;.  This policy was worked out in extreme detail.  It is a more detailed policy than that which has since been done by the IDA in the production of the regional development organisations and is, I would say, more sophisticated and more likely to succeed.  It provides for growth centres in the various places and it also provides for a local initiative.  If there is not a growth centre in a town and local initiative and local capital wish to come together to try to get an industry, provide money, provide effort and perhaps, if they can contact that industry, even provide the <i>entre-preneur,</i> they will be provided with advance factories just as the growth centres the Government have set up after considerable prodding from this side of the House are.</P>
    <P>For the first time there is some evidence that the IDA and the Minister are making sure that when factories are built they are filled.  There is some evidence that industries which might have gone elsewhere are now going to growth centres.  Our policy, which is far more detailed, is a wise one.  It gives smaller towns and towns which have not got growth centres an opportunity to have advanced factories and develop along the lines themselves which the Government is developing in the obvious places&mdash;which were pointed out to them from this side of the House for years before they did it. It does mean we are not going to have a situation where every piece of land around Galway becomes worth ten times more because the Minister and the IDA are going to prod everyone <Col N="1858" /> towards Galway and away from Westport and Castlebar.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that all designated areas should be developed on a planned basis and the people should be brought in on this plan.  There used to be an old theme with regard to farming that one cannot inspire farming from Merrion Street; likewise one cannot inspire local industry from Kildare Street but I think we get people involved working for their own town, even though they know that the sensible thing is to have growth centres in larger centres of population or in places where there are natural advantages such as a harbour.</P>
    <P>From 1962 on this party has spent its time prodding the Government into having growth centres and although I do not delight in the sad years that have been lost I delight in the fact that after standing here and making speeches on the necessity to develop Sligo as a growth centre for so many years my efforts have at last borne some considerable fruit.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House have checked with the Common Market authorities in Brussels about the movement of goods from designated areas either to areas of consumption or export if there are not export facilities available near the designated area concerned, to see whether or not, under the Rome Treaty, one can have a transport subsidy from these designated areas to the east coast.  If one takes the Rome Treaty as it is the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo; but there have been many exceptions along the line and we can obtain such an exception if we ask for it.  The Minister made no reference in his speech this morning to such an exception.</P>
    <P>It is of the utmost importance to locate heavy industries in designated areas.  They can only be located there if there is either a good export facility nearby on the west coast or if there is a good employment force ready and waiting.  But then there is the necessity of moving the goods across the country to either the east coast or the south coast for export.  This exception can be arranged; it is in our policy, but it is not in the Government's policy.  It <Col N="1859" /> is important to know that the CIE wagons which convey goods to either the south or east coast for export can be the subject of a transport subsidy. In relation to the Common Market this transport subsidy is what one might call one of the bargains, just as the whole problem of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement was not the agreement itself but the bargains which were not entered into by the Minister as a result of which we are now suffering.</P>
    <P>I want to talk now about the Common Market and the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  The year of review ended on 1st July, 1971, and in April or May, 1971, the Minister, on the Control of Exports Bill, indicated to me that he had not made any representations to the British under the year of review.  This statement naturally sparked off Parliamentary Questions from me.  The Minister then indicated that he was making representations to Britain in respect of certain industries that were in trouble, and that it was not in the interests of either those industries or the country that he should tell me which they were.  I accepted that completely and I do not ask the Minister even at this stage to tell me under which particular sections he is making representations.  At least nine months of the year of review had elapsed before we, on this side of the House, were able to kick the Minister into doing something about it.  Having got him to move he then informed us that any negotiation opened before 1st July, 1971, can be proceeded with.  Last week he informed me that negotiations are proceeding.  I would suggest that the industries, whatever they are, which are in trouble as a result of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement or any of the features of it, should have been the subject of representations to the British in the first month of the year of review and that whatever alleviation necessary should have come long before now.</P>
    <P>We meet again the situation where for more than two years the Government have been so tied up in their own political tangles that they have not been able to do the day to day work of the Government.  Neither the time nor the opportunity was there to give every <Col N="1860" /> moment of every working day towards the advancement of industry which is the concern of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>While the Minister for Foreign Affairs is concerned with every detail of our proposed entry to the EEC I am sure the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his Department have to have a detailed and clinical approach to our advent into the EEC.  The Minister said in his speech that there were fears that these fears were groundless, and that it was the smaller countries which had benefited most.  I suggest the Minister take into account the fact that it was the smaller countries which bargained most.</P>
    <P>Small countries have this great advantage when entering trading blocs: their entry will not be as important or destructive to economies elsewhere as the entry of a large trading country. My worry regarding the Common Market is that we will go in&mdash;as happened in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement&mdash;without making detailed bargains in relation to important matters and that we will not avail of our opportunity to be different from Britain.</P>
    <P>I said in this House at one stage that it appeared we were going into the Common Market like a child in arms. Subsequently, there appeared a Warner cartoon with my name on it depicting the Minister's leader being taken like a child in arms by Mr. Ted Heath through a door labelled &ldquo;The Common Market&rdquo;.  It is important that we bargain hard and I have repeated this many times.</P>
    <P>Our entry into the Common Market is a must and, with respect, this affects the Labour Party and their attitude to the EEC.  We must go in&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the kernel of the matter and I am glad to hear that intervention.  In the British House of Commons there was a Government majority of 112 in favour of entry. There is no question of a referendum in Britain; it is obvious that the Conservative Government will not go to <Col N="1861" /> the country, that they will not get flapped.  They will go into the Common Market, but they will be subject to the most severe examination and criticism by the Labour Party in Britain and all their actions in this matter will be questioned.</P>
      <P>It must be clearly understood we could not pay the common external tariff on 80 per cent of the goods we export to Britain, including agricultural goods, and remain outside the Common Market.  The Labour Party here are against entry, Fine Gael are in favour &ldquo;with conditions&rdquo;&mdash;and this is the important point&mdash;and Fianna Fáil in the last few weeks evidently have decided there was a chance of having some bargaining power.  I admit they achieved some success in relation to grants under the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
      <P>It is essential that we enter the Common Market if we are to ensure that employment and industry are kept at a high level.  Fine Gael will examine in detail everything that is done by the Government for as long as they are in power&mdash;which I hope will not be for long&mdash;in relation to our entry into the EEC.  Not only will we defend 100 jobs; we shall try to defend every single job if that is possible.  In view of the overwhelming majority in the British House of Commons and the fact that Britain will enter the EEC, the Labour Party here have a duty to carry out a minute examination of all the Government's proposals.  We must ensure that there will be the minimum disturbance in industry and that we get every benefit it is possible to wrest by way of bargaining.  It must be stated that the Government have not shown any great aptitude for bargaining and, in fact, they have been selling the Common Market to the country rather like one would sell a penny bun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the sensitive areas of industry, the manufacture of shoes and the entire textile sector fall into this category.  In the spring of this year the Mills Bill was put down in the United States Senate and there was the rumour&mdash;which was corroborated in the Minister's speech today&mdash;that President Nixon was considering measures to discourage imports into <Col N="1862" /> America and to encourage exports.  The vulnerable textile industry of America was being affected by Japanese imports and it was thought a tariff wall should be raised&mdash;in fact this was done if one considers that a 10 per cent surcharge was raised against imports.  There was also restriction on money from the United States and, in fact, the only way one can get money in the United States now for exports seems to be on the basis that a certificate from a commercial bank here will indicate there can be repatriation of that money if purchases are made here.</P>
    <P>I was in Brussels in the spring of this year and at that time senior officers from Brussels were in America arranging that the textiles from Japan which might be excluded from America might be taken into the Common Market without the common external tariff or with a reduced tariff or without quota restrictions.  The idea was that they did not wish to push Japan nearer to the Chinese Communist <i>bloc;</i> they wanted to keep Western Europe, America and Japan in the one kitty.  To some degree this has succeeded but it has left us in the situation that our developing textile industry is in a vulnerable position because of the world situation.</P>
    <P>If one reads the IDA report one sees that a considerable amount of money by way of grants is in respect of the textile industry or the garment and associated industries.  In the trade review contained in the Córas Tráchtála report of 1970 it is stated that exports of apparel in 1970 were £22 million; in 1969 they were £19,732,000. That showed some small increase.  Our exports of women's and girls' clothing amounted to £7,475,000 in 1970 while the figure for 1969 was £6,944,000&mdash; very little change.  Of course, 1971 has been a more troublesome year. Exports of men's and boys' clothing for 1970 amounted to £4,545,000 against £4,674,000 for 1969.  This shows the first drop in our exports.  This is a sensitive line and the grants given towards the industry by the IDA are probably more necessary now than ever before, especially since so many people are employed in the textile industry. Our exports of other clothing in 1970 <Col N="1863" /> amounted to £6,098,000 as against £4,380,000 for 1969.  That was all right. Exports of footwear for 1970 amounted to £3,977,000 as against £3,764,000 for 1969.  It will be seen, therefore, that we are merely holding our own in 1970 but there has been a drop in 1971.</P>
    <P>Because of the amount of money invested in textiles I would have expected an increase in exports of about £10 million, but what I am reading here is an even-Stephen situation.  There was an increase in exports of general textiles for the year 1970 of about £5 million.  Without going into detail, or referring to the grants given to various industries, if one considers the total amount of money invested in the industry, plus the grants, one will see that the improvements have not been as great as one would have expected.  The Minister referred rightly to this particular industry.  Again, it is a sensitive industry and I am not dealing with it in a critical way but merely pointing out that although there have been increases, these increases have not been spectacular.</P>
    <P>Exports of wool textiles for 1970 amounted to £10,246,000 as against £7,456,000 in 1969.  That was not bad. Cotton and linen exports amounted to £2,888,00 in 1970 as against £2,857,000 in 1969.  The figure for artificial and synthetic textiles amounted to £5,112,000 in 1970 as against £3,351,000 in 1969.  Exports of other fibre products totalled £3,231,000 for 1970 as against £2,730,000 for the previous year.  There was an increase in our exports of leather and leather goods from £5,644,000 for 1969 to £6,629,000 for 1970.  In engineering and metal products there was an increase from £29,927,000 for 1969 to £38,457,00 for 1970.  There was an increase of only £1 million in exports of electrical machinery while in non-electrical machinery there was an increase of about £3 million.  We just held our own in metals and in metal manufactures there was an increase from £5,998,000 in 1969 to £6,172,000 in 1970.</P>
    <P>Transport equipment increased from £1,201,000 in 1969 to £4,933,000 in 1970.  This covers ships and boats to <Col N="1864" /> which the Minister referred.  I agree with subsidising this industry.  We have no alternative if we want to remain in the boat building industry and Verholme give quite an amount of employment.  All countries are waiting for the time when such subsidisation will not be necessary but if Ireland were to opt out now, we might be very sorry in the years ahead.  I do not consider the figures given by the Minister in relation to grants to be excessive. The increases in exports of transport equipment was spectacular.</P>
    <P>Exports of medical and scientific equipment increased to £10,338,000 in 1970 from £8,054,000 for the previous year.  I expect that most of this increase would have been generated in my constituency because of the efforts there of a certain very successful firm.</P>
    <P>Exports of paper and printing materials showed a marginal increase. The same applied in respect of building materials, furnishings, chemicals and pharmaceuticals.  There was quite a good increase in exports of plastic products and there was an increase of about £1 million in exports of petroleum and petroleum products.  We did very well in rubber exports, having increased the figure from £1,261,000 in 1969 to £4,362,000 in 1970.</P>
    <P>There was quite a good increase too in exports of tobacco and there was an increase in exports of food and drink from £125,527,000 in 1969 to £145,984,000 in 1970.  In meat and meat products there was an increase from £66 million to £74 million.  The overall increase in exports was £64.07 million.  Dairy products showed an increase for the year 1970 of about £5 million and there was an increase of about £2 million in chocolate products. If we are to be hit by the grave problem that is effecting the textile industry, we could be in for serious trouble so far as employment in concerned.</P>
    <P>In relation to Córas Tráchtála there is the question as to whether we are doing enough towards getting a foothold in Europe.  Yesterday I had a question down for the Taoiseach to ask him:</P>
    <P>What improvements in the balance of trade have been effected with <Col N="1865" /> Common Market countries in this country's efforts to gain a foothold in their home markets before accession to the Treaty of Rome; and what increase in exports they have effected to this country over the last five years for which figures are available.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach replied that the information was being circulated with the Official Report.  This information was that our import excess with Common Market countries has increased between 1966 and August of this year from £19.7 million to £51 million.  That would seem to indicate to me that our market here has been the subject of some considerable effort by Europeans. Although there has been a special arrangement in respect of motorcars of which, incidentally, I approve, the position is that the Europeans have been concentrating very much on getting into our market.  I would pose the question as to whether we have been doing enough to get into their markets, and whether or not our technological grants and the activities of Córas Tráchtála should have been more aligned towards the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I read in the Córas Tráchtála report that they are opening two new offices, one in Milan, as far as I remember, and one in Brussels.  I understand that they have an office in Frankfurt and another in Paris.  It seems to me that the Minister may have been lax in not seeing to it that this was done long ago.  It must be at least 15 months since it was clear that, unless there was an upheaval in matters on the Common Market front, or an upheaval in political matters in Britain, Britain was going into the Common Market. Therefore, the opening now of two new offices is too little, and too late.  We need a quickly set-up promotional drive in Common Market areas for our industrial goods.  Four offices are not adequate.  We are spending a lot of money on Embassies in various places that are unlikely to get us any industrial achievement.  Why did we not open at least one office in every Common Market country?  I criticise the Government and the Minister for that. <Col N="1866" /> We should also have had a dual approach: the approach of giving the services of Córas Tráchtála, without the manufacturers looking for it, to work out what the markets are for the various products and what changes in manufacture or in general production here would be necessary to provide a product that would be acceptable by the people in the various countries.  We should also have speeded things up so that we would have a foot in.  We could give grants before we go into the Common Market to pay for the common external tariff.  This should have been done.  When Britain was in trouble the Government imposed a 50 per cent deposit scheme on our industrial exports to them.  That was not so very long ago.  They exacted every penny of it and had it locked up for six months.  Before we accede to the Treaty of Rome, why should we not take this step of paying, from the Capital Budget if necessary&mdash;which is the Government's right if they wish to do it&mdash;for the common external tariff on products which we could export from here when we get into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I will mention one such product.  The Minister said there are difficulties in relation to confectionery and chocolate products.  As the Minister is well aware, and as everybody who has been there is aware, in the Common Market countries the price of chocolate products and confectionery is extremely high.  We have the raw materials: we have the sugar; we have the eggs; we have them in quantity and their quality is probably the best in the world.  We also have the milk and the cream, the natural agricultural products of our country.  In respect of selected commodities surely the Government should have paid the common external tariff.</P>
    <P>I did a study tour in Brussels last March or April.  I stayed on for two days to get as much information as I possibly could for industries here and for certain specified industries, some of them in my own constituency, who were worried about the advent of the Common Market.  Part of the information I got was about an advantage which Ireland might have at that moment, and that moment is disappearing <Col N="1867" /> very fast.  I brought this message home and, in one instance, it was acted upon.  The advantage that Ireland has is that countries with a made product, a product internationally known and accepted, and who wished to be within the Common Market and needed a labour force, would desire to come to Ireland now so that when we accede to the Common Market they will be ready to export.</P>
    <P>The point was made that, under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, an industrial export could go to a market of 60 million in Britain.  An American company or a South American company, or a company from anywhere else in the world, or a company within the Common Market, which wanted to expand and had not got the labour force could come here and enjoy the British market until such time as we all went into the Common Market and, at that stage, produce here for the Common Market and Britain.  The Minister did not mention that.  It would be of great benefit to this country.</P>
    <P>When I was in Brussels on this industrial tour it was pointed out to me that, in relation to textiles and shoes, the people who were in trouble were the large producers of normally priced articles.  The fashion textile trade, with relatively small producers, was not only surviving but expanding, and there seemed to be a constantly increasing market for these goods amongst people who were prepared to pay double or treble the price for a garment, or a piece of textile, or a pair of shoes.  It was pointed out to me that we in Ireland should be orientating ourselves towards that.  I do not see much evidence of it, I am sorry to say, in the grants mentioned in this year's report of the Industrial Development Authority.  I do not see much evidence of it in the grants extended to small industries.  We may be falling down on this and we may rue the day that we did fall down on it because of this non-approach.</P>
    <P>There is no choice now.  We must go in.  Both Opposition parties must make sure of the conditions.  As Deputy Coughlan said this is the <Col N="1868" /> important factor.  It is true&mdash;and no mention has been made of this&mdash;that quotas can be arranged under the Treaty of Rome.  This has been done. If one studies the Treaty of Rome and all that happened since, one finds out facts such as the fact that Western Germany has the right to trade in certain items with Eastern Germany of all places, and the fact that France can still trade with her dominions overseas.</P>
    <P>If you read the British White Paper you will find that until 1977 New Zealand will have the right to send&mdash;I forget the exact amount&mdash;tens of millions of pounds of butter to the Common Market and that, after that, with the alignment in prices the probability will be that New Zealand will continue to have that arrangement and will be unaffected.  Instead of thinking that everything will close down, the job that has to be done now is to bargain to ensure that we will not lose one job and to bargain in extreme detail.  I do not believe that this Government are in a position to do that because of the happenings of the past couple of years and because of their behaviour in making the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement when they did not bargain at all.</P>
    <P>I want to instance another situation that is of great importance, that is, the crisis in the French light electrical goods industry within the Common Market.  We have an excellent light industrial goods industry here, most of it about four miles down the road from me.</P>
    <P>When I was in Brussels I discovered that when the French refrigerator and light electrical goods industry got into serious trouble they asked to have a quota applied against Italian imports. They wanted three years.  They got 18 months.  They succeeded in stopping the influx of large quantities of Italian cheap refrigerators into their area.  It was just like the year of review, that the Government did not act under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement or acted when it was too late.  They got 18 months within the Common Market.  It is absolutely clear that what has to be done is to bargain&mdash;for instance, in regard to sugar.  There are items that must be <Col N="1869" /> dealt with and that should be considered in detail but which were not mentioned in the Minister's speech which is just a general lengthy diatribe produced not by himself.</P>
    <P>According to the White Paper, Britain has succeeded in defending her dominions' exports of sugar to Britain. I would advise the Minister to read the White Paper.  Therefore, a small country such as we are should now be negotiating in detail.  That is the job that has to be done by the two Opposition parties here, to make the Government negotiate in detail so as to avail of the opportunities existing in relation to the Common Market.</P>
    <P>In July a document was issued, referred to now as the Blue Book, containing a description of our position in regard to industrial tariffs in the Common Market.  I quote from page 13, on which the following figures are given in regard to a reduction between our duties and the duties in the EEC: 1st January, 1974, 40 per cent; 1st January, 1975, 20 per cent; 1st January, 1976, 20 per cent; 1st January, 1977, 20 per cent.  On page 16, on the alignment of prices and the harmonisation of prices, there is again a time schedule ending in 1977.</P>
    <P>On page 70 of Deputy Dr. Hillery's Blue Book on the elimination of customs duties between member states and alignment of common customs tariffs there is a table again setting out 20 per cent reductions ending in 1977.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has succeeded in getting for us the right to give our grants up to 1990, approximately. I compliment him on that.  It is the one good thing that has been done.  We are a small nation and it would appear to me from the Blue Book issued in July that the Minister has swallowed, hook, line and sinker, in relation to our industrial goods, the arrangements made by Britain.  The tables applicable to Britain are a little different from the tables circulated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs but I quote from the British White Paper, <i>United Kingdom and European Communities,</i> of July, 1971 and refer to Table I, where they refer to the adoption of the common external tariff and the changes that are being made.  That <Col N="1870" /> table is exactly similar to the first table that I read out from the Blue Book. What you have is 40 per cent, meaning 40 per cent of the common external tariff, applied at this stage, and then 20 per cent, 20 per cent and 20 per cent, which means 100 per cent of common external tariff.  At paragraph 82 of this British White Paper it is stated:</P>
    <P>We shall adopt this Community system of support though not Community prices in the first year of membership.  We shall introduce threshold and intervention prices of our own.  These will be lower than the full Community threshold and intervention prices, the difference corresponding to the difference between our market price levels and those of the present Members.  We shall then increase our threshold and intervention prices gradually to full Community levels by six steps over the five years of the transitional period.</P>
    <P>We have swallowed that, hook, line and sinker, as far as our industrial goods are concerned.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has not been conspicuous by his trips to Brussels. We got exactly the same terms.  Our strength in regard to industrial exports to the Common Market lies in our weakness in the volume of industrial goods from any one sector that we could deliver to Common Market countries.  The gross national product of the Community of Ten will be nine-fourteenths the size of the United States of America.  On that I quote Mr. Carl Beker who is the head of the Department for Information of Applicant Nations.  We would be exporting industrial goods in relatively tiny amounts to a group of states whose gross national product is of the dimension I have mentioned.  As far as the transition is concerned, we have accepted the same terms as would apply to a nation that has been famous as an industrial nation for decades and centuries and whose population is 60 million.  Does the Minister see what I mean when I say that the duty of the two Opposition parties is not to talk about the Common Market now, because the decision has been made and we have <Col N="1871" /> to send 80 per cent of our industrial and agricultural goods to Britain, but to steer a lazy or uninformed Government into making bargains from our position of weakness which will allow us to get far better bargains than the British can ever hope for?  May I again quote Mr. Carl Beker from a note in my diary?  He said: &ldquo;Anything is negotiable during the transitional period.&rdquo;  The position is that, even if this Government have made a mess of things to date, if they wanted to change their step and seek a longer transitional period and special terms for special industrial goods they could do it but I do not think there is much chance of their doing it.  It would be far better if somebody else did it for them.</P>
    <P>The figure for industrial exports to Europe is 14 per cent of our total.  We have moved from an import excess from Common Market countries, of £19.7 million in 1966 to an import excess of £51 million in the period January-August of this year.  We have accepted hook, line and sinker, with the exception&mdash;and I praise the Minister for Foreign Affairs and, if the Minister sitting opposite had anything to do with it, I praise him too&mdash;that we can give our grants and incentives to our designated and non-designated areas for some considerable time to come; but, with that exception, we have swallowed, hook, line and sinker, the British conditions.</P>
    <P>I have described our economic and industrial strength relative to that of Britain.  I intend to move now from that sad situation and I am glad to have this opportunity today to put the House on notice of its responsibility, by every means in its power, to see to it that this Government, which has not adverted to the situation, will now mend its ways or see to it that another government will accept the truth, namely, that there is no way out and we cannot afford the common external tariff on our goods.  We could not afford to pay the extra industrial tariff on our agricultural goods.  Since sufficient bargaining has not been done and since sufficient use has not been made of the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement in <Col N="1872" /> relation to the Common Market exercise to date, a heavy responsibility rests on the two Opposition parties here to join together and ensure that everything is examined out and that every opportunity is taken to get the best bargain possible for us until such time as those who are bad bargainers are replaced.</P>
    <P>I want to move on now to an excellent exercise in which I am sure the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, played a part.  I refer to the GEC in Dunleer.  Some time ago a very large factory was built in the town of Dundalk, the idea being that in the country areas it was impossible to get a mixture of male and female labour and some of this light electrical work required female labour.  There was an international recession and British GEC decided that GEC of Ireland should not go forward with their project.  The new factory was left empty.  It cost between £400,000 and £500,000.  Happily, Ecko, associated with EI of Shannon, occupied the factory.  In the forefront of people's minds was the thought that someone in London could make a decision of this magnitude and, if such a decision could be made in relation to a new factory in Dundalk, then a similar decision, inimical to the welfare of workers, could be made up the road in Dunleer as well.  Fortunately, the American director of GEC floated another company and is now in process of selling electrical goods in practically every town in the country while, at the same time, getting ready to defend our home market against free trade competition. He is also, of course, looking after the export opportunities.</P>
    <P>As a result of the excellent work of Mr. Martin McCourt and the way in which both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce dealt with the matter there will now be Irish control.  That is how I interpret the situation and that is what I said to Mr. McCourt when I rang him up to congratulate him.  Like every other businessman he is naturally at risk, but it is heartening to see such courage and to find someone willing to take a risk in the knowledge that what one is backing is one's own judgment <Col N="1873" /> which, in the past incidentally, has always proved right.  I shall say no more about that.  It is only fair to advert to it knowing that something has been done which is good from the point of view of employment.  I have no objection to praising the Minister when the right thing is done.</P>
    <P>With regard to grants for existing industries, no matter how much capital is involved in expansion, no matter how new the development is, existing industry is restricted to a maximum grant of 25 per cent.  Where expansion is as large as the original industry, and where the capital expenditure relative to that already employed is extremely large, the policy of my party is to give grants at the same level as those given to entirely new projects.  I think that is only fair.  There is, for some reason, more joy over a new industry employing 20 people than there is in extending an existing industry employing 200. In my constituency the Minister has taken action in defence of 128 jobs.  I hope his cash injection will be successful. As I say, there is more political joy over a small new factory creating 20 new jobs than there is in injecting capital in defence of 128 existing jobs. Admittedly, we are all political animals, but this is a trend that should be corrected.  Publicly the main Opposition party has laid it down that, if returned to power, they will provide grants at the highest level where there is major expansion.</P>
    <P>The Government have been great sinners where prices are concerned. There was the classic example of delay in sanctioning an increase in the price of flour and bread.  Early last January the millers indicated they were going to increase the price, irrespective of whether or not the Minister liked it. There was a legal question as to whether or not flour and bread were in a different category from everything else.  It was covered by the 1958 Prices Act.  The millers succeeded in convincing the Minister and the Minister gave them a temporary increase of 8s per sack of 20 stones.  None of us carry these now.  An inquiry was set up. A situation then obtained which, in my view, should never have existed.  If one were to take the millers' figures &mdash;and a large proportion of their <Col N="1874" /> figures were substantiated and increases were given as a result&mdash;at that stage the industry was losing £26,000 per week.  Again, if I am not mistaken, by the time an award was made, back money to the extent of £7,000 or £8,000 had to be and has been accounted for by giving a greater increase over a future period, which we are all paying now when we eat bread.</P>
    <P>Referring questions like this to committees is just a political exercise by the Government.  What went wrong at that time was that the Government wanted to keep their options open. They did not know if they were going to the country or not and they did not want to go with a big increase in the price of bread.  They referred the matter to a committee.  It was an excellent committee which did an excellent job.  I was a witness before it myself. Is it not true that there is an excellent prices section in the Department and that a report could have been made to the Minister and all the Minister had to do was to go to a Cabinet prepared to look sensibly at the matter and give the increase?</P>
    <P>As things were, the result is that all the poor people now must pay more for bread over a period to recoup the back money accrued during the period when the row was going on between the millers and the Minister. If costs go up, prices must go up and this must be accepted.  It is far better, and more in accord with the prices and incomes policy to which I have adverted, that price increases come in small slices and when they should come and that industrialists and employers are not put out of business while an argument goes on, an argument that has as background the question of whether the Government wants the argument to go on so as to keep their options open for an election or by-election.</P>
    <P>If this Government changes&mdash;this seems to be on the cards&mdash;and if there is a Fine Gael Minister for Industry and Commerce, which also seems to be on the cards, quite clearly the prices section of the Department will no longer be a racehorse running in hobbles and every effort will be made to keep prices down, but the proper attitude of allowing small increases in <Col N="1875" /> prices before large losses are sustained will be adopted.  There will not be a situation in which an industry loses £26,000 per week. In the particular industry to which I refer it was possible for the millers to stay open and continue production. The industry has been rationalised and there are not so many millers.  But if some other industry is kept waiting for 15 months and if the net result is that people must pay in the increased price back money for that industry, how many of the smaller units in that other industry may have gone to the wall in the meantime because the bank would not give them the necessary overdraft?</P>
    <P>I am not a miller; I am merely a dryer and storer of wheat.  The amount of the award given to people such as myself in this case was less than one-third of what the second largest firm of accountants in the country produced as the proper figure.  I shall not comment on that; it could not matter less.  The amount involved was greater than the net profit in that business which employs 125 people.  The net profit involved in that operation, which would be the largest operation, was greater than the net profit.  If that is so, is it not true that, if this is how the Government behave in regard to the prices section of the Department, many other things follow.  One is that the consumer is being cheated by having to pay a lower price for a period and then having to pay a much higher price later on.  Again, this leads to the worker saying: &ldquo;I have not sufficient wages; I must look for a big increase because I have a big increase in the price of a commodity, in the price of shoes or clothes for my children.  I must seek a very large increase.&rdquo;  All this happened because of the changes of a by-election or a general election: the options were required to be kept open.</P>
    <P>There is absolute necessity for price control because in a small country like this it is possible in certain industries for a few people around a table to decide on price increases and put them into effect.  Other people may follow suit: if they do not, they may be subjected to pressure to the extent&mdash;the <Col N="1876" /> Minister referred to monopolies which is a matter that must be dealt with&mdash; that they would have to follow suit because this is such a small country. While there is absolute necessity for price control it is also true that the attitude of the Minister introducing a national prices commission to which he will refer everything is somewhat like that of Pontius Pilate washing his hands.</P>
    <P>The Minister is charged with responsibility for prices; it is his job and the prices section of the Department is there to advise him and, like all branches of the Civil Service in this country, they are an honourable body who will advise correctly.  It is then the Minister's job to have the guts to go to the Cabinet and get them to make the smaller price increases as these become necessary rather than postpone them for political reasons.</P>
    <P>Without discourtesy to any member of the National Prices Commission I say there is no necessity for that commission. There is a virtue in doing justice and letting it be seen to be done; but if one does one's job in regard to keeping a keen eye on prices and keeping them as low as possible, while at the same time defending the net profit of the companies on which every employee depends for his next pay packet. one will do a much better job and should be capable of openly defending one's actions in this regard.</P>
    <P>A price increase when necessary is easy to defend.  Evidence can be produced before any group from a board of directors to a trade union, and any group of people can see if you increase the cost of raw material by 25 per cent that entails an increase of a lower percentage in the cost of the finished product.  Anybody can see that, if you have a legitimate wage increase of, say, 10 per cent, that entails a lower percentage increase in the cost of the finished product.  If you marry the two together, if they happen at the same time, anybody can see that the addition of the two is the proper price increase plus any other increases there are.</P>
    <P>There is no point in acting like an ostrich: there will be price increases. They should be made regularly, as <Col N="1877" /> they are justified, and not until they are justified, All I can do from my position is make deductions and I deduce that lack of speed is not in fact the fault of the prices section of the Department.  There should be far more speed.</P>
    <P>It is the fault of the politicans.  The difficulty about the National Prices Commission, which has now been instituted, is that it looks as if it is a very authoratitive body on which all shades of opinion are represented and justice must be done.  In my considered opinion the prices section of the Department of Industry and Commerce plus the Minister would do justice and do it must faster.  This is a case of washing one's hands and putting aside the difficulty while, at the same time, making quite certain to be there with the golden key to open the new factory on every possible occasion.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the services section of industry and the shop-keepers. The only message I can get from page 45 of the Minister's speech is that the small trader should sell Irish and that the efficient small trader has nothing to fear.  I am aware that the introduction of large supermarkets in certain areas has helped small traders in close proximity particularly if the small traders were prepared to change the type of their business.  The bringing of people to any particular spot means that if one puts the goods in front of them one has one's chance of selling some goods.  While that is true in certain individual instances, the fact is that the small traders of this country have been having a pretty difficult time. In the case of drapery the large multiple supermarkets have gone into this line and very many of the things that everybody wears are now purchased in these supermarkets.  All that seems to be left to small drapers are expensive things like men's suits or ladies' dresses.  The loss leader is something that cannot be blazoned across a small front window and I have the greatest sympathy for the small traders in the retail trade.  I wonder have the Cabinet talked about this at all.  I wonder whether there should be some relief extended to them in relation to turnover tax beneath a certain turnover?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1878" /> I am aware that with the new currency and decimalisation supermarkets find themselves in difficulty with fractions and that the fraction always goes in their favour.  They defend their actions in this regard by saying that they do not charge any turnover tax on purchases under five new pence. There are very few purchases under five new pence at present.  A person going into a supermarket will probably make at least two or three purchases. This gives the supermarkets an advantage. There is one large chain that does not charge any turnover tax.  They carry it themselves.  That means their prices have to be a bit higher.  Indeed the maze of prices, the dropping of prices from one day to another, the almost computerised way in which this is done and in which they get their high profits and the fact that they give no credit means that they have extra-ordinarily great advantages over the small trader.</P>
    <P>I am putting forward an idea.  I have no right to put it forward as Fine Gael policy because it is not passed as such at this moment and I want to be quite specific in what I say this morning and quite truthful if I can be.  If I am not truthful in anything, I am being mistaken, not deliberately untruthful. In my opinion the small retail traders could be given some alleviation of tax in respect of their sales.  I do not think it would cost very much.  At present it might cause administrative difficulties but it would help them to preserve themselves in whatever degree of comfort they are lucky enough to enjoy at the moment.</P>
    <P>The highly expensive exercise of industrial training is necessary but it is being paid for by company profits and sometimes these are extremely slim. I remember the late Deputy Sweetman in this House being assailed at one time&mdash;he was in Opposition at the time&mdash;when he said that, in general, company profits in Ireland were far too low.  He defended his assertion by saying that we had no source of wealth apart from profits from which we could get reinvestment.  In that I agree with him.  One per cent might look a very small amount to somebody who is selling French perfume and getting 300, 400 or 500 per cent profit and <Col N="1879" /> selling very little of it but if one were selling some of the heavy items that are produced one might find that a profit of 2 or 3 per cent on turnover might be a very, very good profit.  As I understand it, the subscription towards AnCO is 1 per cent.  From that point of view I think it is a bit high. I know that if one can prove that 51 per cent of one's turnover is just retail sales or that, you do not pay but there are many industries where for themselves industrial training is not necessary.  I am not exactly clear on their position but I think they can opt out.  If one is in an industry where the work being done requires no industrial training one will never get any benefit from the operations of AnCO. Therefore, it is questionable whether there should not be a more liberalised approach that would help these people who are in the position of having a low percentage profit and having to pay a large subscription towards industrial training.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Company continues to do well. Fine Gael back it and feel that it is a good development.  There is no more to be said about that except that whenever the Government changes we will see that it proceeds as well as it did before.  I take a pretty jaundiced view of trade with Rumania, Bulgaria and such countries.  I do not think it is on. Their line is that when they want something out of you they cannot get any-where else, or when they want currency, they will do a deal one way or the other, but when they do not want either of those two things then they will do no deal.  They will also be extremely difficult to satisfy as to quality, delivery and various other things.  If dissatisfied they will refuse to pay.  I can instance a case of an English businessman who had a very difficult time and was, in fact, nearly put to the wall by the fact that the Government of one of the countries I have mentioned &mdash;obviously I will not say which&mdash; refused to pay for a large consignment of goods and that was that.</P>
    <P>If somebody in London owes a firm here money the firm can probably get their money through a solicitor there almost as quickly as if somebody <Col N="1880" /> owed the firm money here, but if somebody in Rumania or Bulgaria owes a firm here money it could be a difficult process to collect the money. I speak here with a little knowledge of the subject.  While I would give the go-ahead to make trade agreements the Government should be careful not to lead some of our good companies on to the wrong side of the curtain because they can go to the wall very easily. When the receiver of the goods says that he is not satisfied one may take it he is the final arbiter if his government goes with him and in 99 cases out of 100 the purchaser is, in fact, the government.  If I was in the Minister's position I would probably make these trade agreements with eastern bloc countries but I would not produce them as a great advance.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister is going to move forward with the same sort of provisions as were included in the Prices and Incomes (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1970 is of interest.  He did not advert to the fact that that Bill was introduced as sister legislation to another Bill, namely the Finance No. 2 (Temporary Provisions) Bill, of that year and that in one Bill there was the pegging of prices and wages and in the other Bill there was the imposition of extra corporation profits tax.  That move was universally condemned by members of the trade union movement, by the Federated Union of Employers and by every responsible body in the country.  I am aware that a week or so ago the Minister granted an alleviation to the tune of £20 million but I want to advert to what was done on that occasion.</P>
    <P>The idea was that all concerned with industry were to tighten their belts and up to 31st December, 1971, there were to be no increases in prices or wages and industrialists were to do with less profits by the imposition of extra corporation profits tax.  Within a fortnight, and more power to them, the trade unions organisation had the Government on its knees, but a statement had been made at that time in relation to corporation profits tax provision that money was necessary and had to be collected.  It was announced that the Government needed £3.6 million in that year and it would collect £6 <Col N="1881" /> million in a full year.  The situation was that the Government could not do without the money and they were therefore going to collect it.</P>
    <P>What happened was that companies were caught in a pincers movement between two forces: one was that wages, salaries and other costs could go up and the other was that there was to be extra taxation from profits. Because of that decision a large public company did not go on with an extension which meant the loss of 150 jobs and they publicly said so.  That is not the sort of industrial Government we want.</P>
    <P>I know there is a need for consumer protection.  I have said that already today.  I have already adverted to my recipe for consumer protection; swift action by the Minister when the prices section of the Department of Industry and Commerce has investigated every side of an application for a price increase so that we can get down to some kind of a prices and incomes policy that would include a clause such as that contained in the present National Wage Agreement that where prices go up above a certain level there can be a compensating wage increase.  We cannot have a situation where the Government are going to delay a price increase because they want to keep their political options open because that destroys any hope of the coming together of a nation in this industrial adventure which has to provide the new jobs and that is why this Government is not suitable for such work.</P>
    <P>I want to advert again to the Verolme situation and to say that we in Fine Gael are fully aware of two sister operations in Cork: one is Irish Steel Holdings and the other is Verolme.  We back both of them to the hilt.  I was the only member in this House, apart from the Minister, when there was serious criticism about the prices being paid by Irish Steel Holdings for scrap metal, who investigated the matter.  I took the view that the service provided by the company, which was accused of having preferential treatment, was an expensive service which covered the whole country, that did not collect scrap metal in Cork and not in Donegal, that did not take the easy bits and leave the difficult <Col N="1882" /> ones behind.  I said publicly that the accusations made were improper and incorrect but notwithstanding that the Minister has seen fit to send the matter to another inquiry.  I suggest if the Minister had investigated it he would have come to the same conclusion that I did.  Maybe he did investigate it, and maybe he did come to the same conclusion, but this phobia of always sending things to inquiries and commissions is unnecessary.  A Minister for State should have the courage to investigate a matter, stand up on his feet, say what he thinks and act accordingly.  As a result of the inquiry that is being held a doubt has arisen in Cork.  I am convinced the inquiry will come out with the same results and conclusions that I reached from my investigation namely, that the company providing the services of giving scrap metal and steel to Irish Steel Holdings is giving a good service at a reasonable price.</P>

I want to make it quite clear that when we gain office, which will not be too long, we shall make every effort to see to it that these two companies are not only continued but expanded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is a measure of the current party political neurosis of Dáil Éireann and the state of the Government that for the past three hours there have only been four or five Deputies present for an Estimate of major national importance, affecting employment and our future industrial development.  I suppose one could say that after the events of last evening the attitude of the House towards a ministerial Estimate is, in the words of Deputy Hogan, rather like the atmosphere of a psycho-therapeutic institution&mdash;these were the words he used to me.  The interest shown in the <Col N="1883" /> lengthy contribution by the Minister is not encouraging for our future industrial development.</P>
      <P>The question the House must ask itself is to what extent there exists within the Government the capacity to develop a strong industrial, independent Republic, a Republic with a dynamic economy and with a firm industrial base which would be competitive in a European setting.  Notwithstanding the Minister's statement, I have come to the conclusion that with regard to industrial development and dealing with problems of employment and adaptation, the present Government is one of the most ineffective, incompetent and incoherent in the history of this State.</P>
      <P>I do not like to have a go at individual Ministers.  There was enough of that yesterday and it was a sad day for the country and for the Dáil. One must regard the present Minister for Industry and Commerce with a certain sense of gloom as being, perhaps, the worst of all the Ministers in that post during the years.  There have been some distinguished Ministers such as the late Seán Lemass and William Norton, both of whom made their contributions in their own way.  Deputy Lynch was notably mediocre as Minister for Industry and Commerce. Deputy Colley was a star that went into orbit but never really got anywhere&mdash;it kept on spluttering and still splutters.  He made no contribution while he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  With respect to the present occupant, I think he is likely to make an even more undistinguished contribution and in making this comment I have no desire to continue the personality obsession this House has seen in the recent past.</P>
      <P>We had a rather interesting but turgid brief from the Minister and he referred to the problem of redundancy. I do not think the explanation he gave will give any hope or inspiration to redundant workers, any more than the statement of the Minister for Finance on 27th October.  The Minister for Finance stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are indications, moreover, particularly by way of increased <Col N="1884" /> redundancies that certain types of firms have been suffering from slack home demand, from recession in certain important markets abroad and from other factors.</P>
    <P>In the first nine months of 1971 there have been 5,715 redundancies.  In reply to a Dáil question on 27th October, the Taoiseach gave this figure in respect of the first nine months of this year and stated that the figure for 1970 was 3,896.  If the pattern of current redundancies is maintained, the total for 1971 will reach 7,500.  This projection is in line with the trends indicated in the recent annual report of the IDA. It is an accurate indication of the abject failure of government policies and of the tragic and undesirable irrelevance of large portions of the politically forgotten Third Programme for Economic and Social Development.</P>
    <P>Of all parties in this House, the Labour Party have consistently advocated and stressed the importance of employment policy in the overall economic strategy.  In the outline policy document of the Labour Party at the last general election with regard to industrial development&mdash;I admit it was rather inadequate although it dealt with employment&mdash;it stated that the biggest failure of the Irish economy and our society generally has been the inability to provide employment for those who wish to remain in Ireland. It stated that full employment is the basis of all the Labour Party's social policies.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies of the Labour Party have been critical of the work of the NIEC on various issues.  However, one report which commanded a great deal of respect and which recognised the importance of full employment was the report on full employment in January, 1967.  I charge the Government with absolute culpability and with abject failure to implement the policies recommended in the report of the NIEC.  If these policies had been implemented when that report was published we would not now be facing the spectre of 7,500 redundancies in 1971.  No amount of absolving by the Minister will get rid of that fact.</P>
    <P>That report contained one particular sentence of major importance, namely, <Col N="1885" /> that full employment will not be achieved without a full sense of social independence and national identity and without a widespread feeling of obligation to make this country a progressive and distinctive political and economic entity.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I do not consider that the extent to which these developments are being brought about under Fianna Fáil is in any way evident from the employment statistics of the country.  The evidence is damning.  It is an indictment of Fianna Fáil, who have been in office now for so long.  One could say that Fianna Fáil have made no contribution towards the economic or industrial development of the country. Of course, when everything is going well they claim total responsibility for the success, but when the opposite is the case they disclaim any responsibility. Were it not for the guiding hands of responsible public servants, notably in the Department of Finance and in the Central Bank, the situation would be much worse.  In terms of economic and social programming during the past two years the contribution by the Cabinet has been nil.  We may hear occasionally of a particular Minister &ldquo;doing his thing&rdquo; in respect of some local factory that may be about to be closed, but that is about the extent of Fianna Fáil thinking on economic and industrial development.  These isolated instances are exclusively for local consumption and local political involvement.</P>
    <P>The NIEC Report on Full Employment made a prophetic comment when it said that the question phrased in the report concerned the will and the conscience of the entire community and that to harden the will and to rouse the conscience of the community would require dynamic leadership and sustained backing from political and religious leaders, from trade unions and employer associations and from other organisations that influence and form public opinion and attitudes.  The report said that without such leadership, particularly in the political field, the policies that will raise living standards and expand employment will not be chosen and implemented. <Col N="1886" /> We have had an exhibition of political leadership in the realm of national economic responsibility during the past couple of days.  The Government will now proceed to yet another crisis next week within their own parliamentary party.  In the meantime the serious economic and social development problems will continue to exist.  After next week's crisis, we can presume that the Government will go on then to their Ard Fheis crisis and thereafter to the crisis of a general election and a referendum.</P>
    <P>There was mention in the Minister's brief of regional policy, of economic development within the regions, of the freeing of trade, of the allocation of industry, the role of the IDA, the role of Córas Tráchtála, the work of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and so on, but all of this is simply a question of marking time. The fundamental criticism that I must make in relation to the Government is the work, if one might call it that, that they have been doing during the past two or three years.  It should be pointed out that, whatever may have been the advances in living standards, our community has permitted stagnation and has permitted avoidable unemployment of some 65,000 to 80,000 people per year.  This is the bitter fruit of Fianna Fáil's often claimed social plans and programming.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to look at the employment statistics to understand the scale of this failure.  In recent years it has become the ploy of the Government, of some sections of the official-dom, to equate the targets of national effort with the short-term projections of growth.  Thus we had the collapse of the Second Programme and we have the imminent demise of the Third Programme. Of course, these are put aside while we are faced with the almost self-congratulatory noises that we have been hearing from the Minister for Finance regarding the feasibility or the likelihood of a 3 per cent rise in GNP. Five years ago this would have been treated by the Government with derision and three years ago it would not have been written into the Second or Third Programmes.</P>
    <P>The essence of planning as I understand <Col N="1887" /> it and the essence of the First, Second and Third Programmes was the setting of targets and the pursuing of very demanding economic goals which reflect the social and economic objectives of the political parties of a nation as well as of the community.  All of this has been abandoned by the Government in retrospective arithmetical exercises of a completely negative economic character.  One has only to consider the growth performance of the economy in the period of each of the Programmes for Economic Expansion in order to see the kind of problems that we are facing now.  If, for example, one takes the period from 1959 to 1963 it will be seen that there was a quite respectable growth rate of 4.4 per cent. During the period of the Second Programme 1964-1967, the rate was 3.3 per cent and it is running currently at about 3 per cent, but this is dropping.  Thus it will be seen that the rate of growth has declined alarmingly.  Of course, the growth rate is bound inextricably with employment and it must be remembered that the GNP growth rate laid down in the NIEC Report on Full Employment was 5½ per cent per annum by the end of the decade.  This report itself was considered at the time to be something of an understatement of the position in terms of the requirements for full employment.</P>
    <P>Industrial growth and expansion are central to the entire economic development of the country and especially to the creation of new jobs.  The Third Programme has been abandoned totally by the Taoiseach, by the Minister for Finance and, indeed, by the Fianna Fáil trade union group of which, I understand, Deputy Haughey is now chairman.  He is now so discredited, apparently, that he can have whatever position he likes.</P>
    <P>The Third Programme set down the annual target of 6.5 per cent for industrial growth in the period 1969 to 1972. That was a reasonable target having regard to the 1963-72 average rate of 7.2 per cent.  The performance has been very poor.  In 1969 the growth rate was 6.5 per cent; in 1970 it was 3.5 per cent and we are to have a 4 per cent rate in 1971.  The productivity rate also has <Col N="1888" /> been very disappointing.  Output per worker in industry rose by 6.8 per cent in 1968.  In 1969-70 the corresponding figure had fallen to 1.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Investment is crucial to industrial progress.  After the encouraging performance in 1969 when capital formation reached 24 per cent of GNP, which gave us all cause for hope, there has been a notable slackening off in this vital factor, namely, the ratio of capital formation to GNP.  The Confederation of Irish Industries commented that the absence of coherent Government policies for industry at this crucial time is adversely affecting business.  The Confederation of Irish Industries was quite clear-cut in its repudiation of the shambles of Government policy on industrial development.</P>
    <P>We had the three-card trick by the Minister for Finance a fortnight ago. In order to recover from putting Irish industry into an industrial strait-jacket and having to cope simultaneously with substantial wage increases and very substantial increases in taxation, in corporation profits tax, he reversed engines, as Deputy Haughey predicted he would.  Under a camouflage of a new capital programme, a new injection of £20 million into the economy, he reversed engines on the question of industrial profits taxation, a major change of policy, a change of policy which, to some extent, caused the redundancy which we are experiencing. Other factors were involved, of course.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that the latest economic review of the Confederation of Irish Industries states that it can be seen that, between 1970 and 1971, pre-taxed profits fell by 7.2 per cent to £16,834,000 as compared with £18,147,000 in the previous year.  More important than that, during the same period retentions of profits fell by over 26 per cent, a massive drop from £4.941 million to £3.645 million.  This is the result of Government taxation policy. It is not very often that a Labour spokesman becomes preoccupied about the corporation profits taxation policy of the Government but, when one sees the outcome of the policy of the Minister for Finance, one sees a situation of considerable political difficulty facing <Col N="1889" /> the Government and of major economic difficulties facing the country.</P>
    <P>Irish industry is losing out in terms of price competitiveness, and losing out very severely at the moment.  The prospects for the next 12 months are not too good.  This is illustrated by a number of factors.  It is illustrated by the movement of unit wage costs, a 44 per cent increase in unit wage costs. The trade unions have their responsibilities in this area as well.  Generally speaking, the unions have been quite responsible despite the provocative stupidities of the Minister for Finance on the Prices and Incomes Bill.  Some people may query the appropriateness of such comments on this Estimate, but a question of employment is involved which is a major issue in relation to the Estimate and one has to take into account all the different factors.</P>
    <P>The movement of unit wage costs was referred to by the Minister, a 44 per cent increase between 1963 and 1970, compared with 29 per cent in the UK, 16 per cent in Germany, 9 per cent in France and 15 per cent in other countries generally.  Irrespective of Irish entry into the EEC, the movement in unit wage costs relative to the movement in the major countries of the Six is not very encouraging.  We have had a very substantial increase in the share of competing imports on the home market.  This has been glossed over by the Minister.  Substantial information is now available from the annual industrial reviews which are available to the middle of this year. They were recommended by the National Industrial and Economic Council as a means of reviewing industrial progress under the Programmes for Economic Expansion.</P>
    <P>These industrial reviews were reasonably useful.  Unfortunately they have tended to deteriorate into statistical exercises of checking figures against projections prepared by the staff of the Department, as distinct from throwing up the real problems in industry and trying to do something about them.  I will deal with that later on.  The information available from these reviews shows a growing share of home consumption of industrial products being taken by competing imports and an <Col N="1890" /> increasing share of industrial production being exported.</P>
    <P>From the data available from these reviews and from the Department of Finance, it will be seen that, for manufactured goods as a whole, competing imports constituted much the same proportion of home consumption in 1965: 14½ per cent as against 13½ per cent in 1960.  There was no movement in the first five years of the 1960s.  In the five years up to 1970 the proportion rose to 19½ per cent and in 1971 it is expected that competing imports in the Irish domestic field will be in the region of 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The increase in imports between 1965 and 1970 was particularly noticeable in the case of textiles which went from 27 per cent of home consumption to the very substantial figure of 36 per cent of home consumption.  In clothing and footwear it rocketed from 8 per cent to 18 per cent showing the change in the whole pattern.  In metals and engineering it went up from 16 per cent to 19 per cent.  Therefore, there is a very substantial increase in the share of the competing imports on the home market.  To give another statistic it went from 14.6 per cent of domestic expenditure in 1965 to 19.4 per cent in 1970.  This is a factor which affects price competitiveness and employment. We have also had the slackening in the growth rate which I mentioned previously.</P>
    <P>I am not a Jeremiah.  I have always felt that too many Irish politicians were too busy knocking Irish industry and knocking our very substantial industrial development in the early 1960s&mdash; major industrial development, there are now almost a quarter of a million people working in Irish factories.  The position is serious.  I do not think we can get away from that.  In considering the rather sorry story of economic stagnation and lost opportunities it is essential to remember that all this economic data is a reflection of the human situation in which we find ourselves. We have 65,000 people unemployed and this represents a massive human problem.</P>
    <P>While I have reservations about the breakdown of the unemployment figure which is a relatively artificial figure. <Col N="1891" /> particularly having regard to the substantial agricultural payments of a subsistence nature built into it, nevertheless the position is serious.  Longterm unemployment is an important characteristic of the Irish situation.  In each of the years from 1962 to 1967 some 70 per cent of unemployed had less than six months work during the previous year.  Unemployment is highest in the categories: short-term unemployed, those who are chronically unemployable, and persons who are seriously ill or handicapped and, of course, those who were in receipt of unemployment assistance until retirement benefit was introduced.</P>
    <P>The national situation might be summed up as follows, without being unduly harsh: The employment policy of the Government is beginning to fail, beginning to drift into being a non-policy; our industrial growth is stagnant at the moment; general investment has slackened; the overall competitiveness of Irish exports has been eroded; more unfortunate than anything else, the concept of economic planning has been totally abandoned. We will get a Fourth Programme of Economic Expansion only because of a sense of obligation in the Department of Finance to inform the Economic Development Division and the senior officers.  They are men who have given their best.  Many of them have been extremely brilliant in producing reports such as the Report on Full Employment, the Report on the Economic Situation in 1965.  That could be reprinted with 1971 being substituted for 1965.  The same lessons are to be learned.  These men may produce a fourth programme but as the Fianna Fáil Party are no longer interested in this kind of exercise, I am afraid planning has been abandoned and there is no real interest in it.</P>
    <P>To quote one of the most recent commentators, the most alarming fact is the failure of the Government to analyse in any detail the reasons for the failures that I have referred to.  What is now urgently necessary is a complete, root and branch, review by the Government. The Government are in power. They are not likely at the moment to commit self-immolation.  They do it <Col N="1892" /> only individual by individual and there are enough individuals still left.  The urgent necessity now is for a complete review of Irish economic experience over the past five years, for an immediate reassessment of planning procedures and for the preparation of a five-year comprehensive national economic plan to become operative from 1st January, 1973, the date of accession to the EEC.  Unless this is done there will be a harrowing transitional period from 1973 to 1978.  It may be that the Government will use such a plan as the next general election gimmick.  They can publish in the middle of 1972, the five-year plan for 1973 to 1978 but this, unfortunately, is what is necessary.  Nobody knows the intentions of the Government in relation to any one region for the period 1973 to 1978.  Regional managers of the IDA will tell you that they are in receipt of no policy guide-lines from the Government as to what they should or should not do.</P>
    <P>It is tragic that the Programmes for Economic Expansion so far have served only as window-dressing for the Fianna Fáil Party and their speech writers.  I do not think that party has the will or the desire to produce the necessary ingredients for successful economic planning.  They are totally reluctant to get down to this exercise. Consequently we have had the statement here today by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the low increase of 3 per cent in industrial output resulted in the slow growth of total national output in 1970 and that employment in the transportable goods industry in 1970 rose at a slower rate than in the previous year.  There was a frank confession on the part of the Minister when he said:</P>
    <P>The Government recognise that our economic growth in 1971 will be below the potential growth rate of the economy and are particularly conscious of the problem of redundancy to which I shall refer later. In order to provide a stimulus to economic activity and to encourage business confidence the Government have announced a reduction in the level of company taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I have read abject confessions of <Col N="1893" /> failure on the part of the Government but this is very abject and represents a litany of where failures have occurred. The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and have also made available an additional £6 million to the Industrial Development Authority...</P>
    <P>He gave to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company a miserable £½ million in the hope that this injection would be enough to get the necessary boost.  It is not proving to be enough. I submit that the Government must now take their courage in their hands and produce for the five years 1973 to 1978 a decent, credible programme of economic planning.  There is nothing wrong with having national plans.  If the Government are prepared to review the economic experience in the past two or three years and to have a thorough reassessment of the planning procedures of the past three or four years I am quite convinced that they have the capacity, not at Cabinet level, but at public service level.  At public service level there is the capacity to produce a five year plan for 1973 to 1978 and then we may once again have some faith in the first three programmes which are now abandoned and which need to be, not just resurrected, but reconstructed and extended into the seventies.  Otherwise the projection of the IDA of 7.500 redundant workers in 1971 will be a reality by the end of this year, something which we will bitterly regret. I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, arising from his reply to Question No. 4 of 3rd November, 1971, he is in a position to state whether any of the 17 incursions over the Border by British Army aircraft have interfered with civilian air traffic carriers or disrupted civilian aircraft flights of any kind; and if the heights and speeds of any of these aircraft were such as to facilitate aerial photography of the Republic's territory and installations; and what action, if any, was taken at the time of such incidents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>None of the air incursions by military aircraft interfered with or disrupted civilian air traffic.  In the case of the confirmed <Col N="1898" /> incursions&mdash;all by helicopters&mdash;referred to in my reply of the 3rd November, aerial photography might have been technically possible but not to an extent greater than could be done from within the Six Counties by suitably equipped aircraft.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The incident of 29th October involved an aircraft rather than a helicopter.  It was not possible then to identify which kind of aircraft it was.  Investigations have been proceeding in the meantime; they have now been completed and the result of them is being conveyed to the British authorities for their comment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach give any indication at this stage as to whether the aircraft he referred to last week in reply to supplementaries disrupted in any way or came into the air traffic corridors of this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy, although he may not have heard my original reply, none of the air incursions by military aircraft interfered with or disrupted air traffic. I am not in a position to say what the plane of 29th October was, whether it was military, civil or otherwise, but as far as I know there was no significant disruption of air traffic.  It may have infringed our air space beyond what should have been permitted but, as I said, our investigations have now been completed and the results are being conveyed to the British authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach please state how long this aircraft spent in our air space, the way in which it flew, where it flew and whether there is any indication as to whether the type of flying engaged in by the aircraft was to facilitate air to ground photographic reconnaissance?</P>

    <P>It is estimated that the additional cost in 1969-70 to public authorities in the State of applying the foregoing Northern Ireland figures of expenditure per head of population would be £50 million, comprising approximately £28 million social insurance benefits, £6 million non-contributory social welfare benefits, and £16 million family or children's allowances.  In this calculation it is taken that the State would bear the usual proportion of approximately one-third of the cost of insurance benefits.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister, bearing in mind that the figures he gave show that the cost of national insurance <i>per capita,</i> per head of the population, in Northern Ireland at £43.28 is almost three times the figure of £15.42 for the Republic, explain how the cost of almost trebling our national insurance bill of £46 million can be only £28 million, the cost to the community?  I should like him to explain that first of all.  I have a number of other queries to put on his misleading information the last day.</P>

      <P>This statistical exercise which the Deputy has put to me is not a factual comparison.  To make a real comparison of the actual amount involved one would have to know the number of persons unemployed or entitled to benefit at a particular given time in each of the two areas and, as the incidence of unemployment is higher in Northern Ireland, in the Six Counties, than it is here it is difficult to estimate without making a comparison item for item. The Deputy knows well that there is no direct comparison for unemployment assistance, non-contributory widows' and old age pensions between here and the Six Counties because they have no comparable benefit and no comparable scheme except the supplementary benefit scheme.  On the other hand, social insurance here is confined to persons up to a limit of £1,600 whereas in the Six Counties social insurance is payable by all and everybody is covered under the social insurance scheme.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not answered the question I asked. Will he read the question and answer it because the question I asked, to which I do want an answer, is the average amount expended per head of the population with the same level in Northern Ireland and what the cost would be?  The Minister has given us figures showing that in this part of the country the cost per head of the population is £30.26.  He has given us figures showing that in Northern Ireland it is a figure of £65.90 per head of the population.  Would the Minister, therefore, agree that the cost of raising the <i>per capita</i> payment in this part of the country to the Northern Ireland level is more than double the present cost of these payments in the Republic, because £65 is more than double £30? Would he answer that question straight, yes or no?</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if he has taken into account in his compilation of the data the fact that there is in Northern Ireland the earnings related supplementary system both in regard to unemployment and to sickness benefit, for which there is no comparable system here; if he has taken into account the fact that there is a graduated pension system in operation in Northern Ireland, for which <Col N="1904" /> there is no comparable system here, and if he has, for example, taken into account the fact that there is in Northern Ireland a scheme of retirement pension at 60 for women while it is 65 here.  These are factors which the Minister, in assessing the figure, has not taken into account.  I suggest to him that, if they were taken into account, the figure would, in fact, be in the region of £85 million and this is the figure the social security experts both in Newcastle and in the Northern Ireland insurance section have in fact reached.  The figure of £50 million, therefore, is quite misleading on the Minister's part.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The authority is contained in section 32 (2) of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, which enables regulations to be made to provide for recoupment from the Social Insurance Fund to a public assistance authority of sums, or such portion thereof as may be prescribed, paid by way of home assistance in respect of periods during which benefit was not received. Regulations made accordingly permit the recoupment to a public assistance authority, at the request of the authority, of home assistance paid in respect of periods for which arrears of unemployment benefit subsequently become payable.  The amount deductible from the arrears of benefit is the difference between the home assistance granted and what would have been granted had unemployment benefit been in payment during the period.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, we already have a number of bodies dealing with the marketing and promotion of our main agricultural and fishery exports although some changes might have to be made in the structure of these bodies to conform to EEC requirements.  I consider that full use should continue to be made of them in the development of our exports.  Also, to comply with Community regulations, it would be necessary to establish intervention agencies for the principal products and to provide for the administration as appropriate of grading standards and export support measures.  The various arrangements in this connection would fall to be made after completion of the entry negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the case and it is a grave reflection on industries such as the dairy industry who have this under active consideration themselves and who are likely to take over greater and greater control of the export of their own produce than has hitherto been the case.  Heretofore, Bord Bainne acted as an export agency, as a monopoly.  This monopoly situation cannot continue, but that does not necessary?  Is it not absolutely necessary somewhat altered form must go out of existence.  In fact, it should continue.  I think the dairy industry in general are taking steps to see that it will continue and it would be to the advantage of the industry generally for it to do so.</P>

      <P>First, I do not want to make a grave reflection on anybody. Secondly, would the Minister not agree that a suggestion that we should have either improvement and expansion of our present marketing boards to take in EEC activities or alternatively new ones, is not a reflection on anybody but in fact is something absolutely necessary.  Is it not absolutely necessary to bring the different elements in the dairying industry together and get them correlated?</P>

There are limitations on the Department of Agriculture in what they, as the Department, can do because, as in the case of Bord Bainne, which is an export monopoly board, the likelihood is that the structure of this will have to change. The various arrangements and changes that will have to be made will have to be worked out as we proceed.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister assure the House that the same standard will be applied to an Bord Bainne and to Irish marketing boards as will be applied to the British Milk Marketing <Col N="1910" /> Board and that they will not get away with maintaining a monopoly?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a reasonable suggestion, but I would also point out that there is a difference that should not be overlooked.  It is that the British Milk Marketing Board is largely an internal organisation for internal marketing, while our Bord Bainne is almost exclusively export.  I think any concessions that might be made to the British in this regard should also extend to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the distinction between the internal and external marketing boards will be gone because you will have one agricultural market in EEC, and would the Minister further comment on the proposed changes and structure in the marketing boards referred to?  Would he particularly state if this means that all marketing boards be producer controlled and will he give an assurance that in future all Irish marketing boards set up in Ireland will be producer controlled?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is too early to say what the exact nature of the particular marketing boards that will be set up will be, but the most reasonable course they should take would be that they would be producer controlled.  It is also reasonable to expect that possibly a section of the Department of Agriculture might act in the matter of intervention, as with the marketing board, as an agent for intervention.</P>

      <P>In the administration of the grants schemes under the Industrial Development Act, 1969, the Industrial Development Authority give grants for new industries in all cases where the merits of the project justify it and where the criteria laid down in the Act are complied with.  Re-equipment grants are approved only in cases where it is necessary to adapt to meet competition from outside and the main reason for withholding these grants from an industry is that the threat of such competition is not sufficiently great in the particular industry to warrant payment of a grant.

      <P>I will, with the Ceann Comhairle's permission.  In relation to new industrial grants there is the question of the non-availability of grants for the soft drink industry.  The motor assembly industry is involved, the ground limestone industry, the grain-drying industry.  Then there are a number of sensitive industries where individual cases must be considered on their merits.  These cover spinning and weaving, jute, bacon factories, food processing, milling, cold storage, foot-wear, concrete products, timber products, printing and publishing, fertilisers and bakery.  Timber products can be so wide-reaching as to take in joinery.</P>

      <P>The Marathon Petroleum Co.

The Geological Survey collects and examines all available geological and other relevant data for the purpose of assessing the prospects of finding natural gas deposits in our continental shelf but the final assessment of the prospects must depend on further exploration of the area by holders of leases or licences.  It is not the present policy of the Government that the State should itself undertake the exploitation of minerals and this would apply also to natural gas or oil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. What the solicitors concerned say is that the documents were posted.  The Land Registry, however, operates a system whereby the receipt of incoming documents is recorded as soon as they arrive in the Registry and I am informed by the Registrar that there is no record of the receipt of the documents. The Registrar is, therefore, satisfied that the documents were not, <Col N="1920" /> in fact, received in the Land Registry. The solicitors concerned are aware of the position.  I am also informed that the only assurance that was given in this case was that the application would be dealt with expeditiously on lodgment of the required documents.</P>
      <P>In pointing out to the solicitors that he requires original documents, the Registrar is exercising his statutory functions and it is not open to me to interfere with the exercise of those functions.  I understand that it is clearly established that original documents must be submitted in all cases of transfers of registered land unless the High Court orders otherwise.  It is to be assumed that the solicitors are aware that it is open to them to apply for the requisite court order if they feel that they can satisfy the court as to the facts.</P>

My reason for doing that was the date of accession to the EEC.</P>
      <P>Unless the country has clear-cut plans for adaptation and industrial development and a social programme, we will drift through the transitional period and find ourselves within the EEC even more uncertain than we are at present as regards economic development.</P>
      <P>The necessary ingredient for the successful preparation of that kind of plan is a decision by the Cabinet to state now in 1973-78 terms the broad objectives of a socio-economic nature which must be recognised as definite commitments by the Government and by the various social partners in the Government. There is a need for adequate institutional arrangements.  I would suggest a complete transition in respect of institutional arrangements particularly those relating to the IDA, to Córas Tráchtála, to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the various State-sponsored bodies whose functions and objects have not been co-ordinated to bring about effective economic development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During that period there may well be a need to establish a powerful, an efficient and a dynamic State holding corporation to assist us in the transition <Col N="1928" /> period and particularly to assist industries that may find themselves in severe adaptation difficulties.  Above all there must be, within the Cabinet, some sort of commitment to bring about change in our own economic structure.  In replies to Dáil questions and in the preparation of legislation that comes before this House there is nothing that indicates any real evidence of any deep discussion within the Cabinet on, for example, regional development or on new kinds of tax incentives that will have to be introduced when we enter the EEC.  A complete change-over will be necessary in respect of export tax incentives. There is no new thinking on any of these matters.  The Taoiseach is a very tired, a very confused and a very upset Corkman who is in charge of a more confused group of individuals within his Cabinet.  There is no common sense of purpose in terms of economic and social strategy.  This is bad for the country.  Certainly, it is bad in so far as the prospects for future employment are concerned.  It means that in this year we are likely to have 7,500 people unemployed as a result of redundancies in industries.</P>
    <P>What is necessary also is the democratic involvement in economic policy by the various national voluntary organisations.  I find that many employer organisations, trading organisations and trade unions within the country are by no means involved in democratic evolution of policy.  It is essential that the various economic sectors and the major single industry firms, as well as the large State-sponsored enterprises in the country be fully involved, fully consulted and fully represented in the development of economic strategy in planning.  So far there has been no involvement of these organisations in Government decision-making.  This is a matter of profound regret and we are now seeing the results of that lack of involvement.</P>
    <P>The overwhelming reaction that one gets from talking to any of the major State-sponsored organisations, whether they be CIE, Aer Lingus, the ESB, the Sugar Company or any other, is that they know what they would like to do.  They may say that they have a <Col N="1929" /> five-year programme.  An Foras Talúntais or the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards may say that they have a particular programme in mind but that, as soon as such a programme reaches the Cabinet, it is shoved off to the National Science Council.  The general reaction from the major State-sponsored organisations is that the various Departments of State operate as autonomous entities in economic development and that there is no consultation involving these national bodies in comprehensive planning.</P>
    <P>Such involvement is a necessity and we must have it in relation to planning in the period 1973 to 1978.  Likewise, the Minister's Department must take some initiative on the introduction of industrial democracy.  I suggest that, initially, they do this within the State-sponsored bodies.  We have heard many pious aspirations and much window dressing from the Taoiseach regarding the need for participation and for consultation.  That is all gone and the Cabinet becomes more and more introverted. The Minister for Foreign Affairs wants to run the show so far as our economic strategy is concerned in terms of admission to the EEC.  The Minister for Finance blows hot and cold month by month.  In the last Budget he imposed massive company taxation but three or four weeks ago that was lifted.  He introduced a Prices and Incomes Bill but, again, this was dropped.</P>
    <P>There is a need for an elementary sense of participatory democracy in the Cabinet but there is a need also to introduce industrial democracy at national level.  In that regard I might give one example.  This is an example that was rather berated in the House by Deputy Seán French.  In respect of An Taisce Stáit I pointed out that where there were very substantial sums of money invested by the State in private companies, there should be broadly-based nominated directors to keep an eye on the taxpayers' money. I raised the matter in relation to a particular company in Cork and I pointed out that the Government had appointed four company directors.  I suggested that there should be a worker <Col N="1930" /> representative on that board but I merely got a negative reaction from the workers concerned.  From the Minister for Finance, I got an inspired reaction and, no doubt, the reaction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce would have been the same as his.</P>
    <P>Therefore, an idea of national participation by national organisations in the Government agencies seems to have got a bad knock in recent years. I have asked also that there be an increasing attempt by the State to exercise more influence over banking and credit procedures, systems and policies.  It is something of a joke that the Central Bank pronounce on high their particular version of economic policy.</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industries follow suit, giving their interpretation. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions chase off to the Minister and the Taoiseach to give their interpretation. Finally the Minister has some kind of a reaction.  There seems to be no basic cohesion and no basic system under which these organisations and the Ministers could consult rather than having the post-mortems on referenda held in the newspapers after the events.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of profound regret that the repeated suggestions of the Labour Party that a national economic council should be set up and should be in operation by now were not adopted.  The Department would be represented on that council.  That council should now be debating the question of redundancy and advancing plans on policies to the Government and to the nation dealing with the question of unemployment and under-employment and the slowing down in industrial development.  It has not been set up simply because, for the past three or four months, the Minister for Finance has been obdurate in trying to dictate to the trade union movement as to who they should nominate to a national economic council.  The Minister should use his influence to bring the Minister for Finance to heel and he should make sure that his Department and the various organisations that consult with his Department are adequately represented on the NEC when it is set up.  It should be established. <Col N="1931" /> It is a bit late now but better late than never.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for control over the acquisition of Irish industrial enterprises by foreign groups.  When the Minister promised us legislation relating to mergers I think he was talking with his tongue in his cheek. He has assured us that he will give us prices legislation and merger legislation and legislation relating to the new State company, Fóir Stáit.  He hopes to have all this through the House by 16th December.  Surely the Minister knows that, with the tremendous backlog of Dáil work and the large number of Bills which we have yet to get through, the likelihood of such legislation going through on this side of Christmas is rather remote.</P>
    <P>We will find ourselves in a situation in 1972 in which the Fianna Fáil Government will propose to lead a rather stagnant and unprepared economy into the Common Market with little more protection than the kind of flimsy draft protocol which the Minister for Foreign Affairs brought back in respect of the export tax reliefs.  He did not even mention the words in the protocol itself.</P>
    <P>We demand a comprehensive public review of the state preparedness of Irish industry for entry into the EEC. I am not convinced that this is being done.  If we are to enter we must prepare for it through the operation of an effective five year plan during the period of 1973 to 1978.  Such a plan is quite inconceivable under Fianna Fáil rule.  It is not on the cards.  I do not think the Government have the capacity or the energy, or the competence to even think in those terms.  They have had their chance to do so.</P>
    <P>Through the decade from 1961 to 1971 there was a proliferation of surveys in preparation for the future. From 1961&mdash;and that is a solid ten years ago now&mdash;until 1964 we had the Committee on Industrial Organisation publishing reports on the main industrial sectors.  In those reports they surveyed the problem areas in Irish industry.  They made suggestions and put forward measures that should be taken to adapt to free trade conditions. <Col N="1932" /> Nothing happened during that period. By and large the Government did not take the necessary steps to implement effectively the many recommendations in the CIO reports.  No positive programme of reorganisation and adjustment was adopted by the Government. They left each Department to get on as best they could with whatever arrangements they could make with industry.</P>
    <P>In 1967 we had the Confederation of Irish Industries, more in desperation I think than anything else, undertaking a study of the prospects for industry generally in a free trade Europe.  It published its own findings and recommended its own strategy at the time in its own publication called <i>Challenge.</i> In 1968 there was another proliferation of reports.  I read through them. Before I came into this House I had to read them and consult the trade unions on them.  If we take on the one hand the 1961 report and on the other hand the 1971 report of the CIO on the one industry, and go through the recommendations contained in those reports, we find whole areas where very little has been done by the Government. So far we have had reports on the women's outer wear industry, the tanning and dressing of leather industry, the metal trade industry, the men's outer wear industry, the paper and paper products, fruit and vegetables, hosiery and knitwear industries. We have had those reports as supplements, one might say, of the report of the CIO from 1961-1963.</P>
    <P>One almost calls into question the purpose of going ahead with this kind of exercise.  A report is published and nothing seems to happen.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say: &ldquo;There is not very much the Department can do.  It is essentially a matter for the industries themselves.  We only exhort; we only give guidance; we only try to persuade people; there is not very much more we can do beyond the publication of the reports.&rdquo;  We must establish in Irish industry the kind of structure that will bring about the implementation of these reports.  I do not think that is being done.  I do not think it has been fully attempted by the Government.  I appreciate that there were major difficulties.  I remember that when I was in the trade union <Col N="1933" /> movement there were major difficulties in getting together industrial organisations to implement the recommendations in these reports on a co-operative basis.</P>
    <P>I refer particularly to the adaptation councils and the proposals which emerged for the setting up of economic development councils for Irish industry. I accept that a great deal of bitchiness went on at the time between the interested organisations.  I accept that there is an undue amount of cynicism at the idea of setting up any kind of new organisation to implement Government recommendations.  I accept that a new organisation might well cut across some of the existing trade organisations.  For all that, I believe that the original proposition to set up a whole range of economic development councils for industry based on a coherent national plan held out hope for the realistic implementation of the recommendations contained in those reports.</P>
    <P>The fact that this did not happen shows the extent to which planning has fallen into disrepute.  We have an ironical situation where the Confederation of Irish Industry seems to be once again rather taken up with the idea of planning.  Originally it was not very co-operative in that field either with the Department of Industry and Commerce or with the Department of Finance.  Now that the Confederation of Irish Industry experience, at first hand, the effects of free trade they are beginning to see the very urgent need to get together to devise some form of planning and organisational set-up which would assist industry and ensure that the opportunities open to industry will be fully availed of. Unless the Minister takes the initiative we will find in the next few years that redundancy in industry will be much more severe.  It is my strong belief that this could happen unless remedial action is taken.</P>
    <P>I was rather interested in Deputy Donegan's comments relating to the EEC and the prospects facing the Labour Party in particular in relation to the Common Market.  I find myself in some agreement with what he says. The Minister devoted several pages of <Col N="1934" /> his speech to the prospects facing Irish industry.  I would find myself saying bluntly to the Minister and the Cabinet, to coin a slogan, &ldquo;No entry on the known Fianna Fáil terms&rdquo;.  I would not be attracted towards the kind of terms that have been negotiated to date.  On the information available to me, the Department of Industry and Commerce does not seem to be playing a very active role in the negotiations which seem to have been taken over almost exclusively by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>In the absence of hard information from the Government, in the absence of a White Paper, any political party would be stupid to commit itself as being in favour of general entry or to say how it will react to a referendum. Having regard to our comparitively under-developed industry, it must be clearly understood by those negotiating on our behalf that ours is not a normal situation in relation to other European economies.  Our income per head of the population is about one-half of that of any one of the Six.  As a member we will be a very small mini-region in Europe.  We are not prophets of doom as suggested by the Minister but I am expressing legitimate fears of the Labour Party because of the fact that we would be only 1 per cent of the population of an enlarged community and because of that and because we produce only about one-half of 1 per cent of the GNP of the Ten we require special long-term arrangements and exceptionally sympathetic and favourable transitional arrangements.  We do not seem to have got them.  Certainly, the Department of Industry and Commerce does not seems to have done very much in getting these arrangements.</P>
    <P>Of course the Taoiseach waits for the day when he may have a kind of referendum-cum-general election on the EEC and then get his party out of current difficulties.  I do not think the country will be so sympathetic to him.  I find it rather amusing when I hear balderdash on the part of Ministers about regional development and regional planning in this country arising out of the EEC.  If we, at single <Col N="1935" /> party Government level, cannot advance any kind of policy in relation to regional economic development in this country, how can we hope to convey to the EEC what we want in terms of regional economic development?</P>
    <P>One has only to contrast the current annual report of the IDA with statements made by various Ministers on economic development to realise the terrible dilemma facing the IDA on the question of regional economic development. In the current report, which has been referred to by the Minister, the IDA say that it is the stated objective of the Government that the aim of our regional policy should be to achieve broadly based regional expansion and to keep population disruption as low as possible; that the IDA plans, regionalwise, will cover the period 1972-1976 and will take 1971 as the base year for regional population and employment projections; that the plans would spell out the extra industrial jobs which must be created in each region over the next five years; that they will analyse the problems and prospects within each region affecting industrial development.</P>
    <P>They will also examine economic and social development in each region and assess the availability of supporting services for industry.  Off go the IDA.  Jolly good luck to it.  It is better to have the IDA trying to make up its mind as to what kind of regional economic strategy the country should adopt than to have the Cabinet arguing the toss, as the Minister for Finance does.  The IDA has now gone ahead and has established a regional organisation, involving the setting up of the new regional headquarters of the IDA, seven regional offices throughout the country, the mid-west region, Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary being administered for the IDA by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and the eastern region, Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow being administered from the IDA headquarters in Dublin.  That is a magnificent development.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce was asked recently what the <Col N="1936" /> Government's policy was in relation to regional economic development.  He replied last week in the Dáil and referred us to the 1969 statement of the Government on regional economic planning.  I have the quotation here of the 4th November.  This is an historic statement now.  I quote:</P>
    <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement issued by the Government on the 19th May, 1969.  That statement indicated that as an objective of the Government&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>et cetera, et cetera</i>&mdash;a lot of waffle.  He went on to say that an inter-departmental committee are at present considering future regional policy, that they have before them the reports furnished by the Regional Development Committee and that they are also aware of the work being done by the IDA on regional industrial planning.  The Minister said he expected to receive a report from the committee shortly.</P>
    <P>It is rather peculiar democracy when the State-sponsored body does the thinking, transmits it to the Cabinet and the Cabinet then proceeds to argue the toss as to whether there will be a growth centre in Letterkenny.  Presumably, since Deputy Blaney has now been screwed to the ground, his political preoccupation about a growth centre in Letterkenny will receive very low priority.  It may be in Clara or in Tullamore or in Portarlington or in Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure where we are going, but I suppose it will depend on the geographical location of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in future Governments.  Public servants of this country have my undying admiration for their capacity, which they have in rare abundance&mdash;the Irish people are not very much endowed with it&mdash;for profound patience and the capacity to know that it is wise and desirable to keep their counsel.  Having read through the various CIO reports and the reports on growth centres of the National Industrial and Economic Council between 1964 and 1971 and when one sees the wry smile on the face of men like Mr. Whitaker when the words are mentioned, one begins to appreciate that there is no strategy for <Col N="1937" /> industrial development.  I do not know what the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dr. Hillery, says in Brussels about Irish regional planning, because the Government have not pronounced on this matter.  I asked the Minister only a few days ago if he would make available to Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas the eight regional industrial plans of the IDA when completed by that authority.  The Minister replied at column 1419, Volume 256, of the Official Report of 9th November, 1971:</P>
    <P>When the drafting of these plans has been completed by the IDA it will be necessary for the Government to consider them in the context of regional policy as a whole.  When this has been done it will be circulated to Members of both Houses and made public.</P>
    <P>I do not want to remind the IDA of the terrible fate that befell Buchanan and the many other reports that were prepared on the subject.  However, at least we have this much consolation, that the IDA, taking its courage in its hands, has gone ahead and carved up the country appropriately, as it saw fit, for example, if I may quote the annual report for 1969-70:</P>
    <P>The regional offices will provide a wide range of services for existing and newly-established industry in each region.  These will include information and advisory services covering such matters as grants and other incentives, site and factory availability, labour availability, water supply, housing, communications and educational and training facilities.  An after-care service for newly-established industrial projects will also be provided regionally.  The offices will be responsible for administering the IDA industrial estates, advance factories and industrial housing in their regions.</P>
    <P>The principal aims of regional planning are ...</P>
    <P>At least one can be thankful that they have taken the initiative, and I wish them well.  The former Chairman, Mr. <Col N="1938" /> Walsh, and Mr. Killeen have the capacity to make this contribution and to play the politics of the game well. As Mr. Killeen and the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Colley, know, both of them have played the game rather well in the past in relation to restructuring but not without comment and not without it being fully known.</P>
    <P>Having made these critical comments, which I think are well merited, on the absence of regional development, I wish to deal with a few remaining points in the Minister's speech.  There is a need for a further evaluation within the IDA of the small industries programme.  While the programme covers the country as a whole and has made some satisfactory progress, we could usefully have a reassessment of the extent to which it contributes effectively to the provision of new jobs.  It was launched in 1967 to provide advice and assistance to Irish entrepreneurs in establishing and expanding their small manufacturing enterprises.  I have some doubts about the extent to which it has helped the development of small industries in designated areas.  The former Minister, Mr. Colley, tended to make a political plaything out of the small industries programme but then Mr. Colley has not grown up in terms of economic development.  It might be useful to re-examine this programme.</P>
    <P>The House should be gravely concerned about the very serious development in regard to our exports to the United States, which run at some 13 per cent of our total exports, £60 million a year.  I believe the measures announced by President Nixon in August will have a more serious effect than the Minister has stated in pages 32 and 33 of his statement.  I would hope there would be a very special effort made by the Minister, in consultation with CTT, to ensure that we, at least, maintain our existing level of exports to the United States and, if possible, increase it.  I would be happy if, over the next 12 months, we were to maintain the existing proportion, but at the moment the prospects do not look very bright, and if the measures taken by the United States begin to bite <Col N="1939" /> more severly it could lead to more redundancies here.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate CTT on their efforts in the export field.  They are a dynamic organisation and have achieved very satisfactory results with not a great deal of assistance from the Government.  I am glad to note they have continued the work of promotion against very difficult odds in the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>I do not see any policy directives or guidelines from the Government to them.  The organisation have been working in a vacuum but they do not seem to be getting assistance along the lines of economic development.  An effort should be made to supply them with the collective views of manufacturers, trade unions and other organisations concerned rather than to have CTT scavenging around the various firms to gather economic intelligence. There is great need for co-ordination in that field and the Government could give much greater help.</P>
    <P>I am worried also about the role of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  We have been rather mealy-mouthed in this respect and have never made up our minds in regard to co-ordination of industrial research throughout the country.  We have the development by the IDA of a research park at Naas, admittedly for the benefit of international companies coming in here, but far more money could have been provided for the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards so that they could do much more valuable work for Irish industry.  I do not regard as very encouraging the reply given by the Minister to a question on 9th November that research and development grants approved to date had been in respect of only 23 firms.  I consider this to be far too small.  I suggest that there should be greater liaison between the IDA and the Institute for Research and Standards.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the volume of criticism one can now hear of Government policy in regard to failure to co-ordinate the organisations in the industrial field, to co-ordinate their <Col N="1940" /> work and their policies in an effort to ensure they do not overlap.  Overlapping in this respect has gone on for many years, and one does not need a crystal ball to appreciate the extent of this overlapping in the day-to-day work of these agencies.  Through lack of moral courage in this area there is a situation in which many officers, senior staff of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the various other Departments, spend their time running from meeting to meeting, trying to prepare memoranda and reports for the many agencies we have in this relatively small country.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there should be more co-ordination between the IDA, Córas Tráchtála, AnCO, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the others.  From reading annual reports of these agencies and from listening to replies and statements in the House by the Minister, it seems to me that these companies are individually pursuing their own tasks, possibly from a sense of national identity and purpose, and their collective impact could be far greater if we had a tough and courageous Minister, a tough Cabinet and particularly a tough Taoiseach&mdash;and remember he was Minister for Industry and Commerce at a critical stage of development.  We need to have a long cool look at the policy being implemented in respect of these organisations with a view to ridding them of the confused functions and the proliferation of work which is bewildering them at the moment.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge that the Government should take their courage in their hands immediately and implement the promise they made to co-ordinate and to rationalise these organisations' work so as to ensure that the £30 million to £40 million they yearly dispense to Irish industry will be effectively distributed and effectively administered. It is to that end that I urge a strong and thorough-going root and branch evaluation of the work of these organisations. This has not been undertaken because the towel was thrown in two years ago by Deputy Colley when the going became rough.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with a worry I have <Col N="1941" /> in relation to the export tax incentive scheme and the recent results at Brussels, confirmed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I ask the Minister to produce the text of the agreement in this respect between Ireland and the Community.  We have had assurances from the Minister in reply to questions and I should like to quote Deputy B. Lenihan on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this regard:</P>
    <P>To quote the Minister:</P>
    <P>The position has been clearly established that export tax reliefs are necessary for our economic and industrial development and that we can continue them as based on my intensive discussions with the Community on 19th October, the understanding reached there and the agreement in the text of the proposed Protocol.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>As regards the reference in my statement to the Community on the 19th October on commitments in relation to export tax reliefs, the position established is that firms in respect of which commitments had been entered into at the time of the completion by the Commission after accession of its examination of our industrial incentives will continue to benefit from export tax reliefs for the full period of entitlement under existing legislation.</P>
    <P>I would await the White Paper before giving formal credence to the Minister on that statement because, certainly, if one takes the introductory statement by the Community Delegation of 19th October, 1971, it is not very explicit. It merely says:</P>
    <P>The Irish Delegation has also explained how the exporting industries are supported by tax relief.  In this respect it is also a question of measures the aim of which is to do away with economic and social imbalances by the development of industry.</P>
    <P>It goes on to state:</P>
    <P>With regard to State aids for regional purposes it should be pointed out that, under the terms of Article (3) (a) aid to promote the <Col N="1942" /> economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious under-employment may be considered to be compatible with the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Again it is not terribly explicit in terms of the Minister's statement.</P>
    <P>The text of the Protocol itself is, with due respect to the Minister, a lot of cliché-style waffle.  I will read these paragraphs for the Minister, because he has been congratulated by Deputy Donegan for protecting Irish export tax reliefs for Irish industry.  The very short Protocol says that the member states:</P>
    <P>Recall that the fundamental objectives of the Community consist in the steady improvement of the living standards and working conditions of the peoples of the Member States, together with the harmonious development of their economies by reducing the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less favoured regions;</P>
    <P>Take note of the fact that the Irish Government has embarked upon the implementation of a policy of industrialisation and economic development designed to align the standard of living in Ireland with those of other European nations and to eliminate under-employment while progressively evening out regional differences in levels of development; Recognise it to be in their common interest that the objectives of this policy be so attained;</P>
    <P>Agree to recommend to this end that the Community institutions implement all the means and procedures laid down by the Treaties, particularly by making adequate use of the Community resources intended for the realisation of the Community's above-mentioned objectives;</P>
    <P>Recognise in particular that, in the application of Articles 92 and 93, it will be necessary to take into account the objectives of economic expansion and improvement of the population's standard of living.</P>
    <P>I do not think that one has to travel to Brussels to get that in the form of a <Col N="1943" /> Protocol.  Frankly, it does not mean a great deal if this is to be the Protocol and the magic formula.</P>
    <P>I hope that, when the White Paper is published, we will have some background data and more detail of the precise agreement reached between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Community on the continuation of our export tax relief system for existing industries at 1990; and of course any new industry coming in between now and the date of accession would have the benefit of the current system. If that is so, the text of whatever letter or minute of whatever arrangement was reached between the Minister and the Community should be published and made available.  It certainly is not available in the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, apart from the statement:</P>
    <P>I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the question would arise in this connection of the commitments which we had previously entered into.  We shall, of course, have to honour these commitments and we shall be ready to discuss in all its aspects, the changeover to whatever new incentive system is devised and we shall collaborate in solving these problems in an appropriate way.</P>
    <P>There is no paragraph, no sentence, in the statement by the Minister to the ministerial meeting of 19th October which indicates that there has been acceptance by the Community of the Irish system of export tax reliefs, and frankly until I see it, I intend to keep an open mind on it, because the greatest single advantage we have and the most enticing inducement we have for economic development is of course the 20 year tax holiday.  Whatever we have, we certainly have that exemption from tax on profit from exports made in Ireland for 15 years and partial exemption for a further five years. That inducement has been a major factor in the development of exportoriented industries in this country and I certainly would be extremely concerned that it should be diluted in any way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1944" /> The Minister is to be commended for his promise to bring in new legislation relating to prices.  I think he was a bit sweeping when he said in his opening statement:</P>
    <P>All proposals to increase prices will be submitted to the Commission for consideration and the Commission will furnish me with a recommendation on each such proposal.</P>
    <P>If one contrasts that with the statement made by the Minister in public on September 9th, one cannot see that that is the precise procedure intended, as I gather from the Minister that the present requirement of three months advance notice of intention to increase prices will be modified so as to require one month's advance notice and, as I understand it as well, a proposed price increase could be put into effect on the expiration of the month's notice unless the commission advise that it should be the subject of a detailed examination.</P>
    <P>I certainly welcome the introduction of this legislation but I would point out very strongly that it is belated, that it is years overdue, and that it has&mdash;to use a Blaney term&mdash;been screwed out of the Minister because of the current extreme situation in respect of price increases.  It is not necessary to be a Deputy to point out that over the past two years prices have been rising at an unprecedented rate.  Between November, 1963, and November, 1970, alone the consumer price index went up by 18½ per cent.  In the past 12 months prices have gone up by well over 10 per cent and, while prices have been rising rapidly in most countries over this period, the increases in prices here have been significantly greater than the increases in any of the other countries.  The price increases we are now experiencing over the past 12 months give rise to concern, and in some cases even to alarm.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of some serious concern to the House to note that the prices legislation, which the Minister now promises to bring in and hopes to circulate in the near future, will not begin to have effect before at least mid-1972.  It will be at least mid-1972 before it begins to have an effect and <Col N="1945" /> before the surveillance system of prices comes into operation effectively. It should be stressed that in the national agreement of the employerlabour conference the parties agreed that it was essential that the rate of increase in cost and in prices should be moderated substantially.  That agreement has been in operation for a long time but there has been very little real action by the Government in respect of excessive price increases.  The Labour Party accept the view that the mere setting-up of surveillance machinery does not of itself prevent higher prices particularly with regard to imported goods or materials.  We cannot do a great deal where money incomes outstrip productivity.  There are well-defined limitations on the extent to which price rises generally can be controlled.  Had an effective system of price surveillance been in operation over the past 12 months, price increases would have been limited to a minimum and price or charges increases without justification would have been prevented.</P>
    <P>The public at large have good reason to believe that, in some instances, prices have risen on an unjustifiable basis, on an excessive basis and on a selective basis in some industries. There is need for the Minister to bring in this legislation as a matter of urgency.  This House, instead of driving ourselves crazy about the price of honour, would have done better work if the Government had realised the seriousness of the position and put legislation through the House instead of engaging in power politics on the part of Fianna Fáil.  We have had an obsession with this kind of thing over the past two years.</P>
    <P>The Minister has shelved the proposal of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for the setting-up of local price committees.  In the submission made to the Minister by the Congress it was pointed out that public involvement in the price surveillance machinery was needed.  It was suggested that this should take the form of local price committees which should be set up in the main centres of population throughout the country and that these <Col N="1946" /> committees should be representative of the Chambers of Commerce, related local organisations of local trades' councils and of appropriate voluntary organisations such as the Irish Housewives Association, and that they should also include public representatives, who should exercise some influence on prices at local level. Certain statutory functions should devolve on these committees.  There is no reason why, in a very large number of trading establishments, adequate price lists should not be displayed. With the introduction of decimal currency there has been no effort on the part of many traders to publish and maintain price lists in public areas of their premises.</P>
    <P>Many tourists have told me of going into lounge bars and of finding enormous differences in prices as between one style of premises and another.  The price of a drink varies from one type of premises to another and we have pub-style premises, singing-pub premises, take-away food stalls, ballad-singing pubs and hotels. There is a wide variation in drink prices.  We speak of tourists not coming in, but many tourists, who have come, have complained that on the east coast they have been charged varying prices for drinks and food and that price lists were not displayed openly.  Prices and service charges should be clearly displayed.  Local price committees could watch such matters.  Local citizens would also be involved in this work, thus ensuring adequate price surveillance at local level.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not rejected the proposition of Congress for local committees but has said that he has requested the new commission to consider the proposal.  It may be some time before the commission examines this point.  I was disappointed to hear that the proposal of Congress that the National Prices Commission should take over the functions and powers of the Fair Trade Commission was not acceptable to the Minister.  The Minister has decided on the National Prices Commission as a &ldquo;never-never land&rdquo; between the prices section and another section of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Presumably <Col N="1947" /> staff arrangements have now been made.  I welcome the setting-up of the commission and hope that the legislation will pass through the House quickly.</P>
    <P>The members of the House fully appreciate the action being taken by such organisations as the Irish Housewives Association.  With the absence of effective local price commissions it is understandable that these organisations should engage in certain actions at local level, such as asking housewives to omit from their shopping lists certain items on which they feel they have excessive price increases.  There are wide disparities which are noticeable. I asked the Taoiseach on the 20th October to give a list of the items included on the consumer price index which increased in price by more than 15 per cent over the 12 months ending 21st August.  The Taoiseach gave me the percentage change on all the items. The list shows that sirloin steak rose in price by 16 per cent; corn beef, 16 per cent; whiting 14 per cent; cured fish 16 per cent; tomatoes 134 per cent; carrots 26 per cent; turnips 21 per cent; cabbage 30 per cent; cauliflowers 31 per cent.  I do not think one can blame the National Wage Agreement for that kind of increase in a 12-month period. Margarine prices increased by 13 per cent; apples 27 per cent; oranges 18 per cent; sugar 13 per cent; jelly 5 per cent; chocolate bars 17 per cent; minerals 13 per cent; women's outer clothing, coats, woollen-lined, lowpriced 16 per cent; two-piece suits, worsted readymade 11 per cent; thread 15 per cent; coal 15 per cent.  We also have today's newspaper announcement of a substantial increase in the price of coal.  Rates and water charges in owner-occupied dwellings over the past 12 months have gone up by 22 per cent, which is quite substantial.  These are the type of increases which we certainly feel should be investigated by the Minister because they have certainly had a dramatic impact on the standard of living of workers in this country.  It is about time that legislation to control those prices was circulated in this House and that we got down to debating it.  It does not look <Col N="1948" /> as though we will have it in operation for at least another six to nine months.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the Minister to include under the system of price control new houses, all services, professional fees, insurance charges and the profits of importers and distributors under a new system.  It is high time that these areas were covered in legislation. There is great urgency to complete the legislation relating to the control and investigation of monopolies, takeovers and mergers.  There have been some very questionable developments relating to take-overs in Irish industry in the past two years.  As well as take-overs by foreign monopolies there have been some quite dubious internal absorptions and realisation of assets by some of our brighter new industrial rich in this country and I am sure Deputy Donegan knows whom I am referring to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

      <P>Taca and some people who have now emigrated with the loot.  As it is the tradition of the House not to name such persons I will wait for the legislation.  There is urgent need for the Minister to be in a position to make orders for the prohibition of mergers or take-overs or in the case of monopolies where the breaking up of a business and the sale of the assets is not in the national interest and the public interest and particularly where such take-overs would restrict competition in a manner which would be quite contrary to the public interest.  I have a feeling that the Minister, as he has been in regard to prices legislation, is coming in too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>His predecessor was asked three years ago to do something about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept that. I believe the Minister now appreciates that, for example, in the distributive trade there have been very substantial realignments, take-overs, mergers and rationalisation, some of it not of an entirely desirable nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to point out that the Minister's predecessor, the late Seán <Col N="1949" /> Lemass, had no hesitation in bringing in the Control of Manufactures Act, 1936 and successive Governments have made it quite clear that foreign control of certain key industries in this country was not particularly welcome in the public interest.  I welcome foreign investment into Ireland but I do not welcome the take-over of domestic outlets, particularly in the distributive trade or of certain manufacturing companies.  I do not wish to see externally controlled monopolies developing in this country.  We have to have a coexistence in this country of native Irish capital blending in successfully with outside foreign concerns who are contributing to investment in this country.  We have to have balance in this matter and I do not think the Minister has ensured that that balance has been maintained to date.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the final pages of the Ministers statement, where he referred to the fact that he is about to grant to 16 companies non-exclusive petroleum prospecting licences for the general surveying of the balance of our designated shelf area.  I welcome both mineral, oil and gas exploration generally. I feel the Minister should take a very careful look at the continental shelf area in respect of the non-exclusive petroleum prospecting licences which are now being sought.  I do not know the 16 companies and I do not know very much about it but in the public interest I feel one should ask the Minister for further information, more particularly as the company he named, Marathon Petroleum Ireland Limited, have had some recent information from the three test wells in the area under their control off the Old Head of Kinsale.</P>
    <P>There is need for the Minister to give more information on this subject. He must ensure, as the British Government and European Governments have ensured, that the greatest possible benefits accrue from the commercial exploitation of gas fields off our coast. Close surveillance will have to be kept over all stages of the exploration. There was public criticism voiced of the original agreement by Seán Lemass and Marathon Oil.</P>
    <P>Since we have been talking <i>ad <Col N="1950" /> nauseam</i> in this House about Northern Ireland, I should have thought the Minister would have taken this opportunity of making some reference to the further development of trade between north and south.  The majority of people in both areas believe that greater progress would be made if there were more co-operation, more co-ordination and a closer exchange of trade.  We have the same soil, the same climate and the same proximity to markets.  We have problems in raising capital for industrial development. Northern Ireland could teach us lessons about industrial growth centres, industrial training, planning and housing. There is a common field for action between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  There could be joint promotional campaigns.  Some of our transport problems could be solved by greater co-operation.  Joint research bodies would pay a dividend on both sides of the Border.  I trust the Minister will hold out some hope of such co-operation and co-ordination.  At the beginning of the 1960s it looked as if we were on the point of a major break-through. The late Seán Lemass certainly made an effort in that direction. So did the present Taoiseach when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  This might be an auspicious time to initiate a closer liaison and we should not, as it were, throw in the towel.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party spokesman, Deputy Michael O'Leary, is in Belfast at a meeting of the Labour Party there, to which he was invited, and last evening he asked me to substitute for him in this debate and to put on record the reason for his absence today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally my contribution is brief but, because of the excellence of the Minister's speech, covering every single aspect of industry, I shall not be able to follow my normal practice.  I congratulate the Minister on his speech.  It is an excellent record of what has been done.  I hope&mdash;it may be a faint hope&mdash;that some of the Opposition Deputies will read it to see what is happening in Ireland today.  I am very optimistic. Not so long ago in this country a growth rate of 3 per cent would have <Col N="1951" /> been regarded as very good compared with the stagnation of the 1950s when there was no growth rate at all.</P>
      <P>Employment is increasing.  It is regrettable that there are people who are out of work, but the regret is tempered somewhat by the fact that we are going through a transitional period and it is encouraging to know that more jobs are actually being created than are being lost.  When there was talk initially about entering the EEC the Government stated frankly that there would be a certain amount of redundancy because of rationalisation. Only a week ago I was listening to a programme on the radio.  The bacon industry was being discussed. There are something like 38 bacon factories in the country and the fact is that 10 factories could do the job more efficiently and in a manner from which better dividends would accrue to the industry and to the workers. Rationalisation is a must and I am confident the Government will not shirk their duty in encouraging rationalisation in industry.  Where workers lose employment as a result of rationalisation it should be possible to provide alternative employment in factories in the same or contiguous areas.</P>
      <P>We have here today very solidly based industries, industries which came in here with the prospect of the EEC in mind and also because of the very generous grants available.  The grants themselves would not have been sufficient without the possibility of Ireland some day going into EEC. When it seemed that EEC entry was off applications dropped considerably but once the talks re-opened the tide turned with more applications than previously.  Also, with the announcement that the Government, through skilful negotiation, have managed to retain the same benefits for industry coming here&mdash;tax free concessions <i>et cetera</i>&mdash;up to our accession to EEC, I believe that we shall have many more industries coming here as a result of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industrial organisation has proceeded very rapidly.  We have exhorted industrialists to modernise.  We have <Col N="1952" /> offered all forms of incentive grants for this purpose.  The index to the Minister's speech refers to industrial grants, the small industries programme, re-equipment grants, technical assistance and so on.  We must adapt.  I do not think there is an industrialist in the country today who does not realise that, if he is in difficulty, he can immediately get in touch with the Department which will guide him as to whom he should see about his particular problem.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see from the Minister's speech that these efforts to encourage industrialists to adapt and move with the times are to be intensified.  I referred to this matter some time ago here when I said that there may be factories in the country which are not modernising and perhaps not aware of their responsibility to their employees, and that, possibly, the Department should cast an eye over such factories that did not appear to be moving with the times and give them the necessary encouragement.</P>
    <P>One of the skills which we have learned rapidly in the past ten years is marketing: producing goods is no use if you have not market expertise to sell them.  Therefore, I am happy to compliment and give credit to the fine people we have in the IDA and in Córas Tráchtála who are doing a first class job.  To suggest that they need encouragement from the Government or that the Government have not a sufficiently strong policy is, I think, incorrect.  These people fully understand Government policy and are interpreting it in a manner of which the Government can well be proud.</P>
    <P>In regard to the voluntary wage agreement earlier this year I believe the workers themselves now realise that this kind of arrangement is far more satisfactory for the economy as a whole than granting of large wage increases to certain sectors causing other sectors to seek similar increases so that the cost of living goes up immediately and the wage increase they got is worth nothing.  A planned voluntary wage agreement is the only thing, in my view, that can really work for the benefit of the whole community.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that <Col N="1953" /> the impression seemed to be widespread that redundancies arising through closures in manufacturing industry were due primarily, if not entirely, to the removal of protection under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  I must agree with that: this is the impression given, wilfully, I think, in many cases.  The Minister does not deny that the freeing of trade has been a factor in some of the closures but it is only one.  As he says, there are many other factors also responsible, such as product obsolescence&mdash;it is not necessary to repeat what the Minister said but I hope it will be recorded as fully as possible in tomorrow's newspapers because it is informative.</P>
    <P>Without the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement we might be in serious trouble because, if we were now getting ready to go into EEC without having had to ginger up our industries, we would be in a difficult position.  I have not heard from Brussels that there is any reluctance on the part of EEC to accept Ireland because of the state of our economy. Ours is an expanding economy which will continue to expand and at a faster rate than in the last few years because conditions throughout the world have eased somewhat.</P>
    <P>I was as disappointed as many others when the US Government found it necessary to put on a 10 per cent surcharge.  For a country fighting hard to increase its exports it was pretty tough but it is probably better that they should impose this 10 per cent surcharge than that the American economy should collapse through failing to act in an economic crisis.  We should be in far greater difficulty then.</P>
    <P>I do not mean to imply that we are in dire straits now.  I think we have dealt with this matter very well and I should like to refer to the magazine <i>Export</i> issued by CTT, Volume 5, No. 2, 1971.  I shall read a couple of paragraphs from the leading article &ldquo;Action Stations&rdquo; in which they said:</P>
    <P>In spite of difficulties 1970 was, in terms of total sales, a record year for Irish exporters in the US market. Subsequent increases gave promise of still better results in 1971; but even so the present year has been <Col N="1954" /> overshadowed from the start by the protectionist threat, with a growing demand from American industry for the extension of restrictions on imports of competing products.  The fears aroused by this development were vindicated by the introduction of the 10 per cent surcharge in August.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>From the Irish exporters' point of view the timing of the surcharge was particularly unfortunate in that it came at a juncture when things seemed to be looking up after a period of relative stagnation and tough conditions in the market.  In the event, the effects of the measure have hardly been catastrophic; but it is, and will remain, what any such impost must be: a nuisance, an irritant&mdash;a hindrance to the smooth flow of commerce.</P>
    <P>It goes on:</P>
    <P>One must wish success to the United States Government in its efforts to overcome its problems, galvanise the economy and restore normal trading conditions.  Meanwhile, it looks as though we shall have to run faster, so to speak, to preserve our position in the market.</P>
    <P>When the English surcharge was put on some years ago we had to run faster and I do not think it did us any harm. In fact, as a result of the extra effort which had to be put in by every member of this community, when the surcharge was lifted we did not slide back, we had increased our efficiency and technology to that extent.  Córas Tráchtála are giving extra grants to industrialists to go to America to look further into the field there.  They say here:</P>
    <P>Quite recently, the members of a newly-formed exporters' co-operative group returned to Ireland with satisfactory orders resulting from their initial promotional tour of the USA and Canada.  &ldquo;Our experience has shown&rdquo;, stated this group's spokesman, &ldquo;that, whatever problems and difficulties the surcharge may generate, it need not be a fatal or even <Col N="1955" /> a serious bar to successful exporting.&rdquo; On the contrary, with close attention to such factors as design standards and market requirements and with increased and vigorous promotion &ldquo;Irish exporters should be able not only to maintain but enhance their position&rdquo;.  The surcharge reinforces a lesson that today is as valid as ever.</P>
    <P>It has been said before that for this nation really to get going we must have somebody threaten us.  They used to say that if somebody would threaten to take the Irish language away again maybe more people would learn it.  I know that is irrelevant to this debate but what I am trying to say should be clear.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note in regard to industrial grants that in the year ending 31st March, 1971, grants amounting to £24 million were approved in respect of 78 projects.  These figures include grants totalling £7½ million for projects in the designated areas and grants totalling £16½ million for non-designated areas.  Out of the total of £94 million which has been allocated since the scheme began £32½ million was for designated areas, in other words areas which needed industry.  This shows the success of the Government's policy in scaling the grants in such a way that people will tend to drift towards these areas if at all possible, if their kind of industry will allow it, in order to benefit from the extra grants.</P>
    <P>The small industries programme has been a very considerable success.  Communities and development committees have seen the advantage of working to get industries into their towns.  The success of the re-equipment grants is shown by the number of people who have applied for them.  The Minister has told us that up to March 31st, 1971, a total of 1,018 projects have been approved for grants.  That is pretty good.</P>
    <P>The success of the industrial estates at Waterford and Galway has been fantastic.  The people of Waterford and Galway will be very thankful in the years to come when they see the success of these two schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1956" /> The Department of Industry and Commerce have missed nothing.  They have their advance factory programme which is being administered through the IDA.  The Minister said that a panel of consultants had been set up to advise on the implementation of the advance factory programme of the IDA and a team has been appointed to prepare the ground, to find out where key workers are, <i>et cetera,</i> for any particular industry that may come in.  This is first-class.  There may have been some closures at Shannon Airport but the future prospects for Shannon are very good.  I would love to think that may be some day we might see Douglas and Boeing put up a factory there for the assembling and the servicing of their planes.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister has again increased the capital of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  I should like to see the Minister make this £2 million next year and £3 million the year after.  This is one of the most valuable institutions we have.  The work the institute have performed is excellent.  I wish more members of this House would go and see what they do there.  The aid they have given to industry could not be purchased outside because they take such an interest in every project that is put before them.  They are performing an excellent job and this will become more and more important.  I remember somebody once saying: &ldquo;He who buys <Col N="1957" /> technology is the slave of he who sells it.&rdquo;  When you develop your own &ldquo;know-how&rdquo;, and this institute are helping people in this regard, you are in a very good position to compete with whoever is on the market.  Most times when you get &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; from abroad further developments have taken place in the meantime and the &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; you are getting may possibly have been used previously, although with today's communications maybe not but you pay an awful lot for it.  It is very desirable that bigger grants should be given to this body.</P>
      <P>The growth in our exports has been fantastic.  The exports achieved by several individual firms this year are equivalent to the combined exports of about a dozen firms ten years ago. Semperit which was set up in 1969 have achieved figures in the region of £1 million.  Deputy O'Connell should be pleased about that as it is in his own constituency.</P>

      <P>One can never tell; we might do a deal with them.  In the magazine <i>Export</i> it is stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chrysler Ireland Ltd. is to export Irish assembled cars to the UK.  The <Col N="1958" /> Irish company has been designated a source plant of the parent company, Chrysler United Kingdom Ltd., and initially will be exporting 3,500 cars per annum, representing exports of £2 million.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of anxiety about the car assembly industry but this kind of thing is very encouraging. I am sure many people do not know about it.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that four out of every ten jobs in industry today are dependent on our export trade and the ratio is likely to increase.  Córas Tráchtála have been very energetic in the development of the design centre. The Kilkenny Workshops have produced some wonderful things. I have seen some beautiful Irish silver on sale in our shops which was a great credit to our craftsmen.  Even though we have to employ people from abroad to train our craftsmen their work is proof that Irish people are capable of learning crafts and producing wonderful articles.</P>
    <P>When the IDA are looking at a project one of the biggest problems is the question of management.  A project will only be as good as its members. If management is inefficient the project may never get off the ground. It is important that we spend time and money training management.  On the record before us today I have no doubt that we have gone very far in achieving this.  There is a great shortage of skilled management and we must train people for our future needs.</P>
    <P>There is a greater awareness amongst manufacturers of the importance of selling Irish goods and there is a vague awareness on the part of the public to buy Irish.  People should look at Irish goods first and if they cannot get what they want then they can buy foreign goods but at least their consciences will be a little bit clearer.  In most instances where Irish products are available the quality is as good as if not better than that of the imported article.</P>
    <P>Mining development has been very successful.  The amount of money which the mining companies have had <Col N="1959" /> to invest is phenomenal.  At page 33 of the magazine <i>Export</i> it is stated:</P>
    <P>The creation of new jobs is recognised to be one of Ireland's major priorities and it is significant that the mining industry now directly employs almost 2,000 people, a total which will rise steadily as recent finds are brought into production.</P>
    <P>I am sure everyone will agree with that sentiment.  The article continues:</P>
    <P>Quoting financial figures for the industry, the booklet...</P>
    <P>entitled &ldquo;Tynagh: a case history of mining in Ireland&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>...says that although Ireland's mining industry has only emerged as a viable factor in the economy during the past six years, it now accounts for £20 million of exports. The Tynagh mine has been in production since 1965.  Since then it has produced £27,325,000 worth of concentrates for export.  It has invested a total of £8,756,000 in the development of the mine and paid a total of £2,500,000 in wages.  Other payments inside the Irish economy came to £6,744,000.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable investment despite the risks involved.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that the Shannon Mail Order Service is doing well.  Sales have risen from £9,000 within the first two years to £528,000 in the last year and £132,000 worth of parcels were sold to duty-free shop customers.</P>

    <P>A large expanse of Irish-produced vinyl flooring meets the eye at the arrivals and departures pier to the new passenger/jumbo jet terminal at Shannon Airport, where 5,000 square yards of special mark-resistent Gerflex &ldquo;Classic&rdquo; tiles developed at the company's new £1 million factory at Carrickmacross, County Monaghan have been laid...</P>
    <P>Only a few years ago we would have imported this flooring.  The fact that we are able to produce so many products at home is something we should all be proud of.</P>

    <P>It is amazing that a country which has not an industrial or business background, a country that in all its previous existence has had an agricultural economy, is able to compete in a tough business world and hold its own.

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the work of his Department.  I should like to pay tribute to the patriotic service of the members of the IDA, CTT, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the many other relevant bodies.  The people in these organisations are not only doing this valuable work because it is their job but are doing it for their country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the previous speaker that the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave us a comprehensive statement.  However, I do not share his optimism with regard to the condition of our economy.  In the past few months there have been considerable <Col N="1961" /> redundancies and everybody is anxious about this problem.  There is no sign of any reduction in the unemployment numbers.</P>
      <P>In every country in the world people have been moving from the land into industry and this tendency has been very pronounced in this country.  Forty years ago our economy was based completely on agriculture but this is no longer the case.  Successive Ministers for Industry and Commerce have stated that it is their aim to create more jobs but this has not happened. The employment figures remain at the same level and, although new factories are opened from time to time and the golden key is still handed to the current Minister for Industry and Commerce, there is no escaping the fact that many factories have been closing down.  This may be due to the fact that uneconomic units have been opened.  I have the impression that we have concentrated too much on factories for which we have not the raw materials available in this country. That is probably one of the reasons we face such unsettled conditions with regard to industry.</P>
      <P>I would not go so far as to say we have a very sick economy but we definitely have an ailing economy.  The reason is that in the last four or five years we have moved into a high cost economy.  Prices have been rising but we have been told by many Deputies that this can be offset by more efficient production.  I do not see how we can get more efficient production if we are not able to sell our products.  In order to maintain continuity of production we must market efficiently.  We must face the fact that it costs us more now to produce the materials we manufacture than it did several years ago and because of this we have difficulty in marketing our products at an economic price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I was told that a subsidiary of a leather factory in Gorey were closing down.  I do not know if the factory are closing for good but the employees have been given notice that there will not be continuity of employment for some time to come.  I do not know if the factory are closing <Col N="1962" /> because they were not able to market the goods but the management have said the reason for the closure is lack of orders.  The same thing happened about 12 months ago when a factory was closed for a period of six weeks as they were unable to market their products.  Because of the higher cost of production they were obliged to charge a higher price for their goods than they did a few years ago when they were in full production. In this instance they were manufacturing a high-class product which was not over-produced.  It was simply a question of costs. We must face this fact.</P>
    <P>When the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement was introduced some years ago it was thought that it would be the solution to our problems.  We were told that employment would increase, that emigration would cease and that our economy would get a tremendous boost.  That did not materialise simply because we were not in a position to produce sufficient goods economically in order to overcome the difficulties of free trade between ourselves and the United Kingdom.  This should bring home to those who manage our industrial concerns that we are not competitive. When we were faced, to a small extent. with free trade we did not succeed.  The result has been increased unemployment.</P>
    <P>Whether we are able in the broader complex of the EEC to face those difficulties remains to be seen.  It is probable we will have greater investment of capital here.  We will have it because in the EEC they have not got sufficient labour content to meet existing demands.  With our high unemployment figures and the factory space that is available at a cheaper price than on the Continent, we should have great opportunities for investment; but of course we must get the right type of investment.  We need people who are prepared to come here, invest their money in industry and employ our people.  Such investment would improve and increase our balance of trade and payments.  However, while we may get that sort of investment in the early stages of our accession to the EEC, we will not get it as a continuing process <Col N="1963" /> unless we are able to eradicate all the difficulties and the disadvantages which our industries are facing now.</P>
    <P>The Government have banked all their hopes and desires for the future on our accession to the EEC.  They hope that membership will solve all problems and difficulties, that it will solve the difficulties in relation to our balance of payments, to our balance of trade, to our employment and in relation to continuing emigration.  There is every possibility of doing that but in order to do so we must put our own house in order.  I do not see any sign of that being done.</P>
    <P>This party have advocated, as one of the basic conditions of our policy, that there should be a prices and incomes policy but Fianna Fáil will not accept that advice.  They have talked about trade agreements, about agreements with the trade unions and they have talked a lot about almost everything but they will not talk about the basic need for a prices and incomes policy.  The Minister told us that legislation of this nature is being introduced.  Such legislation would be welcome&mdash;better late than never&mdash; but we must consider all the damage that has been done to our economy by the lack of such a policy.  We have a very high cost of living and much suffering has been caused to many people particularly those in the small income groups because of the inaction of the Government in regard to introducing any proper policy to control prices.  Of course, whenever there is an increase in prices, there will be a demand for increases in wages.  There is no point in making trade agreements unless there is something solid to back them.  I am charging the Government with living on a day-to-day basis. When problems become very bad they introduce a palliative and this is what they are doing in introducing, at this stage, a prices and incomes policy. This is something that should have been done ten or 12 years ago.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us why his party did not introduce such a policy earlier.  They have refused to listen to the counsel offered to them from these benches.  I suppose it is accepted that <Col N="1964" /> advice offered by a major Opposition party is not taken up by a Government party because they are of the opinion that they can run their own affairs better than can anyone else.  However, history has proved that, certainly during the past three or four years, they are unable to run their own affairs.  This is evident from the mess that has been made of the economy.  I do not know whether the reason for this can be attributed to the Government's preoccupation with other matters but, at any rate, no attempt has been made to deal with the country's problems.</P>
    <P>One matter that is causing considerable anxiety to everybody is the fact that big combines, not necessarily outside combines, are taking over smaller businesses.  If one examines these combines closely one will find that while they may be functioning under national names and national directors, a lot of them are based outside the country.  The tendency for firms to be taken over by big outside interests has reached a dangerous stage and nobody seems to have a remedy for the situation. At one stage if somebody wished to come in here and invest a certain amount of money we welcomed him but now the situation is that most small businesses are being taken over and that is what I consider to be the danger zone.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is hard to blame any Irishman who may be running a small factory, or maybe two or three small factories in different parts of the country, if he should accept an offer from an outside concern for his business.  As well as buying him out, such a concern may offer him a directorship on the board of the company and to pay him a good salary. Naturally, he will opt for such an offer because he has been struggling for so long against spiralling costs.  The Government must be aware of this tendency and I want to warn them about the danger of it.  I do not know whether it is possible for them to exercise any control over the situation at this stage, but, at least, they should endeavour not to let it go any further and to examine very carefully any suggestion of monopolies or transfers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1965" /> The Minister referred to legislation to deal with monopolies.  Again, this is something that should have been done years ago.  I regret to say that these monopolies and big concerns that we have here are subscribing to Government funds and therefore they are getting benefits and advantages that small national concerns cannot get. Consequently, our national image is being eroded gradually.  The sooner we wake up to that fact the better.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the potential of our continental shelf.  Any country in the world that is producing oil has a sound economy.  For instance, the small country of Kuwait can do more with its economy than other countries 20 times its size.  Oil explorations are being carried out on our continental shelf. Here again, it is the big combines that are involved.  I do not think it would be fair to name companies here because they are not in a position to reply but everybody knows the ones I have in mind.  If natural gas is found the benefits should accrue to the State. I would like the Minister to tell us what benefit would accrue to the State in the event of oil being found.  Very little I would say.  What benefits would accrue in respect of employment?  Of course, any such big concern would contribute to Exchequer revenue by paying income tax in the way anyone else pays it but the wealth that would accrue from oil would go mainly to that concern.  Everybody knows that oil is one of the greatest assets that any country can have.</P>
    <P>Austria was a comparatively poor country until a dozen or so years ago. She discovered that she had oil and, therefore, she was able to expand considerably and all within the confines of the state were able to benefit from that expansion.  We are not benefiting because the big combines are here already and they are getting a monopoly.  They get an exploratory licence and, when they find something, it is not thrown open to tender, although we passed a Bill in this House in which we claimed complete rights over our Continental Shelf. What rights have we now?  We are probably going to sell out.  We do not know because we are not told.  We are probably going to sell out our full <Col N="1966" /> rights to any findings to some company.  How does the nation benefit from that?</P>
    <P>These are matters that should be looked into.  These are rights for which Deputies should fight because they are national rights.  If we have control of any findings we get the full benefit from them.  The Arab States were prepared to go even to the extent of closing the Suez Canal to get their rights and, when the outside interests found that the states concerned said &ldquo;Those are our rights&rdquo;, there was nothing they could do.  We never do that here.  We hand away every decent asset we have.  We have done that for years.  We have done it for as long as I have been in this House.</P>
    <P>The question of marketing is, of course, of paramount importance and, perhaps, never more so than it is today. Córas Tráchtála deal with projections in relation to export markets and they helped considerably.  I do not think we do enough to communise our industries to enable them to work as one body and concentrate on exports. One of our exports is Irish whiskey. The Scotch whisky distillers spend ten times as much as the Irish whiskey distillers on advertising to popularise their whisky.  I think you will agree with me, Sir, that there is no comparison between the quality of the two products.  Irish whiskey is a potstill whiskey.  It is an acquired taste.  Anybody who drinks Irish whiskey never wants to drink Scotch whisky again. Scotch whisky is distilled.  It is a different product altogether.</P>
    <P>In some instances, as a matter of fact, Irish whiskey is exported and used as a basis for Scotch whisky.  The Scots have at their disposal a very fine organisation for exporting, publicising and marketing Scotch whisky, all over the world practically.  We have not got the same advantages here.  I am citing that as an instance of what the Department should concentrate on.  Producers of different products should be encouraged to co-operate instead of being in competition for export purposes. That is what other countries are doing in relation to marketing and that is what we should do.  We have slipped up very badly on marketing.  We must <Col N="1967" /> expand our products in the competitive days that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement has been a fiasco, to my mind.  We gained absolutely nothing from it.  It has shown us our weakness when we have to compete with free trade.  There should be a reappraisal of the management of exports and we should be prepared to spend far more money on trying to market our goods abroad.  We have spent a good deal of money on trying to establish new industries but we should concentrate on our existing industries and try to step up their production and their sales.  If we did that we would not be faced with redundancies every other day of the week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>One matter was raised here the other day and the Minister was not able to give us a proper reply.  I am concerned at the decision of the United States Government to impose a surcharge on imports into the United States and the effect this surcharge will have on Irish exports.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>In 1970 Irish exports to the USA were valued at £60 million ... the USA is now, after the UK, our next most important market.</P>
      <P>This surcharge by the American Government applies to two-thirds of our exports to the United States according to the Minister, so it applies to £40 million worth of our exports which means that it costs us an extra £4 million a year.  That is a serious matter.  The Minister's answer was far from satisfactory.  If it is costing this country £4 million a year, I should like to think that our Ministers are doing something constructive about it. The surcharge was aimed directly at countries such as Japan and West Germany.  It certainly was not aimed at Ireland which will not dislocate the American economy.  We should try to use our influence with the American Government on this matter.  We helped our exporters when Britain imposed a surcharge and I should like to think that we are trying to do something about this now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I often wonder is the Department of Industry and Commerce really necessary  <Col N="1968" /> since we have so many State and semi-State bodies.  Some of the officials may not like that.  I wonder how the Department can keep going with all the committees that have been set up. It would take the full time of a Dáil Deputy to keep abreast of the number of committees that have been set up and he would need a special diary for their reports.</P>
    <P>I notice the weakness of the Minister's replies to questions about redundancies which are now part of our lives.  The Minister has no early warning sign of redundancy in industry.  His Department and the bodies attached thereto have given a considerable amount of support to some industries.  They have financed them very heavily with public moneys. I should like to think that we could have some early warning sign, an alert sign, to show that a company were getting into difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough that a Minister for Industry and Commerce may be in Cork, as happened to the present Minister, and see a news flash that a company had gone into liquidation, that the workers had been declared redundant and that he should be asked for his comments although he had never heard about it.  This is no way to treat a Department which has been responsible for so much finance for so many industries.  It shows the whole weakness in the system that we can give so much money to industries and ask for nothing in return.  It would be no great demand if we were to ask that the Government would get a seat on the boards of these companies.  Anyone investing so much money in companies might ask for some protection for the shareholders.  The shareholders in these cases are the public and the Government are merely acting on behalf of the public.  If we are going to be so generous in our grants we should ask for some accountability.</P>
    <P>There was a factory in Ballyfermot manufacturing Christmas decorations. The works manager said to me: &ldquo;We have so much left in the bank.  I am preparing to go to the States.  We are living on the grant that the Government pay us and that is paying the wages each week.  I know how much <Col N="1969" /> is left and I know when to make my application for the job in America, to get out&rdquo;.  They were doing nothing. They were living on the Government grant, the public money.  He had that information because he was works manager.</P>
    <P>I wonder why no safeguards are taken by the Department or the Government on behalf of the public.  We saw the fiasco of the Potez factory.  We were codded up to the teeth.  Obsolete equipment was shipped in here.  False values were put on it.  We were fooled. &ldquo;Defrauded&rdquo; is the word.  We had no redress.  Some cock-eyed person gave out, on behalf of the public, vast sums of money.  When I talk about £1,000,000 I am not exaggerating. That amount of the people's money went into this stupid idea of manufacturing planes.  Anyone with any common sense would know that even America cannot hope to save companies involved in the manufacture of planes.  It was a crazy idea.  We have had our fingers burnt very often.</P>
    <P>I love the expression &ldquo;potential employment&rdquo;.  That is a wonderful escape clause.  It does not mean a damn thing.  Anyone can say that there is potential employment for 1,000 workers when there may never be more than 100 employed.  If we are giving out public money let there be accountability to the public and let us ask for a seat on the boards of these companies which we are heavily financing.</P>
    <P>I am not too happy with the outcome of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  We in this party were told that we were reactionaries when we expressed our doubts and suspicions as to the success of this agreement.  We have been proved right.  I agree that exports have increased but imports have more than offset the increase in exports.  The Minister says that a more favourable balance of trade is now evident.  That is a relative term.  More favourable than what?  Than last year? Let us hear the comparative figures for the first two years.  It is significant that we have not used the services of the body which insults the Irish language when it calls itself An Bord Dumpála. I refer to the anti-dumping board on <Col N="1970" /> the South Circular Road.  I do not think it is attending to its business.  Irish fertilisers were being sold in Britain. When 85 workers were declared redundant as a result of imports from Ireland, Denmark and other places, Britain quickly applied the anti-dumping clause.  They were very quick to move in when the jobs of 85 persons out of 60 million were threatened.  I do not think we have applied the protective clauses of the agreement.  We have suffered very badly as a result of the agreement and the Government know we have, but Britain told them when they sought a review that they could not do anything about it.</P>
    <P>It is significant that we have replaced Australia as Britain's best customer since the introduction of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement. That agreement has brought havoc in its wake.  It has brought great unemployment to our country.  It was obvious that we could not hope to sustain the fierce competition from Britain.  Take the case of one item manufactured here.  One extra run for one hour on machines in Britain would supply the requirements of this country.  This is what is happening.  If workers object to conditions in a factory and seek better working conditions or more benefits they are told, &ldquo;We will close down and we will supply direct from Britain&rdquo;.  British exporters to this country have this protection and companies here can close down if the workers say anything.  That is a terrible threat to hold over the heads of the workers in Ireland.  They are told that, if they do not fall into line, the factory here will be closed down and the market here will be supplied from Britain.  These are some of the defects of the operation of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement. The Fianna Fáil Government here have not been able to do anything about it and now we are facing the disastrous consequences in massive unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority, in their annual report for 1970-71, said that there was a shortage of skilled labour during 1970-71 and that it was a limiting factor in attracting and expanding certain types of desirable <Col N="1971" /> new industry.  He also said the IDA during the year approved grants amounting to £1.6 million for training in a wide range of industry, and that AnCO was working in this field also. If there is such a shortage of skilled labour, what plans are we making to prevent this situation deteroriating? With the young people availing of the free education scheme in secondary schools there are more and more children gaining their group certificate. These children with their group certificate are unable to get apprenticeships in Dublin.  This is talent that is being lost, and in three years time the situation will be so bad that I can see firms closing down and going elsewhere because they cannot get skilled labour.</P>
    <P>This is one of the effects I foresee if we enter the EEC, because we are not doing anything to train these people who have got their group certificate and who want to take on a trade. Electricity is important but it would be impossible to get a boy with a group certificate apprenticed in the electrical trade at the present time.  If you get on to the placement officer in the employment exchange in Gardiner Street he will say: &ldquo;Send him down&rdquo; but there is no hope for him.  This is a diabolical situation in this city.  This is a very serious matter and we should be applying our resources to help these lads to acquire skills which are necessary for new industry.  We cannot say electricity will become an archaic trade.  I would like to see the money that is being ploughed into other aspects of industry being ploughed in here to help these lads to get their training.</P>
    <P>I have seen the report of the IDA and the grandiose plans they have and what they say about advance factories. We talk in terms of 2,000 square feet. If we are talking about bringing in foreign industries, I cannot see any foreign industry being satisfied with 2,000 square feet.  It is an insult.  That 2,000 square feet would barely provide office space, never mind a factory. That is the first thing that is wrong with the IDA plans for advance factories.  You could not put three <Col N="1972" /> machines in a space of 2,000 square feet.  I defy anyone to contradict me on that.  You have to talk in terms of 10,000 square feet for a factory.  You have to talk in terms of proper modules to allow for expansion. Advance factories of 2,000 square feet are unrealistic, unless we want cottage industries and nothing more.</P>
    <P>The question of insurance is a source of anxiety to many people, especially in view of the exorbitant increase in insurance which was granted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce last year.  He could not justify the increase and all he did to fob us all off was to say: &ldquo;I will set up an inquiry&rdquo;. This has been going on for over 12 months and we have not had a report yet.  I think the Minister has been dilatory in his work.  Insurance, particularly motor insurance, is a very serious problem.  It is a crying shame that there are motorists driving without insurance because they cannot get insurance.  If these insurance companies are to operate here the Minister should ensure that they will fulfil their obligations to the State and to the public.  If insurance is to be compulsory it should be compulsory on insurance companies to accept insurance.  This is what is wrong and because they are not accepting insurance we see too many instances of motorists driving without insurance.</P>
    <P>Fire insurance has been a big problem, particularly in the last year when there have been a disastrous series of fires in which almost £7 million worth of Irish industry was destroyed.  This is a fantastic amount. The interesting thing about it is that this is greater than the amount of new industry which opened up in the country in the past year.  I would like to think that we might do something about such a heavy loss, that we might encourage proper fire fighting facilities, perhaps create a co-ordinated national fire service to help to prevent this terrible financial loss.  You can imagine businesses being disrupted, many employees being put out of work, perhaps declared redundant forever as a result of the terrible loss from fire. The Minister might give some thought to the provision of facilities whereby <Col N="1973" /> staffs could engage in fire-fighting.  He might also consider the establishment of a national fire-fighting service because the situation is sufficiently serious to warrant it.</P>
    <P>I must deal with the question of price increases.  There has been very nice jockeying by the Government in the matter of price control.  I came here in 1965 and saw the Price Control Bill introduced at that time.  We tried then to explain to the Government the escape clauses in that measure but they did not listen to us, saying that all the protection the consumer needed was embodied in the Bill.  Now we have been told that in the past year prices increased by the astonishingly high figure of 12 per cent.  Since the National Wage Agreement the rise in prices has been phenomenal.</P>
    <P>It reminds me of the late Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, altering the system of recording the number of unemployed in the country in 1966.  Since then we have not been able to get valid unemployment figures.  In the same way, decimalisation has bamboozled us in the matter of estimating price increases. It is difficult now to try to compare present prices with those of the predecimal period.  We know that prices have spiralled but the Department's reply to complaints is that, if anybody sees an increase in price which he thinks is unwarranted, he should notify the Department.  This is no remedy because the people most affected are inarticulate people, people who do not know how to write or to whom they should write.</P>
    <P>The only remedy is to provide a team of inspectors who will be constantly on the alert.  Manufacturers should be compelled to provide a regular price list and this should be surveyed constantly by the Department. I should like the Minister to tell us how price increases are arrived at.  Are they based on sales of individual commodities or is it just a matter of deciding to increase the price of a commodity by one penny?</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot remain complacent in the face of the vicious price increases that have been occurring.  He has told us that price increases amounting to £43 million were sought in the <Col N="1974" /> past year and that the Department permitted only £30 million in price increases. That is nothing to be complacent about.  That only offers manufacturers an opportunity to seek higher price increases in the future.  They can say that if they seek price increases amounting to so much the Department will allow something lower and they will therefore seek much higher increases than are justified.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately vested industrial interests control the present Government. The Government know where their power, their finance and their support come from and they must yield to those interests.  They will use any device in order to fool the people because of this and they will allow price increases far in excess of what is warranted.  The Minister must accept responsibility for the present high cost of living and for leaving the consumers without the protection they so badly need and are entitled to.</P>
    <P>There is one other way of increasing prices.  Take a bar of soap, for instance. If there is no obligation on the manufacturer to sell it at a certain weight, instead of seeking an increase of, say, one penny per bar he can reduce the weight and thereby procure his increase in profit.  I should be obliged if the Minister would let me know if it is obligatory to provide such things as soap and soap powder at specified weights.  If it is not it leaves the door open to manufacturers to increase their profits without increasing their prices.</P>
    <P>We have been told it is impossible to control the price of meat.  I think it can be controlled, and I think it must be controlled, because it cannot be the policy of any Government to allow prices to spiral, particularly in regard to essential commodities like meat. Their reason may be that prices will be so high here by the time we enter the Common Market that they will not expect a great outcry when we face the phenomenal prices obtaining in the EEC.</P>
    <P>I do not see embodied in the Minister's elaborate document any real concrete plans for increasing employment.  Despite what is happening in the North, this is a very big <Col N="1975" /> problem.  I have not visited a home in my area that I do not see one or two unemployed people, young people.  I cannot get them jobs and they cannot get jobs.  There seems to be a real tightening up on this question of employment.  I think we have 6,000 people redundant in the past year.  I feel that we have an ideal opportunity here to encourage America to invest a little more in Ireland because she would have an opportunity, with the EEC, of gaining a foothold in Europe. I would like to see greater attention being paid to this.  I would not like to feel that we were part of international cartels which, if things went wrong, could close down their Irish factories. I appreciate that this can happen and that where a world-wide recession hits them, they are not concerned about their Irish interests; but I would like to see medium-sized industries who would be glad to gain a foothold in Europe through Ireland and we should be concentrating on trying to help these, and we should be trying to train more and more of our workers and, if possible, training them abroad.</P>
    <P>I would like to see money being poured into training our workers abroad.  This is where we can get tremendous experience and tremendous skill and we should be planning to meet the challenge that will come if we are to overcome this problem of skilled trades and employment.  I would like to see more and more encouragement of native Irish industries and of people who would like to set up an Irish industry. The joking remark has been made that if you wanted a grant from the Government, you had to be a foreigner who was unable to understand the questionnaire they gave you.  It is unfortunately much too common that people have been able to come in here and be financed very well, while our own Irish people were not.  They had the best of ideas, ideas which were indigenous to the country and could have been successful, but all the time they have been hampered by lack of credit.</P>
    <P>It has been said that Irish industry should concentrate on exports and I have discussed with a number of companies  <Col N="1976" /> why they should consider exports, but their one problem is that they do not have the credit or the finance to enable them to wait for their money from export orders.  This is the big bugbear with medium and small-sized industrialists and I think we should be trying to help them to a greater extent.  The Minister will say that the Central Bank has made arrangements with the commercial banks to extend almost unlimited credit for exports, but I would like to see small and medium companies, who would wish to engage in exports, having their finance and the interest on their finance subsidised.</P>
    <P>They might have a small rate of interest to enable them to do so. I think we need this incentive but they are concentrating on the home market because of the fear that being without money and having got the orders, they could not hold out for their money. This is where we should be trying to help them.  There is no use in saying that they can have credit facilities at the high rates of interest which we charge in this country.  These are much too high and they are making it difficult for business to manage in the matter of overdrafts.  A rate of 10 per cent is a very high rate, and what we should be doing is subsidising them with a lower rate of interest so as to encourage more and more exports.  If we were to put forward a plan like this, we should and could encourage many more of our industries to participate in the export market.  Only one-third of our industries are participating in that market and this is a low figure.  Every effort should be made to increase this and we might adopt a policy of subsidisation in this way, or some modification of it, in this regard.  I have talked to a few factory owners about exports and this was always the excuse they gave me.</P>
    <P>There is another point&mdash;and this is not a reflection on the Department &mdash;that there are companies which can get the orders and which accept orders for exports, but they do not meet their obligations.  They are not able to fulfil the orders, and this is very damaging for industry and for the country, because importers in other countries will not rely on companies here who <Col N="1977" /> cannot fulfil their obligations in a fiercely competitive world.  We saw how Britain suffered in relation to this. Different industries were not able to fill their orders and Germany and Japan took advantage of that situation. I do not know how we are to bring home to them the fact that if they are to survive in foreign markets, they must be able to fulfil their obligations in respect of export orders.</P>
    <P>The Minister touched on our plans for meeting the EEC.  I will not say he has gone into any great detail but he mentioned the White Paper that is to come out.  I am wondering in a situation, in which only one-third of our manufacturing industry is in the export field, how we could possibly survive, and perhaps the Minister might give his view on that situation. With only one-third of our manufactured goods being exported, what chance will we have.  We have to realise that the other countries in the Six at the moment are all aiming at exports, but only one-third of our manufactured goods are exported which seems a very low figure.  It means that two-thirds is for the home market and will be competing with all these other countries.</P>
    <P>We have had published the reports on the various industries.  I have read a few of them&mdash;the clothing industry and the printing and publishing industry&mdash;and I am wondering what action is taken on these reports.  Are they just published, and is it then left to individual companies to make up their own minds as to whether they are going to stay in industry, or just to carry on as they are, hoping for the best and getting all they can out of it, and leaving the workers to the wind as would happen?  I have seen it in the publishing and printing business and I have seen that we do not have a hope of surviving in the printing industry. We have too many printing businesses, and I would like to think that we might have a Department which might call these together and talk to them in terms of amalgamation, in terms of rationalisation and seeing what could be done.  I do not know if these reports are acted upon by the Department or its various bodies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1978" /> Certainly to my knowledge, it has not happened in that industry.  I would like to think that, when an investigation into these industries takes place and when a report is issued, there might be some action on the report. Maybe I am ignorant on this matter and perhaps the Minister will tell me exactly what they do, but I would be very enlightened if I heard what action is taken because it is a year since the particular report was published and, to my knowledge, nothing has yet taken place.</P>
    <P>The way to avoid massive redundancies is to act quickly.  We must discuss this problem in terms of acting on these reports on industries.  I would like to think that the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards would have power to ensure that manufacturers were not producing cheap, shoddy articles and that the consumers had some protection.  I had occasion to draw the attention of the Institute to a particular, inferior product.  I was told that the Institute had no power to do anything about it. As a matter of goodwill and courtesy I was told that the company concerned would be phoned in connection with this shoddy article and that it would be suggested to them that they could do something about it.  We should have more protection than that.  Companies operating for quick money gains are not working in the national interest. They are creating a bad impression. Standards and quality should be upheld. We hear of buying &ldquo;quality Irish&rdquo;.  Poor quality articles should not be produced here.  The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards should have some power.</P>
    <P>Many products manufactured abroad are now being sold here.  We see the word &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; on them, but not the name or address of the manufacturer. It took me a month to trace the manufacturers of one product.  There should be an obligation on importers to protect the consumers.  There should be some check so that if a product marked &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; is put on sale the purchaser should have some redress if he is not satisfied with it.  What does &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; mean?  The whole purpose is to protect consumers.  Importers <Col N="1979" /> should not place products on sale without accepting responsibility for their quality.</P>
    <P>As a doctor I had an unfortunate experience.  I bought some hypodermic needles.  One needle was defective and broke in a patient's muscle.  The word &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; appeared on the box of needles, but not the name of the manufacturer. I could not trace the manufacturer. The Minister should give serious consideration to this question to see whether we can bring in legislation to protect the consumer.  This is vitally important especially now when more and more foreign products are on the market.</P>
    <P>A great deal of electrical equipment is being imported.  There should be protection for the consumers in ensuring that parts for such equipment are available.  Often equipment and machines are imported without any obligation on the importer to ensure that parts are available.  Some of the international companies are selling obsolete goods on the Irish market. Washing machines and fridges sometimes need spare parts for repair purposes and it is annoying to find that one has to write to Canada or the United States for them, only to be told that the model was not being produced there before you bought it. In such cases the consumer needs protection.  This should be the responsibility of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Importers should not have the right to dump these goods on the market.  They must be made realise that they have an obligation to consumers.  They are acting as agents for the manufacturers and must accept responsibility. Consumer protection is badly needed in this country.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards play a bigger role as regards Irish manufacturers.  They might act as watchdogs for the public with regard to Irish-manufactured goods.  I would like to see the brand of the Institute on goods.  This would provide us with an assurance as to their quality. A special stamp would be some protection.  The manufacturers might <Col N="1980" /> pay something for such a stamp.  Such a system would benefit both manufacturers and the public.</P>
    <P>We have spent much money sending Irish businessmen abroad.  Since the scheme was started in 1957 the total amount of money granted was £2 million.  I know the cost of air fares and I would like to see this £2 million spent on sending workers abroad.  We should finance firms who are sending their workers abroad.  I would be very happy to see such money spent in this way.  I would like a breakdown of this figure.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I am fully satisfied that the expenditure incurred both by the firms and the Government has proved to be a sound investment in helping energetic and forward looking companies to prepare to meet the challenge of the seventies.</P>
    <P>There have been individual cases of people evading their duties.  I know of some people who had a holiday on this money.  I do not like anyone taking a holiday at the expense of the taxpayer. I would like to see a breakdown of that figure of £2 million, because £2 million is a lot of money.</P>
    <P>I see a firm of international consultants were engaged by the Department. I wonder if it is the same firm who have worked for several Departments. They will become part and parcel of the Fianna Fáil Party they have worked on so many projects here. I believe they have renounced their US citizenship and have come to live here permanently because they have said: &ldquo;There's gold in them thar hills.&rdquo;  That is exactly their attitude because there is no limit to the fields in which they will be employed.  They are very expensive guests to have in this country.</P>
    <P>I would like to see an end to McKinsey and Company; I would like to see Irishmen produce some plans. But we always have the mentality that we must go abroad and bring foreign experts over here to plan for us.  The firm of McKinsey have produced some very elaborate documents.  They produced a plan for CIE.  I saw in the paper during the week where they had a map of some railway line which <Col N="1981" /> does not exist at the moment.  They think they can bamboozle us with the terms and the names they mention, but you would want to spend a few years in America to learn about McKinsey and Company and what they mean.</P>
    <P>I am on a health board and I can tell the House that nobody understands McKinsey and Company and what they are about.  The sooner we get that firm out of this country the better for us because they will rob us before they are finished.  It has cost £250,000 for one project in which they were involved. They produce very elaborate documents which are nicely bound but when you try to read and understand those documents you come up against a brick wall.  The Minister may be super intelligent.</P>

      <P>I saw reference to a firm of international consultants.  This firm have cropped up in many different Departments.  No sooner was the Minister for Health finished with them than they moved to Transport and Power. Their plans for our health boards have really put us astray.  The suggestions they have made in regard to different projects they have worked on will not help the country.  I have no doubt they are a very good American company.  I am not casting aspersions on their ability in America, but they are not suitable for this country.  America has a population of 200 million and they think in terms of that figure.  You cannot change a company like that to suddenly come over here and adapt their ideas to 3 million people.  This is where we have gone wrong.  I would ask the Government to forget about McKinsey.  Perhaps the Minister would reassure me that the firm of consultants mentioned here is not McKinsey.</P>

      <P>Good.  The Minister has had the good sense to keep them out of his Department, but if he is not careful they will find their way in.  I am sure the Minister agrees with me that they have come up with some grandiose ideas not adaptable to this country.  The sooner we tell that firm their place is in the US the better.  We have got, periodically in reply to questions, details of our balance of trade with various countries.  We have fared badly with many of the countries, especially in the East European bloc, China, Japan and places like that.  I know the Minister has been abroad many times.

      <P>I am not condemning the Minister for travelling abroad because I believe he can do a lot of good by meeting the right people in those different countries.  I know it is easy to be critical when he comes back but I appreciate the problems of any Minister who goes abroad in the present situation in the North.  It is hard for people abroad to differentiate between North and South and the first thing they will say to a Minister is &ldquo;There is awful trouble in your country&rdquo;.  It is certainly not a happy environment for setting up an industry.</P>
      <P>There is great ignorance abroad about Ireland.  I have been getting letters from people in the States who think that the people in this part of the country are still in trouble.  I remember a president of a US bank saying to me: &ldquo;You picked up English very fast&rdquo;.  He did not know we spoke English here.  I have a German friend who thinks we are involved in all the trouble in the North.  This is the impression which people abroad have of this country.  We are up against the handicap of the trouble in the North when we look for people to come in here and set up industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult for a Minister to <Col N="1983" /> do everything, but I should like to see more concentration on trade attachés rather than embassies abroad.  We should have special trade departments in all our Embassies and specially trained people working in them who can attract people to come here to set up new industries.  The Minister should be able to make special visits to trade departments in all our Embassies after the people there have made contacts for him.  I do not think our Embassies abroad are doing the work they should be doing to attract industry to this country.  I know there is a great deal of work to be done.  Proper information must be provided and I should like specialised teams in the Embassies doing this work.  We might also encourage some of our more successful businessmen into the Department of Industry and Commerce and into the IDA.  That would engender a more businesslike approach to and more businesslike thinking on the problems affecting our country.  The Minister looks a little askance at this suggestion. He will probably say that this is done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is done and, when it is done, we are attacked by the Deputy's colleagues.  We had Deputy Desmond on the subject yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  A man qualified in the arts is no good in business.  Business requires a businesslike mind.  We also need sales teams.  I have talked to many English people who have nothing but praise for the &ldquo;Kerry Gold&rdquo; campaign.  They say we have done a fantastic sales job and that we have outsmarted the Danes.  They are very impressed.  Whoever was responsible for that campaign has won the admiration of British businessmen. I should like to see similar campaigns initiated in regard to other commodities. Everything depends on a dynamic sales force and on technique and know-how. With an expert team we could be very successful in markets abroad.  We have the advantage, though some may not regard it as such, of speaking the English language.  Whether we like it or not, English will be the spoken language in Europe; they are all trying <Col N="1984" /> desperately there to learn English.  We should make more use of it.</P>
      <P>The loss suffered by Erin Foods is a big one.  I think their promotional campaign was wrong.  If one wants to sell something one should find out, first of all, what the consumer thinks about it. One can flog something to death but, if people do not want it, they will not buy it.  As I say, the promotional campaign was wrong.  Perhaps they can change their plans now.  Perhaps the product is just not right.</P>
      <P>We should be training our young people now in expert salesmanship.  We should have good brand names.  These are the things that will bring results. More money should be spent on training and, if necessary, experts should be brought in from elsewhere to train our young people.  If our young people are not given this opportunity we will regret it.  The Minister might have a closer liaison with his colleague, the Minister for Labour, about the training of young people who have the necessary qualifications, particularly in view of that pessimistic report saying there is a great shortage of skilled personnel.  We must act immediately. If we do not, the consequences in three or four years time will be disastrous. We must create the opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from an area in which there is no worthwhile industry, an area in which there are many people anxious and willing to work but unable to find work.  Very often the Taoiseach, the Minister and other members of the Cabinet talk about the establishment of industries in the West.  Let me tell the Minister now that he will have to establish industries, let them be big or small, in many of the towns throughout the West if he wants those towns to survive.  It is sad to see so many young people leaving school and unable to find employment.  They find it difficult to know where to go or what approach to make and, in the end, they go to England.  I hope that in the near future some Government will come to the rescue of these towns because it is the towns which will save the rural areas.  The rural areas are becoming depopulated because there is no employment.  Even if employment <Col N="1985" /> were provided eight, nine, or 20 miles away the people would be glad to get it because wages are good and they could maintain a car.  If they had employment they would be a benefit to their country and to their homes.</P>
      <P>We have very active town development committees, giving voluntary service, working hard, late into the night, at long and tedious meetings, in order to try to help the towns to which they belong.  After many such meetings they discover there is nothing doing.  A great effort has been made by the North Leitrim Development Committee and by a very active branch of it in Dublin to get some industry established in Manorhamilton.  A few years ago meetings were held in Carrick-on-Shannon and Manorhamilton to bring the town to the notice of the Department or of some industrialist who might consider establishing a pulp industry there seeing that we have extensive afforestation in the area.  Afforestation has been going on there for over 20 years.  The climate was suitable and so was much of the land and very good progress was made. Today the benefit can be reaped from the work done by the forestry section and the very efficient staff.  Instead of using transport on our well built roads to carry ten or 20 ton trucks it should be more economic and more sensible for the Department to see what could be done on the spot.</P>
      <P>It is all right for a Minister to say: &ldquo;Put forward some idea and we shall look at it and consider giving grants.&rdquo; At this time, with a Government that have had the support this Government had down the years, it is their duty, as I have often said, to visit those areas and see the towns in rural areas for themselves.  The forestry is there and the centre for industry is there.  If some industrialist considered it costly to provide transport in the area the Department would be well advised to give a substantial transport subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the idea has been turned down and I think it is in Roscrea, between 60 and 80 miles away, that the factory exists and all the surplus timber has to be taken there in the trucks I have mentioned instead of trying to have some industry established locally even <Col N="1986" /> on a small basis.  The raw material is there but Manorhamilton is without an industry.  If the Government intend to help those towns the time to save them has almost passed.  The late Deputy Sweetman worked very hard to establish an industry at Ballisodare.  He succeeded, and just as it was getting off the ground, he had a fatal accident. That industry, manufacturing concrete pipes for drainage, building and other purposes is making very good progress now.  I visited the factory and it is a treat to see the fine product that is turned out there and the employment given and the life it puts into the area. That is what we want.  If we had such industries rural areas would be saved and instead of emigrating people would remain there and some who had left would return.</P>
    <P>Other towns such as Drumshanbo are also suffering from a similar degree of depopulation with no industry. If it had not been for the Arigna coalmines within four or five miles of the town it would be almost closed down.  The mines were a source of revenue down the years and helped to keep the shops going thus the people from the mines made Drumshanbo their local town.  Otherwise, there would be a much smaller population there today.  The Taoiseach once held a largely attended meeting there and told the people he would see that the town would be well looked after but I can assure the Minister that Drumshanbo has not yet got any benefits.</P>
    <P>The Department should examine these areas themselves.  We can repeat our arguments, Estimate after Estimate, but if the Minister went there with his officials they could see for themselves what is required in those towns.  The time has come when they should do this.  Telling a group of people to prepare a project and that if it is worthwhile they will see what they can do is not the proper approach in an area which has suffered so much from depopulation.  Yet, that is the only answer we get.  The Government have been in office since 1932 except for a few interruptions and all down the years Leitrim gave the Government good support.  All the Deputies from <Col N="1987" /> that part of the country worked hard whether in Government or Opposition and were all anxious to have something done to save the area and have the people kept on the land and in the towns.  If it was not for the factories in Collooney and Tubbercurry there would be a much lower population in that part of County Sligo.</P>
    <P>We now have a factory at Hazelwood, Sligo.  It is now getting off the ground and employing a number of people which is increasing by perhaps 20 per week and we hope that it will ultimately absorb about 550 boys and girls.  If that is so it will prove to be the salvation of the area because Sligo has suffered some serious set-backs and if it was not for this new factory we would have to shout louder.  A chip basket factory closed there leaving between 40 and 50 employees out of work.  There is a letter in the <i>Evening Herald</i> this evening referring to the closing of a Sligo factory.  It says that the closing of the Innisfree Potteries factory in Sligo has gone almost unnoticed and the employees have now joined the 7,000 other workers who have lost their jobs in the last seven months throughout the Twenty-six Counties.  &ldquo;Innisfree Potteries,&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;was a thriving industry and was closed at very short notice.  To date, no statement on the closure has been made by either the owner or the Industrial Development Authority.&rdquo; The letter challenges both the IDA and the owner, on behalf of the Countess Markievicz Cumann Sinn Féin, in the town, to explain the circumstances leading to the closure.  The letter was signed by Michael Mooney, chairman, and Seán Breannan, secretary.  Those are the things that are happening.  We are all hoping very sincerely that this industry will make progress.  It is a really sound industry, one of the most advanced factories attached to that Italian concern.  The progress of that company would help to save the life of north Sligo and north Leitrim.  The youth in that wide area have nothing to look forward to.  There are many young people leaving school with leaving certificates and they and their parents are very disappointed to find <Col N="1988" /> that there are no openings for them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan for years pressed to have industries in Sligo and he succeeded, but there was one factory built that never opened.  I did not intend to speak on this or I would have had more specific information.  When I make inquiries about the chipboard factory I am told that it is being bought but I have been told that for a long time now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Connell spoke about expert advice.  For years we have been listening to this both in the council chamber and from the Department. We are told they must have expert advice and when we make further inquiries we are told that the experts must come from England or America. I have the greatest confidence in our own trained personnel.  I have no doubt many of them would do as good a job on many projects that come before local authorities and before the Department as has been done by the so-called expert advisers.  We often see young lads heading for the city or even staying at home and establishing themselves beyond all expectations in the building industry and in many other spheres&mdash;for instance, the horse industry.  These people got no expert advice.  They are geniuses in their own way.  If we had enough of them in the industrial world, we could do without the fellows who come along and think that we know nothing.</P>
    <P>We have an industrial development officer in Sligo.  I hope we will get more industry into that area.  Ballinamore, County Leitrim, could also do with an industry.  It is very well served by schools which have turned out many educated young people who, for want of employment, must go further afield. Those towns should be seriously considered by the Department for industry.  I can assure the Minister that if industries were established in those towns there would be no problem in getting a labour force.  There are people there who are well prepared by excellent teachers.  There are night classes which they can attend.  There is the Regional College in Sligo to which any of them can travel after a day's work if they wish.</P>
    <P>For a number of years past when <Col N="1989" /> we have had a bumper yield of agricultural produce throughout the West there has been practically no place to take it in order to have it processed.  There is a potato factory in Tuam but in the other parts of the West there is no centre to which one can take a surplus of farm produce. A few years ago there was a bumper yield.  These people are not big farmers but whatever surplus they had had to go to waste because transport to Tuam would be too costly and there was nowhere else to send it.  It is a pity the price and the market are not there for things such as green vegetables.  There was a substantial sum of money collected in this area at one time towards establishing such an industry but it did not meet with a favourable reception from the Department and the money, which was generously subscribed by everybody who could subscribe, is lying in the bank and nothing has been done.  The Department should have been more generous.  There were very sound people at the head of that project with very good intentions but for want of encouragement from the proper source it fell through.  That is something that should be considered, because we have there a large area with no centre to which to take any surplus of farm produce.</P>
    <P>We had a sad experience in Sligo a few years ago when the woollen factory, which employed about 350 people, was burned down.  The fire started at about 11 o'clock at night but it was soon discovered that the facilities available for fighting the fire were inadequate.  I am suprised that the departmental inspectors who go around the country inspecting factories do not check up on the availability of facilities for fighting fires. There is a generous water supply in the town but the factory was gutted before the fire-fighting machinery got going at all.  Inspectors should ensure that every factory has adequate facilities for dealing with such emergencies.</P>
    <P>There are many small groups throughout the country who are exempt from the grants given to industry.  A list was published recently <Col N="1990" /> in Sligo and only then did a few groups of people ask me if they could be included in that list.  I got on to the IDA officer in Sligo and I hope they will be considered.  I remember making representations on behalf of a small group engaged in making furniture but they did not come within the scope of the Act.  I referred the matter to our development officer, Mr. Martin, and when I have found out from him what the position is I shall come back to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to detain the Minister very long because I know the nerve-wracking time he has had during the last 24 hours and I am sure he wants to get away and have a good night's sleep.  This is a most important Estimate and one which during my ten years as a Member of this House I have always felt obliged to speak on.  It is true to say that the acid test of Government policy is the creation of employment.  Looking at the record of the last 12 months it is to be regretted that the progress which has been made in the past few years has not been maintained.  I admit, as the Minister has pointed out, that there were a combination of unfortunate circumstances this year which created serious difficulties in various sectors of manufacturing industry.  The Minister has outlined these various factors but what has prompted me to speak is a comment by the Minister on page 13 of his brief where he was dealing with the question of redundancies.  He admitted that free trade had been an important factor but he went on to say that, &ldquo;it is only one of the factors involved&rdquo;. He then went on to point out and I quote:</P>
      <P>... one of the sectors of manufacturing industry where the incidence of redundancy has been greatest this year has been the food industry...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This raises a point which I have raised on every occasion I have spoken on the Estimate of the Department of Industry and Commerce and that is the question of the potential of this country for food processing industries. The Minister did not attempt to explain in detail the significance of the <Col N="1991" /> fact that the redundancies in the food industries were greatest.  The fact that the incidence of redundancy has been greatest in the food industry this year is a terrible reflection, if not an indictment, on the industrial policy being pursued by the Fianna Fáil Government. I suppose it is an indictment of the overall economic policy because the food industry is based on the agricultural industry from which it gets its raw materials.</P>
    <P>We have the finest agricultural land in western Europe and there is no doubt about the capacity of our farmers to produce top quality food efficiently.  It is inexplicable to find that this year the food industry has had a very high incidence of redundancy. Apart from the fact that we have all the natural conditions, and all the natural advantages conducive to a prosperous and growing food manufacturing sector, we have the additional tremendous asset that just a few miles across the Irish Sea is Great Britain, which is the greatest food importing country in western Europe.  When one considers these factors it is very difficult to explain why this situation has arisen, free trade or no free trade.  There have been bad reports from Erin Foods and Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta which I am sure, are matters of concern to the Minister even though these particular companies may not come directly under the control of his Department.</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact that on a number of occasions this year we have been unable to meet the demands for certain food products on the export market?  Is it not a fact that we were unable to supply a very substantial order for butter?  Is it not a fact that we are unable to supply our full quota of bacon on the British market?  Is it not a fact that there is a colossal potential in Britain for other types of food products? When the Minister is replying perhaps he will attempt to explain in more detail than he has done in his opening speech why there has been such a high rate of redundancy in the food processing industry.  I have said on many occasions that I believe the food processing industry is inhibited by <Col N="1992" /> reason of the fact that the industry comes under the control of a number of different State Departments.</P>
    <P>When the Arthur D. Little Report was being considered in relation to the restructuring of the IDA I expressed disappointment that the Government did not go the entire way in an effort to rationalise industrial development.  It is wrong that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has not responsibility for important sectors of our manufacturing industry&mdash;the bacon industry, the milk industry and so on.  This matter must be considered and I should like to see all manufacturing sectors coming within the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his statement referred to the Shannon Industrial Estate.  Some years ago the manufacturing sector of the estate was transferred from being under the aegis of the Department of Transport and Power to that of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Minister referred to the fact that an additional subvention of £500,000 is being made available to the Shannon Development Company for the purpose of industrial development.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister referred to the fact that there have been closures and redundancies at Shannon and in other parts of the country.  For the record, approximately 700 people have become redundant in the Shannon Industrial Estate in the past 12 months. I regret this as much as anyone and I am not inclined to score political points on this matter.  Because of my involvement with the workers at Shannon and my close contact with people on the industrial estate and following inquiries I have made regarding some of the industries which have closed, there are certain suggestions I should like to make to the Minister.</P>
    <P>At Shannon there are about 23 manufacturing enterprises and it should be possible to arrange for some kind of early warning system when an industry is getting into difficulties.  The development company concerned and the Department of Industry and Commerce should be alerted in adequate time to enable them to assess the situation and see if action might be taken.  I want to be fair to the Minister on this point <Col N="1993" /> because whenever I have had occasion to approach him about redundancies he has been anxious to help and has been courteous to me.  However, the problem is that it is usually too late when the situation is brought to public notice.  The term &ldquo;fire brigade action&rdquo; has been used in this context but I am not in favour of this because such action is usually a last minute effort. When an industry gets into difficulty because of adverse factors on the export market, the Department, the IDA or the local regional development company should be alerted to see if timely action could save the situation.</P>
    <P>In the case of a sophisticated and highly-efficient organisation such as the Shannon Industrial Estate it should be possible to arrange that a new industry would be able to take over when a firm get into difficulties.  I realise this would be difficult to achieve in the normal way but given the early warning system and a new method of processing new industries it should be possible for a new industry to go into production as soon as a firm might have to vacate an existing plant.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to make on this matter and this has been advanced by the trade union movement catering for the Shannon workers.  In the case of redundancies at one factory at Shannon strong criticism was expressed by the representatives of the workers that they had not been given adequate warning that difficulties had arisen.  A group of 20 workers arrived at my office in Limerick one morning during the summer recess. These workers had suddenly become redundant at the Shannon estate.  They had no redundancy pay and they did not know what to do about it and I had to phone the Department of Labour on their behalf.</P>
    <P>In an effort to tackle this problem a suggestion has been put forward by the trade unions which I think is valuable.  In the case of a concern such as the Shannon Development Company who have jurisdiction not only over the industrial estate but over the airport and the mid-western region, there is a cast-iron case for worker or union representation on the board of the company.  The Minister has <Col N="1994" /> probably had representations on these lines and I would urge him to consider this matter.  Apart from the fact that it would ensure that the unions knew when a firm was getting into difficulty, the workers could be warned and steps taken to secure alternative employment. This is more easily done in an industrial estate than in a town with only one industry.</P>
    <P>A sad aspect of the redundancies that have occured is the fact that many highly-skilled workers have no prospects of alternative employment. Many of them wait for some time but finally they are forced to go to England or elsewhere.  With more efficient planning and foresight and with better understanding between the Shannon Development Company and the unions some formula might be devised that would minimise the impact and consequences of redundancy and which would ensure that, when a plant or an industry got into difficulties, everything possible would be done to ensure that any workers who became redundant as a result would find employment as quickly as possible in the particular industrial estate concerned.  This is the first Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce since the present Minister took responsibility for it and this is the first occasion we have had to review the progress made by the Shannon Development Company since they were given responsibility for industrial development, not only at Shannon itself, but in the mid-western region which comprises Limerick city and county, Clare and North Tipperary.</P>
    <P>As one who, for a number of years, had been advocating this development, I am happy to be able to say that the progress being made by the Shannon Development Company throughout the entire mid-west region in the promoting of industry is very gratifying.  There are two very large industries being promoted adjacent to Limerick city. One of these is in my own constituency while the other is in the constituency of Limerick West.  I hope that when these industries go into production in the course of the coming year, they will go a long way towards absorbing <Col N="1995" /> redundant workers of which there are quite a large number in Limerick at present.</P>
    <P>Because they had the expertise and the know-how, the Shannon Development Company have been of invaluable help in the promotion of industry in the mid-western region.  So far as the concept of regional development is concerned the Shannon Development company have justified the confidence and the hope that was placed in them when the Bill giving them this additional responsibility was going through the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred also to the small industries programme.  From the figures he has given it would appear that this programme, which now extends throughout the country, has made a very important contribution to the overall growth of industrial development and to the provision of jobs.  For many years I have been keen on this idea of promoting and assisting small industries, particularly in rural Ireland. Perhaps I was the first Deputy to voice this idea in the House and I wish now to pay tribute to the man who was responsible for implementing the idea by having set up a special division to deal with small industries.  I refer to Mr. T.M. O'Connor who was then our county manager in Limerick and who, I think, by reason of the success of a small industries' programme that was his brainchild, has made an outstanding contribution to the development of industry in this country and who, in particular, has made an outstanding contribution to rural development because in the vast majority of cases it is in rural areas that the small industries are operating.  I have had a fair amount of contact with the small industries division of the IDA and I must say that the officials, from the chief right down to the men who go out into the field to assess projects, are outstanding men.  It is only fair to say that the success of the small industries programme is due in no small measure to the dedication and hard work done by these people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that for the year ending 31st March, 1971 grants <Col N="1996" /> totalling £1.2 million were approved for the small industries programme and that there was involved an additional employment potential of 1,140 workers.  This is remarkable development. The Minister went on to tell us that since the scheme was initiated in 1967 the number of grants approved was 593 and totalled £4 million and resulted in additional employment for 7,400 workers.  Those who for many years have advocated this type of development, have reason to be pleased with the results that have been achieved.  There is yet vast potential for this type of programme.  Of course it is only fair to point out that the idea of the small industries division was not original from the point of view of industrial development because long before we thought of it, such programmes under different names had been in operation on the continent, in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and various other countries.  The reason I say there is yet vast potential for development is because there is a tremendous amount of latent talent throughout the country.  We have a great fund of inherited skills in particular crafts that have been handed down from one generation to another.</P>
    <P>I hope that the progress of the small industries division will continue and that every effort will be made to ensure that any project offering a reasonable potential will be assisted. The Minister referred briefly to the EEC.  I suppose one must agree with him when he says that this is not the time or the occasion for a full discussion on the implications of EEC membership in so far as Irish industry is concerned.  I am not an expert on industrial development nor am I an expert on the EEC.  I only want to say that, despite the gloomy prophecies that have been made about the impact of EEC membership on industry of the the whole I am quite confident of the ability of industry to meet the tremendous challenge that lies ahead.</P>
    <P>I see one very real possibility for new industrial expansion.  I believe that our entry into the EEC&mdash;and I understand from offical channels that there is evidence of this already&mdash;will lead to a very big increase in the number  <Col N="1997" /> of foreign industrialists, particularly American industrialists, who will be seeking a base in Europe and whom we have a very good chance of attracting to Ireland.  Certain doubts were expressed about the future of the Shannon Industrial Estate and the customs free zone.  I believe that within the context of the EEC and industrial development Shannon has a tremendous future.  It is an ideal base for American manufacturers in particular who are seeking a base for manufacturing their products and exporting them into Europe.</P>
    <P>With the airport, the air facilities and the tremendous facilities that are available to be exploited in the Shannon estuary, with proper planning and with confidence, Shannon has a bright future as a transportation and a trans-shipment centre for manufacturers who wish to export into Europe.  I sincerely hope that this will be borne in mind because no other part of western Europe has at the moment the same facilities for trans-shipment, and trans-shipment between Europe and the continent of America is a growing business and will be bigger business.</P>
    <P>I want to say something now which is relevant to what my colleague, Deputy McLaughlin, said.  A very interesting case was put forward within the past year by a former director of the IDA, Dr. Cathal Loughney, in relation to industrial development in the west.  He pointed out that one of the factors which inhibits industrial development along the western seaboard is the high cost of transport, particularly from the port of Dublin and other eastern ports.  He put forward the view that the scheme of grants administered by the IDA should incorporate some form of transport subsidisation for industrialists who would be prepared to set up an industry along the western seaboard where employment is very badly needed.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether any survey has been made, whether any information is available, or whether the Minister and his Department have made any assessment of the relationship <Col N="1998" /> between transport costs and the development of industry along the western seaboard.  I would be very grateful to hear the Minister's observations on this because this is a matter in which I am keenly interested by reason of my interest in transport and western development.</P>
    <P>This should be possible in order to encourage the establishment of industry along the western seaboard, if we are serious about western development. I was horrified to find that many of the people who have been very vocal about western development, and about saving the west, proved to be complete hypocrites in relation to another issue.  If the Minister is serious about industrial development in the west, and serious about retaining at least the existing population in the western towns and in the rural areas in the west, this whole question of transport subsidisation for industrial development along the western seaboard will have to be looked into.</P>
    <P>There are numerous other items which arise on this Estimate on which I do not propose to speak since the views of the Fine Gael Party have been put forward very adequately by my colleague Deputy Donegan.  In conclusion I should like to express the hope that the year that lies ahead will be more favourable for industrial development and that there will be a reversal of the unfortunate trend towards redundancy that we have seen in 1971.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>In general the observations made by the various Deputies in this debate were extremely constructive. The wide-ranging nature of the comments made makes my task this evening a sort of broken one.  I intend to try to deal with as many of the points raised as I possibly can and I anticipate that my remarks may, of necessity, be a bit disjointed.  I will, however, endeavour to cover the debate as fully as I possibly can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell was extremely worried about my capacity to stand up to this in view of the rather difficult 24 hours he felt I had been through.  I should like to console him and say <Col N="1999" /> that I feel reasonably easy about it.  In fact, my normal Saturday at home would put me through far more difficult problems than the problems I have had over the past 24 hours.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan led off for the Opposition.  His contribution to the debate was extremely constructive, as usual I must say.  I had this experience when I sat in for the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries some years ago.  This is my second experience of dealing with the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  On all occasions his contributions have been extremely constructive. I think I should say this.</P>
    <P>He spoke about industrial development. He attributed the fact that not enough new jobs have been created mainly to two major factors.  He decided that the difficulty arose from instability of Government, that due to what he described as the present instability, foreign industrialists and <i>entrepreneurs</i> were disinclined to develop new industries here.  I should be in a position to disillusion the Deputy in this regard.  From my understanding of the situation from the reports coming to hand from the Industrial Development Authority and from practical experience of the IDA, and to the knowledge of Deputy O'Donnell who spoke last on this Estimate, there are a number of outside industrialists who are marking time waiting for the final decision as far as we are concerned to join the EEC, so that they can go ahead with their development plans at that stage.  If there is any indecision or postponement of decision it is not because of any problem within the Government but because of the fact that we have not as yet had the national referendum which will put the rubber stamp on our entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>The second cause cited by the Deputy is one that of necessity one must agree is a major factor in the promotion of exports coincidental with the development of industry and it is something about which I and my pre-decessors have on many occasions warned against, that is, the danger that we might price ourselves out of <Col N="2000" /> markets if costs are allowed to rise too much.  The Deputy referred to that today and said he hoped his remarks would not be taken out of context.  I have no intention of taking his remarks out of context.  He did make the point that if the cost of living could be kept down in relation to the cost of production, and one went with the other, it would be possible to generate further industry here and at the same time maintain living standards with a comparatively low rate of cost.  This is desperately easy to argue but it is not so easy to attain.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell said that there was nothing in my speech which would indicate that anything was being done to procure more jobs or to develop further industry.  This is an extraordinary sort of statement and it is a statement that it is pretty difficult to take inasmuch as this was the presentation of an Estimate which showed that an additional £4½ million was provided for industrial development in the original Estimate and I was in a position to indicate that an additional £6 million had been laid aside further to augment the £23 million which had already been provided in this year's Estimate.  I was in a position to state that in this year provision had been made for the spending of £29 million to attract industry to this country, as compared with a figure of £18½ million last year.  In face of that, Deputy O'Connell had the audacity to say that there was nothing in my speech which would indicate that the Government were doing anything to create further jobs or to attract further industry to the country.</P>
    <P>We had Deputy Desmond pointing out that the Government invariably claim responsibility for progress while, on the other hand, they disclaim responsibility for failure.  In direct contradiction of that statement he went on to say that if there had been any progress it was progress that would have come anyway, despite the Government, and that failure was the Government's responsibility.</P>
    <P>The contributions to this debate from the Opposition benches indicate a clear divergence of opinion as to the causes of the number of redundancies that <Col N="2001" /> have occurred over the past 12 months. During the course of the past year, by way of Parliamentary Questions and arising from speeches made by Opposition Deputies, the overall impression has been created that it was the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement that had been responsible for almost all of the redundancies that have occurred during this period.  I outlined the position this morning and limited reference was made to the effects of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  It was clear to me from the debate that the factors which I spelt out, world conditions and so on, were reasonably fully accepted by the Deputies who contributed to this debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell, in general terms, dismissed my contribution as containing nothing.  I have just referred to the fact that it did contain the information that the money being provided this year for industrial development is in fact&mdash;in one year&mdash;almost 50 per cent more than was provided last year.  Nevertheless the Deputy found it possible to say that there was nothing at all in my speech this morning.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention another matter now that Deputy Desmond is here.  I am not saying that in a derogatory way because Deputy Desmond has been here for most of the day, like Deputy Donegan and myself.  We did sneak out to get a bite.  Deputy O'Connell said that it would be very useful if the Department of Industry and Commerce and the various State-sponsored bodies that come under their aegis were to attract into their ranks successful businessmen, persons who had made a success of their own jobs, and tried to use them in the general development of the various businesses in which they were involved.  I deliberately interrupted to draw Deputy O'Connell's attention to the fact that a colleague of his had criticised the action of the Minister for Finance in introducing four well-known, successful businessmen as representatives of the State into a commercial concern recently.  The Deputy said he welcomed the Government's use of successful businessmen and their contribution to industrial development.  I know the Deputy was not present to hear it but I would refer him to the debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no objection from anyone except the Deputy. Deputy O'Connell suggested that it might be a good thing if we were to bring in foreign expertise to train some of our unskilled workers to become skilled in some specific trade in which there might be a scarcity at present. Deputy O'Connell made this suggestion <Col N="2003" /> at the same time as he was attacking various sectors of Government for bringing in foreign experts to examine the workings of various businesses.  In this regard over the last few years when the Industrial Development Authority attracted in some industry in which there was a lack of know-how when the industry was getting off the ground, there was an arrangement whereby a number of potential workers in that new industry could be grant-aided towards going, to perhaps, the home base in whatever country it was to do a term of training in preparation for their future work in the factory.  This system has worked pretty well up to now.  This problem was raised at the recent meeting to which I referred this morning and at which the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Labour and myself met the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The Taoiseach asked the ICTU to try to persuade certain unions to modify their opposition to giving recognition to people being trained by AnCo in certain industrial techniques here.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties I always find about replying to a debate on the day on which it occurs&mdash;and I am not saying I have any objection to doing that; it is always very welcome from a Minister's point of view&mdash;is that while one has recollections of what the contributor has said, one is always not too sure until the Official Record has been checked.  However, as far as I can recollect, Deputy Donegan said it would be Fine Gael policy, if they assumed office, to provide grants at new-industry level where there is major expansion of existing industry.  That would not be new policy.  That is the situation at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not appear to be the policy that is being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the policy.  As a matter of fact I did promise during Question Time today, arising from supplementaries, to go into more detail during my reply on this Estimate on the question raised by Deputy Donegan as to what industries are globally disqualified from receiving grants either for new industrial projects or re-equipment, <Col N="2004" /> and the reason for such disqualification.  Spelt out in the background information arising from the reply today in connection with new industrial grants is, first, that the purpose of the scheme is to encourage the establishment of new manufacturing industry and the major expansion of existing industries.  That is the position as far as the IDA are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, expansion of existing industry, even though major, does not enjoy the higher level of grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position, but if there are any problems in that regard which cannot be ironed out with the IDA, perhaps the Deputy would care to contact me, but I do not think it will be necessary.  The reply on this question could have been so exhaustive today that it was not appropriate to Question Time, but in the meantime I had the opportunity of checking on the joinery aspect.  The supplementary to the reply today developed into a discussion as to whether there was prohibition on the allocation of re-equipment grants for joiners.  Taking what one would describe as standard joinery, windows, doors, <i>et cetera,</i> that is a sensitive area.  This does not apply to off-standard joinery such as furniture, built-in wordrobes, bar fittings, <i>et cetera</i>.  However, standard joinery is suffering from a national over-capacity at the present time, that is, even within the State; there is no question of pressure from outside.  Nevertheless, the IDA will look seriously at an application for grant assistance if the applicant can show, for example, that there is a local developing market and that the project has export potential such as cross-Border trade.  In the matter of such things as wardrobes, bath fittings and so on, there is no problem.  Each case is examined on its merits.  I do not know if that covers what the Deputy was asking me.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2005" /> There may be a lack of immediate pressure because of the question mark about our EEC entry prospects, but it is anticipated, and my solid information from the IDA is, that there is a sort of back-up in the pipeline of applicants who are preparing for determination of our EEC application.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to boardroom decisions in Birmingham and Chicago that can never be counted on. The Deputy will appreciate that, while no one can claim there are genuine decisions of this nature, it is just as easy to say they have been made, because the question is not one of the Government being in a state of chassis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the other hand, it is unfair to say that trouble within the Government is responsible for the indecision or the changing of decisions in this respect.  From information available in SFADCO, Deputy O'Donnell was able to tell us that American industrialists are waiting for the final EEC entry decision and that it has nothing to do with any problems across the floor of the House.</P>

      <P>I am supposed to have the last word, anyway.  I referred to the EEC earlier today and I will have to refer to it again because most Deputies who spoke did so.  Deputy Desmond was not as happy as Deputy Donegan in relation to the success of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in regard to export tax reliefs.  He read it differently from the Government's presentation of it and from the manner in which <Col N="2006" /> Deputy Donegan read it.  In a reasonably short time we shall have a full debate on the White Paper on the EEC and it would be preferable not to anticipate that discussion in this respect.  I shall satisfy myself by reiterating&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We see it as the Commission see it and we are satisfied with the preservation of the export tax relief provisions.  If at any stage before the end of their promised life they have to be altered in any way, the alternative provisions will be at least as attractive as what we have been giving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on the record.  We can further develop that subject during the discussion on the EEC White Paper.  Deputy Desmond went on from that to the question of the Protocol and he suggested that there was no industrial regional development plan. In relation to the regional planning which the IDA are doing, he complained that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had given no directive to the regional managers or the regional officers of the IDA in relation to plans for the various areas.  He went on to say that he objected to a State-sponsored body doing the planning for the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I make my points in some peculiar way which prompts the Deputy to comment.  The present arrangement is that the IDA regional officers, in consultation with the various local groups, are preparing the regional plans.  All the proposals will be collectively looked at, even in conjunction with the overall looking at Buchanan, and then will come to Government, having been completely vetted at top level by the IDA.  I personally think that is the ideal arrangement, and it is in fact the answer to the criticism, which Deputy O'Connell came up with tonight, about bringing in outside experts.  Here we have our own experts, something which was recommended by Deputy McLaughlin, and I do not think anybody would really object to it, except Deputy Desmond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection is that, when you get the reports, you do nothing with them.  That is what has happened since 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection and my note of the message given to the House today by Deputy Desmond was that he objected to a State-sponsored body doing the thinking and the planning on behalf of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Being obliged to do so&mdash;that is my point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see what the record says in due course.  I certainly think that the arrangement worked out is the proper one.  It is planning, as I see it, by Irish people, who know best in their own given areas what the requirements <Col N="2008" /> of those areas are, and here we have the Government looking at these plans with a view to being able to link them in with the general overall development plans which are contemporaneously going on and I think this is the best approach yet to overall regional planning.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond went on to describe the various reports already prepared by the Committee on Industrial Progress as in general being non-progressive and that they are a reproduction of the CIO reports, or coming to the same conclusions as the CIO reports came to in the early sixties.  Coming to the same conclusions does not make the reports inconsistent.  That in fact is really the message that needs to be got across to industry.  The message was got across early in the sixties and succeeding Ministers for Industry and Commerce, and other Ministers, have endeavoured to get across the message to industry to re-adapt and re-equip, and this is what all the re-equipment and re-adaptation grants have been for and geared towards over the last number of years.  The Deputy did not quite spell out what he meant by forcing the implementation and I think he did suggest that I set up a whole lot of development councils to work this out. This is not the solution.  Exhortation and inducement, as I see it, is the most practical way to get industrialists, who are disinclined to do so&mdash;in some cases they are only now waking up to the problems they are going to face, and are facing, in a free trade situation&mdash; to prepare themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the forcing of the implementation of the recommendations is the ideal solution in this type of situation and I am positive that to endeavour to force our industrialists into re-equipment or adaptation would not be a solution to any problem. Certainly, from the point of view of overall management in any industry, unless management is able to bring the workers along with them, the industry cannot be a success, and from the point of view of a Government endeavouring to force industry along with it, that could not possibly be successful either, and all I can continue to do in that regard, as Minister, is to <Col N="2009" /> endeavour to prevail on, to cajole and to do what I possibly can to encourage the sectors of industry which have not so far taken the advice of the experts which is so freely available to them through the various agencies in my Department.  I can only continue to appeal to them to take this advice because this is the expert advice, which, if ignored, can only lead to closures of further industries and to a loss of jobs situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell spoke of the number of people who have become redundant in Shannon over the past 12 months.  I have met deputations in this regard and it has to be accepted that we have had a certain amount of redundancy in the Shannon area.  My information from SFADCO and the IDA is that everything possible is being done in an effort to attract further industry in to replace industries which have in recent months closed down. There is the situation in which we have had lay-offs in some of these industries, while in various others there have been further expansions. SFADCO are quite confident that, within a reasonable period, within a period of the next 12 to 18 months, they will be in a position of having attracted in more than sufficient to make up for the job losses.  In fact, they have plans at the moment and they hope that they will have in production new industries there which will have provided 1,000 new jobs within the period of the next year and a half to two years.</P>
    <P>In addition, as Deputy O'Donnell said&mdash;he said he welcomed two sizeable industries into County Limerick which would partly compensate for the loss of employment in the Shannon town area&mdash;there are the Ferenka and Howmedica industries, which it is hoped will be well off the ground inside the next 12 months, and in fact Ferenka are at present recruiting workers.  I referred to the fact already that Deputy O'Donnell was looking forward to membership of EEC and he said that from his experience of the area as he saw it, there was a great future for the Shannon Industrial Estate in an EEC situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2010" /> Deputy McLaughlin went out of his way to stress the need for further industry in his own area and this is understandable from the point of view of a rural Deputy.  I have had this experience myself.  He complimented Deputy Donegan for his efforts down the years to attract industry into Sligo town area, and at the same time, Deputy McLaughlin, even though he represents Sligo, was naturally anxious to see industrial development in County Leitrim.  This is something to which I fully subscribe.  I may be doing Deputy Donegan an injustice in this regard, but I think that in last year's debate he said that we should not concentrate too much on that but should really develop Sligo and provide jobs for people to go into.  I think I am right in saying that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister might be shading it.  What I did say was that, if it had to be, it would be preferable that people might have to move from one place within the country to another rather than one of these other places.  I certainly did not extol the virtues of industry in Sligo as against industries in Leitrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy McLaughlin gave due credit to the potential which SNIA held for that expansion, the huge expansion in the Sligo area.  While I am conscious of the fact that the IDA have not been as successful as they might have been in the Leitrim area, I know, of my personal knowledge, arising from conversations I had with the IDA, that they have had difficulties in regard to the provision of an advance factory at Manorhamilton.  They have been endeavouring since the advance factory programme was first mooted to get a factory established in Manorhamilton. I have been under considerable pressure from one of my colleagues about this and I have no doubt the problem will be solved as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are problems of this nature in the Leitrim area but Deputy McLaughlin specifically said the Government had done nothing for Drumshanbo.  There is one industry in Drumshanbo at the present time and from the limited amount of foreign <Col N="2011" /> travel I have done I know that the management of that factory are extremely active in the export market. The Deputy did pay tribute to the developments which have taken place in Tubbercurry and Arigna.  While the Deputy appreciates those developments, he seems to write them off as not contributing a great deal to the economy of the area, but I understand they are contributing to a great extent. The IDA are fully conscious of the needs of further industrial development in that area and are doing all they can in this direction.  I have no doubt that when the regional programme is prepared further development will take place.  The Deputy thought there was no point in the IDA telling local development associations to try a little harder; he felt the IDA should go and see what the problems were.  The regional development offices of the IDA are established for this purpose. I hope by the time next year's Estimate comes around that we will be able to discuss the progress which has been made in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to be able to look at the Deputy's smiling face over there. Deputy McLaughlin said there was nowhere in the West able to take bumper yields of farm produce.  This does not directly concern me as Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;it is more a matter for the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;but I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that I read almost every day in the newspapers of constant appeals being made by the Sugar Company to farmers to grow more beet and potatoes in order to keep the factory in Tuam going, so I do not think the Deputy need worry about that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond spoke of the need for restricting the control of Irish industrial enterprises by foreign groups, although at a later stage in his speech he said he welcomed foreign investment in industrial development.  His earlier objection seemed to me to be contradicted by his later statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>During my speech this morning I said I was providing legislation for the investigation and control of takeovers and mergers.  I hope this legislation will guard against the abuse referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>When dealing with redundancies Deputy Desmond said that they could have been reduced if the Government had acted on the NIEC Report on Full Employment.  This morning I outlined the factors which gave rise to these redundancies.  I do not accept that redundancy is due to either Government action or inaction.  It is natural for the Opposition to blame redundancy on the Government, but during the course of the debate it has been accepted across the House that there were a number of contributory factors which could not be attributed to Government action or inaction.</P>
      <P>Deputies Donegan, McLaughlin and O'Donnell referred to the subsidisation of transport costs for industries in the West.  Deputy Donegan said he was satisfied that the Rome Treaty could be read as not being specifically against subsidisation if a decision were to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite so&mdash;that an exception could be made.  I checked on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that provision could be made if, after a study, the Government felt that this was a useful contribution.  The general policy of the EEC is not to allow transport subsidies which would be regarded as a distortion of competition.  I am satisfied that if it were decided to introduce a subsidy of this nature it could be done without being in conflict with the Treaty of Rome.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan clapped himself on the back for having stirred the Minister for Industry and Commerce in April or May last into doing something rather speedily about reviewing the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  Under the terms agreed a review was to start on the 1st July, 1970.</P>

I disagree with the Deputy.  The review had, of necessity, to take place first.  There was no point in trying to talk to the British about matters that had not been reviewed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

      <P>Deputy Dr. O'Connell spoke about the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  He said that the agreement was working to our disadvantage and brought havoc in its wake.  This was dealt with in my speech.  The suggestion that the agreement gave rise to redundancies was dealt with on pages 12 and 13 of my speech.  I presume there was no point in dealing with it because Deputy O'Connell said there was nothing in my speech so obviously he had not read it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy said that the Anti-Dumping Commission were not doing their job.  I want to say that this commission have investigated all cases of <Col N="2014" /> alleged dumping and it is wrong to say they have been neglecting their job. Many cases of appeals against dumping turn out to be appeals for protection against competition.  This is one of the factors: straightforward competition cannot be proved to be dumping.  The most convenient thing to say in connection with it is that it is dumping.  This is why those allegations are made against the Anti-Dumping Commission.</P>
    <P>Nearly every Deputy spoke in glowing terms about the various State agencies under the control of my Department, the Industrial Development Authority, the CTT, which came in for quite a fair share of general praise, and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  I should like to acknowledge the various tributes paid to those organisations.  My experience in my time as Minister for Industry and Commerce for a little over a year has been that all of those organisations are dedicated to serving the needs of the country.  I deeply resent any unfair criticism of those organisations.</P>
    <P>Criticism of the IDA that they do not give a sufficient grant for some particular project is reasonably acceptable, but nobody today criticised any of those organisations and it is very satisfactory for me to acknowledge on their behalf the tributes which were paid to them.  I want to avail of this opportunity of conveying to them the House's appreciation of their efforts. Córas Tráchtála got a good deal of very merited praise today.  Any Member of the House who read my speech today will realise the tremendous progress made in exports, but let us not forget that much of the exports have been generated by the exporters themselves and by the quality of the goods produced.  I should like to join with the House in paying the very deserved tributes to those various organisations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond said the Small Industries Programme should be looked at again.  On the other hand, Deputy O'Donnell paid tribute to this division in the IDA and specifically drew attention to the 7,400 jobs which I had pointed out had been created since the establishment some five years <Col N="2015" /> ago of this programme.  There is at this stage no positive need, as I see it, to have any serious look at it again. The IDA will be able to look after any problems that may arise in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan felt we were not geared up sufficiently at this stage for our entry to EEC.  After complimenting CTT on their endeavours so far, he said he was pleased to see they were opening offices in Brussels and Milan but questioned whether that was sufficient at this stage.  He even said it was too late.  As I see it, Córas Tráchtála must allocate their resources in the most beneficial way possible. They must decide which activities they should follow up, in what countries they should undertake particular projects and keep the position under constant review.</P>
    <P>With an office in Brussels and offices in Paris, Düsseldorf and Milan, they will be represented in each of the EEC countries.  The office in Brussels will cover the Benelux countries.  From my knowledge of CTT, if we were able to have 12 rather than six of those offices, it would be of great benefit to us.</P>
    <P>It is a question of CTT's energies. They are now endeavouring to generate exports in preparation for our entry into the EEC.  Because of my knowledge of the capacity and ability of the people there for the job I do not accept the contention that it is too late. Deputy Donegan also suggested that a subsidy should be paid to help exporters to get a hold in the Common Market.  This kind of subsidy would be contrary to our commitments under GATT and would immediately attract countervailing duties in the EEC countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

      <P>Deputy O'Connell made the point that there was no provision for credit for export and small exporters could not carry on an export trade because of this.  Over the past 12 months arrangements have been made for financing exports.  A firm, be it large or small, can get credit at the special rate of 7 per cent for from one to five years on the sole condition that the firm gets an export credit guarantee insurance.  This new scheme was evolved within the past 12 months and there is no reason why any exporter of capital goods should have any problem.</P>

The CII some years ago, to my predecessor, and the Congress of Trade Unions early this year to the Taoiseach and to me, expressed their lack of confidence in the Department being seen to do justice to applicants for price increases.  On the other hand, the consumer saw the Department as letting applicants get away with murder.

The Merchandise Marks Act enables me to lay down regulations or make orders and insist on descriptions and, if necessary, on the weight and content of packages being displayed.  The order is being prepared at present in respect of a number of items and I hope to be able to make <Col N="2019" /> an announcement about it reasonably soon.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan made a statement in connection with Irish Steel Holdings and the question of the inquiry.  I do not know if it is in progress at present or is about to take place.  It is in regard to the supply of scrap.  The Deputy accused the Minister of setting up this inquiry which is not so. Complaints had been made over the period and in reply to parliamentary Questions on a number of occasions I said that if people had complaints in this regard they should be referred to the fair Trade Commission.</P>

      <P>No, I agree.  I am not saying that.  I answered questions on 4th December, 1969, from Deputies Fox, Donnellan, Belton and Burke asking if the Minister was aware of the excessive discrepancy in prices paid by Irish Steel Holdings to persons engaged in the business of scrap steel. There were similar questions by <Col N="2020" /> Deputy O'Donnell on 16th July, 1970. The Deputies were informed on both occasions that I was aware of only one complaint which originated from an interested group who were told in December, 1969, that the matter should be referred to the Fair Trade Commission if there was a complaint.</P>

I would be open to criticism and nobody would criticise quicker than the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I was a little disappointed at the attitude of the House in one regard.  Deputies went down through my speech, and many of them had much to say about the effect of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, how little prepared we were, and so on, but, with the exception of Deputy Briscoe, nobody joined me in appealing to the people to buy Irish and to sell Irish.  Deputy Donegan said there was nothing in a certain section of my speech except the Minister's &ldquo;usual jazz&rdquo; about buying Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I said it in relation to small shopkeepers when you were offering them the advice to sell <Col N="2021" /> Irish.  That is not much use to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not apologise to anybody for asking shopkeepers, big and small, to sell Irish.  I think we should do more in this regard.  I can be criticised, and many will criticise me, for not raising this, that or the other barrier to prevent articles from coming in so that various factories can be kept open.  The necessity would not arise if the people, purchasers, consumers and sellers, did their part.  The more I study this the more I find myself having to find fault with the seller who is projecting the imported article.  Perhaps this is because he can make more profit from it; I do not know; I have not been able to analyse it sufficiently.  I spoke today about £450 million worth of exports.  People across the world in the course of last year spent £450 million buying Irish products yet, unfortunately, there are people in this country who do not think these products good enough for them.  I find this abominable and I shall use every possible opportunity to draw attention to it.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion that I did this I was approached by members of the distributive trade in Dublin who drew my attention to the fact that there is a developing problem in this regard in that manufacturers who engage in export are inclined to neglect the home customer and concentrate on export, only supplying the home market if they have a surplus which they cannot export.  I should like to warn our manufacturers about that.  They cannot expect much sympathy from distributors if the distributor is abused in this regard.</P>
      <P>In paying tribute to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards Deputy Briscoe spoke of it as a very valuable institution.  I fully agree and I appeal to industry to make more use of the institute which is there to give the fullest assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have endeavoured to deal as exhaustively as possible with the points raised in the debate.  I have some further notes and I propose in relation to certain matters raised to communicate with the Deputies concerned when I have an opportunity of investigating <Col N="2022" /> more fully matters that I cannot deal with fully at this stage.</P>
    <P>It is rather difficult at the end of a day such as this, when I have been out of the House for a few moments on a number of occasions, to be comprehensive but I have endeavoured to deal with all the matters raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>When I gave notice that I was raising this matter on the adjournment I did so because I felt that the Labour Court would by now have reached some conclusion.  I understand that the Labour Court is still in session and I do not wish to say anything that would exacerbate a very delicate situation.  However, I have been approached by relatives of patients and I feel that, as a public representative, it is my duty and the duty of this House to express our grave concern and to request both bodies to find a solution at the earliest possible hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last seven or eight hours I and my fellow Deputies have been in contact with different mental hospitals throughout the State.  The reports which we have been getting are constant and consistent inasmuch as they indicate that the good work of the psychiatric nurses, in relation to <Col N="2023" /> the improvement of patients, could be lost if a reasonable solution is not found at the earliest possible date.  I am told that the patients who had the privilege of moving to tuck shops under reasonable escort are now confined. I am told that the patients who were undergoing occupational therapy are also confined.  These people are not used to confinement and they are confused and their condition is deteriorating. I have medical opinion to the effect that unless a solution is found soon many years of good work will be lost.</P>
    <P>It is with this background that I came into the House to appeal to both sides to exercise their good offices to arrive at a solution which will have this strike finished at the earliest possible hour or minute.  Having said that, I feel that the Department of Health should recognise that the psychiatric nurses perform a duty that can be best described as a dedication or a vocation.  I do not think there is any other group of people in the country who perform duties as dedicatedly as the psychiatric nurses.  I believe these men and women perform quite a noble job.  I am, personally, of the opinion that their claim is a reasonable one and without getting into the pros and cons of the Labour Court, and being deeply conscious of the part the Labour Court plays in the fabric of our society it would be extremely dangerous of me at this point of time to say anything that might weaken any one particular case or strengthen the other, nevertheless, on balance, I feel I am justified in saying that this strike never should have happened.  It should have been attended to long ago.  I am not concerned, nor do I wish to involve myself, in the arguments or the claims relating to monetary or other conditions of employment except to say that I cannot help thinking that the strike is now deadlocked on the question of promotion on seniority.  I want to pose this question to the Minister.  If promotion on seniority is wrong how many people over the number of years that we have had mental hospitals in operation have been bypassed?  In what way has it failed?</P>
    <P>How often has someone been <Col N="2024" /> selected on promise rather than on performance?  I do not want to come down on any particular side but I feel justified in asking is it worthwhile to have a strike of such a national character and of such a serious nature on such an issue?  I want to say that if anything can be done by the Minister to influence the powers-that-be or, indeed, if there are union representatives who can be influenced they should sit down and seriously consider a compromise on the question of promotion by seniority.  My opinion is that, if I had the power to promote any person, that promotion would be on performance taking seniority into consideration. This is the crux of the whole matter.  With that background, I wish to say that it has come to my attention that 500 patients in St. Brendan's Hospital today have been looked after by 14 nurses, some of whom could not find relief and stayed on until today when they were relieved. Some of them were on duty for 24 hours.</P>
    <P>My information is that since the strike the nurses have been providing voluntary service.  They have provided a skeleton service voluntarily and without pay.  I want to say that all due credit is due to the nurses.  They have recognised their duties to the patients and have acted in a most humane manner.  Patients are not used to being neglected.  I am told that in my own county there are no laundry facilities. But for the fact that the nurses and domestic staff took the precaution of having extra laundry provided before the strike the position would be chaotic at the moment.  This position can only last a couple of days.  The toilet facilities leave much to be desired.  I am told that beds are not made in the manner in which they should be made.  The geriatric patients are receiving all reasonable attention which the nurses can give them.  It is very difficult for me to be critical of the Department of Health because if I do so I am then taking sides and I could be creating more difficulties than I am trying to solve.  I know the Minister, Deputy Seán Flanagan, who is acting for the Minister for Health. reasonably well.  I respected him as Minister for Health and I still respect <Col N="2025" /> him acting in that capacity tonight.  I have every confidence that this appeal of mine will not go unheard when I ask him to take every measure possible to ensure that people will act reasonably.</P>
    <P>If, in my opinion, the strike can be called off on this one point of promotion by seniority then I think the Minister will agree with me that is too frivolous a point on which to allow many of our people&mdash;who are the weakest section of our society and who do not even know what the strike is about&mdash;to bear the hardships involved. We, as human beings, should do our best to improve the position.</P>
    <P>If this strike is not finished by the time the Dáil meets again, I will ask the Minister for Health to intercede. I should like to put on record that I would like an all-party deputation to go to St. Brendan's Hospital, which is the largest mental hospital in the country, tomorrow morning.  Possibly we could meet here at 11 a.m. and go to St. Brendan's to see for ourselves what is happening.  We must take an active interest so that we may solve the problem with the least possible delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points put forward by Deputy Harte.  I represent a constituency which has two psychiatric hospitals.  If this strike is not brought to an early finish patients will suffer serious hardships in the not too distant future.  In both hospitals voluntary nursing services have been available to look after the patients. We must remember that many of the patients are not in a desirable state in so far as hygiene and health are concerned.  Steps should have been taken by the Minister and the Department to ensure that this strike did not take place.  It is a well-known fact that people in the nursing profession, especially psychiatric nurses, have a delicate task to perform.  In many cases such nursing is a unenviable occupation. Throughout the years these nurses have devoted themselves to this profession. They have done this job with pride and distinction.  It is regrettable that, after all the years service which they have given to this profession, that a situation such as this should have been allowed to develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2026" /> We all know that it is not adequate just to give drugs to the patients night and morning.  The patients need more than that.  Any break in their daily routine can be detrimental to them. Some patients might never recover from the ill-effects of a break in their treatment.  More should have been done to prevent this crisis.  I have the greatest confidence in Deputy Seán Flanagan.  I regret that the Minister for Health was not in a position to be here tonight and also that he refused to intervene in this crisis.  This strike is very serious.  It affects many people throughout the country, many of whom are not in a position to look after themselves.</P>

      <P>I wish to endorse what Deputy Harte and Deputy Fox have said.  So far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we certainly do not want to make politics out of this issue.  This matter has been under discussion for more than 11 years and it is a pity this strike was allowed to take place.  However, it is only fair to say that Members of the Dáil did good <Col N="2027" /> work, because Deputy Noel Browne, Dr. Deputy O'Connell and the leader of Fine Gael tabled a Special Notice Question on Tuesday last asking the people concerned to sit down around a table and try to settle this strike.  As we speak here tonight I think that is being done.  The people who have met since early morning and who spent 11 hours yesterday in an effort to come to a satisfactory agreement are to be congratulated.</P>
      <P>According to a letter of 26th June, 1970, the Minister suggested that &ldquo;a certain number of permanent appointments could safely be made now in anticipation of the eventual settlement of the promotional issue&rdquo;.  I would ask the Minister if it is true that the chief executive officers of the health board refused to carry out the Minister's recommendation?  I have been told the representatives of the unions were prepared to accept the Minister's recommendation at that time, but it appears the CEOs were not prepared to do so.  I should like to ask the Minister if they are acting as bureaucratic dictators?</P>
      <P>This is no ordinary strike.  The lives of the patients and the safety of the nurses are at stake.  In some places one nurse has charge of from 80 to 100 patients where there should be nine or ten nurses to carry out the work. Wonderful co-operation and harmony has existed during the years among the staff, and if this strike is allowed to escalate this harmony could be damaged irreparably.  I hope the Minister, the Department of Health and everyone concerned will make an allout effort to bring this unfortunate strike to an end immediately.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to thank Deputies for their approach to this problem and to say that it is a very serious matter that there should be a strike in the psychiatric service.  Nothing I shall say will in any way interfere with the negotiations which are going on at this moment and which we hope will lead to a settlement of the strike within a matter of hours.</P>

      <Col N="2028" /> With regard to the complaints made by Deputy Harte about conditions in particular hospitals, I should like to mention that the unions undertook to maintain a limited staff and a limited service, and if there are shortcomings it would be up to them to see that they are remedied.  Of course, that is on the pessimistic basis that a settlement will not be forthcoming very quickly.</P>
    <P>May I say it should be obvious to everyone that the two parties to a dispute of this kind could not possibly have allowed a strike situation to develop unless there was disagreement on something of fundamental importance to the service itself.  I must remind the House about the meaning of the word &ldquo;service&rdquo; in regard to any kind of patient, and in particular in regard to mental patients.  It is a service to patients and it is the longterm interest of the patients that everybody on management and staff should be concerned about.  There is, and has been for some time, a deep divergence of opinion between the unions representing the staff and the management as to what is the proper structuring of the service to the patients from a longterm point of view.  It would be wrong of us in this House to suggest that either side was anything but sincere in its views.  What they are talking about now is not of a compromise, I would hope, but of a reasonable settlement of views as regards the betterment of the psychiatric service for the patients.</P>
    <P>There were proposals put forward on which I shall not comment because I do not think it appropriate to do so. They are proposals which sought to deal with the promotional problem about which Deputy Harte is particularly concerned.  As he knows, this is not a black-and-white problem; it is full of greys and different colours and I can only express the hope that the talks going on at the moment will result in a satisfactory settlement of that major issue.</P>
    <P>There are many other issues also and I believe that, with goodwill on all sides, these can be settled.  Might I say in the short term that, in view of the fact that these talks have been going on for so long and that there <Col N="2029" /> must be, and obviously is, good will on both sides to find a settlement, it would be a splendid gesture on the part of the two unions and the association concerned if they would say: &ldquo;We believe we can find a solution and we ask our staff to go back to work immediately.&rdquo;  I think it would be of practical help if the unions and the <Col N="2030" /> association were to ask their staff to do this and if they put their faith in the good sense and judgment of the two sides and in that way bring this strike to an end immediately.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 16th November, 1971.</P>
