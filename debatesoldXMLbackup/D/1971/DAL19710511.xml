    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a progress report on the introduction of the necessary measures to ensure effective representation from the agricultural sector on the National Industrial Economic Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to previous Dáil questions, the Government decided on the formation, in succession to the National Industrial Economic Council, of a more broadly-based National Economic Council.  The question of effecting agricultural representation on the NIEC does not arise, as the Government have terminated the mandate of that body pending the establishment of the new council which is intended to include agricultural representation.  An announcement to that effect was made on the 18th January last.</P>
      <P>Discussions with interested parties on the establishment of the new council have been in progress for some time past; these will be brought to a conclusion as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the adverse trade balance for the first four months of 1971 is greater than it was for the first four months of 1970; if so, the reasons; and what action the Government intends to take to correct the imbalance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As yet, trade statistics are available only for the first three months of 1971.  These show a rise of about £29.7 million in the import excess as compared with the corresponding period of 1970.  The reason for the increase was a substantial rise in imports, the principal element in which was two Boeing 747 aircraft, which added some £20 million to the import bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to the final part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to the speech of the Minister for Finance when introducing the recent Budget in which he outlined the economic policies to be implemented by the Government this year.  The purpose of these policies is, <i>inter alia,</i> to bring about an improvement in the balance of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not admit that a further increase of £29.7 million should be causing grave concern to the Government?  Will he not further admit that the Government's policy of inflation down through the years has been pricing our exports out of both the British markets and, if we enter the EEC, the European markets?  Is he not aware that due to inflationary trends we are now pricing ourselves out of the Irish market, that British products are more and more on sale in Irish shops and that consequently Irish employees are losing their jobs in our factories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the Government do not have a policy of inflation.  On the contrary, our policy is to avoid inflation and to reverse the inflationary trend.  I agree that inflation tends to put up the price of goods, especially home produced goods, and therefore tends to make them less competitive. Fortunately, the trend of inflation is being felt in other countries, particularly those who trade with us, so that our competitive position has not been so adverse.  As was indicated in the Budget and as is inherent in Government policy, the inflationary trend is now bending in the right direction and I hope that in future months our goods will be more competitive and that this in turn will have an advantageous effect on employment.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware the Government, through Córas Tráchtála, have made a wide range of grants, incentives and other services available to exporters and these apply to exports to France.  As part of its range of services, Córas Tráchtála maintains an office in Paris.  In the Embassy in <Col N="1456" /> Paris an officer is assigned full-time to trade promotion work.</P>
    <P>The efforts made to expand our exports to France have met with considerable success in recent years.  This is evident from the increase which was achieved between 1967 and 1970 during which period the value of our exports rose from £6.5 million to £13.5 million.</P>

      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise that, while the farmers represent roughly 30 per cent of the population, they are getting only about 17 per cent of the total national income?  Is he not aware that the gap between their income and that of other sections of the community has widened to as much as £8.50 per week now?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary in favour of this continuing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of £2 million is based on what moderate contributions under the scheme would yield.  As indicated in my written reply to a question by Deputy Hogan on 5th May, details of this will be announced when I bring the necessary Bill before the House. As these details are not yet completed, I cannot now say what the rate of contribution will be nor can I at the moment give a detailed breakdown of the numbers in the different income categories to be covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this is evading the question that has been asked.  A figure of £2 million was put into the Budget speech.  It must have been set on some fixed basis for different categories some of whom are known because they are already covered by social welfare contributions.  Is it not an absolute neglect of the normal procedure in connection with matters of this character to refuse to give information when the figure was arrived at after some assessment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure was arrived at after some assessment, but it will not help the Deputy if I tell him a figure that may not be the final figure. The contribution would be of the order of a flat rate of some 12 to 16p.  I cannot say exactly what the figure would be per week per person, or per contributor.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question on 13th May, 1970 in which I intimated that, pending the outcome of discussions on the proposed reorganisation of hospital services in South Dublin, as envisaged in the FitzGerald Report, it would not be possible to take a decision about the future of St. Catherine's Hospital.  These discussions are still in progress and while considerable advances have been made on the general pattern of hospital services in South Dublin, it will be some considerable time yet before a decision could be reached on the future role, if any, which St. Catherine's Hospital might play in the hospital programme. In the meantime, the hospital will continue to be used for the accommodation of patients from the Meath Hospital.</P>

      <P>Apart from the investigation, at present in progress, into the financial position of CIE of which I gave particulars in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 5th May, 1971, there were two previous governmental inquiries into internal transport in Ireland which covered the affairs of CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of these inquiries was carried out in 1948 by a team headed by Sir James Milne.  The cost of preparing the report was estimated at £2,771, exclusive of the cost of printing and publication.  Following this inquiry the Government decided that the undertakings of Córas Iompair Éireann and the Grand Canal Company should be <Col N="1469" /> amalgamated and brought under public ownership.  Effect was given to this decision in the Transport Act, 1950.</P>
    <P>The second inquiry was carried out in 1956-57 by a committee of inquiry of which Dr. J.P. Beddy was chairman. The cost of preparing the report was estimated at £5,250, including £1,031 in respect of printing and publication. Following this inquiry, the Transport Act, 1958 was enacted.  This Act gave effect, with certain modifications, to the recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>An internal review of its activities was also carried out by CIE in 1963 the production of which was not separately costed.  The Transport Act, 1964 was drafted in the light of the information available from this report and other sources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen the statements and am aware of the concern of students in regard to certain travel organisations. Student travel organisations who operate student air charters require my approval.  Before such approval is forthcoming the organisation is required to be adequately sponsored by educational establishments and by student associations.  Two organisations, who successfully organised student travel over the past few years, <Col N="1470" /> have so far produced adequate sponsorship viz. the Union of Students of Ireland Travel (USIT) and Irish Student Educational and Travel Association (ISETA).  The former was approved some months ago, the latter has now been approved after it had produced evidence of the necessary sponsorship.  An application from a third organisation named Irish Student Exchange Club (ISEC) which only recently appeared on the Irish scene has been investigated and I am not prepared to approve the operation of student charter flights by this organisation.</P>
    <P>The question of visas which would enable Irish students to visit the United States for summer travel and employment opportunities is one for settlement as between the students travel organisations and the officially designated sponsors for exchange visitor programmes and the US authorities. I understand that while USIT has made arrangements with the designated organisation in the USA to sponsor its students for visa purposes, the ISETA is still negotiating for sponsorship at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that 1,400 students who had booked flights to the States with ISETA and had paid their money now find, 20 days from the departure date of the first flight, that this organisation has no operating permission, the students have no visas, and the position has given rise to very serious concern? Is the Minister also aware that if the regulations which he introduced on January 1st last had been sufficiently comprehensive this type of situation could have been prevented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very complex field.  First of all, I want to emphasise that the main trouble has been caused by this third organisation, ISEC, and having fully examined their case I refused them sponsorship at this end, so they now drop out of the field. In regard to the two organisations that were there, USIT and ISETA, the problem of the organisation referred to by the Deputy is not a problem at this end, because they got their sponsorship at this end; the problem is with the <Col N="1471" /> United States authorities with regard to getting visas.  This is a matter outside my control altogether.  What I want to emphasise is that so far the one body that got full support from the Irish end and from the American end are USIT; there is a second body now looking for visa facilities in the United States of America and there is a third body which now drops out altogether by reason of our refusal to sponsor it in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the principal thing here is to have one student organisation.  I had enough of student politics for some time some years ago and I am well aware, as the Deputy is, of the sort of internal in-fighting that goes on, but at least it is now rationalised to two organisations and on the face of it it looks as if the one organisation, the USIT, would appear to be in the best position at present to cope with the problem.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to a statement by the midland group of dental practitioners concerning his Department's dental benefits scheme and the scale of fees paid to participating dentists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen several statements made by or on behalf of a group of dental practitioners in the midland area.  Twenty-three of these dentists who I understand are members of the Irish Dental Association terminated, with effect from 1st December, 1970, their agreements to provide dental services under the Department's scheme.  It was stated at the time that their action in withdrawing from the scheme was because of their dissatisfaction with the fees being paid under the scheme although agreement on the question of these fees had then been reached with the Irish Dental Association and the new rates had been <Col N="1476" /> brought into operation with effect from 17th August, 1970.  At that stage the only matter still being discussed was the question of payments in respect of certain specialised and expensive treatments the cost of which the Department had agreed should be met on a grant-in-aid basis.</P>
      <P>While I recognise the right of any dentist to withdraw from the scheme at any time and for any reason, it would be improper of me to enter into separate negotiations in the matter of fees with any body or group other than the Irish Dental Association who have always been recognised as the negotiating body on behalf of dental practitioners.  For this reason I have refused to treat with this group of dentists.</P>
      <P>Thirteen of the dentists who resigned in December last applied for re-admission to the dental panel last month and new forms of agreement were sent to them for completion.</P>
      <P>I may add that, apart from the specialised items of treatment which I have mentioned and on which negotiations are still proceeding with the Irish Dental Association, fees now being paid under the scheme on the scale agreed are in general higher than those being paid for corresponding treatments to dental practitioners in Great Britain.  The Irish Dental Association has now intimated that submissions on a demand for a new scale of fees are being made and a preliminary meeting in this matter arranged last month with officials of my Department, will take place next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistical records are not kept which would enable information to be given in the form sought by the Deputy.  Where a worker loses social welfare benefit as a result of the failure of his employer to stamp his insurance cards he is informed of his right to recover the lost benefit from the employer.  He is also informed that my Department, if requested by him to do so, will on his behalf take action against the employer to recover the benefit lost.  In some cases the matter is settled directly between the employee and his employer while in others my Department have taken action on behalf of the employee. In the case of disability benefit claims I can say that from 1965 to date my Department were successful in recovering benefit lost by employees in 120 cases.</P>
      <P>I might remind the Deputy that I indicated in reply to previous questions that I proposed to make statutory provision to deal with the sort of case referred to by him in his question.  On the 8th March, 1971, I amended the contributions regulations governing the payment and crediting of social insurance contributions so as to enable contributions to be credited where an employer fails or neglects to pay contributions due and the insured person is himself blameless in the matter thus avoiding loss of benefit to the employee.  These regulations while not covering every situation in which loss of benefit could occur in the circumstances mentioned, will have the effect of greatly reducing the number of such cases.  To meet those situations where paid contributions are necessary to enable an insured person to qualify for benefit I propose to amend the Social Welfare Acts and I hope to be in a position to include an appropriate provision in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.</P>

In regulations made by me on the 8th March I have taken authority, as far as existing legislation permits me to take it, to credit these people with contributions in respect of the period for which their contributions were not paid and in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill, as I have announced twice today already, I am bringing in legislation to permit me to cover the situation fully, with credited contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>The two companies referred to were incorporated on 8th July, 1968, and 1st October, 1969, respectively.  They were both under the same management and both closed down for financial reasons on 27th January, 1971. The older company was surveyed in January, 1969, and arrears of £556 were assessed.  Of this amount £50 was paid on demand but the balance was recovered only after legal action had been taken.  On further visits made in March and July, 1970, it was found that the company had continued to default but it closed down, leaving no assets, before further legal action could be taken.  The associated company was also surveyed in March and July, 1970. It was also in arrears and it also closed down before legal action could be taken, leaving no assets.  In accordance with the recent amendment of the Social Welfare (Contributions) Regulations my Department have allowed credited contributions to all employees in respect of each unpaid contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allowance of these special credited contributions enabled payment to be made on the claim of one person which had initially been disallowed. Thirteen other persons whose claims to unemployment benefit were disallowed could not benefit under the amending regulations which were made on 8th March, 1971, because the claims were in 12 cases for periods of unemployment before that date and in one case because the claimant did not satisfy the <Col N="1481" /> first contribution condition for the receipt of unemployment benefit.  This first contribution condition requires that at least 26 employment contributions be paid in respect of a claimant. It will be appreciated that the fact that more of the former employees of the firms did not benefit under the new regulations arises because the persons' unemployment occurred just before the regulations were made and such a situation should not recur.  Furthermore, I intend to introduce legislation at an early date to provide for treating insurance contributions due but not paid as having been paid in cases where the worker himself has not been at fault.</P>
    <P>29.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will arrange that regular checks be made, at least quarterly, to ensure that social welfare cards are properly stamped, and so avoid the hardships involved for large numbers of workers who lose benefits due to them because of the failure on the part of employers to pay contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of employers fulfil their obligations under the Social Welfare Acts in a praiseworthy manner; those who delay or default are a small minority.  The system of inspection in force in my Department is designed so as to devote most of the available official time to annual surveys of those employers who for various reasons are likely to default in their obligations.  The system on the whole works satisfactorily and I do not consider that more frequent inspection is justified.  The incidence of cases in which hardship is caused to insured persons because of failures on the part of employers will, I am confident, be reduced considerably as a result of amending regulations which I introduced recently and which provide for the crediting of contributions in such circumstances.  To meet those situations where paid contributions are necessary to enable an insured person to qualify for benefit I propose to amend the Social Welfare Acts and I hope to be in a position to include an appropriate provision in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>On the basis of present information it is not expected that the floating of the Deutschemark and the Dutch guilder will have any significant effect on this country.  The same applies as regards the revaluation of the Swiss franc and the Austrian schilling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Imports from the four countries in <Col N="1483" /> question may cost more but import prices will not necessarily reflect in full appreciation in the value of their currencies. So far, the appreciation in the value of the Deutschemark, the currency with which we are mainly concerned, has been quite small and not such as would be likely to affect our import trade to an appreciable extent.</P>
    <P>To the extent that the currencies of the four countries have or will appreciate in value, there should be a higher return from our existing exports and opportunities of expanding them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that since the rate is floating we cannot estimate accurately until it settles down at some figure.  It went to 5 per cent yesterday and it went down to 3 per cent later on in the day.  It is difficult to estimate it but our imports last year from Germany were £46.1 million.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has received representations from the Third Tipperary Brigade Old IRA Commemoration Committee regarding the granting of certain facilities to IRA veterans and their wives; and, if so, what steps he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received the representations referred to in the Deputy's question.  As regards the means test aspect I would refer the Deputy to the reply given by the Minister for Social Welfare to question No. 60 on 14th November, 1968.  In brief that Minister indicated that a means test was an integral part of the non-contributory old age pension code and could not be abolished in favour of any particular section of the community. Pensions and allowances in respect of Old IRA service are not, however, included in the assessment of means for the purposes of the old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the proposed provision of free travel for unaccompanied wives of veterans I was, as mentioned in my Budget speech, unable to extend the scheme to one group or another as the ultimate cost would be too <Col N="1491" /> great and I decided, therefore, that the resources available could best be utilised in providing the concessions in respect of military service pensioners announced in the Budget.</P>

      <P>In regard to the coast protection scheme at Moville certain legal requirements have yet to be complied with but, all going well, I am hopeful that works can start before the end of the current year.</P>
      <P>I cannot at this stage say when work is likely to start on improvements to the pier at Moville.  Local interests have asked for substantial alterations in the original scheme proposed and these are being examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 42 together. The design of a drainage scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, for the Suir catchment is in progress.  Until the scheme and estimate of cost have been prepared and considered and the requirements of the Act complied with I cannot indicate when actual drainage works are likely to be commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Clashawley River which drains the Laffansbridge area is in the Suir catchment and as such could only be <Col N="1492" /> dealt with by the Commissioners of Public Works as part of a comprehensive drainage scheme for that catchment as a whole.  The Clashawley has been surveyed but pending the preparation of the Suir Scheme and the evaluation of its economics I cannot say what channels may be included therein.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to the location and lay-out of the building which includes residential accommodation as well as the Garda Station proper it is difficult to devise a satisfactory scheme of improvements. A sketch plan has now been prepared, however, and is being submitted to the Department of Justice for consideration by the Garda authorities. If the plan is approved steps will be taken to have the works carried out as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not think it unfair to dismiss men with up to 14 years service, to my knowledge? Other Deputies know what the position is in their own districts.  Is it not very unfair that a forestry worker who has given good and faithful service over a period of years should be dismissed and get only a small redundancy payment, particularly having regard to the fact that a pension scheme is now being formulated for such workers? As a result of being dismissed or declared redundant they will not benefit from such a scheme.  This is completely unfair and unjust and it is something to which this House must address itself.  These workers are being thrown out of employment after years of service.  This is worse than the unemployment question we dealt with in the Dáil the other day.</P>

      <P>Members of the House learned, this morning, with deep regret of the death of Mr. Seán F. Lemass&mdash;solas na bhflathas dá anam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Born in County Dublin in 1899, his life from an early age was closely interwoven with that of our nation and <Col N="1500" /> formed a vital strand of the political and economic history of this country since the Easter Rising, in which he participated as a boy of sixteen.  Early in the year following, on the reorganisation of the Volunteers, he became a Lieutenant in C. Company of the Dublin Brigade and from then onwards he played a prominent part throughout the War of Independence, displaying&mdash;in the face of imprisonment and other privations&mdash;the determination and resilience which always characterised him.</P>
    <P>He was elected to Dáil Éireann for the first time in November, 1924, and, from then on, was successful at each succeeding general election up to his retirement in 1969.  Between 1932 and 1966 he was Minister for Industry and Commerce for over 19 years and Minister for Supplies for six years.  He became Tánaiste in June, 1945.  He was appointed Taoiseach in June, 1959, and retained that office until he relinquished it in November, 1966.  As a former Taoiseach he was, up to the date of his death, a member of the Council of State.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lemass received high honours from the Holy See, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Principality of Monaco, and both our universities, Iona College, New York and the University of Villanova in Philadelphia conferred honorary degrees upon him.</P>
    <P>Although Seán Lemass has passed to his reward, the manifold results of his endeavours for the nation will constitute an enduring monument to his name.  He and his comrades could not have realised that the generosity of their youthful response to the call to serve Ireland would determine the direction of their life's work.  He himself later coined the phrase &ldquo;politicians by accident&rdquo; to describe himself and his colleagues in the Government, and it is a particularly apt description of a man who was called to onerous responsibilities by fortuitous circumstances yet gave the best that was in him in steadfast pursuit of the same objectives that had first attracted him into public life.  Long before he assumed public office, he realised that <Col N="1501" /> the inherited problems of economic decay and social distress would not solve themselves and that all that freedom really conferred was the opportunity of striving towards the nation's political, economic and social welfare.  Patrick Pearse said that &ldquo;every generation has its task&rdquo;, and Seán Lemass's task was to consolidate the economic foundations which support our political institutions, recognising that unless this were accomplished, the nation's future would always be in danger.</P>
    <P>Among the many successful achievements especially associated with his name were the provision of greater social security and improved working conditions&mdash;in recognition of which he was elected President of the International Labour Conference in 1937&mdash; the immeasurable strengthening of Ireland's industrial arm, the reorganisation and rationalisation of transport services, the establishment of an Irish mercantile marine and an Irish dockyard, the foundation of the Irish aviation services, the vast expansion in the use of electric power, the development of the nation's peat resources, the expansion of the tourist industry, the maintenance of essential supplies of food, fuel and raw materials during the Emergency years from 1939 onwards and&mdash;especially during his period as Taoiseach&mdash;the development of co-operation with Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Even in retirement from active public life, Mr. Lemass continued to give unstintingly of his counsel, especially in the sphere of economic and social development in which he had such an abiding interest.</P>
    <P>I would ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to convey to his widow, to his son, Deputy Noel Lemass, and to the other members of his family the very sincere sympathy of the Members of this House.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my <Col N="1502" /> colleagues, and on my own behalf, I should like to express deep sympathy with Mrs. Lemass, Deputy Noel Lemass, TD, Parliamentary Secretary, and with the daughters of the late Mr. Seán Lemass.</P>
      <P>Although we were on different sides politically I enjoyed the most close and cordial relations with Mr. Lemass and during the years I had a great deal of contact with him in Government as well as in Opposition.  From an early stage I learned to respect his practical approach to political affairs.</P>
      <P>In a very active political career he recognised earlier than any of his party colleagues the status and importance of Dáil Éireann.  This realism made him appreciate and further the cross-Border contacts on questions of mutual concern which had been initiated by a previous inter-Party Government.  The same capacity enabled him to recognise the time for change and alteration when he advocated the establishment of a committee to consider amendments to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>He was a most vigorous and able debater, skilled in the rules and practices of the Dáil.  It could be said that he relished political conflict.  One of his very attractive qualities was his lack of any kind of pretentiousness.  Although he was a man of considerable ability, perhaps it was his misfortune that he came to office as Taoiseach late in his political career and thereby was prevented from realising his full potential as Head of Government.</P>
      <P>Those of us who knew him here appreciated his devotion to the practices and procedures of the Dáil and the interest and attention he gave to discussions on legislation or Estimates. We recognised the immense contribution he made to the economic and social improvement and we all feel a sense of loss at his passing.  <i>Requiescat in pace.</i></P>

    <P>On behalf of my party, and on my own behalf, I should like to extend our <Col N="1503" /> deepest sympathy to Mrs. Lemass, to her family, and in particular to her son, Deputy Noel Lemass, a Member of this House.</P>
    <P>Although we may have been opposed politically, I think all of us recognised and respected the undoubted qualities of Seán Lemass not only as a politician but as a man.  The man we saw and liked very much was the man outside the arena of politics; he had a sense of humour, he was genial and, above all, in politics he was tolerant towards his opponents.</P>
    <P>He was an historic figure and must claim a major place in the history of this country.  For the greater portion of his life he devoted himself to his country and to his party apart from his participation in the national struggle when he was so very young.  He served his country in various capacities.  He served his country as a Deputy here in this House.  As a Deputy he was vigilant, he was in constant attendance and took his duties as a member of the Opposition seriously in that vigilance and in that constant attendance in this House.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Industry and Commerce I suppose he will be better known than anything else because one cannot take from him the tremendous efforts he made in order to establish Irish industry here, particularly in the 1930s, and for years on after that.  We, particularly, in the Labour Party, applaud the efforts, many of them successful, his initiative, in the establishment of many of the State bodies which now flourish.  It is true as well, and I think I said this when the late Seán Lemass was in this House, when he was appointed Taoiseach, that it was a pity he had not this appointment ten or 15 years before because I have no hesitation in saying, even though we were opposed and opposed bitterly on various questions, if he had been Taoiseach at an earlier age it might have been a somewhat different Ireland, it might have been a somewhat different Parliament.  We also remember and pay tribute to him for the first gesture that was made in his endeavour to start to bring about normal relations between <Col N="1504" /> the people in the north and the people in the south of this country.</P>
    <P>Some of us here were his Parliamentary colleagues for quite a long time. We were his colleagues for very many years and for him we can say that he demonstrated without bitterness and personal abuse.  He liked the cut and thrust of politics but I do not think anybody could ever accuse him of either being bitter or engaging in personal abuse.  For him we can say he demonstrated his ability in debate and in his practical approach to questions, problems, social and economic.  We who knew him can say, although we differed from him and strongly at times, he commanded our respect for his qualities as a Deputy, as a Minister and as Taoiseach.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to remove certain restraints on the operations of the Industrial Credit Company which experience over the years has shown to be no longer necessary.  The opportunity is also being availed of to <Col N="1505" /> increase the limits on the company's authorised share capital and borrowing powers and to introduce certain minor amendments to the existing legislation to give the company more flexibility in relation to the appointment of a managing director and general manager and to facilitate them in relation to the submission of their annual accounts to the Minister for Finance.  A provision in relation to the position of directors and staff of the company who may become members of either House of the Oireachtas is also included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation&mdash;the Industrial Credit Act, 1933&mdash;the ICC may issue loans to companies operating in this country, whether or not they are registered here, but they may not take up shares in foreign-registered companies even to finance their Irish operations. The restriction in relation to share investment in foreign-registered companies was originally based on the principle that while loans can be secured by a charge on the assets within the State share capital cannot, and that, accordingly, there was no way of ensuring that finance injected into a company in the form of share capital would be used for a particular purpose. This differentiation is not considered to be justified in modern conditions and it sets an unnecessary limitation on the scope of the ICC's facilities.  Section 3 of the Bill has the effect of removing this limitation and gives the ICC powers to invest in the share capital of any company which operates a business in this country, whether or not it is registered within the State.  The company will take precautions to ensure that any such share investment is used for the benefit of projects within the State.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill also provides that the ICC may issue unsecured loans.  Under present legislation the ICC may not lend money without security and this restriction is considered by the company to be anomalous. At times there are practical difficulties in obtaining adequate security for a loan and potentially desirable clients may be deterred from approaching the ICC for facilities because of their inability or unwillingness to give security for a loan.  Besides, <Col N="1506" /> there may be occasions where the ICC might consider it desirable to give both a secured loan and an unsecured loan for a particular project. Competitor organisations are free to issue loans without security and the ICC feel that the existing legislation places them at a disadvantage.  In the event of the winding up of a business concern loan capital even though unsecured would rank before share capital in the distribution of the assets. I might add that over 80 per cent of the ICC's investment in industry is in the form of loans including hire-purchase and leasing.</P>
    <P>With the advent of freer trade it is already apparent that the need for Irish businesses to have external associations for the marketing of their goods abroad is becoming increasingly important.  While the ICC may at present assist Irish-based companies in the acquisition, establishment or development of overseas subsidiary or associated companies, they can do so only by lending to or investing in the Irish parent company.  They may not assist the overseas subsidiary or associated company direct.  This is considered to be a shortcoming which should be removed so that, if a particular situation requires, the ICC may provide finance directly to a subsidiary or associated company rather than to the parent company.  Section 3 of the Bill gives the extra power to the company in this regard subject to the overriding safeguard that such investment is likely to be of benefit to a trade or industry within the State.  Before a company can qualify for subsidiary or associated status for the purpose of this section, more than one-fifth&mdash;in nominal value&mdash;of their voting shares must be held by the parent company.</P>
    <P>In removing these various restrictions it has been considered preferable to restate in full the principal objects of the company rather than merely to amend the existing provisions of the 1933 Act.  Section 3 has been drafted with this in mind.</P>
    <P>The present authorised share capital of the ICC is £10 million while the limit on the company's borrowing powers is £15 million.  The issued share <Col N="1507" /> capital is now approximately £8.8 million, virtually all of which is held by the Minister for Finance, while total borrowing by the company is approximately £12 million.  The company's activities have expanded rapidly during the past few years; for instance, the provision made in the Public Capital Programme for 1971-72 for assistance to industry by the ICC is £9.3 million &mdash;including £1.8 million for loans by its subsidiary, Shipping Finance Corporation&mdash;compared with an outturn of £6.3 million&mdash;including £2.0 million for Shipping Finance Corporation&mdash;in 1970-71.  It is expected that the present expansionary trend will continue and, accordingly, it is desirable to ensure that the statutory limits of share investment and borrowings will be adequate to meet the company's needs during the next four or five years.  It is proposed, therefore, to raise the share capital limit to £12 million&mdash;section 2&mdash;and the borrowing limit to £30 million&mdash; section 5.  It is hoped that an increasing share of the company's new capital requirements will be forthcoming from non-Exchequer sources including receipts from its recently introduced deposits scheme.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation the ICC must have a managing director.  The board of the ICC wish to have this compulsory provision modified so as to give them the discretionary power to appoint a managing director if they see fit, and also to appoint a general manager.  The existing statutory arrangements are considered to be too inflexible as they require that the chief executive must always be chosen from among the small number of board members.  In fact since May, 1969, when the latest serving managing director retired, the post of chief executive has been filled by a general manager in anticipation of amending legislation.  Section 4 of the Bill covers the proposed change in the arrangements.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned earlier that provision is being made in section 5 for raising the statutory limit on borrowing by the company to £30 million.  The same section also provides that the company may borrow in currencies <Col N="1508" /> other than Irish currency.  The existing statutory provisions relating to borrowing by the company have been interpreted as empowering the company to borrow in Irish currency only. Suitable opportunities for foreign borrowing may arise from time to time and in fact arrangements for a loan from the World Bank have been substantially completed.  It is considered that there should be no restriction on foreign borrowing where it is in the national interest.  Since the 1933 legislation no borrowing could be undertaken by the company except with the consent of the Minister for Finance and it is not the intention to alter this arrangement.  For the sake of simplicity, section 5 sets out in full the new proposed borrowing powers which will replace the earlier provisions.</P>
    <P>At present the ICC are required to submit their annual accounts, duly audited, to the Minister for Finance within 90 days after the end of each accounting year.  As the volume of their business grows the company are finding it increasingly difficult to meet this deadline and have asked for some relief.  Provision is being made in section 6 that in any year, on application by the company, the Minister for Finance may extend the 90 day period to whatever extent he considers reasonable.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation empowers the Minister for Finance to guarantee the company's borrowings.  As a consequence of the extended borrowing powers being provided for in section 5 it is necessary to extend similarly the Minister's existing powers to give guarantees. This is the purpose of section 7. For instance, the World Bank loan to which I have already referred will need to be guaranteed under this section.</P>
    <P>I should mention here that at the Committee Stage of the Bill I propose to introduce an amendment to section 7 to provide that in addition to guaranteeing principal and interest of a loan, the Minister may guarantee any incidental expenses payable by the ICC in relation to such a loan.  The World Bank has specified that a condition of the loan at present being negotiated shall be that, in addition to guaranteeing <Col N="1509" /> the principal and interest, the Minister for Finance must also guarantee the commitment fee payable in respect of the loan and also any premiums for which the ICC may be liable in the event of their repaying all or part of the loan prior to the scheduled dates for repayment.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes certain provisions&mdash;section 8&mdash;as regards membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas by directors, officers and servants of the company.  These provisions which for some time past have been included in legislation relating to State-sponsored bodies are not in the ICC legislation and it is considered that the opportunity afforded by the present Bill should be taken to extend them to the ICC.  Since the Bill was drafted, however, I have come to the conclusion that subsection (2) (c) should only apply where the staff member would qualify for an Oireachtas pension.  I consider that the simplest way of rectifying the matter is to delete the subsection entirely at the Committee Stage and to provide for the matter in a general Bill dealing with the directors and staff of State-sponsored bodies who become Members of either House of the Oireachtas which is at present being prepared.</P>
    <P>The intention of the general Bill will be to introduce uniform arrangements for all State-sponsored bodies including those which already have their own provisions governing this matter in their individual legislation.  So far as superannuation provisions are concerned the intention will be to ensure that the period of Oireachtas service of a staff member may not be reckoned both for an Oireachtas pension and for a staff pension.  If, however, he does not qualify for an Oireachtas pension, he will, on payment of the appropriate pension contributions, have the period of his Oireachtas service, during which he was seconded from his employment, reckoned for pension purposes under his occupational scheme.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Credit Company have been in operation since 1933 when they were established to provide financial facilities for industry.  The company are operated on commercial lines with due <Col N="1510" /> regard to their role as an instrument of national development.  Their facilities have been availed of over the entire range of industry and in all parts of the country by large, medium and small undertakings.  They provide a full range of industrial financing facilities to promote both the establishment of new industries and the development of existing ones.  Since their incorporation they have provided capital for Irish industry by way of loans, share investment, machinery finance and guarantees to the extent of more than £52 million and in addition they have underwritten capital flotations in excess of £21 million.  Their recent entry into the field of finance for the distributive sector, the establishment of a separate company&mdash;Mergers Ltd&mdash;to initiate and facilitate mergers and the introduction of a scheme for the provision of finance for under-capitalised concerns are all indicative of the company's flexibility in servicing the varying requirements of the business community. The new mergers subsidiary specialises in the field of mergers and takeovers, undertaking share evaluations, advising on terms and assisting in negotiations for merger.</P>
    <P>The capital requirements of both existing and new industries have changed materially in recent times both as to their nature and extent, and the current activities of the ICC must, therefore, be seen against a much more sophisticated and developed situation than that which prevailed up to a few years ago when demands for capital were relatively small and the sources from which these demands might be met were very few.  It is essential that the company should be in a position to provide capital on very flexible terms towards the further development of Irish industry.  For this reason it is considered that in the present industrial environment the existing restrictions on share capital investment and unsecured loans should be removed.  It is equally important that adequate funds be available for the company's expanding activities.  I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to bring up to date the legislation governing the <Col N="1511" /> Industrial Credit Company and, as such, it must be recommended.  Because of the many changes that have occurred in a short time in relation to finance and business&mdash;with the world becomeing smaller and with the association of companies here with companies overseas&mdash;it is only natural, as the Minister has said, that legislation that was enacted so many years ago would now be out of date.  Therefore, it is time that the legislation be brought up-to-date.</P>
      <P>I think that the Bill can also be commended because of the fact that opportunity has been taken to make certain fundamental changes that had nothing to do with the times but which were necessary in any case.  I refer first of all to the question of the managing director or the general manager.  It could be true that the board might desire to take in a general manager who would be charged with the administration of the company while the board would oversee his direction, his executive work and in that way divorce themselves, perhaps, from the day-to-day decisions which he might make and might be more fitted to make if he had more time available and perhaps was not related in his thinking and discussions all the time and entirely to the board itself.  The tradition of this board of ICC is that eminent citizens in the business world, and from the trade union world also, have been placed on it and charged with developing the business of lending money for Irish industry but at the same time the idea certainly recommends itself to me that a general manager who might not be on the board might in the first years of his operation be in the best situation and that after some time it might become obvious that the best thing might be to put him on the board changing his functions and his status also to make him managing director.  In large businesses all over the world the principle of the general manager who is not on the board and who might have the highest salary within the company is one that has found favour and from that point of view it is a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of share capital or taking share capital in companies outside the country or taking <Col N="1512" /> share capital in companies inside the country&mdash;which can be done already: we saw some evidence of it last week&mdash; this again is a good thing because it is clear that if an exporting company here had a marketing company in Britain or anywhere else, or had a company which was selling manufactured goods, then it might well behove the Industrial Credit Company to agree to invest in a company registered outside the country which had been set up specifically and with Irish control for the purpose of further processing semi-manufactured Irish goods or doing anything else you like with goods that originated here and had provided employment in Ireland.  That is something that can obviously happen as the world grows smaller.</P>
    <P>The next point mentioned by the Minister is also something which, when you consider it, is clearly necessary, the matter of unsecured loans.  Most companies here, particularly if they have existed for a long time and are home-orientated and not enjoying the benefits of freedom from income tax for new exports, have given debentures to banks and have perhaps given second and third debentures or have entered into <i>pari passu</i> debentures with banks and lending organisations and having done so find themselves not legally empowered to give security for a further loan.</P>
    <P>One of the instances of this that I can think of&mdash;I am sure my legal colleague Deputy O'Higgins would be much better able to explain it than I am&mdash;would be a case where a bank, say, and an outside lending association had entered into a <i>pari passu</i> debenture with the company giving them in broad terms equal rights in the event of the company going into liquidation or in the event of either one desiring to get its money back.  If these two lending organisations, an ordinary commercial bank, for instance, and a merchant bank or somebody else refused to allow the ICC to enter into a further <i>pari passu</i> debenture or to wipe out the <i>pari passu</i> debenture already given and create a new one embracing the three of them on equal terms then, in fact, it would not be possible, in my view, for that company to give security <Col N="1513" /> for a loan to the Industrial Credit Company. That is the legal position as I see it.  I may not be absolutely correct but I believe this trouble does arise.  If this is so and if it is clear that the amount of money already borrowed from the other companies or lending agencies was such as not to render the risk too great, surely the position would be that the ICC would be correct in lending an unsecured loan particularly if such loan were to be repaid over a short period and if it was a condition of the loan that at the end of each financial year the balance sheet, profit and loss account and trading account of the company concerned would be presented for the scrutiny of ICC?  For the first reason I gave, that other bodies that had lent money refused to enter into a further <i>pari passu</i> debenture, it would appear that the Industrial Credit Company to date would be precluded from giving the loan.  Secondly, another reason might be that the amount of money required from the ICC might relatively be so small as not to merit completely upsetting one <i>pari passu</i> debenture ranging over one, two or three lending agencies and proceeding to enter into another, which if the repayment period were short would mean you would have a situation in four or five years time in which further legal complications would arise and matters would require to be dealt with which need not arise at all.</P>
    <P>I take the Minister's point that loan capital ranks before share capital so that in the event of a secured loan of any sort, <i>pari passu</i> debenture or ordinary debenture or just a plain mortgage, the loan made by the ICC which, under this particular section would rank second to the previous loans, would at the same time rank before the share capital of the shareholders in the company.  This appears to me to be a safe situation and if proper examination is made of the accounts and properties of the company and the books, if necessary, to see whether there was a high proportion of bad or slow debts indicating that there was little or no risk involved, it is my considered opinion that this is a good step forward and <Col N="1514" /> power should certainly be given to the ICC to make these loans, power which it did not have up to date.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the question of investment in a company overseas. There is also the question of lending money to a company overseas.  It works two ways.  If a company overseas is coming here to spend a considerable amount of money and if they are investing a good deal of their own money and we are sure of this&mdash; on occasion we have not been too sure that they were&mdash;and if a loan is required by them for the erection of their factory or the establishment of their business or whatever it is, then surely that should be given provided the stake they are putting in is such as to give us the insurance that they will not do the traditional thing of lopping off the arm at a later stage.  In the international world of trade if things do not go right it is the Irish subsidiary which is lopped off and the parent company in Frankfurt or London goes gaily on its way without let or hindrance.  The judgment should be whether or not the arm that will be here will be in greater part fed with the blood of the parent company as well as the finance of the Industrial Credit Company so that the lopping off of the arm&mdash;and I only mentioned this in passing because it relates to the decisions of the board of the Industrial Credit Company&mdash;would be a painful procedure for the parent company.</P>
    <P>We in this House find that all State companies come back to us for permission to borrow or lend more money or to issue further share capital.  This is normal and natural and the figures given by the Minister indicate we are reaching the upper limits.  If the legislation which the Minister has put before the House today is necessary then the right thing to do is to increase the permitted lending powers.  It will be the duty of the Minister for Finance and his officials to watch the progress of the company and if it is felt there was an excess of enthusiasm in regard to lending or anything like that then this House is here to see to it that wisdom as well as the enthusiasm. which should and must prevail as we approach the Common Market and the world of freer trade, prevails.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1515" /> In relation to borrowing from outside the country why should a Government agency not do it as the Government themselves are doing it?  It must be remembered that dividends earned by people who invest from outside the country will, in respect of tax, pay that tax to a foreign power.  This is something we do not like and as far as possible we should aim at a situation where lesser amounts are borrowed from outside the State and greater amounts are borrowed from within the State.</P>
    <P>The restriction that the company must produce certified accounts within 90 days places a very heavy responsibility and worry on the shoulders of their auditors and accountants.  I do not think there is any way of doing this except by the bringing in of a large number of accruals which would be decided for the following year's accounts.  That is not a criticism of the auditors or accountants but there are many things in relation to a business deal which cannot be settled within 90 days.  Any firm of auditors or accountants who have the duty of putting their signature to a set of accounts have this problem.  The normal way of dealing with it is to take in an accrual which is corrected in the succeeding year's accounts but auditors and accountants hate this practice, they regard it as a bad one and they try to do the minimum of it. Sometimes things are beyond their control: ships are at sea and like the gentleman in the &ldquo;Merchant of Venice&rdquo; there is nothing they can do except estimate what the outcome will be and produce an accrual of a fixed figure which is corrected in the succeeding year's accounts.  It would be far better when a case was made to the Minister that they could not make the grade in time if the 90-day period were extended because in that case the accounts would be more accurate.  I am not suggesting that they have not been accurate in the past but if people are asked to do the impossible they sometimes have to compromise.</P>
    <P>A guarantee by the Minister is absolutely necessary because when we face free trade we shall have to take risks.  I <Col N="1516" /> am not going to name names but I know of a company who took a risk in the last fortnight or three weeks by the injection of share capital by the Industrial Credit Company for a considerable sum of money so that it would carry on and become viable not this year or next year but the year after.  This was a calculated risk. Another calculated risk taken by the Industrial Credit Company without the available legislation and which, having been taken was the subject of a note in the annual report for some years afterwards, and was the cause of the Government passing the Taisci Stáit Act whereby they could give above £250,000, was the £1,800,000 lent to various companies by the Industrial Credit Company some years ago on the break-up of Dundalk Engineering and the Dundalk Railway Works.  Various loans were made and an instruction was given by either the then Minister for Finance, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce or the then Taoiseach, I know not which, certainly a Cabinet instruction was given, to give the money and each year in the accounts produced by the Industrial Credit Company a statement appeared that the board wanted to draw attention to the fact that this was not a commercial risk.  At a later stage the matter was dealt with by further legislation and the set-up was created whereby the Cabinet itself could make the decision.</P>
    <P>In the next few years there will be times when it will be absolutely necessary for the Industrial Credit Company to give loans to companies on the basis of a calculated risk which will in my view go beyond what ordinary financial houses in the city would regard as a commercial risk.  That is not to say that if freer trade arrives it will be possible for any State agency to buttress up companies with any volume of money available to it which are not going to succeed.  This is a financial and physical impossibility. Nothing will decide that but the terms of trade, productive capacity and competition largely from abroad.  In years to come the Industrial Credit Company will have to go beyond the stage of lending money, as it did in the two <Col N="1517" /> cases I have mentioned, on the basis of ordinary commercial risks.  If we lend money to ten companies which are beyond commercial risk, but in our view not beyond salvation, and nine come home but the tenth does not, this has to be accepted in the pattern of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, the EEC and the movement towards freer trade generally.  There is a responsibility on the legislators and on the people to some extent, not to an unnatural, abnormal or unfair extent, to attempt to defend the jobs that are on the verge of being lost on the basis of whether or not the lending of further funds for rationalisation would or would not be a commercial risk.</P>
    <P>That is about all I want to say on the Bill except, perhaps, to repeat that it is legislation which will have to be examined in great detail in Committee. I do not think it is a political measure or anything that should put us into a controversial mood.  It is a serious Bill which will have to be examined in the light of the serious things it contains, and during its passage through both Houses we will have to improve it with whatever expertise we possess on either side.  There is the particular point of protecting jobs in industry.  Apart from trying to create new jobs, we must try to protect existing ones.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of agriculture, this involves what I might call the defensive point of view.  This Bill will help to defend jobs in industry but I should like to put a thought into the mind of the Minister for Finance in regard to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  Does he think that legislation enacted in that respect is so up to date that it will help agriculture as we hope this Bill will help industry?  I think there is a need to look again at this matter even if we have had legislation in recent years dealing with the ACC.  Does that body, who are very similar to the Industrial Credit Company, need the sort of amending legislation we have before us today?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume this Bill has been introduced in the main to deal <Col N="1518" /> with the increase in the authorised share capital from £10 million to £12 million and of the statutory limit on borrowing from £15 million to £30 million, thereby tying up many loose ends.  It seems extraordinary that although the authorised share capital is being increased by only £2 million, the statutory limit on borrowing is being doubled.  This throws out the question of the intentions of the Government. It would appear they do not intend to get too much involved.</P>
      <P>I suppose this is an appropriate time for the introduction of a Bill like this. I was interested in Deputy Donegan's final comments in regard to employment because I believe that the one thing that is necessary now is to try to ensure the survival of firms which run the risk of going to the wall, either because their markets have been taken from them or that they are not able to get new markets because of the necessity to retool.  The biggest crime against this country being committed at present by the Government is that they do not seem to be taking the necessary steps to ensure that companies which are finding difficulties are given all the assistance they require, and quickly.</P>
      <P>Moving through the country at the present time it is remarkable to find people who will say that the firm who are employing them are closing down. There are more than half a dozen reasons given for such closures, one of them being the Anglo Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and another being a change in public taste.  Was any effort made to try to help such companies to diversify, to change their system of operation, to have new forms of manufacture? If a firm is not large I am afraid little effort is being made in this direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I wish to make is that throughout the country districts and in small towns there are a large number of small industries which were built on a shoestring, being run on a shoestring, which have been giving employment to 20, 30 or 40 people each.  From time to time such small companies have been able to get a grip on certain markets and thus to ensure their continuance for <Col N="1519" /> many years to come.  However, such companies have found that when they looked for assistance they were asked if they had got the necessary know how, whether their premises were big enough and if they had done market surveys which would guarantee that what they were doing would be a success. The net result of such action is a loss of jobs.</P>
    <P>Can I make it any plainer?  The loss of 20 jobs in a town of 2,000 is far more disastrous than the loss of 100 jobs in a town of 20,000, because such small industries have been the life blood of small towns and villages.  I know of one particular company which years ago looked for £10,000.  After a lot of negotiation they were told that if they could put up £10,000 themselves it might be possible to arrange another £5,000.  If that company had been able to secure £10,000 they would not have asked for £10,000.  However, they struggled on and on and became successful. Some of the officials who had been instrumental in ensuring they would not get the £10,000 met them at an international fair and said: &ldquo;You are doing pretty well.  Can we help you?&rdquo; I think the House can guess the reply they got.</P>
    <P>I am not decrying the ICC.  All I am trying to say is that although this House is prepared as quickly as necessary to make available the money the Minister is asking for today, we believe that in return the ICC must ensure that those companies who need money can get it quickly.  I repeat that it is not always the big company which needs the money and which should get it. The small modest company also must be considered.  We should not have the philosophy that if a company wants only £5,000 it is hardly worthwhile investing £5,000 in such an undertaking. They all mean jobs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan said that many people will be depending on certain industries being kept going.  I do not agree with one of his points as to what will happen in Europe.  I do not think we will go into Europe.  I think it would be a bad day if we ever did.  I think it was bad when the free trade area <Col N="1520" /> agreement was signed.  Deputy Donegan did not think so at the time but he does now.  The trouble is that such agreements did not take into account the undue and unfair pressure they put on small industries in this country which are keeping people in employment.</P>
    <P>The question of the balance of payments comes in.  There is the question of the manufacture of goods here which otherwise would be imported.  All these must be taken into consideration.  There has been reference to the taking of shares in foreign companies.  This has been done in the case of An Bord Bainne.  I suggest that we should tread very warily here because when it comes to international markets £10 million or £12 million is a very small matter.  I could not agree more than I do with Deputy Donegan who referred to the foreign companies investing here.  We ought to be very careful about the companies to which we give large loans.  We have had more than one example of the parent company lopping off the arm and moving back home where they have enough &ldquo;arms&rdquo; to enable them to carry on, leaving us with nothing but a bleeding remnant which is of no use to the people who lose their employment as a result of this move.</P>
    <P>This Bill should get the full support of the House.  I agree that it is rather harsh to tie down the auditors to 90 days, particularly in view of the fact that it is not easy in this city to get an auditor to prepare books to a deadline. I was responsible for trying to meet a deadline with audits over a number of years and I am well aware of how difficult it is to get a firm of auditors to ensure that they will have everything prepared on a certain date.  I have seen some bad results from computers.  The day on which the computer takes over the audit will be a bad one for all who are responsible for preparing books for audit.  The 90-day limit may be a bit short, but some limit should be fixed. The Minister will remember an insurance company which got away with something clever a few years ago because of the fact that the then Minister was a little bit lenient with regard to the limit and this had disastrous effects <Col N="1521" /> on some people and annoying results for others, including myself, who were insured.  The limit should not be too rigid.  It should not be possible to apply to the Minister for an extension at any time.  That is what happens at the present time.  The Bill was necessary.  There may be something in it which has been missed in reading it quickly here.  This Bill should be recommended to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us in this House favour amending legislation to give additional assistance to industry at a time when industry is going through a very bad period and when many people are becoming unemployed because of the difficulties being experienced generally.  Any assistance which industry can get to help it over this period should be welcomed by every Deputy.  This is a period of rapid change.  These difficult times will pass if industry is helped to weather the storm.  This legislation is the only way by which we can assist our industries to weather this storm.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the existing statutory provisions relating to borrowing by the company.  There is reference to the fact that these provisions have been interpreted as empowering the company to borrow in Irish currency only.  Reference is made to the fact that the change which is proposed in this Bill empowers the company to borrow outside the country.  Reference is made to arrangements for borrowing from the World Bank.  I was not in the House when the Minister was making his statement so I do not know whether the Minister told the House of the specific purpose for which this borrowing is being done.  So far as I know, it is necessary to specify what the borrowing is for if money is to be borrowed from the World Bank.  That does not appear in this statement of the Minister.  There is a reference which I would like to comment on.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>As a consequence of the extended borrowing powers being provided for in section 5 it is necessary to extend similarly the Minister's existing powers to give guarantees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In what way is it extending the Minister's <Col N="1522" /> powers to give guarantees and to what extent can a Government guarantee be safeguarded by a counter-guarantee from outside?  I understand that it is fairly normal when the Government guarantee a loan that a counter-guarantee is given and that to a considerable extent this safeguards the position of the Government in case a company goes under for one reason or another.  I think it is to the extent that the shareholder loses all his money before the State lose any money as a result of guaranteeing the loan.  Perhaps the Minister would refer to this point when replying.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the powers of the company have been extended to increase the borrowing powers and to enable greater assistance to be given to companies which are in difficulties at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputies who have spoken for the welcome they have given the Bill.  It is quite clear that the provisions which I have outlined are designed to improve the operation of the Industrial Credit Company in the light of modern conditions and of the competition with which they are faced in their business but, in particular, it is clear that the objective on all sides of the House is to ensure, in so far as we can, that the assistance available to Irish industry is as efficient as we can make it.  The provisions in this Bill are designed to help the Industrial Credit Company to provide that kind of service for Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few points on which I wish to comment.  Deputy Donegan commented on the proposal about the chief executive, and was in agreement with it.  It is intended to give greater flexibility so that the chief executive of the ICC may be either a managing director or a general manager.  I have indicated that as things stand at the moment the chief executive has to be the managing director and has to be chosen from among the board.  This is a very restrictive situation.  That is not to say that the chief executive might not at some time in the future be managing director.  It is giving a wider discretion in the choice of chief executive.  In so far as the loan from <Col N="1523" /> the World Bank is concerned what is involved is a loan for the general purposes of the Industrial Credit Company, that is for the development of Irish industry but through the agency of the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that sufficiently specific for the World Bank?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am just giving it in very rough terms.  The loan has been negotiated in considerable detail and all the activities of the Industrial Credit Company have been examined including their terms of reference under the legislation.  As I have indicated, there is one small provision which we want to put into this Bill which is meeting one of the requirements of the World Bank.  The specific loan is directed to the Industrial Credit Company for the purposes of its operations.  In so far as we have to borrow abroad&mdash;I do not want to start wandering around on that because I dealt with it recently&mdash;it is generally agreed that to the extent that we can borrow from the World Bank we should do so because the terms available are more attractive to us than those available from other normal sources of borrowing abroad.</P>
      <P>I should like to confirm something I said when introducing the Second Stage.  Not only large companies and not only medium companies benefit from the activities of the Industrial Credit Company.  Quite small companies also benefit.  The reports of the Industrial Credit Company make this clear but I have personal knowledge of quite a number of small companies which have availed themselves of the assistance of the Industrial Credit Company. This assistance, in many cases, particularly in the case of smaller companies, can be much more than money. The Industrial Credit Company have available to them a great deal of expertise in financial management and make available to applicants the benefit of this expertise.  I know myself of some smaller companies which were able to make considerable use of not only the money but the expertise made available to them by the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" /> With regard to the provision about the period within which the audited accounts must be submitted Deputy Tully suggested that there should be a fixed limit.  This is a suggestion I considered because it is attractive on the face of it.  Nevertheless, I came to the conclusion that what we have provided here is probably better in the sense that we are trying to stick to the 90 days in so far as this can be done and to provide that where the company cannot comply with it, it will be obliged in each and every year in which it cannot comply with it, to come to the Minister for Finance and make application and then if it does so the Minister will satisfy himself as to the reasons for the delay before he fixes the period within which the accounts must be submitted.  In this way it is probably likely that we achieve two things&mdash;reasonable pressure on the company to furnish its accounts as quickly as possible and, secondly, provide a degree of flexibility which will cover different kinds of situations which could arise.  I hope that on reflection the Deputy will agree with me that this is probably the best way to deal with this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned in relation to the new paragraph (c) subsection (2).  I gather the intent of the section is to set out again the objectives of the company and to incorporate in the powers of the company the right to finance or invest in a company or a person who is assisting a company operating inside the State and so to enlarge the lending powers of the Industrial Credit Corporation. I am somewhat concerned in relation to the words in the new paragraph (c), subsection (2):</P>
      <P>Provided that every such acquisition, underwriting, holding, selling or other dealing is likely to be of benefit to a trade or industry in the State.</P>
      <P>This also appears in relation to a person in subsection (4).  May I ask the Minister, who determines whether it is likely to be of benefit to a trade or industry?  It would seem to me that in the interests of efficiency this determination should be made by the company. I would suggest that subsections (2) and (4) would read better were they to provide for a certificate or expression from the company that the purpose was likely to be of benefit to a trade or industry inside the State.  I can see questions arising as the section now is because nobody is designated to give that determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Higgins is correct in saying that the determination of whether or not a particular transaction is of benefit to a trade or industry inside the State would be for the company, and certainly for the board of the company. I do not think this could operate in any other way.  As I would look at it, it would be in this way: that set out here in this section is, roughly speaking, what I might call the terms of reference of the company, certainly <Col N="1527" /> the terms within which the company may operate, the terms within which other parties may deal with the company. I would regard this phrase as being a limiting factor which would apply to any transaction which the Industrial Credit Company would propose to undertake.</P>
      <P>I have already explained to the House the reasons why we wish to extend these powers.  I gather that no one is objecting to that principle.  I have also explained that the Industrial Credit Company is in competition with other companies who are not in any way restricted.  For the reasons I have mentioned I am anxious to ensure that we do not restrict the Industrial Credit Company in this matter in any way that is avoidable.  On the other hand, it seems clear to me that there could and, indeed, should be objections in this House if we were to leave complete freedom to the Industrial Credit Company with no limitation at all so that we could end up, in theory at any rate, with the Industrial Credit Company devoting the resources placed at its disposal for the benefit of a trade or industry in some other country rather than here.  For this reason this overriding phrase is put in which would operate by force of law in relation to any transaction undertaken by the Industrial Credit Company and, therefore, in practical terms would be something to which the board of the Industrial Credit Company would have to have regard in any proposed transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the intention behind the insertion of this phrase.  I am not quite sure if I understand precisely what Deputy O'Higgins's problem is.  I think he said he visualised that, perhaps, it would be necessary to have a certificate where a foreign transaction was taking place that this transaction was for the benefit of a trade or industry in the State.  Offhand, I cannot see the reason for this because it seems to me that by inserting it here we are making it mandatory on the Industrial Credit Company to conform with that requirement.  If there were a question of some confusion arising in a business deal in the absence of such a certificate, <Col N="1528" /> then I could understand the point made, but at the moment I do not see why such a certificate should be necessary since, as I say, this would be a mandatory statutory provision applying to any such transaction undertaken by the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase used is not a usual phrase: &ldquo;is likely to be of benefit to a trade or industry inside the State&rdquo;.  This, in fact, is investment of our resources in a company outside the State so that we are lending money to some outside-based concern in which a company inside the State has a limited interest of one-fifth or more and it must be likely to be of benefit. That means somebody thinks this ought to be a good bet.  Of course, I am assuming the worst case where, in fact, it is a very bad bet and the money is lost and continues to be lost, and the Industrial Credit Company continues to invest in a number of operations of the same kind.  Where is the determining body?  Who says: &ldquo;This must stop&rdquo;? There is no definition.  For instance, no one is made responsible to this House to say who decides that this kind of operation is likely to be of benefit to the State.  If it happened and I put down a question to the Minister for Finance asking who was doing this sort of thing the Minister would say: &ldquo;That is within the internal operations of the Industrial Credit Company and it is a matter they have to decide&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the problem I want to raise.  I do not want to go back over the past but even inside the State there have been notoriously bad investments.  Investments were made, money was loaned and the company blew up a short time afterwards.  It was considered a fair enough investment at the time, I assume, on the information available but, in fact, it represented a loss.  I agree with the principle in the Bill that by reason of the developing situation in our economy we are now facilitating a position in which we can enlist outside aid, but we should be careful in <Col N="1529" /> relation to who will decide these things. I do not like adjectival phrases like this in regard to the power to invest which say that it is likely to be of benefit to the trade or industry inside the State without anyone being given the responsibility of so deciding or on what basis.  I would suggest that the Minister might have a look at that again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I understand a little more clearly now than I did what Deputy O'Higgins has in mind.  It seems to me, first of all, that the risk which he contemplates, taking the worst possible view of what might happen, of investment of this kind in a company abroad which goes wrong, and a continuing investment of that kind, is a risk which, of course, exists but&mdash;and he touched on this towards the end of what he said&mdash;it is a risk without any investment abroad at all. It could happen entirely within the State as well as outside the State. Therefore, I do not think that any form of certificate or different form of words will change that risk because it is a risk which is inherent in the whole operations of the Industrial Credit Company in so far as it is investing in companies which may not be absolutely sure things.</P>
      <P>All of us want to ensure that the Industrial Credit Company does not confine its activities simply to companies which are so strong and so well managed that they could get assistance anywhere.  We want to ensure that, while the Industrial Credit Company is not investing wildly, it is prepared to take certain risks especially with Irish companies.  Ultimately it boils down to the efficiency and effectiveness of the Industrial Credit Company in its day-to-day operations and in the perspicacity of the Board of the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of the word &ldquo;likely&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;likely to be of benefit to a trade or industry in the State&rdquo; is probably the only one possible in the circumstances.  Any stronger word would mean that the Industrial Credit Company would have to say in effect before they invested in an outside company: &ldquo;This investment cannot go wrong&rdquo;.  Clearly, they could not say that.  I think this wording is as <Col N="1530" /> good as we can get, granted the situation being as I have described.</P>
    <P>Ultimately this rests on the effectiveness of the Industrial Credit Company in their operations.  It seems to me that on the record of the ICC, the House can be assured they will not engage in a series of investments that will be unsuccessful and, in particular, are not likely to do so in regard to foreign companies.  I would expect that the Industrial Credit Company would be quite wary about investments of this kind and would only engage in them when they were satisfied that it was a worthwhile investment.</P>
    <P>Basically the problem is that if one engages in this kind of business certain risks are taken and ultimately one must depend on the judgment and good sense of the people concerned.  I do not think any formula which we could devise in this House can get over or obviate that risk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that in the various operations in our society there must be a certain amount of trust and that responsibility must be placed in different fields. However, experience shows that responsibility is more forthcoming if there is ultimate sanction and in our democracy sanction ultimately is in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister to say that the board, the general manager, or the people responsible for the Industrial Credit Company will not lend money to the first foreigner they meet simply because they like the colour of his eyes.  They will be careful and responsible under the terms of the parent legislation and this legislation. However, they are human, they are fallible and may make mistakes. We all know that mistakes were made in the past and that nobody was responsible to this House for those mistakes. Nobody could be challenged at the bar of this House for what took place.  Investments were made in companies here which, in retrospect and by hindsight&mdash;and I emphasise by hindsight&mdash;turned out to be foolish in vestments.  Up to this the company was under no obligation except to assist an enterprise operating or proposing to carry out work in the State.  Up to <Col N="1531" /> the present the board had not the statutory obligation of evaluating whether the proposed activity was going to be a commercial success.  I have no doubt that it operated in that sense, but that was the position as regards investments in relation to the law.</P>
    <P>We are now extending the powers in relation to companies outside the State who are interested in our domestic market.  Since these companies are associated with a person or a company here they have a tie-up in relation to our domestic market.  In this Bill the Minister very properly imposes an extra obligation on the board.  The company have the added obligation of coming to a decision that the proposed investment is likely to be of benefit inside the State.</P>
    <P>Who is going to be responsible to the representatives of the people here if the company makes a mistake, repeats a mistake or follows a policy which, in the opinion of the representatives of the people, is a wrong policy?  I think someone ultimately should be responsible.  I think the Minister should consent to this kind of activity so that at least the Minister can be answerable here if something goes wrong.  Otherwise, once more we are handing over power to an entirely faceless group of people to invest our money in an activity they alone decide is proper.</P>
    <P>In the past we have had much of this kind of legislation and in my view it is not desirable.  It may be that a particular procedure may eventually be evolved for supervision.  &ldquo;Likely to be of benefit&rdquo; is what is suggested to be the test.  Someone should be answerable if the investment turns out not to be of benefit.  The person who should stand up in the Dáil and give the reasons is the Minister for Finance or some member of the Government.</P>

      <P>If the phrase &ldquo;likely to be of benefit to a trade or industry in the State&rdquo; is left as it stands, there will be a limitation on the operations of the company.  Therefore, it follows that in the case of any transaction entered into by the Industrial Credit Company of the nature contemplated in this section, the board of the ICC will be responsible for determining whether the transaction is likely to be of benefit to a trade or industry in the State.  I do not think anyone would contest this on the interpretation of the section as it stands.</P>
      <P>What Deputy O'Higgins has raised now relates to this and to the various operations of the Industrial Credit Company.  The point that the ICC as such are not responsible to this House and that the Minister is not responsible for the day-to-day operations of the company is a major point and the Deputy touched on possible solutions. I do not think it is quite true to say that the Minister is not responsible at all.  It would be true to say that he is not responsible for the day-to-day operations but if the kind of situation developed in which the company were making a series of bad investments either at home or abroad, this would seem to me <i>ipso facto</i> to be evidence of bad judgment and inability on the part of the board of the Industrial Credit Company.  A consistent performance of that nature by the board would also seem to me to indicate that the Minister who was responsible for their appointment, or failure to move them if they persisted in doing this, would thereby become responsible to Dáil Éireann in the conduct or failure to conduct his own duties as Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I am taking this further than day to day operations.  I am referring to clearly persistent failure on the part of the board.  I may say, and I am sure Deputy O'Higgins would agree with me, that I contemplate no such thing in relation to the board of the Industrial Credit Corporation, as at present constituted.  I agree it is a <Col N="1533" /> point which would have to be considered in the House&mdash;the possibility that such a thing could happen and what action is open to this House.  As I say, I do not think this House is without resources in dealing with a situation of that kind.  Apart from what may arise under the legislation, there are various methods under the Standing Orders by which the House may deal with a situation of that kind by resolution or otherwise.  The point now being raised is of very general application and one which does not arise specifically on this section but in relation to the activities of most State companies. I do not profess to say that the ultimate solution to this problem has been discovered, either in this country or abroad, but I say that I do not think it is a problem which can be remedied by any amendment of this particular section.</P>

      <P>There is a point which has not been made by the Minister and I think without saying it Deputy O'Higgins was adverting to it, that is, when a mistake is made by the board of a semi-State company, if the mistake is big enough the fact is that it becomes quite wrongly in my view, a political thing.  You find there are criticisms across the House because errors were made.  There is one classical example we need not go into in this regard.</P>

      <P>A Government might be extremely reluctant to use these very powers which the Minister has mentioned <Col N="1534" /> and, in fact, it might, indeed, be quite wrong that criticism would redound on a Government because of a decision made by a State board.  The Government being political animals&mdash;I do not mean that in a derogatory way &mdash;might decide: &ldquo;We will not do this because if we do it, it does not matter what the facts are, the worker in Ballyfermot or Drogheda or Mornington who lost his job will relate this mistake not to those who made the mistake, not to the recommendation of the executive to that board but to the Government.&rdquo;  It might well be that Deputy O'Higgins is very much on target in relation to this&mdash;that while the House might have rights and powers there might be a reluctance on the part of this House, whatever Government was in power, to use them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the problem that in legislation of this sort, which is terribly important in relation to the State, it would be desirable to see it developing without the shackles of Civil Service control, without any red tape of any sort.  Possibly, if one were always sure that the judgment of fallible people was always the right judgment this is the way things might more easily develop.  The trouble is that somebody sooner or later will goof. There will be some wrong decision and if this House is to function in the way in which conviction can be carried to the people there must be a situation in which some Member of the Government, whether he personally is involved or not&mdash;generally he is not&mdash;must be available to answer Deputies in this House for what occurred and to take full responsibility for it on behalf of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more legislation we pass here in which we give a <i>carte blanche</i> to an <i>ad hoc</i> body, and we give them the power to borrow or we give them the money belonging to the people and tell them: &ldquo;Go out, we trust you, carry out your statutory obligations and provided you operate within the powers we give you no one inside this House can question you&rdquo;, the more we deviate from democracy in this House.  There was a great need around 1933&mdash;indeed, I should imagine it was the late Mr. Seán Lemass who first <Col N="1535" /> introduced the first Industrial Credit Act in 1933&mdash;for the provision of credit for industrial development and it was appropriate that you did not hamstring the efforts to providing credit, that you gave people the job and you hoped, even though there might be bad investments or investments that were a little bit doubtful, by giving this credit that we would be able to develop our industrial arm.</P>
    <P>This is recognised in the Bill, section 3 of which restates the objects of the company.  So far as the company are operating within the State full discretion is given to the board of the Industrial Credit Company in relation to what they do.  Now we are enlisting outside aid.  The Minister has even recognised this by providing that the aid must be such as likely to benefit a trade or industry inside the State. This is something new.  Somebody has got to make that decision.  The person who makes that decision should in some way be responsible inside this House.  I will not press this matter or delay the Bill but I raise it because I think we should bear this in mind in relation to this kind of legislation. I hope it may be looked at between this and the time the Minister brings it to the Seanad and that he may consider the desirability, even in relation to that kind of loan when we are more and more involved in foreign borrowing and to this extent in foreign investment, that somebody should be responsible in a supervisory way so that he may be answerable on behalf of the activities of the board in this House.</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay the House further on this but Deputy O'Higgins made a suggestion that I would look at this between now and taking the Bill in the Seanad.  I will certainly undertake to do that but I do not want to mislead him or the House on this.  I do not see any way by which I can do it.  I gather that what he has in mind is some provision whereby in the event of investment of this kind in a company abroad, the Minister would certify that such investment was likely to benefit trade or industry in the State so that if something <Col N="1536" /> went wrong the matter, on foot of that certificate from the Minister, could be raised in the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete paragraph (a) and substitute the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) in subsection (1)&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) &lsquo;and in such money (including money in a currency other than the currency of the State)&rsquo; shall be inserted after &lsquo;in such form and manner&rsquo;, and</P>
      <P>(ii) &lsquo;and any such guarantee may include guarantee of payment by the Company of incidental expenses arising in connection with the borrowing&rsquo; shall be added after &lsquo;payment of such interest&rsquo;,&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained on Second Stage, this is an amendment that is required to meet the requirements of the World Bank conditions.  The amendment empowers the Minister for Finance to guarantee incidental expenses with which the Industrial Credit Company may be charged in relation to their borrowing, that is, to guarantee incidental expenses in addition to guaranteeing the actual amount of the loan.  The types of expenses that are envisaged are possible commitment fees.  In dealing <Col N="1538" /> with the World Bank there is laid down a schedule of the times at which portions of the loan will be paid and failure to take them up at that time involves the payment of a commitment fee or, even to take them up on the schedule agreed, might involve a commitment fee.  This is a payment made to the World Bank in return for holding available that money to pay to us at a certain time.  An alternative kind of liability that could arise would be in the case of our repaying the loan ahead of schedule&mdash;certain dates will be laid down for repayment&mdash;and we would then have to pay a fee to the World Bank in compensation.  This is normal practice in relation to loans. However, the only circumstances that I can envisage in this respect would be in the case of a landslide in interest rates where it might be worth our while to repay ahead of schedule.  It is to meet such requirements that I move this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To delete paragraph (c) of subsection (2).</P>
      <P>As I indicated, this amendment was put down because I have had second thoughts about the provisions which we put in relating to possible membership of the Dáil or Seanad by a director officer or servant of the Industrial Credit Company.  The section is similar to the provisions we have in a number of other enactments relating to State companies but there is a loophole in it in so far as somebody could be elected, say, to the Dáil, and not have sufficient service as a Member to qualify for the contributory pension to which a Deputy becomes entitled after eight years.  Therefore, he would lose out on the pension here but could not get service in the ICC either.  The best way I can deal with this is to delete paragraph (c) of subsection (2). As I indicated earlier, a general Bill is in preparation to standardise the provisions in this regard in relation to all State companies.  I have indicated, also, the general lines on which we are proceeding. This is probably the best way to deal with this particular matter at this time in this Bill.</P>

It transpired some years afterwards that after a particular general election there was inside the House a Deputy who had been at the time of his nomination and election an officer or employee of the ESB.  As a result of discussions across the House an amendment was introduced which changed the law with relation to the ESB.  I take it the change is in accordance with this kind of change?  As I understand what the Constitution implies, no legislation here can prevent any citizen who is qualified otherwise from standing for election to Dáil Éireann.  Our legislation may provide that a Member of Dáil Éireann as such, may not hold a particular post and I take it that is the bent of legislation now.  No member of the ICC can be prevented from standing for or being elected to Dáil Éireann but, being a Member of the House, he may be disqualified for that post which he held before or might like to hold.

      <P>Perhaps I am reading this incorrectly but subsection (3) of the section brings in the disqualification in relation to a lawfully elected Member of the House, a person who is for the time being entitled under the Standing Orders to sit in either House shall, while so entitled, be disqualified from becoming a director of the company, or an officer or servant.  There is a distinction inferentially drawn there between a person who is elected as a result of a declaration of poll in a general election or a by-election and the person who comes into the House, signs the Roll and takes his seat.  Does it mean that those who do not wish to come in, who refuse to recognise the authority of the House, will be put in a preferential position?  I do not understand why we propose to provide that &ldquo;A person who is for the time being entitled under the Standing Orders of either House.  ...&rdquo; A Deputy may be ejected from this House for a day, a week or a month.  This has happened. Can he then become a director of a company or an officer or servant?  Why is it proposed to use these terms?  It would be much better to say &ldquo;A person elected as a Member of either House of the Oireachtas shall be disqualified from being a director or an officer or servant of the Company&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am a little confused because section 8 (1) says:</P>
      <P>Where a director of the Company is nominated either as a candidate for election to either House of the Oireachtas or as a member of Seanad Éireann, he shall thereupon cease to be a director of the Company.</P>
      <P>How could he then be a Member of the House and be asked to resign if, in fact, he can become a Member of the House while holding such a post?  Either one or the other is superfluous.  Does the Minister see what I mean?  Section 8 (3) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who is for the time being <Col N="1542" /> entitled under the Standing Orders of either House of the Oireachtas to sit therein shall, while so entitled, be disqualified from becoming a director of the Company or an officer or servant of the Company.</P>
    <P>If he is disqualified as soon as he is nominated, from being a director of the Company how then does subsection (3) apply?</P>

      <P>I confess I cannot say why this particular form of wording is used as against, &ldquo;a person who has been elected...&rdquo;; it is a form of wording that has been used in quite a number of Acts and it has been incorporated holusbolus into this.  I can only surmise that the reason is probably that the objective is to ensure that a person who is acting as a Member of this House or as a Member of Seanad Éireann will not, at the same time, be either a director or officer or servant of the company.  I think Deputy O'Higgins has probably touched on the reason for this particular wording: you could have a situation in which somebody would be elected but would not take his seat If you did not have the section worded in this way that person, by becoming elected and not taking his seat, would be deprived of any way of <Col N="1543" /> earning his living.  I am surmising that is why the subsection is worded in that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I devoted the first part of my speech on the Budget to the inadequacy of the social welfare provisions.  I suggested to the Minister that he might over the weekend look at the questions raised by Deputy L'Estrange and myself about the increase in the consumer price index because in my view the quoted figure of a 10 per cent increase in the cost of living was less than what, in fact, it would be.  I am sure the Minister has looked at that over the weekend.  I do not intend wearying the House by reading out a long list but when the Minister is replying he can refute me if he wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Minister cannot refute under any circumstance the position in relation to the advances given to unfortunate social welfare recipients. In pages 3 and 4 of the document circulated with the Budget the principal social welfare increases are given which, by and large, show an increase of 10 per cent.  In my view the social welfare provisions are the greatest failure in this Budget.  This Budget is not a &ldquo;stay as poor as you are&rdquo; Budget because social welfare recipients as from 1st August, unless there is a further increase in the cost of living, will not be as poor as they are today but, if one relates it directly to the 1970 Budget and writes in the increase in the cost of living one finds it is a &ldquo;stay as poor as you were&rdquo; Budget in relation to the 1970 Budget. That means that in this Budget we have not moved one iota towards <Col N="1545" /> bringing our social welfare recipients up to a comparable level with Europe or Britain.  When we look at the whole social welfare spectrum and at the peculiar debacle of the withdrawal of the dole, which shows three different moves towards chaos on the part of the Government, we find the Government have failed and there is no excuse for them.</P>
    <P>The only way we can justify our advances towards freer trade is by being a bit kinder each year to our poor people.  In this we have not succeeded. Why have we not succeeded? In the <i>Review of 1970 and Outlook for 1971</i> we find that whereas the Third Programme for Economic Expansion hoped for an increase of 4 per cent, all we can hope for now, according to the Minister's Budget Statement is an increase of 3 per cent.  We did not succeed in achieving our object during the financial year 1969-70.  In fact, we were 1½ per cent behind the projection for that year.  I remember the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Haughey, when we failed to reach the objectives in the Second Programme complaining about the &ldquo;excessive quantification therein&rdquo;.  He made quite sure that in the Third Programme there would not be &ldquo;excessive quantification therein&rdquo;. We were not going to be told what the targets were but, of course, there were the ordinary simple increases in gross national product and things like that which we had to be told, even if we were to have only the barest outline of a statistical programme.  The figures we were provided with showed that we were going to fail in 1970-71 and that we failed in the financial year 1969-70.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that this failure is far more spectacular than one might regard at first sight.  The failure to achieve 1 per cent in the gross national product is rather like increasing interest from 6 to 8 per cent which looks like an increase of 2 per cent, but when one comes to pay the increase in the interest one finds the charge to the purchaser represents an increase not of 2 per cent but of 33? per cent.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the simple statistics and remembers that the Minister's predecessor <Col N="1546" /> made quite certain that there would not be &ldquo;excessive quantification&rdquo; one finds the Minister's projection for this financial year is that gross national product will be 25 per cent under the Third Programe for Economic Expansion projection and was more than 25 per cent under the increase in the previous year.  Deputies on all sides of the House know that we have to provide new jobs to offset those we are going to lose in modern agriculture.  The increase in the gross national product is a very important factor and if there is a 25 per cent reduction in the gross national product projection the provision of new jobs will not improve.</P>
    <P>The advice of the Central Bank shortly before the Budget was announced, but in my opinion after much of the documentation we were given on Budget day had been typed and printed, was that taxation should not be spectacularly increased.  The Central Bank also advised that the increase in bank lending in the private sector should remain at the same figure as last year but that personal overdrafts and personal loans should be severely restricted and that the money available should be devoted to productive purposes.  This was the advice of a Central Bank which quite clearly saw that the patient was no longer capable of being cured by bloodletting and that what the patient, in this case the Irish economy, wanted was nourishment, not punishment.  At the end of every credit squeeze&mdash;I do not think we have yet reached the end of this one&mdash;that is the pattern.  So much harm was done by the sort of &ldquo;Stop-Go&rdquo; economy that it is difficult to see what the final result would be.  This is the only economy one can have when there is a Government which relates everything to the next general election or the next by-election.  When a &ldquo;Stop-Go&rdquo; has been applied for a period and a few things have gone against one, the insistence by the financiers and the experts of tightening belts, spending less and deflating the economy changes into a fear that the deflation will result in the destruction of a great part of that economy.  That is one of the reasons why this Budget can be regarded by some as a soft Budget.  There was no <Col N="1547" /> other way in which the country could continue on its way without the most spectacular and the most all-enveloping ills, taking unemployment as the first major ill and the collapse of companies as the second, the second, of course, a corollary of the first.</P>
    <P>This has been the result of seven years of political expediency on the part of Fianna Fáil.  Every financial and every economic decision was related to either a by-election or a general election.  After seven years of such behaviour there have been almost precisely two years of utter dereliction, not because they would not, perhaps, have wished to attend to the economy, would not, perhaps, have wished to spend their time considering the economy, but because, when they had done the normal work of their offices of State, taken the day-to-day decisions which must be taken apart from any policy or major change, there was time left only for the discussion of their own sad and sorry political party plight.  That left no time for the constant attention a modern economy requires.</P>
    <P>Whether or not one agrees with what is happening in Britain either under a conservative administration or a Labour administration one can take these two periods of British politics and compare them with our administration here.  One can say, without fear of contradiction, that in Britain over that period there was constant attention paid to the economy.  Under the Labour Party administration there were changes that could be said to have been opposed to traditional democratic Labour policy.  The same thing applied under the Conservative administration.  The reason is quite clear.  This afternoon four or five of us here have been discussing a Bill embracing all sorts of changes in the lending of money by our Industrial Credit Company both inside and outside the State.  The House has agreed that this Bill is necessary.  Over that period the economy should have been given a slight deflation in certain areas because of an upsurge in some direction which would ultimately hurt the economy generally.  At the same time <Col N="1548" /> there should have been a slight in flation in another direction so that, as we went along, we could take our chances, acting more in the role of professional economic observers, well advised, rather than as politicans in a particular political party.</P>
    <P>The last two years have, of course, been disastrous.  The Minister's predecessor had the kind of ideas I have promulgated.  It is quite clear he addressed a considerable amount of expertise towards their fruition.  The fault here lies with the whole Cabinet. The Government have always been prepared to prostitute their duty to their political aims and ambitions.  All the expertise in the world, all the knowledge and all the advice cannot substitute for an honest man.  I make nothing but a political charge against anybody on the far side of the House.</P>
    <P>In the position in which we find ourselves today we will have to take serious risks in order to keep our economy from partial collapse.  One of the risks is the production of this Budget, a Budget I have already described as a Sweet Fanny Adams Budget, a Budget that does nothing for anybody. I have given my reasons in relation to social welfare and the Minister has the option of refuting my arguments when he comes to reply: people on social welfare may be as well off on 1st August next as they were on 1st August last.</P>
    <P>During the year we had a financial measure passed in this House, the infamous Finance (No. 2) (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act which imposed 58 per cent taxation on companies here.  The Minister went to some considerable trouble to give one or two specific examples to show that this would not be the case and he asked us to compare our system with the system in Britain. He says our dividends here are not taxed.  That, of course, is not the case. If a person gets a dividend here he pays full unearned income tax on that dividend and the specific example given by the Minister does not apply in 90 per cent of the cases.  There is, too, the fact that we have a much smaller economic base than Britain has and an enormous number of our companies are subsidiaries of British companies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1549" /> Our protective tariffs encouraged the setting up of such subsidiaries here, producing the same kind of goods under the same trade mark and with precisely the same specification.  These companies are inter-related and the raw material comes from the parent company. Like every other company, from year to year their profits, gross and net, vary and their costs vary when taken into their profit and loss accounts.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in telling the House that I know of many companies whose auditors and accountants have now found that it would pay them better to pay their taxes in Britain than here and that it is as easy as kissing hands for them to make a higher service charge and by increasing the price of raw materials from the parent company in Britain to create a situation where the profits are made in Britain and not here, because the rate of taxation is lower in Britain than here in the case of the particular instances I know of.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that against the extra moneys the Minister has specified as being necessary, the £3½ million got retrospectively by this infamous legislation and the £6 million which he estimates will fall to his maw in this financial year, he will have to set a sizeable sum in respect of the money that will not be collected here because it will pay companies very well to pay their tax in Britain instead of here.</P>
    <P>That is the position we have got ourselves into.  I make no apology for saying that a proper housekeeping approach to the financial problems of this country during the decades when Fianna Fáil were in power could have created an excellent economic situation for us in which goods produced at home would have been cheaper and in which the industrial worker, the small farmer, the self-employed person in the middle income group, might be earning a bit less than their counterparts in Britain but the money would buy more because it would have meant that our people would have been living better and that our export opportunities would have been enhanced.</P>
    <P>What is the truth?  It is that not only are a great number of goods which we require more expensive here than in <Col N="1550" /> England but also that the taxation payable by those companies whom we need to employ our people leaving agriculture, is in most cases higher than in Britain.  Therefore, we are left with the worst of both worlds because of an Administration who thought only of their own political selves.</P>
    <P>Where is the silver lining?  The free depreciation provision in the Budget is welcome for those people who can afford to engage in capital expenditure. There are a large number of firms producing goods for home consumption&mdash; some of them are shoe factories and many of them are well known to me &mdash;who will have capital to invest and who will, therefore, enjoy the free depreciation clause.  There has been freedom from tax in respect of export companies.  There is more joy in Fianna Fáil ranks about the opening of one small factory employing six people than in the protection of 200 jobs.  I remember the present Tánaiste taking off in his State car, coming down to Drogheda and there opening what was stated to be a factory&mdash;I must not use names&mdash;to press moss peat into bales for export to Britain. It had a hopper, a grinder and a thing for compressing the peat, but the sum total of employment was two.  They are gone now and the premises are used as storage for another plant.  There was more joy in the Government Information Bureau's headlines and in the speech of the present Tánaiste than if an existing factory have been saved from extinction.  I am not saying that some factories have not been saved but this would not have been necessary if the country's economy had been handled properly.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I intend to deal with another matter which is far from being a silver lining, but before that I must refer to the part of his Budget Statement in which the Minister said that he is relying on new taxation this year to the extent of £9.2 million.  As well, he is relying on buoyancy to the extent of £16 million.  Where will the buoyancy come from?  It will come from the second stage of the 12th round wage increase and from the first stage of the 13th round which will fall into this financial year, from 1st October <Col N="1551" /> next.  It will come from every subscriber by way of PAYE, the unfortunates who have to look after wives and families.  If such a man has a car in which to get to work he will not be allowed one penny travelling expenses. That is the law of the land. If the company which employ him send out a chauffcur driven limousine to bring a director for his morning coffee that company will claim that as an expense.  Unless a worker has three or four children&mdash;even then, if he does some overtime, he will be caught&mdash;he will have to pay 7s in the £.  I can give an example in respect of a company in which I am interested. From 4th April, 1970, the workers were paid 15s, from 1st October they were paid another 15s and from April, 1971, they were paid another 15s.  That agreement terminates on 1st October next.  There is the period from 1st October until March 31st in which to collect revenue from another £2, if the 13th round is adhered to.  That is where the Minister's buoyancy of £16 million comes from.  The people will not be any better off.  Let us consider the figure of £3.  At this stage people have reached the tax bracket, because all their allowances are gone.  Out of that will come three times 35p, that is 105p.  If they drink two pints a further 17½ will be deducted, that is 122½p; and if the wife happens to have two sherries the deduction will not be very far from the same.  As a result of this Budget the people, even though they do not know it, will stay exactly where they are.  At the same time there is no fillip for agriculture or industry.</P>
    <P>The trade union agreement to which I have referred does not take into account the various changes in hours, service pay or anything like that.  Leave all those things aside and just consider the main items.  The industry concerned is not one in which the workers are highly paid; they will have very little left over when these provisions are implemented.  If a person wanted to live as a monk or a hermit he might be a few shillings better off, but living a normal existance he will be worse off, even after the termination of the 12th round agreement and the application of the 13th round.  Since <Col N="1552" /> the Irish people will be as badly off as they were in a time of rising prices&mdash; and the consumer price index will not stay where it is; I have not brought that into the argument at all&mdash;I would have hoped there would have been in the Budget speech not only a statement of the reason why but a statement of the advantage around the corner.  I have heard Fianna Fáil refer to this advantage around the corner many times when it was not there.  It would have been better to give the country a lead than to produce a spate of changes which are of no real consequence and which, if examined in any depth, will be found to leave the people worse off without, at the same time, doing anything for the economy.</P>
    <P>I referred, in passing, to the dole. There is no need to refer to it after the speech of Deputy Joseph Lenehan. When it comes to wondering what is an island or whether the Mullet of Belmullet is an island, whether Achill or Valentia is an island, it is merely a question of wriggling by the Government. The Taoiseach is responsible for all this wriggling.  Do not think he is the lily white gentleman in the background. He is responsible for the action of each of his Ministers.  In the Book of Estimates there was printed a reduction of £1,500,000, and an order was made implementing that decision. A Parliamentary Question extracted the information that £1,500,000 was the amount of money involved.  Then there has to be a definition of what is an island.  When one considers the state of chaos to which the country has been reduced, one must ask how was it possible to get any sort of serious economic discussion going at Cabinet meetings over the past 24 months.  I sincerely believe that it was not so possible.</P>
    <P>I now want to refute, and do so in my capacity as chairman of Louth County Council, the Minister's statement in his Budget speech that the rates were being relieved by extra money towards meeting health expenditure.  My phraseology in that sentence is deliberate.  Of course, the Minister has to give something more for health in relief of rates. I had to study in detail the position in my county, and I do not require any file to recount to the House precisely <Col N="1553" /> what that position is.  Last year we received a supplementary grant of £69,854.  Then we received a supplementary grant in respect of our over-expenditure for the financial year that has just passed, estimated about a week or a fortnight before the end of that year at £39,000.  This year our State grant will be 54.7 per cent of our health expenditure based on the arrangements made with the new health authorities.  There will be no second supplementary grant in respect of over-expenditure. The rate has been struck on that basis and has been increased by over 14s and some new pence in the £.  Health expenditure keeps going up, and the £ is worth less.</P>
    <P>I would be obliged if the Minister would indicate to me when he is replying if, in fact, he intends to give supplementary grants next year, if the circular sent by the Minister for Local Government to local authorities was in error, and if, therefore, the local authorities have struck a rate greater than they need strike.  Those are the alternatives open to the Minister.  He has informed us we are getting the same as we got before without the supplementary grant for over-expenditure.  It will not, I am sure, be very difficult for him to contact his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, to obtain this circular, if it is not already in his own Department, and look at it.</P>
    <P>As a farmer I have for many years been irritated by Table V, which has appeared in the Current Budget Tables, for about ten years.  It refers to &ldquo;State Expenditure in relation to Agriculture&rdquo; and according to the asterisk note it includes both capital and non-capital expenditure.  Agriculture, of course, is a big industry but this is just as if one were to charge up the cost of law enforcement to some Department other than the Department of Justice.  Surely we as an agricultural nation building up our industry should not be printing these lists which include such things as arterial drainage&mdash;a figure of almost £1½ million&mdash;payments related to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement&mdash;which is not the fault of the farmer&mdash;agricultural education&mdash;as if perhaps somebody living in Terenure could not avail of agricultural education <Col N="1554" /> and enter agriculture for the rest of his or her life.  This charging up of items to agriculture, based on everything that has anything to do with the land is a mistake; it is setting family against family and it is creating an urban <i>versus</i> rural bias and, as it is there, why is the expenditure in relation to Industry and Commerce not similarly tabulated?</P>
    <P>This table was produced at a time when an ex-Minister for Agriculture, who is still a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, was at loggerheads with the farmers.  He produced it to stuff it down their necks and let everybody know that they were getting something like £50 million, which has now become £100 million.  This, however, has no more to do with what is being done for the individual farmer than &ldquo;Sweet Fanny Adams&rdquo; has.  In regard to the claims of the Minister in relation to agriculture I will turn to his extremely useful and abbreviated document, &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;. Item No. 1 is for £1.4 million to meet the extra cost to the Exchequer of the export support payment for carcase beef.  This sum may be paid or it may not be paid.  The position is that under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement the British have agreed to pay a subsidy on a figure of 25,000 tons of beef, some lamb, mutton and so on, and above that we have to pay it ourselves.  If the market price for beef in Britain falls at certain times of the year below the price specified as proper for the English farmer then the British pay the subsidy up to 25,000 tons and from there on we pay it.</P>
    <P>In the same article of the same agreement we undertake to provide 638,000 head of store cattle.  I have not got the figure to mind whether we have so done but if the store beast went to England it could very well, and most probably would, make the same price as paid here for killing in a factory two or three months later.  The stay in Britain for gaining the subsidy was three months but now it is two months. Therefore, the price to the farmer in relation to the £1.4 million is not affected and that is the mildest way one can put it.  Unlike my colleagues in the Labour Party I hold the view that the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area <Col N="1555" /> Agreement was inevitable once we went towards Europe, and that we had to go in; my argument with the Government about our accession to Europe is not as to whether we should or should not go in&mdash;I say we have to go in if Britain goes in&mdash;but my argument, and here I come pretty close to my colleagues in the Labour Party in this matter, is that they are not bargaining hard enough.  Our beef factories got the opportunity to increase production and were, in fact, underwritten by this section of the agreement, and instead of sending 25,000 tons we are sending something more, which approximates to a payment agreed within the agreement of £1.4 million, and therefore for any Minister to say that he is giving the farmer £1.4 million more for his beef is a complete travesty of the truth.  I hasten to add that I am not suggesting that the Minister is telling a deliberate lie because I make every effort to be in order.  What is happening is that we are sending more than 25,000 tons of beef and that is that.  That is the only explanation for it.</P>
    <P>In a certain section of the agreement it is possible to have a revision but we have had a Budget introduced here in which there is not a word about that. If it turns out that there is more beef and, I suspect, less store cattle going, and if we want to develop our beef factories then we should make representations to the British Government that if they want our beef, and a continuing supply of it, and that is one of the bases on which we got other very important advantages under the agreement, then they should jolly well pay for it.  It is not for the Minister for Finance to suggest that he is giving an increase of £1.4 million to beef producers. He is doing nothing of the sort. In fact he is adhering to a provision of the agreement on which his Government have not sought any improvement by bargaining.</P>
    <P>For the first time for many years butter is improving in price.  We are not restricted in the amount we can send to the British market yet the best that can be done is for the Minister to say that he is producing £2.2 million to improve the position of the dairy farmers.  I wonder, in the heel <Col N="1556" /> of the hunt, whether he will produce anything or not.  I remember very well the year 1959.  I was acting as spokesman for agriculture that year.  It was an extremely dry year and it was the year of the GATT, to which we had not acceded at that time, if my memory is correct.  Under that agreement Britain suggested to its partners, and to everybody outside the agreement, which included ourselves, that we should limit our supplies of butter to the British market and that that limitation should be based on what we supplied during 1959.  Our meagre supply during that year was 12,000 tons.  To the credit of Britain in every succeeding year when other partners or suppliers inside or outside the agreement did not supply their quota supplementary licences were given to Ireland. This was a very definite advantage to us because there is not much joy in selling butter at the sort of prices at which we sold to the Middle East not so very long ago and when the people at home would have bought it even if it were dyed purple for greasing cart wheels.</P>
    <P>It was so small as to be hardly measurable in new pence.  The position about butter and cheese is improving and I wonder whether, when the accounts of Bord Bainne are finally assessed, there will be the loss of £2.2 million which the Minister has suggested. The guaranteed minimum prices of top-grade pigs is to be increased by an average of 50 pence per cwt dead weight.  The price of barley goes up by a figure which, on the basis of 3 lb. of meal fed per lb. of pig-meat produced, will more than wipe out the 50 new pence.  An ordinary correction is taken as an advantage by the Minister. It is something for which he should be lauded at every agricultural meeting in the country.  The hogget ewe subsidy is to be increased from £1.50 to £2.00 per head at a cost of £0.25 million.  The small farm incentive bonus will be increased from £50 to £75 at a cost which is not mentioned. There will be higher grants for a new and more efficient type of forage harvester and an improvement in the grant rate for farm silos.  If I went into the type of discussion which <Col N="1557" /> the Minister went into here on forage harvesters and the pig-farrowing equipment and dry sow stalling accommodation I would be ruled out of order, and told that I should wait for the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>It was a measure of how small a degree of advantage is given to the farmers in this Budget that these matters had to be mentioned.  There was nothing of greater moment.  It was said that these improvements would support farm incomes to the extent of about £12 million per year.  A figure of £4.35 million is added to the Supply Services for agriculture in the Budget. I know there are items in the Book of Estimates.  I know that the Department of Agriculture veterinary surgeons and inspectors must get more money and that the girls in the offices must get higher salaries, but I would like the Minister to explain how the improvements referred to would improve farm incomes to the extent of £12 million per year or is the phrase &ldquo;will support farm incomes&rdquo; just another trick phrase?  Does the Minister mean that farm incomes will be improved by £12 million per year?  I want to state categorically that farm incomes will not be improved by £12 million per year. The increase in milk prices is meagre. It is questionable whether or not it will cost the Exchequer anything.  The beef price increase is connected with the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, the bargain made by the Government. This is the year for a review and no review has been asked for.  The increase in the price of pigs is connected with the increase in the price of barley after the next harvest.  The increase in the small farm subsidy scheme from £50 to £75 and the possible grant for silage or forage harvesters is mentioned. Agriculture is still perhaps the most important facet of our economy.  If that is so, we have been sending a boy on a man's errand when these small improvements are all that have been obtained.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the air companies, I wish to refer to the £25 million of scarce capital which is being given.  I am not against air companies.  The performance of Aer Lingus and Aerlinte <Col N="1558" /> has been spectacular.  At this stage a halt should be called.  The replacement of planes is extremely important even from the safety point of view, apart from prestige value.  It is true to say that we probably kept the Viscounts too long.  We have invested heavily in the Jumbo jets.  We should ask ourselves whether or not some of the moneys so invested might not have been better employed down the long boreens of Ireland.  The taking by the Minister of share capital in the British and Irish Steam Packet Company shows some wisdom.  These things can be done by the stroke of a pen, but people at the top are hailed as national saviours, acclaimed as brilliant geniuses with mental ability far beyond that of anyone here or of anyone at the head of any Department of State or at the head of any university or other important institution.  In my opinion most of these people are not so brilliant.  There was one instance of a gentleman who was given so many jobs within nine months that a member of a teenage group on television mentioned him as the person he would send to the moon.  Other teenagers said they would send the President, or the Leader of the Opposition, or the Taoiseach but this young lad said: &ldquo;We might as well send Mr. A because he has been given every other job and we may as well give him this one also.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We should watch the national debt carefully bearing in mind the willingness of the Irish people to pay and the ability of our people to work, and their well-known honesty.  We should be very particular that we do not incur debt for the advancement of a few and the payment by the many.  In speaking about the national debt I may have a different view from some of my party on this subject and from many people in this House.  This nation must have a large national debt relative to our earning population.  I was born in 1923.  That was the end of the Civil War when much damaged property had to be replaced.  Forget who was wrong and who was right.  Then came the economic war when there was no capital, no advancement&mdash;again forget who was right and who was wrong, it is all history&mdash;and then the war <Col N="1559" /> itself when we built up foreign reserves, that dissipated themselves by the fall in the value of money.  There was the story of the man in Germany who papered his bedroom with bank notes at a certain stage because that was the cheapest way to do it.  I do not say we ever suffered that way but it is not so very long ago&mdash;and in relation to the national debt this should be mentioned &mdash;since, in complete contravention of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, the British imposed their deposit system on exports from this country and we felt we were lucky because we could sell a lot of foreign securities that we had, largely British securities, which were our external assets.  Some of those which were sold had an interest bearing rate of 3½ per cent so the guardians of those coffers were not being so bright or the politicians who were the guardians of the guardians of those coffers were not being so bright either.</P>
    <P>I accept the fact that the nation must have a large national debt for the very reason that there is no great colonial wealth.  There is no great wealth here born of the ages past.  A question was asked here some months ago about the number of surtax payers.  I forget the figure.  It was certainly fewer than 1,000 people anyway.  The figure in my mind is 600.  I may be wrong.  If that is so then people in that category have not got&mdash;they may have the opportunity perhaps to have expense accounts or something like that which they should not have&mdash;the opportunities for tax avoidance.</P>
    <P>There is no great source of old national wealth.  If there is not and if our boys and girls must be provided with houses or flats when they get married at a reasonable rent, if we must improve our educational facilities, if we must improve our roads, if we must improve our hospital facilities, if we must keep abreast of Europe, then we must have, relative to the earning head of the population, a large national debt.  My considered opinion is that at the moment our national debt is not disastrous but there is something else that is disastrous and <Col N="1560" /> that is the fact that the money borrowed is not being properly applied.</P>
    <P>I remember one evening an economist giving a lecture in which he defined &ldquo;saving&rdquo; as wise spending, a very proper definition I thought.  In relation to the national debt I do not think we have had wise spending here and, in the experience of every profligate, we must reap our wild oats.  I think that the housekeeping of the Fianna Fáil Government over the past decades has not been sound.  Considerable expenditures were entered into which should not have been entered into.  That should not have meant a lesser involvement by the State in the affairs of the nation but a different involvement. The idea that the State should not go in and that private enterprise should have everything at its beck and call and that the old Manchester school of economics which was: &ldquo;If you do not work you do not eat&rdquo; should apply all over the place is as dead as mutton.  Where the State involves itself it should involve itself wisely.  It should borrow wisely.  It should over the years by the management of its various budgets increase the desire on the part of the saver to save.</P>
    <P>I once visited a man who has now been dead for a long time, a man hallowed in the halls of this House.  He once refused the office of Minister for Local Government.  He was a man called James Murphy from Drogheda. He was ill in bed and with him was another old friend who is also dead. The Budget had just come out.  It was not a Fianna Fáil Budget.  It was a Budget introduced by the late Gerard Sweetman.  The old man who was visiting ex-Deputy Murphy said as I entered the room: &ldquo;You robbed the savers and now you are asking them to save.&rdquo;  The man in the bed said: <i>&ldquo;Panem et circenses&rdquo;</i> or &ldquo;If you cannot give them bread make sure you give them plenty of circuses.&rdquo;  That has been the pattern of Fianna Fáil administration over the years.  They create a hullabaloo to get themselves out of any serious economic difficulty that should really be talked about and thought about in every workingman's house in this country.  Is it not true that if the value of our money is <Col N="1561" /> to be eroded those who have property will become richer and those who have not will become poorer?  Is it not the worst situation that could possibly arise that we would have an Ireland in which there might be some hundreds of powerful, wealthy men controlling, as happens in banana republics, the very lives and the futures and the fortunes of the men who work?  This is surely not the approach of any modern administration.</P>
    <P>Go back to my opening statement which shows quite clearly that the social welfare recipient is no better off than a year ago and you find the utter weakness, the utter sterility of this Budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that we will borrow here whatever we can and we will have more borrowing from abroad. We borrowed £200 million in the last two years and we applied it here and when the dividends are paid out, and the servicing of public debt is in this Budget as it is in every other Budget, the recipients will pay their income tax in West Germany, largely in West Germany.  I think some of them will pay it in Holland.  That makes the rate of interest which is paid factually by this Government one-third greater than if it could have been borrowed at home. There is the fault; there is where the correction is needed.  We did not create an economy capable of producing the gross national product to provide the savings that could have obviated the necessity of going abroad.  I believe that if the people are paid for their savings they will give them to you provided at the same time that you do not take away&mdash;as this Budget will take away from them&mdash;as much as you give them in the form of direct or indirect taxation related, of course, to the increase they may get in the 12th, 13th or any other round.</P>
    <P>I want to address myself now to a specific item, that is, the increased expenditure of £4½ million on factory grants.  Will this be spent?  Will companies come here to pay higher taxation than they would pay at home?  The answer is that if they are producing exclusively for export they will, because they will get a tax holiday.  If they are producing in part goods for consumption <Col N="1562" /> on the Irish market then they certainly will not because, so far as I can see at the moment, the Irish market would be regarded as a contracting market.  Will this £4.5 million be spent? I do not know how it was computed.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Industrial Development Authority were in a position to tell the Minister that they had entered into commitments of a volume which would entail that extra expenditure.  If that is so I am delighted, but I am extremely suspicious as to whether these plans will ever come to fruition, or whether this is more window-dressing to leave open all the political options so that they can go to the country now if they like, stick if they like, or go to the country at any other time they like. If they have themselves cemented together and if they have got over their own dreadful internal squabbles, they can let the country run until October or November.  Then, if revenue is not right they can impose another Budget in the realisation that they still have a sufficient number of members with sufficiently thick political skins to stick it out.</P>
    <P>Enough expertise was not used in relation to the question of borrowing money at home.  The ordinary lending houses in this city, and in every other city, employ an extraordinary amount of expertise in the way they gather money.  They will take money on three months call and give half per cent extra.  They will take money on seven days call and give half per cent less. They will take a proportion of money and say: &ldquo;You can have one quarter of it back at such a time and one quarter at such a time, but give us six months notice for the whole lot and we will give you an extra rate of interest.&rdquo;  They can do all these things.  In my view this should have been done by the Minister.  He had his agencies if he wanted to do it. He could do it through the Post Office, the Industrial Credit Company or the Agricultural Credit Company.  He is not giving them very much encouragement to do anything.  He merely makes up the deficit.  He restricts them to £7 million or whatever it is.  If they could by their own efforts induce Irish citizens <Col N="1563" /> to save, and if they had £12 million available, he would take £5 million from them.  That does not seem to me to be the right way to do it.</P>
    <P>It is all right for a politician to come in here and take the hide off the Government for about two hours and then sit down.  I propose to do that.  I propose to be a little more blunt than the Minister was in relation to the Budget.  There is one ray of hope in this Budget.  There is one silver lining, apart from the small silver lining I mentioned in relation to free depreciation for anybody who can get the money to invest in industry.  Although the Minister did not say it, I think this Budget was framed on the basis that, if the agreement between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the employers on the pattern of the 13th round is adhered to, it will be possible to carry on for the rest of the financial year.  If the Minister were a bolder man he might have gone a little nearer to making a promise in that regard.</P>
    <P>It was my job as spokesman on Industry and Commerce for the Fine Gael Party to say quite clearly that the £2 suggested as the figure for the 13th round will be removed entirely by the Minister in taxation.  I have instanced 7s in the £ and on £2 that is 14s gone. Then if a man takes two pints that is 3s 6d, making 17s 6d.  If you add it up between 5 per cent turnover tax and 20 per cent selective wholesale tax, which includes an enormous number of household commodities which his wife might buy, his own personal purchases and his direct taxation, there is no doubt that the 13th round will be removed.  That is the buoyancy in the Budget.  That is, in fact, extra taxation. If the Irish nation are prepared to accept that&mdash;and at this point of time I think they should&mdash;then it is possible that the Government may be able to leave things as they are for this financial year.  That would be a good thing in a diabolically bad situation created by the Government themselves. It might get us a little nearer to the road back.</P>
    <P>There is in the offing one other silver lining.  I suppose nobody should talk of a tax as a silver lining.  Properly used and properly applied, there is <Col N="1564" /> some chance that the brutal blunt instrument of selective wholesale tax and turnover tax could be improved by the application of added value tax. If increased taxation has to be put on luxuries let it be indirect taxation.  The necessaries of the housewife, of the young married couple and of the ordinary plain decent working people of Ireland should be left alone.  If that is done, the argument as to whether the 13th and 12th round should be adhered to, the argument as to whether there has been a spectacular increase in the cost of living and that therefore they should not be adhered to, will be carried out in a kindlier atmosphere.  That is the only hope for Ireland.  I do not think the Minister has given any reason for that hope.  He has merely left his political options open, and to blazes with the rest.</P>
    <P>I have not mentioned the crushing burden of rates so far.  I am glad I remembered it before I sat down.  If, by the proper application of an added value tax, and the repeal of turnover tax and selective wholesale tax, the people could hope that the crushing burden of rates, rents and taxation would be shared more equitably and if, at the same time, they could be assured that if they want to live in a modest way and seek modest things in decency that will be available to them without going on strike constantly and having the nation at the top of the strikes league, something might come out of this morass.  I have no confidence in Fianna Fáil doing that ever.  I have considerable confidence that they will not get the chance.</P>
    <P>I want to be quite clear and decided in what I say now.  When a Taoiseach is being elected after the next election, which cannot be too long delayed, I hope the House, with the exception of the faithful few in Fianna Fáil, will vote for Deputy Liam Cosgrave on the basis of an unblemished record&mdash;a record embellished by the name and record of a proud father.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to comment on Deputy Donegan's speech. In my notes I had put down a quotation from a speech by the Minister for Finance.  In the Budget Statement he made the claim that &ldquo;expenditure in relation to agriculture is now running <Col N="1565" /> at £101 million&rdquo;.  Deputy Donegan has exposed very well the reasons why this claim is dishonest and disgraceful.  It is a tendentious and bogus claim that farmers are getting this amount of money because that is what the public understands to be the case.  In the last few years we have, tragically, become experts in the devious use of English. No doubt people on the Government side will say that the statement does not really mean that at all but the public at large have in their minds the figure of £100 million going to Irish farmers.  This is untrue and disgraceful and I imagine there are many people in the Department of Finance who are ashamed of this tendentious use of statistics.  I do not propose to amplify the arguments put forward by Deputy Donegan.  In my view they are unanswerable and I agree completely with him.</P>
      <P>I should like to say two things about this disgraceful claim.  First, it is socially divisive for the following reasons.  In any society there is always a tendency towards a lack of understanding or even conflict between rural and urban populations.  When a claim of this kind is made in the Irish context the result is that the urban population looks contemptuously towards the countryside, believing that the farmers are not pulling their weight and are living on the urban workers.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Donegan has said, the motive for doing this little sum every year dates partly from the time when there was sharp conflict between a Minister and the agricultural lobby.  It has a disruptive effect and builds hostility between two sections of the community who should not for political gain be set against each other in this way.  In the short term there is another reason which in terms of national interest in the coming years may be more important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have applied for membership of the EEC.  At this moment crucial conversations are proceeding and nobody wants to bet on the outcome.  If we get in we will have the duty to abide by the common agricultural policy of the Community and we accept that duty.  However, with an <Col N="1566" /> underdeveloped agriculture, we have a duty to our farmers to look for every possible favourable interpretation of the rules, every possible protection and as much stretching of the rules inside the Community as we can obtain. Every country is trying to help its agricultural industry inside the Community and is trying to conceal the extent of that help from its rivals. The rivals are trying to reduce the extent of the help while maintaining assistance to their own farmers.  The tendentious propaganda statement in the Budget speech will make more difficult the wheeling and dealing that will be necessary inside the Community to protect our farmers.  The claim is foolish as well as socially divisive.</P>
    <P>I have been reading recently debates on Budgets of previous years. It is a slightly depressing exercise.  On the one hand there are the furious assaults from the Opposition at everything in the Budget and, on the other hand, there is the sycophantic adulation of whatever the current Minister for Finance has chosen to say from the benches behind the Minister.  This reduces debate on probably the most important measure of the year to a kind of political ping-pong.  For what they are worth to the Government benches, let us get certain admissions out of the way.</P>
    <P>Of course certain increases to some sections of the community are welcome. Of course the little considerations towards some disadvantaged sections are welcome.  Of course the position of the Minister is difficult; he has not much room to manoeuvre and not many options.  That is true because, within a permissible imbalance, he must get some kind of lining-up between the money that is coming in and the money that is going out.  He must meet certain social demands and standards which any population calls for as being normal and those standards rise each year.  We accept all these points.</P>
    <P>When we are discussing financial policy there is a matter we must not forget.  We are a tiny open economy. During the lifetime of this State we have never sought to establish control <Col N="1567" /> over our financial system or establish economic independence.  That is the nasty truth.  We may make nice speeches as though we possessed economic sovereignty and control of our finances.  However, we have never considered it important enough to attain this and this is one reason I find the auctions held among the various grades of Republicans regarding who is the more Republican as being more than faintly ridiculous.  In the past matters of oaths were important and now matters of national unity are presented as being very important but apparently these people are not interested in the sovereignty of our economy which is central to any Republican thinking.</P>
    <P>For some considerable time the Government have been profoundly divided and deeply preoccupied with matters that have nothing to do with the running of our economy.  A great deal of the work of the Budget is done by civil servants and it is done over a fairly long period.  If I have one conclusion from the experience within the last 12 months it is that the inadequacy, the stupidity and the wickedness of certain politicians has been matched very often by the dedication, the honour and the committedness to the weal of the country of our public servants. We have been very lucky in the last year to have public servants as good and as dedicated as they have shown themselves to be.  In fact, the vast majority of Budget work is their work.  There is nothing sudden about it, it is over a very long period.  At the best of times they present a number of alternatives to a Minister and he chooses in the light of political judgment and the exigencies of his own situation which of the options or alternatives he will endorse and present as his Budget.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to have a small print form of discussion on this Budget, especially coming late in the debate when many of the points I might make have in fact been made by others. I want to talk about the portion of Budget making which in fact rests with the Government.  That is the portion of the work which decides priorities, options and strategies because once that is done either by a political party <Col N="1568" /> or by a particular Minister belonging to that party, the realisation of the small print is in fact the work of the public servants and there is not that amount of choice.  It is a reflection of the existing level of the economy and it is a reflection of the social options that are laid down so that much of what I have to say about the Budget will in fact be rather general.</P>
    <P>Someone on the Government benches last year said that we were disappointed with last April's Budget because it was not severe enough and we in the Opposition were mocked because of that.  We made it completely clear last year, both Fine Gael and the Labour Party, that we saw inflation as the great issue.  We criticised the Budget because it was not sufficiently strong in dealing with that danger.  The increase in retail prices of one-tenth in one year is the fastest it has ever been and the fastest in any comparable country, leaving out Brazil and a few places like that or leaving out Germany in the immediate post-First War period.  This is the record of the period since the last Budget and this in fact vindicates our judgment.</P>
    <P>We criticised the central money-raising piece of policy in last year's Budget, the rise in turnover tax, the doubling of it.  This has been inflationary and we isolated inflation correctly as the great enemy.  Our criticism of the general strategy of the Government by apparently saying in last year's Budget that inflation was not very important was a correct criticism.  The Government were saying that and they were profoundly wrong.  The Opposition were totally right to seize on this as the central bait.  We in the Labour Party were not just right but politically courageous to have taken a position different from the traditional position of a Labour Party on an issue like this.  We were right and we were validated.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the successful management of an economy involves important decisions about timing.  The matter of timing last year by the Government was wrong.  I know the truth gets obscured in party political abuse but I think there are very few people, <Col N="1569" /> even on the Government benches, although they might not say so in public, who do not recognise that that was a mistaken approach to this looming inflation.  In fact last year's Budget was mistaken in its priorities and in its strategy.  I do not propose to spend a lot of time analysing the effects of that but they are reasonably obvious to everyone.</P>
    <P>Increase of prices of one-tenth in one year is a nationally serious thing. We are faced with the question of what ought to be the general strategy for this year.  In the end, of course, this comes to a matter of political judgment. You can have your mathematical models of economies.  As far as I am concerned I believe profoundly in using all of the modern mathematical techniques for measuring economies, making models of them and trying to get predictions from these models.  That is a valid and fruitful exercise but in the end, especially in a tiny little open economy like ours, the decision comes down to a political decision because it depends so much on many other countries.  We might as well be blunt about it.  It depends on political guesses, educated guesses if you like about what is going to happen in the world economies, and particularly in economies close to us over the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>It is my belief, and it is well I should put it on the record now, that for the second year in succession there has been a major error.  Last year's error was to fail to recognise the central importance of fighting inflation. I had better say briefly that the background to my belief is that I think significant markets will be faltering over the next 12 months and therefore the 3 per cent rise in output which the Minister for Finance spoke about is, in my view, a bit optimistic.  The American Government some time ago decided to abandon traditional American Republican Party big business policies.  We had the interesting spectacle of President Nixon declaring himself a Keynesian.  We have seen a somewhat reflationary Budget in Britain also more recently and physically closer to us.  I want to record the conviction that our need over the <Col N="1570" /> next 12 months will be to begin to reflate the econmy, to get more jobs and to get more investment, above all of a productive sort.  In fact, you cannot separate the jobs from the productive investment because the two things go together.</P>
    <P>This is what you might call a &ldquo;steady as she goes&rdquo; Budget, leaving things approximately as they were, rolling on as they were, on the assumption that the British and American economies were beginning to lift a bit, that the crisis would not blow up in Europe and that we would lift from 1½ per cent growth rate in the last financial year to 3 per cent this year and that if you keep everything steady it will come right.  I must say it is my conviction that this is a misjudgment again of the economic situation and that we need, in order to protect jobs and to protect investment so that we can take advantage of future opportunities, to reflate a bit even at the risk of inflation.  In other words, I think that the inflationary threat has receded a little, is vastly less dangerous than it was 12 months ago and its recession is the danger now.  Therefore, I want to record the conviction and offer it as a hostage that for the second time in 12 months the basic strategy of the Budget has been a mistaken one.</P>
    <P>I want to amplify this a little by talking about agriculture, which is an area where I have particular interest. Maybe we will get into the EEC, in which case there will certainly be much higher prices for dairy produce and for beef.  We have the good fortune to be livestock farmers and animal product sellers in a world where these things are in relative deficit.  Maybe we will not get in; but in regard to the prospects for milk and meat, for once, it does not matter because the British, in or out of the Community, have set about dismantling their traditional food policy.  The Tories, while they were in Opposition, promised to do that and now, in Government, they have started to do so.  The whole trend of the British policy is to let the consumer price of food rise, to phase out their large subsidies and to let the price at farm gate rise also.  In my <Col N="1571" /> view, that trend will continue.  The other factor that is new on this scene is that, in regard to many of these agricultural products, we are being treated across the whole spectrum as if we were members of the UK.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the prospects in Ireland for meat production and for dairy produce are good in terms of being able to shift increased volume at better prices, but that thought did not come out of a clear sky three weeks ago. Firstly, I have been saying this and, secondly, I have been acting on this basis for the past 18 months.  Eighteen months ago people were talking about a butter mountain inside the Community but if one looks carefully at the trends of cow numbers and of milk production, it will be seen that 18 months ago it was obvious that that mountain was disappearing.  If we had not been so busy bamboozling our farmers with the marvellous bonanza there would be within the Community we could have considered the real relationship between farm prices and farm costs in the Community and realised that Community farmers were getting out of milk as were British and American farmers.  This was obvious to me 18 months ago and I can validate this because I took decisions on this basis in regard to my own farm policies then.  Far from getting out of milk, that was a time to get into milk.  We now have the horrendous circumstances of lack of forethought, or, to be blunt, we have had stupidity and incompetence in regard to forward planning. The price of butter has never been as high on the British market as it is at present.  We have finished with the quota that has been strangling us for so many years, during which an amount of 12,000 tons was increased to 30,000 tons, but that was all.  Now, however, with the quota lifted, we could be increasing our market if we had the milk and, subsequently, the dairy produce.</P>
    <P>There is now the ridiculous situation whereby Bord Bainne are searching the country for milk because farmers got out of milk and into beef as a result of ridiculous policies.  If it was obvious to an amateur who is involved in a <Col N="1572" /> number of other activities that the butter mountain and the milk surplus would fade, surely it might have been obvious too to professional economists and to full time public servants whose work it is to follow these trends in a sophisticated way?  How could they have been so wrong in regard to milk production?  Their policy in that regard was a mistake and will have to be changed.  Although Deputy Blaney is no longer Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries there has been no indication of the courage needed to scrap the tiered milk price scheme except for a slight concession towards scrapping and a promise that it may be scrapped.</P>
    <P>In the documents accompanying this Budget there is the admission in regard to capital inputs that there has been a cut in investment in agriculture. That is a disastrous attitude at this time for the reasons I have mentioned&mdash; whether in the EEC or in the British Market, we have prospects of a bigger volume at higher prices and the obvious thing to do is to stage something of a boom in agricultural output. This talk of £100 million is tendentious and dishonest.  A lot of public money is spent in relation to agriculture and that gives to any Government who want leverage very great leverage in regard to the nature of production.  We have had so many changes of course in agricultural policy in regard to livestock that we do not have a good national herd in terms of milk production.  Indeed, the beef incentive scheme has been disimproving that residue of good dairy cows we possess.  Scientifically baseless, old fashioned, inaccurate and wrong thinking has been dominant in regard to the possibility of having good milk and good beef out of the same strain of animal.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to pursue this subject because it is more relevant to the Estimate for Agriculture but I shall resume this particular theme in another place.  However, that part of the Budget that relates to expenditure, that part which is in the power of the Minister to determine whether he will have a growth in production is relevant. There has been an extraordinary foolishness and inadequacy for which <Col N="1573" /> we will pay dearly in the future.  This is a time when we could be carving out increased market shares in Britain, when we could be increasing production at a fast rate and when we could be getting the sort of economy scale that would make us, pricewise, more competitive.  The whole thing about livestock production is that you cannot suddenly increase up the number of cows.  Even if the number of dairy heifers born is increased, if will be two years before they will calve and become, milkwise, productive.  We have already missed the perfectly predictable improvement in the market situation for our dairy produce.  This makes one wonder about the competence of the people who make the decisions.</P>
    <P>In his Budget speech, the Minister talked a good deal about the national pay agreement.  Before I finish my contribution, I shall revert to the whole question of the control of prices and incomes, but let me say from these benches that we are in favour of orderly and well organised wage bargaining. We are not in favour of a particular tiny grouping using the extraordinary leverage that a strategic position in the economy allows them to progress very rapidly when other sections who are less powerful in economic leverage are falling behind.  The labour movement&mdash; the Labour Party and Congress&mdash;have behaved in a disciplined, in an orderly and a responsible way in the matter of a potential wage explosion.  But what does one say to people when-they tell one that prices have increased by 10 per cent within a year?  On the basis that we are trying to be orderly and disciplined and that we are trying to look after the weakest sections of the community, we find ourselves pedding restraint in wages at a time when there is no restraint or no serious effort at restraint in prices.</P>
    <P>The reason for our existence as a party is to protect and defend in advance the interests of the working people.  On the basis of national interest and on the basis of arguing for this restraint, we could find ourselves trapped into doing the opposite.  Of course, we want orderly wage increases.  Of course, we want a situation whereby we do not price ourselves out of our markets and <Col N="1574" /> finish up worse off than we are.  But when you have the sort of confusion and vacillation that we had over the past 12 months, it is very difficult to ask people living on £15 a week to listen to these arguments because they no longer believe what they are told by official spokesmen about economic affairs.  It is not so long since Deputy Haughey switched on a crisis and then switched it off again.  That sort of use of the media, suddenly to cry &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; and then pretend it is all right, makes the population at large profoundly sceptical of the sort of exhortation that is sometimes necessary in regard to an orderly process of wage increases.  Then, we had the magnificent spectacle last autumn of legislation in regard to prices and incomes, great resolute growling that this freeze would be protected and was not negotiable.  Thrilling stuff if everybody believed it.  Of course, they did not believe it because they remembered not too long before the crisis being switched on and switched off again.</P>
    <P>Then it was negotiated a little bit and then abandoned entirely.  That sort of action is a green light to any small section or group of people who have special leverage because they say to themselves: &ldquo;They say they will not give in to us but on these two examples, all you have to do is give them a kick in the shins and they will crumble.&rdquo;  Then we had the ridiculous comic opera of the dole a few weeks ago, the third example in a very short period of this sort of reversal.  That lack of steadiness, confidence and solidity in the running of the economy is, in fact, a certain mechanism calling on indicipline in regard to pursuing wage demands.  No doubt we shall hear, as we hear all the time, great abuse from the Government of one or other section of workers who, because they have considerable leverage in a particular business or particular section of the economy, use that leverage to gain more rapid or larger wage increases than comparable workers in other areas.</P>
    <P>But who is calling them on to that action?  In the last 12 months it has been the Government.  That leads me to refer to the matter of the reduction <Col N="1575" />&mdash;we are talking about rapid changes in direction&mdash;to two-thirds rate on the first £100 of income tax.  At the end of April, 1970, when the Taoiseach was presenting the Budget speech for Deputy Haughey he said that income tax on the first £100 would be charged at two-thirds of the standard rate.  Then he said, and I quote from the Budget speech of April, 1970, as read by the Taoiseach:</P>
    <P>The principal objective of the relief is to introduce an enhanced measure of graduation into the system of taxation.</P>
    <P>That is something we in the Labour Party believe in, something we uphold and applaud.  All the usual, simple, eulogising noises were made by Fianna Fáil contributors to the Budget debate.  I shall not quote them all but in order to get the flavour I shall quote a few of them.  Deputy O'Malley, in volume 246, column 209, said:</P>
    <P>Our Minister for Finance ... gave substantial reliefs in income to lower paid workers, to the people who needed those reliefs most.</P>
    <P>He was right; they did need those reliefs most.  Later on at column 211 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>We get much welcomed and badly needed reliefs in income tax for lower paid workers;</P>
    <P>That was in April, 1970.  Deputy Dowling said the same thing at column 526 of the same volume.  Talking about the tax reductions to lower income groups he said:</P>
    <P>In the main, these make due allowance in the case of the lower income group for the increases in the price of foodstuffs and other commodities affected.</P>
    <P>He was saving in effect: &ldquo;This balances out the 2½ per cent increase in turnover tax for the lower income group.&rdquo;  That was fine; that was 12 months ago but when somebody shouts: &ldquo;Roll over,&rdquo; they all roll over because this year that relief is abolished.  That abolition affects approximately 600,000 taxpayers. There was great play in the Minister's speech about a tax relief that affected 20,000 taxpayers.  Twelve months later <Col N="1576" /> a relief is taken away that affects every taxpayer.  The arguments that were good 12 months ago are still good.  We believe in graduated income tax.  We believe in relief for the poorest, especially when their costs have risen by one tenth in the ensuing 12 months.  We believe in a steeply rising slope of tax or in the Taoiseach's words: &ldquo;... an enhanced measure of graduation.&rdquo;  We believe in that.</P>
    <P>But last year people were asked to accept a 2½ per cent increase in turnover tax.  It applied to food which is such an enormous part of the budget of the poor as well as to luxuries.  It therefore bore hardest on the poorest. Solemnly, from Government benches, it was said: &ldquo;Accept that because now you have relief on your first £100 which will compensate you for it.&rdquo; That was for 12 months until there was a change of Minister.  What one had given, 12 months later somebody else took away.  The arguments of 12 months earlier were suddenly not arguments and all those who had eulogised the giving of the relief in 1970 equally eulogised the 1971 Budget which took it away again and they all voted to take away what they had given 12 months before.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of ridiculous change of direction, possibly from simple political pique, that again is a green light to every section of the community to &ldquo;have a go&rdquo; because, they will argue, when the Government introduce a regulation glaring into the eye of the television camera and saying it is not negotiable: &ldquo;If we make a loud noise, they will immediately climb down&rdquo;.  That is the conclusion from all the events, from the crisis-no-crisis broadcast by Deputy Haughey up to this latest reversal in regard to cash allowances.  That is the conclusion: it is the Government who are calling on indiscipline in the ranks of people who are seeking wage rises.  It will not stop the Government screaming about it but it is their responsibility nonetheless.</P>
    <P>As there was 12 months ago, there is again, in a slightly more developed form, mention of a Department of Public Services.  I welcomed this 12 months ago.  I want to welcome it again now and urge that reforms in <Col N="1577" /> the public service be implemented as a matter of urgency.  I paid a compliment at the outset&mdash;it was a sincere one&mdash;to the quality of the personnel of our public service but, in fact, its structure is British, unreformed since before the first world war and that structure is crucifying many of the personnel to whom I think I paid a just tribute.</P>
    <P>If we are so intent on entering Europe &ldquo;without reservations&rdquo; to use the phrase of the Minister for Foreign Affairs I hope in the reform of the public service we will look beyond the British system to the systems of other European countries.  It is arguable that a great deal more open public service in the contemporary world is advantageous, that a great deal freer exchange between businesses, universities and the public service is also advantageous. If we get in, which is about even money in my view, we shall find ourselves trying to interpret the vast amount of small print that has been pouring out of Brussels, Rome and everywhere else during the past 14 years or so, to the advantage of our own population for the ultimate possible protection.  We shall find ourselves dealing with very blunt, tough, ruthless, confident public servants from other countries and the Brussels Commission.  We need all the protection we can get from a restrucing of our public service which will release the creative energies of very many civil servants and, indeed, of others who can usefully, for short periods, act as civil servants in a way that they are not now being released.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that last year's growth was 1½ per cent and this year's was planned to be 3 per cent.  Perhaps &ldquo;planned&rdquo; is the wrong word&mdash;&ldquo;estimated&rdquo; is the right word&mdash;because we do not have any planning as Deputy FitzGerald pointed out well in his contribution to this debate; the feeble efforts of planning of a few years ago have become unfashionable again and there is no serious mention of planning in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>There is a school of thought in the United States which is questioning this dedication to growth which has preoccupied economists all over the world for a number of decades.  In the circumstances <Col N="1578" /> of the United States and in the circumstances of a country like Sweden a very good question to ask is: Why growth?  Growth for what?  Merely to increase production by the year without a concomitant increase in the quality of life is self-defeating.  Doubts about growth are, perhaps, relevant to the United States but, in fact, they are not relevant for us at all.</P>
    <P>If one makes some Community comparisons, leaving Luxembourg out, with the other nine member countries we are much the smallest economy.  The next smallest in terms of gross national product, Norway, is three times bigger. We are three times smaller than Norway in our weight in the scales economically in terms of GNP.  We are tiny. We are also sluggish.  We have been growing less rapidly.  We are falling behind as well as starting from a much lower baseline.  We have had the cheerful pretence over the years of our negotiations that we were a developed economy but we are not a developed economy as we shall find out in a most ruthless way if we do get into the Community.  We shall also find out the drawbacks of pretending to be developed in circumstances where we were not.  It may be a striking posture to declare the country developed for the sake of negotiations but we need to have rapid economic growth so that we will come within some sort of striking distance of the standards of living and the levels of output of those with whom we are in the process, if the Government are successful, of forming an economic, monetary and ultimate political unity.</P>
    <P>The OECD document this year, which may have influenced the Government in drawing up the Budget, urged caution in the policies in regard to the management of demand.  If one could paraphrase it very briefly it urged us to forgo growth for the sake of stability.  My own conviction is that in regard to Ireland's interest as distinct from the interests of distant economists this is a wrong conclusion and, in fact, as I said earlier, in regard to general strategy, last year was the year we should have been fighting inflation and this is the year we should <Col N="1579" /> be going for more growth even at the risk of inflationary pressures.  My belief is that the acute inflationary pressure is, in fact, over.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss what one might call the small print which comes near the end of the Budget but I feel one is entitled to criticise the general strategy.  The general strategy, if one can paraphrase it, making due allowance for some of the perceptive and humane things which are undoubtedly contained in this Budget, is to keep things approximately as they are, to keep the options open, to move to a tax system which will fit us for joining the EEC and to move to a general economic atmosphere which will also fit us for the EEC.</P>
    <P>The economic atmosphere of the European Community is that the regulation of the economy and the general attitudes of economists in government in the formulation of policies is of a sort of <i>laissez faire</i> capitalism of before the first world war.  Keynes might just as well not have existed, the whole development of welfare societies such as Scandinavia and elsewhere, the whole experience of the &ldquo;new deal&rdquo; in the United States might as well not have existed and in regard to certain progressive attitudes in relation to social legislation and in regard to the management of the economy they are extremely conservative, extremely right wing and extremely determined that the market place shall rule and that a mixed economy, a strong public sector with major public intervention is not the way they see the Community evolving.  This is true even though there are States in the Community with a very powerful and successful public sector.  Italy with the IRI is a case that comes to mind most easily where the system of a mixed economy has worked very well and has produced industrial development in areas where private business would certainly have not done so.  Our Government are moving away from that.  We had a mixed economy in the thirties under Fianna Fáil and many of the industries which now exist would not have existed if left to private capitalists.  We in the Labour Party have always applauded <Col N="1580" /> those initiatives on the part of the Government and we are sad to see them weakening.  But within the general framework of a movement towards a European taxation system and a movement towards European <i>laissez faire</i> economic philosophy, all we have got is the mixture as before: a simple, short-term response to what is long-term, complex planning.  There is no strategy.  There is no planning.  There is no social vision.  There is no determination to use this great annual instrument in regard to the way in which moneys will be raised and spent so as to change the nature of society. It is simply an exercise in conservative bookkeeping.</P>
    <P>This is the great criticism I have of the Budget and I should like now to adumbrate the sort of alternate strategy I believe our budgeting calls for. It is, of course, perfectly easy for a socialist to say that there is no cure for our problems except socialism.  In fact, I believe this to be true, but it is often unhelpful from the point of view of what one ought to do at a particular time and in a particular place.  It is an easy solution, but it sometimes does not help very much in a real situation. We are fast reaching the point at which we can no longer continue to go on in the way in which we have been going. I do not think the equilibrium evolved in the last decade will remain.  We are becoming less competitive for reasons of skill.  We are becoming very dependent on foreign investment.  We are becoming very dependent on exports for the products of these foreign factories, rather narrowly based products.  We have not developed exports based on agriculture and natural resources, exports which would be a protection for us.  Whilst we are getting into this relatively defenceless position we are at the same time steadily liberalising trade. The half-way point in dismantling tariffs was reached last year.</P>
    <P>Many people look on our joining Europe as a panacea.  Ours is a tiny, open, uncompetitive economy and the danger of pressures from external dynamic industry is very great indeed to our level of employment, our population and the scale of our national economy. We cannot continue as we have <Col N="1581" /> been doing.  We can for a year or so, but not indefinitely.  If the negotiations to enter the Community are successful in the next month or so the problem, from the Government's point of view, will be solved because all the economic decisions will be transferred to Brussels. It will take a decade, but that is where the decisions will ultimately be taken.  We will have our parities frozen. Economic decisions will not be taken here.  This will be good for farmers above a certain size, but it will be disastrous for others.  It will be good for certain industries and disastrous for others.  It will not be conducive to growth in industry.  It will not be conducive to the nation as a whole, but the two major political parties are bent upon this course and nothing this party can do will alter the voting.</P>
    <P>I said before that one can cure a cold by jumping off the roof of a high building; that stops the cold and it also stops the traffic.  Entering the Community without reservations and without protection will not solve our economic problems in terms of a dynamic industry and a growing population.  As I say, the decisions will not be taken here.  They will be shuffled off on others.  If we do not go in we need a totally different perspective.  If, as I would wish, we get a trade agreement with the Community, without full membership, we will need that new perspective also.  If Britain's application collapses we will certainly need a perspective in regard to Budget policy.</P>
    <P>I should like now to outline this briefly.  We have seen the dollar crisis in the last week.  This proves to me our need for a separate currency with a real control of that currency.  To be tied to sterling is a liability now. A small economy must protect itself against the sort of swings in money around the world.  We should have sovereignty over our money.  As well as being desirable on broad, general, republican principles, it is also in the national interest.  It is a practical necessity now.  Deputy Donegan talked about savings and the rate of interest.  We are borrowing overseas and we are faced with the prospect of both our industry and our agriculture being strangled by a high interest rate.  This has nothing to do with the <Col N="1582" /> supply of money or the availability of money in the Irish economy.  It has to do with the state of the American economy.</P>
    <P>If we had our own currency we could dam up our natural accumulation and determine interest rates by our own needs and the availability of our own capital.  Very small countries have taken this course.  It would be vastly easier to raise money internally. We go abroad now and borrow at high interest rates and one-fifth of our Capital Budget goes servicing debt. The capital accumulation as a result of Irish economic activity ought to be available to the Government.  In actual fact it flows out and the Government have to borrow at high interest rates, rates dictated by the situation in the United States of America. We have every reason to implement a monetary policy which will establish our control over our own money system.  We should use the Budget to establish this control.  We need both a protective and a defensive attitude towards industry and employment. There is this uncertainty about Europe. It must be clear to people who a year or six months ago were not making even contingency plans for the collapse of our negotiations.  The position they took was that if we got in, everything would be solved, and they fed the people on that&mdash;that we were certain to get in so there was no need to develop alternatives.</P>
    <P>The point is that we needed a defensive posture in a tiny open economy like ours.  That was the posture of Fianna Fáil policy in the 1930s.  It is the posture of a strong public sector. What exists now and what did not exist in the thirties is sophisticated planning.  The policy in the thirties had to deal with a world slump but it had not to deal with a factor which is in existence today&mdash;modern techniques of planning.  Instead of no planning, which is the situation in this year's Budget, what we want to see is greater strength in planning, the working out of detailed plans, the allocation of resources in a mixed economy.</P>
    <P>The great defect of this Budget is that there is no plan in it, no use of the various large resources that the Government <Col N="1583" /> possess in order to regulate the economy.  There is a continuing need for wealth transfer.  I have already quoted what the Taoiseach had to say last year about enhanced graduation in the taxation system.  I have quoted what the Minister for Justice said about substantial reliefs for lower paid workers.  We agree with those sentiments. It is a pity they have been abandoned.  It is a pity that the change in the income tax system means that the workers will bear substantially the same amount of increased taxation because of the withdrawal of the £100 reduced rate allowance.  That imposes the same amount of increased taxation substantially on everybody, regardless of whether they have £6,000 a year or £750 a year.</P>
    <P>That is the exact opposite to the enhanced graduation the Taoiseach seemed to think was a good thing last year and which we still think is a good thing.  We think the Budget should be used for wealth transfer from the rich to the poor.  The intent of this Budget is the opposite.  We believe that the objective of taxation policy should be to produce the situation envisaged by a Danish social reformer years ago who spoke about a society where nobody would have too little and nobody too much.  We do not see that sort of taxation policy.  We see an extreme right wing, a be-nice-to-the-richest policy, again of the most stupid kind because it means be-nice-to-the-richest in incomes but it does not mean increased industrial investment.</P>
    <P>We do not see in this year's Budget a removal of last year's taxation on companies and it is serious that we are getting stagnation of investment.  If we do not get investment now of a positive kind we will not get job growth or growth in industrial prosperity which would enable us to take advantage of the favourable things in the community. Instead of increasing the growth of industry, the effect of our taxation is to diminish it on incomes but it is also having the effect of continuing encouragement of non-productive investment. So this is not a rich man's Budget in terms of getting progress.  As I have said, we would look for a Budget <Col N="1584" /> strategy of wealth transfer.  Above all, we need a strategy that will get a bit of growth going.</P>
    <P>I spent a little time at the beginning examining the effects of our policy in regard to dairying produce.  They can also be applied in the industrial area. We now have punitive taxation of companies which takes away the reserves that ought to be conserved for growth of production and growth of jobs.  That is taking the OECD recommendations too seriously.  It is sacrificing growth and this is not what the current situation in Ireland calls for.  If we promote growth now we may get our costs better and we may get a more competitive situation.  The argument against this is that it would be inflationary, that it might put prices up. We import our inflation anyway, so much of our prices being determined by the price of imported goods. Reflationary activities here would have much less effect on cost increases than they would in America, a totally closed economy.</P>
    <P>There has been talk of grasping nettles during the last 12 months.  It has become a sacred metaphor.  I speak about a policy on prices and incomes. Of course, such a policy is necessary. The anarchy that prevails in a number of societies at the moment is bad for everybody.  The efforts made by a number of countries in the last decade in many cases have collapsed.  Some of the early pioneers, like the Dutch, have thrown their hats at it and given it up, but the problem exists and the need to try to explore methods to control the growth of prices and incomes persists. People will have to go on trying until this problem is solved.</P>
    <P>As socialists, we have no reservations in principle about the rightness of controlling all of these things in a planned way.  What we will not have is control which is not even the control of incomes but just the control of wages, the control of the incomes of the poorest while other incomes and prices are not controlled.  We have no objection to the whole package.  We say it is necessary in a small, weak, open economy like ours.  But it is depressing that there is not a much more powerful section in this Budget.  There is <Col N="1585" /> promise of price control.  There is price control machinery but it has not been used.  In the prevailing political mood of rushing to the right it may not seem desirable to Ministers.  In my view decisions in regard to prices which the owners of industries may dislike very much indeed must be taken&mdash;public decisions made by the Government of a country exercising their democratic rights over the activities of individual companies.</P>
    <P>We would like to see a real policy for prices and incomes which would take the anarchy out of the current situation and which would also result in the sort of wealth transfer which should be the objective of taxation policy.  Those are some of the things in terms of strategy that are missing from the current Budget.  There is no serious planning.  There is no serious effort at wealth transfer.  In fact it is the opposite: inequalities are being increased.  There is no serious effort at protecting us from fluctuations in the world money situation.  There is no serious effort at getting growth.  There is no serious effort at regional planning or sophisticated planning of any kind in the direction of investment.  There is no serious effort at a prices and incomes policy.  All of these desperate omissions are made at a crucial time in the economic life of the nation, whether the EEC negotiations succeed or fail.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this Budget signifies an absence of budgeting, an absence of policy, a simple totting up of proposed expenditure: you do a sum to find out what is the necessary extra income and then you think up a taxation system to raise that income; then you dress up the pill with a few charitable and humane bits of sugar-coating, and that is it.  In fact this is the abnegation of policy, the abnegation of politics.  It is not enough simply to leave it to public servants, because public servants are quite scrupulous when they put up alternatives; they will stand back from the political judgement which has to be taken by the politician.  Public servants can produce a package of any kind, but somebody has to say resolutely what kind of package it is to be.</P>
    <P>There has been no such instruction, no financial policy.  We are just tottering <Col N="1586" /> on and hoping that our accession to the EEC will save us from the need for a decision on the matter.  There is an expression in the Budget of the pitiful indecision, weakness and, at times, downright stupidity and incompetence which we know from other sources characterise this Government.</P>

      <P>In any proposed expenditure of moneys, whether this occurs in one's own home or in an organisation to which one belongs, it is inevitable that there will be certain disagreements as to how money will be most beneficially expended.  In regard to the proposals which the Minister for Finance has placed before this House as to how the finances of the country are to be managed it is likewise inevitable that he will be criticised, from all sides of the House, for omissions and inadequacies. Some criticisms will be logical; others will be emotional, and motivating others still will be an element we usually find in politics, popular appeal.</P>

    <P>Any Minister who is responsible for handling the nation's purse and who approaches that in a responsible fashion realises that there is a day of reckoning, a year of reckoning.  He is given little room for wrong manoeuvre. Accordingly, any Minister for Finance has my sympathy.  I must say I am quite happy with the proposals presented <Col N="1587" /> by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, although I shall refer presently to one or two omissions as far as I am concerned.  It is very easy for us to indulge in political philosophising and to describe ourselves in certain political terms.  If I were convinced that under the umbrella of socialism I could cure or help to cure the ills of this nation, then I should readily seek such an umbrella.</P>
    <P>However, as I see it, you do not solve ills by giving to yourself any special name.  You do not correct or cure the frailties of human nature by suggesting that you are a socialist, a republican, a communist or any other type of &ldquo;ist&rdquo;.  Perhaps what is lacking all round is that too many of us seek the solution of our problems&mdash;in certain cases problems to which wittingly or unwittingly we may have contributed by omission or with full knowledge&mdash;by taking refuge in the expression of some &ldquo;ism&rdquo; as justification for our faults.  My &ldquo;ism&rdquo; is that I can see no family or no collection of families operating on any system other than one of reward based on a certain effort.  I do not see any community operating or progressing on any system that suggests that people can have a reward without an effort.  However, I am mindful of the fact that there are people who for one reason or another are not blessed with the facilities or the abilities to apply certain effort and therefore there is an onus on those of us who enjoy better talents to look after those people properly and adequately, not to look after them as people who are entitled to a national minimum but as people who would be prepared to contribute to the standard of living which we enjoy except for the fact that some physical or mental disability retards them.</P>
    <P>Having said that I should just like to refer to what has been called &ldquo;the dole question&rdquo;.  I believe that unless every Deputy says what he thinks, says what he believes to be the thoughts of the people in his constituency, he is doing a disservice to them and to the House. As a Dublin Deputy I am not unmindful of the situation which exists in my constituency in which you have certain <Col N="1588" /> people who are prepared to overcome the natural and understandable reluctance which perhaps we all have towards work; where you have people prepared to make sacrifices in order to contribute to the development and welfare of the State.  If those people see others who, although they are blessed with the same talents, are not prepared to make the same effort, if they see people who can stay in bed until 11 o'clock in the morning while they must rise at 7 a.m., if they see such people enjoying what might be called the same luxuries as they enjoy &mdash;attendance at sports meetings and at places of amusement&mdash;it is not surprising that they should experience a feeling of frustration.  They are not going to be exhorted to make the effort which brings to them a reward which is identical to that which those who do not make the effort also get.  We should, therefore, be careful to avoid such circumstances.</P>
    <P>In my constituency a company have been engaged on the reconstruction of a road.  This work was supposed to take only 12 months but it has now extended to over two years, much to the frustration and annoyance of people in the area.  I was asked to meet the corporation and the contractor with a view to getting the work completed.  When I spoke to the engineer on the site he told me that if I could go to the labour exchange and have able-bodied men sent out to him he would have the road finished quickly.  It was no pleasure to him, he said, to have the work dragging on.  Subsequently I asked a question in this House about the number of able-bodied men in receipt of assistance and the number went into thousands.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned with people in receipt of assistance who are unable to work.  I am excluding people who for one reason or another have lost the hunger for work, perhaps because they have been out of employment for a long period.  I am concerned, however, with able-bodied men who register as being prepared and anxious to work and who are in receipt of money which is being paid to them by their neighbour and who, when work is presented to them, are able to escape the responsibility placed upon them.  I know of <Col N="1589" /> course that tomorrow or during the week the finger will be pointed at me and I will be accused of having attacked people who are drawing unemployment assistance.  In anticipation of such an attack I say now that that is not what I am doing.  I am criticising the person who is fit and who has the ability to work but who is not prepared to work and who at the same time is taking money which I should like to see being spent on the person who is genuinely unfit.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to help widows.  I am sure I speak for every Deputy when I say that we would welcome the expenditure by the Minister of all the funds he has on helping widows and their children.  I hope that soon a scheme will be introduced which will differ from the one we have.  I hope that every worker&mdash;and by that word I mean everybody in the community, whether he earns his livelihood by his hands or his head or a combination of both&mdash;during his lifetime will make a contribution related to his total earnings and having regard to the standard of living which he, his wife and children enjoy so that if and when he is taken from them his widow and children will at least enjoy a standard of living comparable to that which they enjoyed during his lifetime.</P>
    <P>It is very tragic that the wife of a man in the middle income group who has been enjoying a reasonable high standard of living should find herself after her husband dies&mdash;and we do not have to dwell on how the tragedy affects the wife and children &mdash;forced within a short time to adopt a standard of living to which she has been unaccustomed and forced to remain at that level until such time as the children can go out to work.  This may mean a period of several years. Some of the children may be attending secondary schools.  Some may be attending university.  In quite a few cases, but not all, such children are obliged to forgo the education they had hoped for.  At the moment our resources are not able to pay the pensions which we would like to see being paid.  Legislation should be brought in to deal with the man who, during his <Col N="1590" /> lifetime, is not doing his duty towards his wife and his family and who is not providing for them.  Some men who spend their money in foolish fashion should be forced to devote that money to something which would be useful to their wives and families after their death and which would make them less of a liability on their neighbours.</P>
    <P>I had intended when referring to this magic word &ldquo;socialism&rdquo; to ask other Deputies to ponder for a moment and to ask themselves how honest and serious they are.  I was impressed by Deputy Keating's contribution.  The thought crossed my mind that he and I, and many other Deputies in this House, have been fortunate in that the rest of the community have co-operated with us in developing whatever talents we have and have allowed us to benefit from an education which they themselves were not able to have. A certain amount of money has been extracted and we have been educated. Deputy Keating is a veterinary surgeon and I am a teacher.  I have thought of how we could demonstrate in return our gratitude to those people who helped us.  If we were really sincere about our fellowmen perhaps Deputy Keating, other Deputies and I should get together and work out a system as to how we could make our services available at a cheaper rate to those people who have made our professions possible for us.  The same thing would apply to the legal and other professions.</P>
    <P>We are all socialist in our readiness and our ability to indicate what other people have and how it should best be divided among those who have less. Those of us who are professional people can try to find a theoretical solution&mdash;Deputy Keating as a veterinary surgeon, Deputy Tunney as a teacher, another Deputy as a doctor and another Deputy as a lawyer&mdash;until such time as we are prepared to work and agitate within our own professions and to convince our members that we owe something to the community and that the best way we can indicate our gratitude is by making that which they have made possible for us available to them at a cheaper rate.  Then we can all say that we are practising Christianity <Col N="1591" /> and I would hope that, having given the lead, we could expect other people to follow.  As long as Deputy Keating and I make a case for retaining all that we have in excess of that which we require there is not much point in our suggesting to our neighbour who has less than we have that he should be prepared to share his lesser excess with those who have still less while we proceed to do little except talk about our ideal, being still unprepared to practise that Christianity which is required.</P>
    <P>I see on television occasionally doctors who indicate their concern about socialism, their concern about a system that allows certain things to happen, their concern about a situation where a mother, a father or a child is unable to get attention.  I can only speak about how things affect myself but I would not go on television and make utterances, unless I could say that as a doctor I had gone to these people myself and given them the service which they required and given it for nothing.  Unless I could say that I would not ask my fellow doctors or the community at large to do it.  I do not think there will ever be an absolute solution because we know that the very nature of man is that, having satisfied one need, a new demand arises.  I admit looking around that there is a need for taking from those who have and giving a little more to those who have not, but this will not be achieved by writing or talking about it.  If it is to be achieved at all it will be achieved by good example and by deeds.</P>
    <P>Whenever I am in doubt as to where I might go or how I might think, invariably I search for an Irish proverb. There is one which says: &ldquo;Bíonn gach duine lách go dtéann an bhó ina gharraí féin.&rdquo;  We all have great understanding and great sympathy until the beast trespasses in our garden.  We might think well about that and, having thought about it, we might be less critical of others and more prepared to change our own faltering ways.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the much discussed and very important field of labour relations.  I wonder at times, <Col N="1592" /> when I read about seminars here and there and management-labour relationships, whether the solution of the problem will be found at that level.  In this field, while I might on other occasions be critical of the trade union movement, I see in certain cases with which I am familiar, the blame lying with the management, not in all cases but in quite a few.  I am thinking of the bigger type of company.  Here I am not thinking of companies which have a long, respected and respectable tradition in Ireland.  I am thinking of certain companies which have risen up here in the last 20 years, companies which have been assisted from public moneys but which, I think, retain the old colonial approach that those who work, especially those who work on machines or in areas outside offices, are people who are entitled at the end of the week to a certain pay packet but are entitled to little else.  They are not looked upon as being entitled to any information about how the company is progressing.  They are only consulted when the company is, in the opinion of management, in financial difficulties.  I am not saying this is general, but it is happening.</P>
    <P>In these companies there does not seem to be regard for the fact that the most humble man in that company has, in his own way, that same feeling of importance as the man who directs.  His horizon might not be as wide as the man at the top but in his own world he feels that he has something to offer. That type of man is not getting the recognition he deserves.  He becomes important in that type of company only when something goes wrong.  It is never suggested to that man that he is playing an important role in the company. It is felt that all the obligations which the company have towards him and towards many others like him end with the handing over of a pay packet. Whether his wife is ill, whether she has died, whether she has given birth to twins, all of which are tremendous happenings in the life of that man, those who are in charge could not care less.  Their responsibility to him ends with the handing over of the pay packet.</P>
    <P>This is where I see what they call human relations breaking down.  This <Col N="1593" /> is where I see the reluctance on the part of the workers to put their shoulders to the wheel if and when such a company finds itself in adversity because there has not been that recognition of the vital part which the worker plays in the company.  I see no reason why companies should not, at the end of the financial year, make available to all their workers a statement as to their financial position.  It will be admitted that it is outside the competence of the ordinary man to interpret the financial statement that is produced.  Invariably this leads to certain suspicions on his part that the company are enjoying excessive profits which they are salting away for some reason of their own, to his disadvantage. It should be incumbent on companies to make available to their workers a simple statement on their position.  I have no doubt that if this were done, if and when the companies found themselves in financial difficulties, the workers would respond.  In companies where the directors are already well paid and where a director can bring in his car and have it serviced, washed and tidied up for him every second day by staff employed in the company who might more correctly be looking after company lorries and where at the same time, if a worker's bicycle is punctured he is not allowed to mend it during working hours, it is inevitable that relations will not be the best.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I should like to refer to a body of men for whom I have a very high regard and to express my disappointment that as of now there is no provision for a State pension for their widows in the event of their death.  I refer to Army personnel, NCOs and men.  Recently I asked the Minister for Defence to consider giving the same consideration to the widows of Army personnel as is given to the widows of former State servants. The answer I received was to the effect that since Army NCOs and men have been classed as contributory workers since 1968, the introduction of such a scheme was not contemplated.  I am at at a loss to understand why that should be the case since other State servants can avail of a contributory pension. <Col N="1594" /> The country owes it to our soldiers to give them the same consideration in the matter of these pensions as is given to other State servants.</P>
    <P>The final point to which I want to refer is again in the field of the transfer of wealth.  I have not done any great research on this point and consequently I can only throw it out as a rather general point.  In the city and county of Dublin at the moment there is a certain group of people who can be described as developers.  As I see it, such people are necessary in our community. On the other hand, they are engaged in a field which has been extremely remunerative in the past. They submit certain proposals to the local authorities.  In Dublin Corporation we have a rather large, well-qualified and professional staff dealing full-time with planning applications.  I realise that they deal with applications in respect of additional rooms or garages or minor improvements to houses.  While so engaged they are doing excellent work, but the bulk of their time is devoted to what might be classified as major projects.</P>
    <P>An application is made and after eight weeks the local authority must indicate whether the application has been approved.  Let us assume that it has been approved.  A certain amount of time and expertise has been devoted to adjudicating upon that application. If it is rejected the applicant has the right of appeal to the Department of Local Government where again professional people and clerical people are called upon to adjudicate upon it. Without further ado I will now mention the point I should have made more quickly.  I see here an area where the State should be collecting money. These applicants should have to pay a fee.  I do not think it would take any great skill to devise some scheme. In cases where these operations will bring thousands of pounds to the applicants and where they are paid for out of the taxpayer's money it is only correct&mdash;and this would bring about the transfer of wealth&mdash;that they should be obliged to pay what I suggest should be a rather hefty fee.</P>

      <P>In speaking <Col N="1595" /> on this Budget I should like to discuss the background to what the Minister faced when he was introducing his budgetary proposals.  In fairness to him one must admit that he did not face a particularly easy situation.  Of course for that situation he shares collective responsibility as a member of a Fianna Fáil Government.  Legislation passed here by his Government has been responsible for creating a very undesirable economic situation.  When he was framing his Budget he had to frame it against the background of an adverse balance of trade, an adverse balance of payments, inflation, lack of capital, failure of the programme of economic expansion, industrial unrest and a deterioration in the return on our invisible assets.  These factors and the difficulties the Minister faced were realised, and he was given a good deal of advice by economists, financiers and other people.  I am not very enamoured of economists because nearly always their forecasts turn out to be wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case they seem to have been on a winner. The Minister received definite advice from two sources and he should have taken heed of their advice.  One source was the Central Bank and the other was the OECD.  We are members of the OECD.  It is an organisation which takes an overall view of the economic situation, with particular emphasis on the member countries concerned.  Without doubt, the advice the Minister received from the OECD listed all the points I have mentioned as being detrimental to our economy.</P>
      <P>The OECD indicated to the Minister that it would be no harm for him to budget for a surplus.  It was politically impossible for the Minister to do that, having regard to the divided state of the Government.  In the uncertain political situation that exists the Government are not sure if they will be able to carry on other than on a day-to-day basis.  Therefore, they were not in a position to budget with a view to continuing in government until the end of the statutory period of five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> The Minister found that he had to budget for the situation that his Leader might be forced to go to the country rather than be defeated in the Dáil. That is the background to the Budget and nobody should doubt it.  I am of a kindly nature and I am not blaming the Minister for that but he shares collective responsibility for what happened. His predecessors&mdash;all of them Fianna Fáil members&mdash; helped to increase inflation here.  One need only look at the various measures that were introduced; turnover tax, wholesale tax and the heavy taxation that has been imposed as a result of economic advice. The trouble is that economic advisers give advice from the day to day economic point of view.  That is why I am not keen on the advice given by economists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

      <P>Economists are not in a position to assess facts other than from day to day but a duty lies with parliamentarians and politicians to see that the situation is handled as it should be handled politically. Apart from his collective responsibility, the present Minister for Finance inherited the rather sticky end of the situation due to the mismanagement of his predecessors.  It should not be forgotten that the Budget was framed in the background of the political difficulties that exist in government circles.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I regard this Budget as a clever one from the political point of view, to the extent that it does not annoy anyone.  My criticism is that economically the situation is not good and all Deputies must realise this.  Something should have been done to rectify the situation.  I should like to make several suggestions in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have a majority in this House&mdash;at least we believe this to be the case, although I see some of my colleagues opposite looking rather doubtful about it.  During the last general election campaign they tramped <Col N="1597" /> up and down the country and asked for a majority in order to have a strong Government.  We face a difficult situation from the economic point of view and I do not think anyone will deny that.  In addition, there is industrial unrest.  We are short of capital.  Our economic advance is 1½ per cent.  That is putting the best complexion on it. Most of that is invisible assets.  Our cattle population has been static practically throughout the whole of this century and is now very slowly rising.  This is the first time this has happened since the Fianna Fáil Government returned to power.  Our economy depends on our cattle population and, were it not that at the moment cattle prices are good and the British went through a very severe attack of foot-and-mouth disease and the demand for cattle is good, our economic situation would be very much worse than it is.</P>
    <P>This economy depends on the export of cattle and the sale of cattle. If the Fianna Fáil Government have anything to offer for that, it is something very small.  Our cattle population has only gone up in the neighbourhood of 5,000, which is minimal.  Our industrial exports, on which we hope to build up a strong economy in association with agriculture, are minimal for the simple reason that we are being priced out of most of the markets by the high cost of production and we are not even competitive with our main trading partner, the United Kingdom, which, by the trade agreement of 1965, we are bound to hand and foot.  We are at a disadvantage with them.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste came in here and gave a long diatribe about the strength of our economy and so forth but he produced no argument to show that our economy is sound, that we are competitive with other countries. Therein lies the whole weakness of our trading position at the moment. We have on top of that an ever-growing load of taxation.  In the Budget each year the sum for the servicing of our loans grows greater year by year.  I think it costs somewhere in the neighbourhood of £91 million a year to service our loans.  That is the sum the taxpayers of this country have to produce to service the national <Col N="1598" /> debt.  We float loans continuously every year, not only at home but abroad as well, at a high rate of interest to encourage people to invest here.  Will we ever have a Minister for Finance whose advisers will produce some scheme for him whereby we can encourage the inflow of capital here?</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom economy at the moment is not in a very happy state but at least they have an inflow of capital available to them because they budgeted for that purpose.  The only inflow of capital we have here is borrowed money.  When we float loans Deputies from different sides of the House get up and say that they agree with the particular loan as the purpose of it is for the expansion of schools and so on.  We would not have to float loans if we had any policy for inducing the inflow of capital here.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom have also a system whereby certain investments, that is money invested in the United Kingdom from overseas investors, are payable to those people at a good rate of interest and this is entirely free from estate duty.  That is the secret of our failure to induce capital into the country.  We have never done anything here to deal with the estate duty problem. Last year the yield from estate duty was greater than that in the average year.  I believe it netted approximately £5 million to £6 million.  Our overall revenue is £550 million.  If any Minister for Finance were to introduce here measures whereby people could come in and know that up to a certain income they would be free of estate duty a great number of people would come in here and invest their money here.  They would settle here, build houses and know that their money was safe here.  They would be taxable here for income tax purposes.  I believe it is only dawning on the Government now that one of the greatest money-spinners is income tax.</P>
    <P>Think of all the widows, living on small incomes, who would be encouraged to come here and settle here if their estates were free of estate duty. Think of all the retired people across the water who have connections here, think of all the Irish people who have <Col N="1599" /> gone abroad and built up fortunes who would be prepared to come back here again provided some Government abolished estate duty.  Those people would then have an opportunity of living here, paying their income tax and their other taxes and feel afterwards that everything they worked for would pass on to their successors, whoever they might be, without having the greater portion of it absorbed by estate duty.</P>
    <P>Estate duty is a capital levy and nothing else.  Many businesses in this country have had to close down because of estate duty.  Take any sizeable business, say a garage, with two partners, one of whom dies.  Estate duty has to be paid and this very often results in closing down the business with loss of employment.  I know of a firm which had two flourishing restaurants in this city.  One of the partners died and as a result of this they had to close down, with great loss of employment, because of this estate duty.  Estate duty, although it may give a sharp return, is by no means beneficial in the long run.  The British have a system whereby the remissions they give are deducted from the whole source but no Minister for Finance here will do that.  He will only give a certain number of benefits but if he abolished estate duty he would be responsible for bringing a lot of capital in here.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is perhaps the only Government spokesman who has come in here so far and put his neck out.  He gave us a résumé of the situation generally.  In fact, he has given the same résumé year after year in which good luck is around the corner and everything will be OK for the future. Everything will be all right for the future; there may be a little hardship now but social benefits have been increased and so on.  I admit that the social benefits were increased this time but they had to be increased because of the high cost of living.  We are a high cost economy and many people were living on the breadline.  What they have been given now will not really take them off the breadline.  However, <Col N="1600" /> we are told that we should count our blessings.</P>
    <P>I can never understand why old age pensioners have to wait for up to five months before receiving the increased benefits although extra taxation is applied immediately after the Budget. Why should this be so when the State can collect the extra revenue?  What is the Budget but financial juggling?  If this sort of thing went on in a private firm in relation to any benefits scheme for employees, there would be screams from the rooftops about the injustices. We saw a photograph in the papers of the Minister for Finance drinking his pint of stout before midnight on Budget Day because if he were to drink after that time it would cost him another penny.  If we on this side of the House vote against any taxation that is proposed by the Government we are accused of voting against social benefits.  The week before last I said to an old age pensioner: &ldquo;Paddy, you will get an extra 40 new pence&rdquo; to which he replied that he would get it if he lived.  He did not live to get it; he died four or five days later.  How many more all over the country have died since then?  What difference would it make to the Government to pay these extra benefits straightaway?</P>
    <P>According to the long introductory speech of the Minister and according to the Tánaiste, buoyancy is so good that it will cover everything.  If the Government took a chance at buoyancy in some respects, surely they could take a chance at buoyancy to give the old age pensioners, the widows and others this extra money straightaway?  It will never be done in this way and, of course, the answer we will be given is that it is not the custom to do so but the real reason is that they are saving money and juggling with finance at the expense of the weakest section of the community.</P>
    <P>I have been accused in this House of being a reactionary.  I do not know whether that is true but one thing that is certain is that I respect and admire the old age pensioners and the widows who are struggling to exist in the hard circumstances that they face today.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister talked <Col N="1601" /> about economies.  He talked about the balance to be held in endeavouring to rectify the situation that existed with regard to certain pressures on the community and on the taxpayers as a whole.  One form of taxation to which he referred was, local taxation which, of course, has reached such proportions that it is inhibiting agricultural production and is a very heavy load on industry. The Minister for Finance said that the Minister for Health would be introducing legislation whereby there would be a contributory health scheme that would lighten the load of taxation. It was for that reason that I sat through the rather dreary speech of the Tánaiste in the hope that he would enlighten the House as to the scheme.  Of course, we, on this side of the House, are particularly interested in a contributory health scheme because it is part of our policy. The only information we have is from the Minister for Finance who said that there would be some from of compulsory contribution for the purpose of relieving the load of taxation on certain classes of the community.  The Minister was particularly vague about the classes of the community but I gathered they included farmers and other self-employed persons such as fishermen. We were anxious to know how the scheme would apply and as the Minister for Finance had mentioned that the Minister for Health would be introducing legislation, we were all ears to hear the secret.  However, it is still a secret because nobody knows what will happen or how the scheme is to be carried out.</P>
    <P>There should be vast economies in this country.  There is no doubt that the overall administration faced many changes during the past few years. Certainly, during my time here we have had two Ministries.  We have had the Ministry of Transport and Power which was set up to deal with tourism and other matters relating to semi-State bodies but, unfortunately, if the Minister concerned is asked a Parliamentary Question, he tells us that he has no function in the matter.  However, we shall leave that for now. Then, we had the Ministry of Labour which was supposed to give us something new in industrial relations.  Now, <Col N="1602" /> we are to have a new Ministry of which, political rumour has it, the Minister for Finance is to be the incumbent&mdash;that is a Minister of Economic Development.  Perhaps it is only right that we should have a Ministry since we are facing a change in administration but what about some of the old Ministries which seem to me to have outstayed their welcome?</P>
    <P>The Department of Lands costs about £4½ million a year.  In the past they had a lot of work to do in so far as there were many estates to be divided.  They succeeded the landlords and their purpose was to divide estates among the smallholders of the country.  At that time the staff of the Land Commission appeared to be necessary and in relation to the value of money today, a sum of about £4 million might have been desirable but there is no justification whatsoever for continuing that sum in the budgetary proposals.  In fact, I can see no valid reason whatsoever for the continuation of the Department of Lands.  That is one of the economies that the Minister for Finance could have considered seriously.  The staff of the Department have increased in number but there is hardly any land to divide.  Also, there was a time when anything relating to land was taken out of politics altogether but today land has been brought back into politics.  The country is asked to pay £4.5 million for a Department that has no <i>raison d'etre.</i> It seems to have no function.  In the Budget the Minister could have deleted £4.5 million and he could have a small section of his Department that would carry on the administration and the collection of annuities and so on, at negligible cost to the country, for the Land Commission.  The Minister, I suggest with respect, could have saved £3 million, allowing something over £1 million for doing the work the Land Commission now have to do and that sum would have been more than adequate.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I have not got the Book of Estimates but whatever is the figure for Local Government it is considerable and I suggest there could have been considerable saving under <Col N="1603" /> this Department.  Some administrative advisers think we could get rid of this Department and that its affairs could be controlled by the Minister's Department.  These are avenues that could be explored to achieve reduction in expenditure.  There is no use in going on with the present high rate of expenditure in view of the economic prospects facing the country.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words on our application for EEC membership and what it means to us and our overall financial position.  We are no longer a low cost economy; we are a high cost economy.  Heretofore, we were carried by the British economy and our trade with the UK.  Up to quite recently, one might say up to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, we had a balance of trade in our favour with the United Kingdom. For many reasons we no longer enjoy that situation and the position is that the trade we have within the confines of the Free Trade Area Agreement is not sufficient to give our people the standard of living they require. Hitherto, people were satisfied with a lower standard of living but now we must raise our sights.  If we are to continue on the present lines proposed by the Minister for Finance, in this year's Budget, with ever-growing taxation and ever-increasing burdens on the people, we cannot prosper. All the taxes that could be imposed have been imposed by successive Ministers for Finance and, in fact, taxes that should never have been imposed have been imposed.</P>
    <P>We must seek a wider economy and we must be competitive and in order to do so we must put our own financial affairs in order.  Whatever the prospects may be for the coming 12 months, I think the Minister has gambled on two things, buoyancy and the fact that we may get into the EEC rather sooner than people imagined.</P>

      <P>Political expediency controls most major decisions taken by Parliaments.  The British are not in as happy a position as we are and it may be&mdash;more than likely, it will be&mdash;inexpedient for Britain to enter the Common Market and it is open to question whether France will welcome her entry or not.  Can we continue in our economy as it is at present without getting out from under the umbrella of Britain, without a wider market?  In my considered opinion, we cannot.  Somebody must take a vital decision in the near future and my advice to the Government would be that, as regards entering or participating in the EEC, they have no problem. They have a parliamentary majority and they should go ahead and negotiate.</P>

      <P>In this debate last week I heard Fianna Fáil Deputies telling us that we were doing untold damage both to ourselves and to the Administration by saying what we thought we should say.  As somebody said a short time ago, Deputies who come in here are anxious to say what they think they should say and they do not have to be told by any member of the Fianna Fáil Party that they are doing themselves untold damage.  Every Deputy is entitled to say what he thinks <Col N="1606" /> should be said on behalf of his constituents. We all admire Deputy Tunney for saying what he did say.  This Budget debate gives Deputies an opportunity to say what they feel they should say and to say the things they know affect the people they represent.  We are sent here by the votes of the people and it would be a sad day if we did not have the right to come in here and speak on behalf of those who depend on us, who place confidence in us and who are waiting to see what account we will give of our stewardship in this Parliament.</P>
      <P>I represent the Sligo-Leitrim constituency and I want to express my views on the present Fianna Fáil policy and on the Budget introduced by the Minister for Finance.  Agriculture is our main industry and it has been sadly neglected by Fianna Fáil down through the years.  Fianna Fáil have concentrated on getting votes instead of going down the country to see what conditions were like there and what needed to be done.  The only talking done was at by-election time when Ministers, their Parliamentary Secretaries, their spokesmen and their TDs told the people what would be done if their candidate was returned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The day of reckoning has come. It is clear that various departments have been neglected and the affairs of the country have been mismanaged. No matter what other project may be successful we will always have to admit that we are principally dependent on livestock.  A few years ago the warble fly eradication scheme was introduced and before that we had the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme, which was a great success.  What is the position today regarding the warble fly eradication scheme?  Our cattle are destroyed with warble fly and despite the fact that officials were appointed to do the job the livestock of the majority of farmers is affected by warble fly. There must be something seriously wrong with the way the scheme is being operated.  At the beginning we were told of the losses our farmers would suffer, but we have reached the stage where losses are due to the mismanagement of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The Minister has said he will give £275,000 in order <Col N="1607" /> to settle the dispute between the NFA, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association and the Department.  The sooner this dispute is settled the better for everyone concerned.  If it is not settled soon our livestock industry will suffer a severe setback.</P>
    <P>The Minister generously gave an increase of £2.30 on hogget ewes and I know it would cost a fair amount to give an extra 50p. on the lambs but it would be worth it because the figures seem to indicate that our sheep population is declining every year.  Our sheep population is a valuable asset and every encouragement should be given to people who keep sheep.  When another opportunity arises I would ask the Minister to go the whole way and give another 50p increase on lambs.  I know this would pay dividends because the money would be going into the pockets of small farmers in mountain districts, the areas where this money is most required.</P>
    <P>A number of farmers are anxious to procure pedigree bulls, such as Aberdeen Angus, Hereford, Whitehead and Shorthorn.  The Department have said they are short of those animals, but where farmers are making genuine efforts to stock their farms with these animals, which would give a good service both to the farmer with a big herd and the locals, because it would save them having to go to the AI Station, it would be money well spent.  I had the experience of having about four or five on my list and only once securing an Aberdeen Angus bull.  That is a loss to the cattle trade and a loss ultimately to the country.  Success has varied.</P>

      <P>The Minister has provided £90,000 for improvement work in Leitrim.  Would the Minister provide a similar amount for Sligo which is another county made up largely of small holdings?  Only £33,000 is provided in the case of Sligo.  Expenditure of this nature is valuable because it puts money into the pockets of those who require it most.  As well as that, it reduces the burden on the Department of Social Welfare and that, in turn, means a reduction in taxation.</P>
      <P>Housing is a big problem in my constituency.  We need 14,000 new houses this year to meet requirements. We are building only some 4,500 or thereabouts.  The trend today is towards younger marriages and, if houses are not provided for these young people, they will emigrate.  It is an appalling commentary on our society that young married people should be asked to pay £4 and £4 10s. for a single room.  The housing problem will have to be solved.  Two or three years ago we were jubilant when tourism earned £100,000,000.  We thought it would earn that sum, or more, every year.  But the trade suddenly collapsed. It would be much better to provide accommodation for our own instead of providing accommodation for people who may never come here. The figure for emigration runs at some 10,000 to 12,000 per year.  The housing problem will have to be tackled more vigorously.  Housing surveys do not, in my opinion, provide a true picture of the situation.</P>

    <P>Deputies representing western constituencies got no opportunity of speaking in the debate on the dole recently. They were rather disappointed.  More people in the West are in receipt of this benefit than in any other part of the country.  Were it not for this benefit <Col N="1609" /> emigration from the West would be even higher than it is.  The holdings are uneconomic.  There is no subsidiary employment.  All that is left is this benefit.  I have had a great many letters about this.  A great many people have talked to me about it.

Seized vehicles are disposed of as early as possible but in some instances it may be a considerable time before the cases involving the owners are settled.</P>
