      <P>When I reported progress on Tuesday last I had dealt almost completely with the dairying industry and the state of that industry <Col N="1154" /> as I see it at present.  I had not dealt in full with the serious effects of the scaling down of milk prices.  There are a few points which I want to bring to the Minister's notice in connection with this scaling down of prices because I believe that it is now it is having its effect.</P>
      <P>When this was first introduced by the Minister's predecessor it was against the wishes of all the farming organisations, the creamery managers' association and everybody associated with the dairying industry.  The Minister introduced a phased increase in the price of milk and it is having its effect at this point in time.  In fact, it contributes to the increased cost of production because the pattern in the dairying industry is that the cows are calving at this time of the year and going into milk, and the milk producers are now aiming at a shorter lactation period.  If they want to produce milk from now until such time as good quality grass is available, the only way they can do that is by feeding concentrates which are pretty expensive.  If they do that they will produce milk over a longer period but it will bring some of them within the scope of the phased increase and they will not get the full value of the milk they are producing.</P>
      <P>At this time of the year the creameries and the processing industries are not getting sufficient milk to keep them going due to the scaling down of milk prices.  As I pointed out on the last occasion, the Minister and his predecessor were confused between the big milk producer and the big farmer because the big milk producer is not necessarily the big farmer.  We have a situation now in which milk is being produced from the grass only and there is a shorter period of milk production.  This results in our processing plants and our creameries having inflated overheads and inflated costs because they have to pay their staffs during the lean period which is a lot longer than it was heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told that at the moment milk is so scarce that the target envisaged for 1970-71 of 550 million gallons will not be reached and that we will not reach 500 millions gallons.  I am also informed by a fairly reliable authority that some creameries are finding it very <Col N="1155" /> difficult to fill their contracts, and one creamery in the south is short of between 200 and 300 tons of skim milk powder.  This is a terrible reflection on the policy pursued by the Government.</P>
    <P>Early last year the farming organisations made representations to the Minister and advised him that at a time when Europe was moving out of milk production we should stay put.  How right they were.  Our contribution is so insignificant and our production is so small that it was a fatal mistake to move away from milk production.  The Minister, who is a farmer, will appreciate that it is very easy to go from milk to beef, or to diversify from milk to any other line of production, but it is both difficult and expensive to get back into milk production.  It is accepted that it takes approximately ten years to build up a proper dairy herd, and this is the great problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department should realise that, once a farmer goes out of milk production, it is not easy to get back into it again.  There seems to be no long-term planning.  Last year farmers were encouraged to get out of milk production.  That was a mistake. I have been told that representatives of Bord Bainne are at the moment canvassing creameries throughout the country to drop all production except butter so that we will be able to fill the quota to Britain.  I do not know how true this is, but I have reason to believe that my information is pretty accurate.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal from Ministers for Agriculture and members of the Fianna Fáil Party about the subsidy the taxpayer is called upon to pay in relation to agriculture. Every time there is a demand for an increase in farmers' income the reply is that the Exchequer is paying almost £100 million a year to subsidise the farming community.  This is not correct. It is grossly exaggerated.  I have tried to get the facts about State expenditure on agriculture.  A committee was set up some time ago to examine into the amount of money provided to subsidise agriculture. Now, there is a vast difference between State aid to agriculture and <Col N="1156" /> subsidising agriculture.  In the information supplied by the Department one finds ten different headings: education, research and advisory services; livestock improvement and eradication of disease; production and development aids, marketing support; administration of miscellaneous Acts; land annuities relief; capital for the Agricultural Credit Corporation and so on.  The Supplementary Estimate for 1970-71 comes to approximately £97 million.</P>
    <P>It was stated recently in a newspaper article that the farmer was being subsidised to the extent of almost £2 million a week.  The report of the committee which reviewed State expenditure to agriculture said that it could be argued that a number of headings could be completely eliminated from this alleged State aid to agriculture.  Expenditure under these headings is described as expenditure in relation to agriculture and not as State aid to agriculture.  The committee are not prepared to argue that all of it is State aid.  This is an important point.</P>
    <P>In the realm of State aid unique to agriculture I list creamery milk.  This aid is unique to agriculture.  There is also carcase beef and lamb, bacon, lime subsidy, incentive scheme for small farmers, beef cattle incentive scheme.  These come to approximately £46 million.  This is a far cry from the £100 million we hear so much about.</P>
    <P>With regard to creamery milk the Exchequer aid comes to approximately £30 million a year.  There is a hidden subsidy in this.  The consumer does not pay the economic price for the lb. of butter and the hidden subsidy amounts to some £5 million.</P>
    <P>The producer of pigs is at a disadvantage in that factory processing costs are probably higher than they would be in a more rationalised industry and a good deal of the subsidy goes in price support of factory costs. This is something we should bear in mind.</P>
    <P>There is relief of rates, a pretty sizeable sum.  This is regarded as a subsidy to agriculture or to the farming community. This is what makes one ask <Col N="1157" /> oneself if this is the reason why such a barrier of suspicion exists between the farming and the non-farming community. Relief of rates and land annuities is a tax relief for the lower income farmers and should not be regarded as State aid to agriculture.  Every one of us who qualifies gets relief in income tax.  Deputies get a certain income tax relief.  Could this be described as a subsidy for Deputies?  This is something we should examine and, instead of talking about £100 million, we should talk in terms of £40 million which is, in my opinion, the accurate figure.</P>
    <P>The cost of rural electrification is described as a subsidy to agriculture. This is utterly absurd.  If there is an extension of supply to a doctor's house in Castletownbere is that regarded as a subsidy to agriculture?  Is it part of the £100 million to agriculture about which we hear so much?  It is ridiculous to regard the extension of electricity to the hills and valleys in rural Ireland as a subsidy to the farming community.  The Minister should have another look at this whole question of the subsidisation of agriculture.</P>
    <P>When the State contributes to agriculture the taxpayer has a right to know what contribution agriculture makes to the economy.  The money spent on agriculture is money well spent but, in order to increase farmers' income, more subsidy will have to be provided.  Agriculture employs 28 per cent of the total labour force.  It accounts for 50 per cent of total domestic exports and, indirectly, it contributes to the employment of 50 per cent of those engaged in manufacturing industries.  We should realise and appreciate the contribution agriculture makes to our economy.  Agriculture uses £18 million worth of goods and services supplied by Irish concerns each year.  This is something we should not forget.  Agricultural exports are not like industrial exports because agriculture is a small importer of goods and an excellent earner, therefore, of foreign currency.  The £100 million worth of agricultural products exported requires only £7 million worth of imports. Every £100 million worth of industrial products exported requires something <Col N="1158" /> around £38 million worth of imports. Those who complain, particularly those in the cities and towns, should bear this in mind when they talk about subsidising the Irish farmer.  This is something they should bear in mind.</P>
    <P>Statements are made from time to time about farmers not paying income tax but what people do not realise is that farmers pay rates on their place of employment which nobody else is asked to do.  Confusion exists and no effort is being made to clarify it among people engaged in work other than farming.  If the farmer pays rates on his place of employment surely he is not expected to pay income tax? I believe if the rates were abolished completely the farmers would not object to paying income tax on their earnings.</P>
    <P>We have made very little progress in dealing with the problem of animal health.  Two years ago, in the debate on the Estimate for Agriculture I brought something to the notice of the Minister and asked him to deal with it when he was replying but he did not mention it.  Probably the present Minister has a better knowledge of agriculture than any of his predecessors had but so far as eradication of animal diseases is concerned progress is very slow and disappointing. At that time we had a situation which was brought to my notice by several people in which we had depots for the collection of dead animals. This is a widespread, pretty lucrative business from which some people have made considerable amounts of money in recent times.  The dead animal is collected without regard to the cause of death and immediately afterwards the carcase of that animal is distributed throughout the country as dog meat without any control.  This is adding to our eradication problem.  The Minister should look into this because it concerns everybody in the farming community.  If we wish to avail of the opportunities presented by entry into Europe it is essential to ensure that our cattle are free of disease.  I do not know what is the solution to the problem but surely something could be done, either by way of licensing or better control of those engaged in this business? <Col N="1159" /> The matter is causing a great deal of concern.</P>
    <P>We have failed to realise the extent of the damage and the cost to the farmer of brucellosis in recent times. Particularly in the southern dairy area brucellosis is very prevalent.  There is nothing to stop a farmer, as soon as a cow aborts, from taking her to market and exposing her for sale among other cattle.  There is no control.  This is something that should be remedied.  I should like a reply from the Minister on those points.</P>
    <P>In regard to bovine TB eradication, this year a number of herds have broken down.  I do not know why but I was amazed at the amount of testing being done in my own area by the vets. Is this an indication that no progress is being made?  I put down a question to elicit some information from the Minister but he would not agree that this was the situation at that time.  We have made very little progress in the eradication of bovine TB.</P>
    <P>In the case of warble fly eradication the half-hearted effort made by the Department to get the farming community to eliminate this pest is pitiful. Practically no effort was made and at the end of last year farmers did not know whether they should or whether they would dress their animals because there was no encouragement, no lead given by the Department.  When the Department did embark on the scheme it was an absolute waste of public money because it was continued only for a while and quite a number of cattle were not dressed.  If you want to eradicate warble fly, treatment must go on for two or three years and every animal must be dressed against a blue card.  That is the only way you can ensure full co-operation and be successful in eradicating the pest.  Farmers now realise the amount of damage that the warble fly can do particularly to store cattle.  I hope to hear from the Minister on that subject.</P>
    <P>I have heard a good deal about animal feed.  Veterinary surgeons are very concerned about the amount of antibiotics being used indiscriminately in animal feed at present.  Some vets have complained that it is now difficult <Col N="1160" /> for them to treat animals because of the indiscriminate use of antibiotics particularly when they have to deal with animals that already have had an overdose of antibiotics.  New brands of pig feed, rations and meals are coming on the market such as &ldquo;rapid rearers&rdquo; and feeds for young pigs and the amount of antibiotics used is detrimental to the industry.  Is there any control?  There is a certain control in regard to the millers but quite a number of farmers manufacture their own rations.  I read a report from an analyst in England in which he said that he had found arsenic of 12 parts per one million in the liver of a pig.  The matter is getting out of hand in this country.  Copper sulphate, for instance, is now added to pig feed.  What you would take up on a sixpence is sufficient for a ton of pig feed but you have farmers manufacturing their own rations using it <i>ad lib</i>.  This is very dangerous and it is a matter the Minister should examine.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister using his good offices in the present farming dispute in an effort to bring the farmers together and get them to end this strike.  The Minister should try to deal with their problems.  They have problems.  The Minister will have to grasp the nettle firmly and deal with them regardless of what criticism it evokes from those not engaged in agriculture. The Minister must try to settle this dispute which will otherwise escalate and cause serious damage. Even now we have evidence that it is causing damage.  There are too many people on strike and too many willing to go on strike at the drop of a hat. I should say that the farming community are the most tolerant section of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>They have had a pretty rough time in the past.  The Minister has a duty to meet the farming community and come to a settlement with them so that they will get back to work, particularly now as we are approaching spring.  We are now in the midst of this strike by the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association and the NFA and we will see, if this continues, wholesale redundancy and wholesale unemployment because <Col N="1161" /> already it has had its effect on the lime quarries and the machinery firms in which men are being laid off.  The Minister should be sensible about this. Surely it has been proved beyond doubt that they have a grievance.  I hope that before it is too late the Minister will realise the seriousness of the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to deliberate too long on this Supplementary Estimate but there are a few anomalies within the functioning of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries which I should like to bring to the Minister's attention.  I have listened, since this debate began, to the various speakers and I listened with great attention to Opposition speakers, and, indeed, to some of our own speakers, and the matter upon which they continually harped was subsidisation.  I am beginning to wonder if any of us here is honest enough with himself and even honest enough with the farming community to stand up and say that it is time we realised that subsidisation should be phased out in regard to our farming community.  This would have many repercussions, could cause great difficulties within the community and could have adverse effects on the industry.  However, as long as we continue to pour subsidies into the farming community in the manner in which we have been in the last eight or ten years we are not solving the farming problem. Subsidisation solves an economic problem but only for a period and when the moneys are used up the thing catches up on us again and then we have to find additional subsidies.  These subsidies must come from the Exchequer and the money must be obtained in a most arduous manner, by devious means, by the State having to put its hands into the taxpayers' pockets and extract money in the most dubious ways.  This has to be done if we are to keep the Exchequer afloat. Every time we advocate additional subsidies to the agricultural community <Col N="1162" /> we should remember that we are not really assisting them; we are solving an economic and a financial problem for them but we are also creating a social problem for them.</P>
      <P>The farming community deserve a certain amount of respect for the skills they have attained through hard work and dedication to this industry and they should be paid a just price for their produce.  If we did that we would, in the future, avoid the necessity for additional subsidies which we might envisage promoting here or which the Department might have in mind.  I am treading very carefully here because I fully realise what could happen if we were to withdraw fully all subsidies from the agricultural community.  I am not suggesting that but I am suggesting that if we enter the EEC we will have to phase out our subsidies and pay the farmers a just price for their produce.</P>
      <P>I hope I will be able to point out a few anomalies.  The agricultural community are being allowed fall behind their industrial comrades in regard to payment for produce and recompense for their hours of labour and toil.  The Minister has, as he should have, his finger on the pulse in regard to agricultural matters&mdash;he is a man of considerable agricultural knowledge&mdash;and he is aware of the many disadvantages created in the past because we advocated additional subsidies and stepped aside from the real issue, a just payment for milk, potatoes, cereals or for any other produce from the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see a very definite approach in regard to this and I should like the Minister to tell us positively whether we intend to continue this trend of never ending subsidisation thus bringing ourselves to the point that when we enter the EEC some subsidies will have to be withdrawn very quickly, leaving our farmers in a very competitive market.  I have no doubt we will enter the EEC.  A very rosy picture has been painted in regard to agriculture when we enter the EEC. This is all very fine for those sitting behind desks formulating programmes which we must implement on the land but it is time we realised that when we enter the EEC we will be competing <Col N="1163" /> against people who work a longer day than we do.  I say this without reservation because we are apt to forget that we should carry out our work in a dedicated way.  When we enter the EEC we will be competing against people who are better geared to carry out their work on the land than we are. Therefore, it will be necessary, not only for the farming community, but for each and every one of us, to roll up our sleeves and say to ourselves that it is time we started to work to produce goods comparable with the products of other countries.  I have no doubt that our agricultural community will be able to do this but we ourselves should show the initiative.</P>
    <P>The system of farm grants should be restructured.  I do not think this needs much elaboration because most Deputies who have spoken on this matter have expressed criticism.  The system should be restructured to ensure that the farmer with a small economic holding can obtain direct benefit.  At the moment the big farmer appears to reap the major benefit and there is no incentive for the small farmer to apply.  However, the worst feature is the fact that he must wait for a very long time before sanction is obtained and payment made.</P>
    <P>This brings me to a pertinent point regarding my own constituency, namely, the scheme of grants for glasshouses. About three or four years ago the Minister for Agriculture introduced this scheme.  I was pleased and said it would be an added incentive to those in the industry.  However, I condemned the fact that a ceiling was not imposed on the amount of money that would be paid to any individual.  I fought against this for two years and last year a ceiling of £40,000 was introduced.  I am not convinced that this was the appropriate amount; I suggest we should have a much lower ceiling, say, in the region of £20,000-£25,000.</P>
    <P>If we look back on the files we can see that some people got grants of £140,000.  Large syndicates grouped together, such as fruit importers who were not involved in any way in the production of tomatoes other than selling them across the counter, and they received grants of more than <Col N="1164" /> £100,000.  The producer with a quarter or half acre finds it extremely difficult to get a small portion of the large sum of money that is allocated to the glasshouse industry.  The ceiling of £40,000 is much too high and it ensures that large syndicates obtain the greatest benefits from the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that the principal objective was to increase the acreage under glass.  I realise that this was possibly the reason for the introduction of the scheme but I also realise that the more people there are in the industry the better are the prospects for that industry.  This is particularly the case in the glasshouse industry and it is carrying out the intention of the Second Programme, namely, to keep as many as possible in viable units on the land.  However, to do this in an effective way we should have introduced a scheme with a ceiling of £20,000-£25,000.</P>
    <P>In this case I want to express my concern because people who applied for grants in March, 1969 have not yet been paid, and will not be paid until March, 1971.  These people have applied for grants in respect of overhead irrigation, for installation of heating systems or for the erection of glasshouses, and they must proceed with this work.  In many cases they have received undertakings from the bank that they can carry out the work provided they obtain the grants.</P>
    <P>I do not know if we ran out of money because we overspent in the first few years&mdash;I know there were more applicants than had been expected&mdash;but if this was the case we should have honoured our commitments. The majority of these people who have applied for grants have no option but to continue with the work without sanction from the Department of Agriculture.  The reply that will be given will probably be that they went ahead without prior sanction from the Department of Agriculture, with the result that they will be deprived of the grant.  We made a mistake in not having a ceiling and the small producer is being penalised.  There are many small farmers in the Rush, Skerries and Lusk areas who are being victimised because the big producers <Col N="1165" /> got the bulk of the money that was originally meant for the small producers.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to arrange to have the glasshouse grants paid. Those who applied in March this year will not be eligible for payment by next year because the work will not have been inspected when the scheme is completed next year.  The majority of the people will not be eligible because they have carried out the work without prior sanction.  This is a specific problem and I hope the Minister will consider what I have said.</P>
    <P>In the event of our entry into the EEC, our tomato producers will be in keen competition with producers in other countries.  From the climatic point of view the continental producer has a tremendous advantage and, therefore, our producers need all assistance possible.  In this regard the Minister should exercise his powers in an effort to have the outstanding grants paid.</P>
    <P>I have been advocating a change of policy with regard to cereal-growing generally and particularly in regard to our present system of operating the wheat levy.  I do not know how the Department intend dealing with the problem this year but it appears it will be dealt with in the same manner as in the last two years, that is, that a levy will be imposed on wheat.  I do not suggest for a moment that the Exchequer should have to subsidise wheat-growing and I do not think it is necessary.  However, it is unjust to tell the farmer that he will get 90s a barrel or whatever it will be for his wheat and then when the time comes to deduct 15s so that he realises a substantially smaller sum.  If the farmer produces a quality product, which everyone advocates, it is not wanted; in other words, if it is really good millable wheat a levy must be paid on it.  Farmers thought this levy would last for one year, and that was all right.  It continued for a second year, and it will remain for a third and fourth year.  If we do not get away from this system it will go on for ever.  There are other systems which could be operated.  They would not cost the Exchequer anything and would alleviate other problems in that sphere and give another outlet to <Col N="1166" /> the Department in relation to the further increase in the production of cereal growing.</P>
    <P>I want to advocate, as I have before on many occasions, even personally to the Minister, the growing of wheat on a quality basis.  I had a question down to the Minister the other day in this regard.  This matter should be examined.  I suggest the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries should recommend certain qualities of wheat as millable.  There are many of them on the market at the moment; they are not very high yielders.  The farmer should know before growing wheat that it will be acceptable as millable, and, secondly, what he will get for it. Along with that, you must cater for the people who are not growing millable wheat; let us call it soft wheat and hard wheat.  In regard to soft wheat you would require a commercial type of wheat for which the Minister himself could strike a price in the Department.  I advocate a price of £3 10s per barrel.</P>
    <P>This would be commercial soft wheat of which there are many varieties in the country.  They are mostly winter wheats.  There is a tremendous acreage of winter wheat this year, and each year that goes by farmers have a tendency to go more and more and more into winter wheat, and why?  Because all the winter wheats are much higher yielders than the spring wheats.  The spring wheats could be utilised as millable wheats if they were grown on a variety basis.  There are only a few varieties which would be acceptable to the millers and which the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries could recommend.  These varieties are not confined to any early-ripening areas. They could be grown generally throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The soft wheat could be grown on a commercial basis and would offset the large sums of money spent every year, approximately £9 million, on the importation of feedingstuffs for cattle, poultry, pigs&mdash;all our livestock&mdash;which could be produced at home.  I realise there are difficulties involved, but I should like to know with certainly that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have tackled this problem in a realistic way.  It should be <Col N="1167" /> given a trial and, if it is not successful, it will certainly be 100 times more successful than the imposition of a levy whereby no one knows what he will get for his wheat.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that the levy does not discourage the farmers growing wheat, and this is so.  Each year yields are being pushed up by the extra application of fertiliser and by the introduction of new varieties.  This has given the farmer an incentive to continue to grow wheat.  Years ago as a child I remember, when we started to grow wheat, if you grew wheat once in ley and got away with it you were deemed to be very lucky.  The variety then was Glasnevin Rosa.  Now you can grow wheat for the third successive season on the one piece of ground and get a higher yield the last year for the simple reason that the rotation of the soil is activating the &ldquo;artificials&rdquo; which have been put in the first and second year.  Some of these remain in the ground and have been utilised to greater benefit in the third year.  There is also the application of chemicals which have brought about resistance to diseases which years ago were the downfall of wheat production.  All these researches carried out for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries by An Foras Talúntais have brought additional money to the farmers.  It costs them more money to produce the commodity but they get additional money by virtue of higher production.  There is a certain amount of satisfaction in knowing that you can sow and reap without having the worry of diseases which used to be a constant threat to the production of wheat and cereals in general.</P>
    <P>Wheat growing would require no support if yields of up to about two and a half tons an acre were achieved. These yields have been constantly obtained in the country generally.  The national average yield is not so far below this.  I have got these yields myself, my neighbours have got them and I have been down the country and I know that people there have got them readily.  If commercial wheat can be grown at the rate of two and <Col N="1168" /> a half tons per statute acre there would be no need for subsidies or levies.  It would only be justice for the farmer to implement a scheme whereby the farmer would know that the higher his yield would be the more money he would get; in other words the more efficiently and more effectively he applies modern methods and his own knowledge the greater the reward he will reap.</P>
    <P>In this way we would be doing justice to the technical knowledge which the farmers have gained through the pamphlets and booklets issued by the Department of Agriculture and the farmers would be compensated for their time and trouble by the introduction of a scheme which would let them know in advance of sowing exactly what they would get for their produce. There is no other industry in which the producer does not know beforehand what he will get for his produce. Every firm which cans peas knows beforehand how much it will get per can, and the same is true in relation to every bottle of milk.  Yet in the case of wheat we allow the farmer to live in suspense.  This is unjust in view of our proposed entry to the EEC and the competition we will meet then.  The Minister, having considerable knowledge of cereal growing, can support what I have said.</P>
    <P>I had occasion recently to witness the importation of field barley.  I do not know what price was paid for it but whatever it was it was too much. I have seen this field barley dumped at the doorway of a shed but because it was so bad and so light it blew all round the shed.  It was absolute dirt brought in from the Continent.  The argument will be put forward that we do not produce enough barley but over-produce wheat.  The sensible thing to do would be to balance the two. Another argument that will be put forward is that we do not have the protein, but protein can be bought in a plastic bag.  Most pig producers buy protein in a plastic bag and mix a spoonful in the pig feed every day. The same is true of the poultry industry.  It would be far better to utilise home grown produce instead of importing this dirt.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> I have seen deplorable wheat offal imported from Russia.  Anyone who went down to the Dublin docks to see the wheat offal we are importing would be horrified because it is the worst type of feeding anyone could consider using. I have seen the Port Milling Company dumping better feeding than what is being brought in.  We would be far better off using home grown produce. It is high time we stopped buying from countries who do not buy produce from us, which means that at the end of the year there is a considerable deficit in our balance of trade.</P>
    <P>Barley prices were increased by 5s a barrel which is equal to 50s a ton.  This increase has already been negatived.  A barrel of barley at the present time costs £6 5s whereas last year it cost £5.  It has gone up 25s because seed merchants read in the papers that the Minister for Agriculture was giving an increase of 5s a barrel to farmers.  An increase of 10s a barrel could have been attributed to labour costs and that would have been quite acceptable but to increase the price by £1 5s a barrel is ridiculous.  Of course it will be said that one barrel of barley can produce 30 barrels at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The price of artificial manures has been going up steadily without any clamp down from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The Minister for Agriculture will have to step in on behalf of the farming community and say: &ldquo;Before the next increase takes place we shall have to have an investigation into this.&rdquo; I have heard representatives of the manufacturers state that as long as the Department of Industry and Commerce allow them to increase the price of artificials they will do so.  The only people to suffer are the farming community.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking it can be said that the last few years have been good ones for agriculture.  Milk production has gone down because we have had dry summers.  While cereal growers increased their yields the year before last, the storm on 12th August last did irreparable damage.  We also had extremely dry weather in July which did not help to fill the blade of corn. However, we gained in quality and this <Col N="1170" /> was a tremendous incentive to the farming community.  Yet, just because the Minister gives farmers an extra 5s a barrel the seed manufacturers and the manufacturers of artificials immediately put their prices up so we reach a stalemate very quickly.  If they make a valid case for increasing prices then they must get them, but they have not shown any evidence to prove that seed barley should be increased by £1 5s and seed wheat by £1 a barrel.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the glasshouse industry and I want to deal with the financing of it by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  During the years, the Department have developed a considerable amount of goodwill with the ACC.  So also have the Department of Finance with whom the ACC have a very close relationship.  If one goes into this, however, one will appreciate that the ACC are not being given sufficient capital.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the case of a loan applicant from North County Dublin who has 20 or 30 acres of land&mdash;this is a fairly average farm in the area, many farms being small&mdash;who wishes to add a small portion adjoining.  He will get only £6,000 from the ACC. In North County Dublin the price of land is fiercely competitive; a farmer is competing with developers who are trying to buy all the land they can in the vicinity of Dublin Airport, particularly near towns of any size.  Therefore, it has become nearly impossible for a farmer to buy land.</P>
    <P>The ACC should be enabled, through additional finance, to be more lenient with such people.  In the area of which I speak, £6,000 will buy only a very small portion of land and because a farmer is unable to get two loans he cannot go to the bank.  The only solution he has is to move to Meath, Westmeath or Kildare.  This tends to deplete the number of farmers in the area and I ask the Minister seriously to consider giving the ACC more resources.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Land Commission cannot ever seriously consider buying land in my constituency.  Firstly, they would have to pay too much for it and, secondly, the successful applicants, in turn, would have to pay too <Col N="1171" /> dearly for it.  There is therefore no possibility of the Land Commission coming into the picture in North County Dublin.  At the moment the ACC are, I think, getting £12 million a year from the Government.  I suggest that this be increased so that they can assist not only farmers in my constituency but farmers throughout the country.  The principle of ACC borrowing is very simple and repayments are very easy for farmers.  The ACC give a certain amount of latitude which the banks do not.  On those grounds alone I plead with the Minister to give additional capital to the ACC.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about education for the farming community. A number of small farmers in my constituency have tried to avail of the educational facilities being made available for the farming community, which are widespread throughout the constituency.  They are being made available by the local agricultural advisory service, by the Department and by the technical schools.  Unfortunately, however, many farmers and their sons are unable to avail of them. There is a labour shortage in the area because of its proximity to Dublin and the ready availability of jobs in building and other industries.</P>
    <P>Therefore, farmers depend nearly entirely on their sons to work their farms and it is only when classes are held at night that the farming community can avail of them.  I appeal to the Minister to try to arrange such classes so that the farming community can benefit.  We have inveigled the agricultural advisers to hold classes here and there but unfortunately the classes are too widespread and there is no continuity about them.  If classes could be held at night and if the farmers were circularised about them I can assure the Minister that the farmers would co-operate fully.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if it would be possible to do something concrete to stabilise the price of potatoes.  It is ridiculous to find potatoes selling in shops in Dublin for between 2s 6d and 6s per stone <Col N="1172" /> whereas if you go to a farm you will get half a cwt for between 8s and 10s, or £16 to £20 per ton.  Therefore, the middleman has a profit margin of anything up to £42 a ton.  Somebody is making a fantastic profit while housewives in Dublin and in surrounding areas are paying through the nose. There is no stabilising in the prices of potatoes or cabbage.  The argument will be made that the price is regulated by supply and demand.  I submit that this is not a valid argument in this case.  The middleman is fleecing the housewives in Dublin.  The housewives in the city of Dublin are fully convinced that the farmer is making a fortune and that is why there is such a kick up every time we look for additional money for agriculture. They say: &ldquo;Oh, it is for the farmer again&rdquo;, because they are fully convinced that the £40 per ton paid to the shopkeeper is paid direct to the farmer, and the farmer is making an absolute fortune out of his potatoes. In the summer months when they stop at the side of the road and ask you to sell them half a cwt of potatoes they are very surprised when you ask for such a small price.  They cannot believe it.</P>
    <P>The price of potatoes should be regulated on a month to month basis, particularly the early crop when the farmer gets about £32 a ton, perhaps less, perhaps more.  The Potato Marketing Board is practically non-existent. We might as well be honest about it.  It has no effective function whatsoever.  It is a waste of time having these people who are potato porters in the market dictating the price, according to supply and demand as they think.  It is really in accordance with what they think they can clear in one day.  That is how the price is dictated. I was a victim of this and many of my colleagues in North County Dublin were also victims of it.  We saw the procedure.</P>
    <P>It is time we got away from that type of gerrymandering in which four or five people can dictate the price of potatoes in the city of Dublin by having a meeting for about seven minutes each Tuesday or Thursday morning. The housewife in the city of Dublin is <Col N="1173" /> being exploited by the middleman.  If the middleman says he is not making the money we should find out who exactly is making the 150 or 200 per cent profit.  We have an alternative. We have co-operatives.  We have people buying in bulk.  The ordinary housewife in Ballymun&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; or the ordinary housewife in any of the big estates, buys a head of cabbage every day and a stone of potatoes in a plastic bag every second day.  If this is what she wants, we will have to facilitate her. She has no place to store one cwt of potatoes and, indeed, no way of getting them.  There should be some investigation into this matter and we should try to stabilise the price of potatoes from month to month, at least.  It is easy enough to do that with the late potatoes because it is fairly easy to calculate the acreage of potatoes and the average of what will be produced.  It will not be exact but it does not have to be exact.</P>
      <P>The reason for the drop in the acreage of potatoes&mdash;and this will continue&mdash;is the instability of the price. It must be admitted that people are not eating as many potatoes as they did, but to offset that every child you see is carrying a bag of crisps.  Therefore, the potatoes are being used in other ways. The market is there for them if we produce them, but we must guarantee the price.  That is not a lot to ask for in this day and age when we are going into guaranteed markets.  The farmer should be respected as one person who should get a guaranteed price.  He has enough drawbacks to contend with through the elements, diseases, and otherwise.  He should at least be guaranteed a price for a good product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to compliment the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries on land drainage.  I have seen in my own area and also throughout the country the tremendous benefits of the work caried out by the land drainage section. I want to speak now for the people in my own county.  The staff of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are the most obliging people I have ever met.  They use their talents to the <Col N="1174" /> advantage of the farmers.  That is probably paying lip service to a staff which will never get recognition.</P>
    <P>In county Dublin we have no big complaint about land drainage.  We have not that much land to drain but we have a considerable number of rivers that are too small to be dealt with by the Office of Public Works and too big to be taken over by the land drainage section of the Department.  I wonder would it be possible for the Minister to make a decision about these rivers?  I should like to mention the Ballyboughal River, in particular. The Office of Public Works say it is not their responsibility because it is too small, and the Department say it is too big for them to tackle it, that their resources are limited and they cannot tackle big rivers.  We are caught in this cleft stick.  Surely a decision could be made as to whose responsibility this river is.  If it is on the list of the Office of Public Works it will not be done until heaven knows when.  If it is on the list of the land drainage section we can get it done immediately.  There are people who are ready to pay their subscriptions to have this river drained to dry up about 470 acres of land in the area.  In regard to the drainage in our area, the Office of Public Works are practically non-existent.  They carried out drainage on a few big rivers and I do not think they intend to do any more.</P>
    <P>There is not proper supervision of land that has been drained.  I was on land in my constituency about three weeks ago which has reverted to its original state.  It has reverted to growing rushes.  I do not think this is right. Proper supervision should be maintained over land that has been drained. It should be inspected periodically. The farmer should give an undertaking that he will utilise the land to the best advantage, in other words, that he will keep it in a fertile condition.  About £45 an acre is spent on the drainage of land and the farmers' contribution would be, possibly, one-third.  A considerable amount of the taxpayers' money has gone into this and it should be stressed to the people concerned that this money is not to be wasted. The Department should inspect drained <Col N="1175" /> land and make sure that it has not reverted to its original state.</P>
    <P>I do not think the agricultural instructors have been vigorous enough in their advocacy of land drainage. They have not made this suggestion often enough.  They have not repeatedly impressed on the people that it is necessary to carry out this work in order to get full production.  The advisers of the Department should not be allowed to set their sights on two or three very good productive farmers in an area, build them us as goods in the area, write their biographies and say: &ldquo;This is what we can do in our area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All farmers in the area should be treated equally and there should be no dedication to the big man who has both the means and the method of doing things for himself.  Agricultural advisers should be instructed to direct their energies to the underprivileged in order to increase productivity in their case.  A great deal more attention will have to be paid to the underprivileged.  Those who can help themselves will need advice only on very, very technical matters.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the warble fly extermination scheme came to an end so quickly. That scheme will have to be re-introduced. It was ill-advised on the part of the Department to cease operating this scheme.  I was told that the warble fly infestation was about 3 or 4 per cent.  That is an absurd estimate because, no matter where one goes in the summer, one sees a cow or a calf obviously infected with warble fly.  The percentage must be much higher.  The scheme of eradication must be re-introduced promptly.  Hides are very important and I hope every effort will be made to get rid of this infestation for the benefit of exports.  Eradication is important to the dairy farmer because warble fly infestation affects milk yields.</P>
    <P>I have been critical of the Department but, if one is to do one's duty, then one must be critical.  I can assure the Minister that I am critical only in the interests of the agricultural community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It may seem strange for a city Deputy to discuss agriculture. It is our most important industry and the Minister has told us that State investment in agriculture has reached almost £100 million.  There is every justification then for all and sundry discussing agriculture.  I do not know a great deal about all the facilities available, but I certainly know that the failure of the economy at the moment is particularly felt in the field of agriculture. There is no proper co-ordination. We have a patchwork of subsidies. This probably goes back to the days when the Department was set up by the British.</P>
      <P>We depend mainly on agriculture and, if we are to have a proper agricultural policy, we will have to make radical changes.  There is at the moment large-scale rural poverty and social decay.  I have seen that in the west and in Donegal.  It is very evident in these areas.  We should aim at building up a dynamic social life and a healthy economic growth in these areas.</P>
      <P>We are inclined to consider rural Ireland in isolation, almost as if it were a reservation like the Indian reservations in the United States of America.  This is quite wrong.  It takes only three hours to get from one side of Ireland to the other.  The problems of agriculture can be solved only within the framework of a properly planned economic and social policy.  We should establish a farming structure which will result in commercially viable farms run by competent farmers.  I dare say the Minister expects me to come out with some heresy which will give him an opportunity later of denouncing the Labour Party.  I should like to see more control over production, distribution and marketing.  Deputy Foley talked about the price of farm produce in our cities and towns.  It is not the farmers who are making the profits.</P>
      <P>There is grave discontent and disappointment with the present Land Commission.  We should have a proper land policy, a policy which will ensure that land is available on acceptable terms to young farmers with the ability to work the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>But that is exactly what is wrong.  There is this strange divorce.  We are inclined to consider these things in isolation.  One cannot talk about agriculture without talking about land.  Land and agriculture should be considered together because they go hand in hand.  The Department was, as I said, set up by the British and it has adopted an attitude of exclusiveness. It had its own programme in opposition to the programme for economic expansion.  It set up its own investigating team into the efficiency of agriculture and acted quite independently of the CIO set up by the Department of Industry and Commerce. This demonstrates the attitude of exclusiveness on the part of the Department. This must be changed.</P>
      <P>We should involve the farming community to the maximum extent in matters relating to agricultural policy. They should be represented on all boards.  There must be more involvement where the farmers are concerned.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about the co-operative movement.  There is need to concentrate more on this.  We should encourage fruit farming among small farmers and so ensure increased incomes for them and probably more leisure.  I should like to see a farmers' insurance scheme on a co-operative basis and probably initially underwritten by the State.  I heard Deputy Foley talk about the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I should like them to extend their facilities so that no worthwhile project would be held up for lack of credit.  The potential of each enterprise should be the criterion. While it may be said that this would be the responsibility of the Minister for Lands I should like a rural development corporation to replace the Land Commission and settle as many farmers as possible on economic farms. I should like to see them build up a land bank that would be available to young farmers.  I would also advocate control of land ownership by non-nationals if Ireland should enter the EEC.  I shall not say more on that subject since it is not relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1178" /> I should like to see the fertiliser industry come under public ownership so that the farming community would have a greater say in it.  I should like the co-operative movement to expand. The Department might consider setting up a national co-operative scheme to encourage co-operatives throughout the country.  They are not sufficiently encouraged. There should be co-operatives to produce and supply all animal foodstuffs including home produced ones such as fishmeal and skim milk.</P>
    <P>We have different boards such as the Meat Marketing Board and the export boards but, looking at it from the outside, I think there is unnecessary duplication and that if we had a national export board to co-ordinate the activities of these various bodies and avoid duplication it would be a good idea.  By this means we might be able to place greater importance on branded products and ensure that these quality products would be branded so that we would have greater access to foreign markets.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in the western farmer because I see tremendous poverty and decay in the west.  The present subsidy structure discriminates against the west.  A recent survey showed that farms of less than 30 acres, which predominate in the west, provide an average income of under £6 a week.  Dr. O'Connell of the Economic and Research Institute, in a paper presented to the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland in 1970, offered a breakdown of the payment of the main agricultural subsidies between the provinces.  The interesting thing is that he said that the payment per farmer in Munster in 1966 was £155 but in Connaught it was only £17.  This is discrimination against the western farmer.  Total subsidy payments affecting farm incomes averaged £175 per farm in Munster but only £25 in Connaught.  If we are to help the west we should seriously consider matters like that.</P>
    <P>When I spoke of co-operatives I did not suggest that the Government should run them.  The Government should promote them.  The co-operatives should be run democratically by the people involved.  Grants should be <Col N="1179" /> available for buildings owned by co-operatives. There should be more emphasis on research to find the most appropriate agricultural products for a region.  An adequate advisory service on production and management should be available.  I think there is a research project on sheep production at Maam. This is to be encouraged and the idea should be expanded.</P>
    <P>There is also discrimination against the smaller farmer under such schemes as the beef incentive scheme.  The Minister should seriously consider this.  A distinction should be drawn between agricultural incentive schemes for the region and the social policy payment.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry has been neglected.  While a staggering profit was made last year the potential of the industry has not been thoroughly exploited.  We are an island and the wealth is beside us but we are not utilising it.  We should be pouring capital into this industry that could bring prosperity to the country.  We should have fish-processing plants in the towns around the coast.  This industry could literally provide an extra 10,000 people with employment.  Instead, we are talking of the EEC and we are going to give them an open invitation to exploit our resources.  If we enter the EEC we shall find that the following morning their members will have fishermen around our coast because they know at present the wealth of our seas.  They are availing of it while we are not.  I should certainly support much more investment in the fishing industry and all ancillary aspects of it.  We should be exporting fish on a vast scale.  Instead, in our supermarkets you see canned fish on every shelf.  This is not right when there is an industry available that could employ so many.</P>
    <P>The need for co-operatives has been shown by the price of farm produce in Dublin.  I read in the trade union information leaflet last month that potatoes had increased in price by 50 per cent last year.  The farmer is not getting that profit.  It is a terrible indictment of all of us if the farmer is not getting the money when the Dublin housewife has to pay so much.  The co-operative movement is needed to stop exploitation <Col N="1180" /> by middlemen of both farmers and housewives.  Something should be done urgently about this.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to the abuse of antibiotics because this comes under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  This is a very serious problem.  The Minister should be aware of this fact and if he were a Minister who was dynamic about it he would say that it was a serious problem that would affect cattle and also people because there is a cross-transference of resistence due to the indiscriminate use of antibiotics in cattle.  The Department have control over this problem and they will be directly responsible if the present position is allowed to continue.  When people become ill and need lifesaving antibiotics they will find that because of this cross-transference of resistence the antibiotics will not be of any avail at the crucial moment.  Dr. Ellen Geraghty in the Royal College of Surgeons has definitely proved that there is this cross-transference of resistance to antibiotics from cattle to human beings.  I would ask the Minister to take immediate measures to curb this indiscriminate use of antibiotics.</P>
    <P>I wish now to talk about sheep and sheepskins.  We have an anomalous situation in that you can export as many hides as you like without a licence.  The hides are not necessary to keep the leather industry going.  But, for some peculiar reason sheepskins cannot be exported except under licence.  We are always talking about exports but this extraordinary situation has puzzled me greatly.  I think vested interests are being served by this prohibition on the free exportation of sheepskins.  As I said, you can export sheepskins only under licence, and then only 20 per cent of the sheepskins obtainable on the home market. Although this prohibition is operated by the Department of Industry and Commerce the matter comes under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>I know of one company, whose employees are constituents of mine, who were fined for exporting sheepskins. They were accused of exporting something like ten or 15 skins in excess of <Col N="1181" /> the allowed number.  This was despite the fact that they have a customs watcher who signs, seals and checks on the numbers.  It is a terrible situation that you should get into trouble for exporting.  I wrote to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries inquiring about the number of sheep and lambs slaughtered at meat export factories; I also asked for information about the number of sheepskins exported by meat export premises.  I was told that this number was not available.  I do not know how we know about exports. The figures are not available in the Minister's Department but an official said that the Central Statistics Office might be&mdash;&ldquo;might be&rdquo;&mdash;in a position to help.  I received an acknowledgment from them.</P>
    <P>I was also told by the Department that information was not available about the total number of carcases of mutton and lamb disposed of on the home market by meat export premises. I think they get a subsidy on meat for export and some of these carcases are being sold on the home market.  Yet there is no information about the figures for carcases being sold on the home market.  Is there a subsidy being paid on these?  The Minister shakes his head.  He does not know.  No, no danger of that.  But how does he know when he does not know how many are sold on the home market?  The reply also stated that due to the very high standards of hygiene and production procedures now required at meat export premises&mdash;which is all right&mdash;and the consequential increase in the duties and responsibilities of the Department's veterinary staff at such factories it was not administratively feasible to keep records of domestic disposals of mutton and lamb on the basis of the number of carcases involved.  That is poppy-cock. The Minister is admitting something which he is not able to check on because his Department's veterinary inspectors are overworked.  That is what he is saying.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting point in regard to a breach of the regulations here.  Meat export factories are allowed to export freely all the sheepskins they like but in regard to the carcases that are sold on the home market, that are not exported, what happens to the <Col N="1182" /> sheepskins?  They are allowed to go out.  They are being sent out of the country so they are in breach of the regulations for carcases sold on the home market.  You cannot have it both ways.  If people are being deprived of exports why does it apply to one section and not to another?  Does the Minister understand what I am talking about?</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  It is an interesting point that they are stopping skins from being exported but yet meat export factories can export as much as they like because the carcases are being exported, but so many of these carcases are sold on the home market that the sheepskins belonging to those should not be allowed to be exported.</P>
      <P>The reply also stated that it was not possible for the Department's staff at meat factories to differentiate between skins from carcases which are exported and those from carcases which go for home consumption.  There is discrimination here against certain people and vested interests are involved.  I wonder why we cannot export sheepskins freely?  The Minister is progressive and I think he will see the injustice here.  I would appreciate if he could do something about it.  The company to which I refer is in danger of closing down. Let us look at these regulations and if vested interests are involved it is not right.  We have the Dungarvan factory saying: &ldquo;Oh, we need the sheepskins&rdquo; but what about the hides?  They need hides too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exports are very important for us. Time and again I have asked for a review of these regulations and I was told that if any alterations took place in the processing of sheepskins they would be allowed export them freely. I asked what type of processing and they would not specify the type.  I asked if pickling would do&mdash;and which this firm were prepared to do in order to retain their employees&mdash;but this was rejected by the Department.  They said &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Even for sheepskins which are <Col N="1183" /> wholly processed and sold as sheep-skin rugs licences are required, they said.  This is ridiculous.  I found myself hitting my head against a stone wall when I got replies from the Departments of Industry and Commerce and of Agriculture and Fisheries and from the Revenue Commissioners.  It is wrong that a firm should be almost made bankrupt because they were accused of exporting sheepskins in excess of the stipulated number, particularly as the customs man was there checking on it.  Like the Gestapo they went in and demanded books and sent inspectors up to the north to the firm's customers checking on the number of sheepskins.  This was wasting State money.  There is a great market for all sheepskins abroad and we should be availing of it.  I think the Minister is sincere enough to do something about it.</P>

      <P>As a western Deputy and farmer there are a few points I should like to put before the Minister regarding the west of Ireland.  The five western counties receive only £2½ million by way of milk subsidy whereas a sum of £32.4 million is paid throughout the country.  Milk is not produced as extensively in the west as in the southern and eastern regions and therefore our subsidy is much lower.</P>
      <P>Under the beef incentive scheme a grant is paid to any person who has 100 cows.  In the west of Ireland there are many small farmers who have only three or four cows and they cannot avail of this subsidy.  If this was paid to the farmers in the west of Ireland it would mean an increase in their incomes.  Although I am a farmer, I consider it is entirely dishonest to the taxpayers that they should have to pay for the subsidies granted to people who own 50 or 100 cows.  These people do not need this money; it could be used to alleviate the hardship of small farmers who are finding it difficult to survive, particularly in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to amend this scheme so that the grant is not paid to farmers who own more than 20 or 30 cows.  I was in milk production myself; when I became a Member <Col N="1184" /> of Dáil Éireann I discontinued with this line of production and I am now in the beef incentive scheme.  However, I do not like to see this scheme exploited and the taxpayers' money paid out at random.  From figures I have here I gather if a man has 20 cows he can get £400 from the Exchequer, later he could sell 20 calves and collect £1,000 for them.  These points are worth noting and the Minister should consider the payment of a grant to western farmers for the first two cows.  If this were done it would be of considerable benefit to people in the west of the country.</P>
    <P>In the west there are various supply stations and small creameries.  However, we should consider seriously the position of the creameries in the event of our entry into the EEC.  I believe there is a future for the milk industry in the Common Market and this would be of considerable benefit to the small farmers of the west.  They could develop their small holdings as a result of obtaining increased prices for milk in the EEC countries.</P>
    <P>Despite all the increases given by the Government in milk subsidies in the last six or seven years, it is strange that the farmer has not received any increase whatever.  To my mind the creameries are not viable and their costings are too high.  At the moment the farmer is not getting any more for milk than he received two years ago. I should like the Minister to let us know the position of those small creameries and to state how they will work in Common Market conditions. Perhaps the Minister might carry out an investigation to see if there is a possibility of the creameries amalgamating so that the farmers would be in a position to compete and operate a viable unit that would work in Common Market conditions.</P>
    <P>The matter of water supply is an important factor in milk production.  The Department of Agriculture will give a grant of £120 to a farmer for a bore well.  I have known several farmers in my area who have bored wells at a cost of £600 or £700.  It was essential for them to have milk coolers and therefore a water supply was vital. However, the sum of £120 is a very small contribution having regard to the <Col N="1185" /> increased cost of materials at the present time.  I appreciate that the Department of Agriculture are co-operating with the Department of Local Government where the cost of group water supply schemes exceeds a certain figure.  These group water supply schemes are a rural matter and I should like the Department of Local Government to hand over to the Department of Agriculture the responsibility for such schemes.  The Minister should give consideration to increasing the grant for bore wells.  In many cases it is necessary to go down 200 or 300 feet; in addition, the person has to pay about £2 15s per foot for the first 120 feet; he has to buy a pump which will cost in the region of £100, with the necessary equipment.  In very many cases the ultimate cost of the well is £700 or £800.</P>
    <P>There is an Erin Foods processing plant in Tuam and there are several bacon factories in the west of Ireland but this is really the only industry that exists in this part of the country.  In my town there are two bacon factories but it is necessary to import pigs from Northern Ireland to keep these factories operating.  This should not happen.  In my own town there are over 200 people working in a big bacon factory.  They are the most hard-working people in Ireland.  The bacon factory is progressing well but cannot get sufficient pigs to keep it going.  Sometimes pigs have to be brought from the north.  I would like to see five or six pig fattening stations erected in County Mayo or in the bordering counties which would supply these two bacon factories which are a great asset to the community, to the people who work there and particularly to the farmers.  One of the most successful pig fattening stations in Ireland is operating on a co-operative basis in Balla, County Mayo.  If a number of these pig fattening stations were established to supply the two bacon factories we could double the employment there.  Not alone that, but emigration would be reduced.  What we want in this country is more production, and this is what will keep the people in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there is an extensive land project scheme operating <Col N="1186" /> under the Department.  I must compliment the officers on the land project scheme for the wonderful work they are doing.  However, these people are handicapped in so far as the farmers with whom they are dealing cannot benefit from the arterial drainage scheme there.  There are 800 extra drainage jobs which the Moy drainage people have practically refused to do. As a result thousands of farmers will be unable to avail of this land project. Some scheme should be implemented whereby the main drain could be opened between townlands where this drainage business was being carried out in order to give a chance to the farmers who live there to avail of the land project grants.  There has to be a certain depth of drain before a person can qualify.</P>
    <P>Again in connection with this Moy drainage scheme, over the past few months or few years silt has got into the pipes of some of these land project schemes.  Complaints and representations have been made to the Board of Works and they have decided they will not carry out these extra drainage schemes.  I cannot see why County Mayo is allowed only £35,000 for drainage and roads.  We have no money at all for this type of work.  If the Minister could give a 100 per cent grant for the outside drain this would be a wonderful asset to the farming community, particularly where drainage works are needed.</P>
    <P>There have been various protests in recent months and in years past by the various farmers' organisations.  The NFA and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association are protesting about their income and maintain it is not keeping pace with that of industrial workers.  There is no doubt whatsoever that the price of agricultural production is not satisfactory, whether it is the price of milk or anything else. The price of pigs has not increased wonderfully.  Take the price paid by Erin Foods for potatoes, something in the region of £11 to £12 per ton.  As a farmer, I know exactly what it costs to produce potatoes, and I cannot see how any farmer could sell potatoes under £18 or £20 a ton and have a reasonable profit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> Let me quite honest and say I am not fully behind the manner in which the farming organisations are protesting. They have refused to buy agricultural machinery.  This is only helping the Government because it reduces imports of machinery.  This is not the way I would do it.  I am a member of the NFA and I am a farmer.  As such I do not entirely agree with their helping the Government who have failed to meet them and Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries who, in the past, failed to meet them on the steps of Leinster House.  I do not agree with farmers helping the economy when the machinery is not imported.</P>
    <P>I saw recently on the &ldquo;Late, Late Show&rdquo; a group of farmers, including Mr. Maher the Leader of the NFA and the Leader of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, drafted from all over the country.  I should like to know if these people were paid to appear on that television programme. One man from my own county stated that he had four acres of arable land and five acres of bog and he classed himself as a farmer.  Any man coming from my county who classes himself as a farmer with four acres of arable land and five acres of bog should be ashamed of himself.  He does not represent the farming community. This type of man should not be allowed to appear on television because he never had a hope of surviving in the west of Ireland without other means of support.  The vast majority of the farms in the west are around 20 to 30 acres.  Some of the farmers are part-timers, but they are as successful as any farmers in the rest of the country.  I must compliment Mr. Maher and the leader of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers for their contributions that night, they were a credit to the farmers, but the representative from Macra na Feirme should have prepared himself better to go on television.</P>
    <P>We have all read the statement made by the Minister for Lands on part-time farmers in the west of Ireland.  I hope Deputy Gibbons will never make such a statement.  The first thing to do is to get the job done and then one can look for praise, but that statement was only bluff, in the same way as talk about <Col N="1188" /> the Land Commission going to Castlebar and the Department of Education going to Athlone was bluff.  There is no point in people talking unless there is a realistic approach behind what they say.  Why should a member of the Government make such a statement unless it was decided that such action would take place?  What we want is action.  My constituency has been represented for the past 20 years by two Ministers, but what industry has come there?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture spoke about part-time farming and that is what I am dealing with.  I would like to see industries, but not industrial estates like the ones in Galway city and Cork city, where farmers could be temporarily employed, so that they could be part-time farmers as well. Parts of my county are 80 and even 90 miles from Galway city, which makes it impossible for a part-time farmer to work in Galway city.  This talk about part-time farming is a farce.  The Government should approach the problem in a logical way and ensure that industries are scattered throughout the west of Ireland.  In this way part-time farming could be implemented.</P>
      <P>A constituent of mine who built a pig fattening unit and then applied to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for money to stock that piggery was refused by them.  I do not think the Agricultural Credit Corporation should refuse to finance anyone who wants to go into production but this has happened on two occasions in my constituency. Any person prepared to go into production should be helped by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I have been in contact with the Agricultural Credit Corporation about these two cases but still they have refused. Production benefits the economy of the country and those who want to engage in it should get all the support they need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to deal with the new regulations regarding the purchase of wool.  I had a Parliamentary Question down to the Minister but I did not <Col N="1189" /> receive a satisfactory answer.  The first regulation is that 880 square feet of floor space is required; around which there is supposed to be a five foot wall. The floor space is to be divided into sections for the different grades of wool and special lights and special scales have to be installed.  In addition, everyone must go for a course in wool grading.  Is this a deliberate move to push out the small wool buyer?</P>
    <P>What is this country coming to?  Are we here to help the foreign financiers, the tycoons, who are coming in here, or are we here to protect our people who have made a living, or part of a living, traditionally through the years in this line?  Why these stringent regulations?  Why are they being imposed when the price of wool, at 3s per lb, does not make it worth while clipping?  Fifteen years ago I was getting something in the region of 6s, 7s and 8s per lb for wool.  Today it is being sold for 2s and 3s.  Surely there is something seriously wrong?  I ask the Minister if he can tell me who is responsible for these stringent regulations.</P>

I have brought it to the Minister's attention and I trust those people will be protected.  I am not here to protect any man who does not buy and grade wool properly, but where a man has been buying wool during the past 40 years, surely it is ridiculous to ask him to go on a course in order that he may be able to grade?  Surely if a man has been 20 or 30 years at it he does not need to go for a course of one week in grading?  If I were to go to the institute in Ballinrobe and talk to the lads I would have this thing off <Col N="1190" /> by heart in about one day.  Those people have been at it traditionally all their lives.  They know what a fleece of wool is and how to grade it.  As I have said, I would not protect any man who would hinder the trade.

      <P>The main thing that strikes me about this debate is that there has not been a great deal of reference to Europe.  It seems to me that a debate on agriculture at this stage should be mainly concerned with how our people should gear the agricultural industry to go into Europe and to take full advantage of all the benefits that are to be gained by being in Europe.  Everybody will agree we are an agricultural country: that is the essential nature and background of our industry.  Other industries are growing quickly but it will be a long time before the nature of Ireland is anything but agricultural.</P>
      <P>There are things wrong with agriculture today which should not be wrong.  First is the antipathy that exists between the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the farming organisations.  I will not say who is to blame for this antipathy, but it is there and it is surely regrettable as well as ludicrous that in a nation essentially agricultural in its makeup and its physical layout there should be antipathy, to use a mild word, in the relationship between the Department in charge of fostering our main industry and the persons working within the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, I do not know where the blame for that lies but I feel that the reason why it grew in the first instance was the failure of those charged with the administration of agriculture in the Department to consult with or listen to the people engaged in the industry.  From speaking to farmers&mdash;I know this is what they feel and believe&mdash;I have learned that the reason for the present relationship is a history of non-consultation, a history of the announcement of decisions after they have been taken, of rather rigid attitudes towards general problems and towards individual problems that <Col N="1191" /> might be outside the norm of the general situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his Annual Farm Review, contained in the Department's Farm Bulletin of December, 1970, paints quite a rosy picture of our agricultural industry.  It is a wide ranging review: It deals with the Common Market and the fact that in the Minister's opinion there is no alternative but to go into the Common Market.  He deals with some of the arguments put up by opponents of the policy of entry to Europe and deals adequately with them, because those arguments have no real substance.</P>
    <P>The other part of the Minister's review deals with the state of the industry and there is great emphasis on the amount of Government support, the inference I draw from it being that he is saying: &ldquo;We are doing an awful lot for you.  You should not be whinging. We are a most generous Government.&rdquo; He deals at one stage with two items, the £30 million support for milk and the £20 million for rates relief, and points out that these constitute half of the £100 million made available by the Government to agriculture.  In one of these figures, the £20 million for rates relief, I think we find part of what has been wrong with agriculture because that rates relief is an indiscriminate relief: the inefficient man who does not deserve it gets it and the rich man who does not need it gets it, granted to a lesser extent than the poor man, but he gets it.  To spend £20 million indiscriminately in this way and not to ensure that there is more and efficient production is not proper.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he is open to any practical suggestions for improving agriculture and states that the money raised must be distributed fairly. He said he would welcome constructive and orderly dialogue with farmers' representatives. The very wording of that indicates the attitude of the Minister and his Department towards the farming organisations.  Why not say, &ldquo;We welcome dialogue&rdquo;?  The implication that dialogue would be otherwise than orderly and constructive is unfair and insulting to them and explains the antagonism and the apathy that exist and have existed for so long.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> I should like to examine the argument in this review at page 6 under the heading &ldquo;Comments and Suggestions by Various Organisations&rdquo;.  In the first example is quoted a comment, which the Minister regards as unconstructive, from the Advisory Officers Association. Then he goes on: &ldquo;Another association, the NFA ...&rdquo; A stranger reading that would imagine that the NFA were some sort of a minor organisation of no status in our community, and of no standing <i>vis-á-vis</i> the farming industry.  It is easy to understand why the NFA feel there is a reaction to them in the Department not altogether sympathetic.</P>
    <P>We are on the verge of entry into Europe and at this stage, with all the opportunities that involves for the agricultural industry, one would imagine that all the persons engaged in the administration of agriculture, and those engaged in working in the industry, would be planning as vigorously as possible, and with as much empathy as possible, towards gearing ourselves to go in and take advantage of that situation, that there would be a complete and thorough examination and analysis of the structure and workings of our agricultural industry to see how it needs to be changed or modified so as to gain something for the people in it who have had hard lives up to this, lives without the benefits that other members of the community have had and to improve the lives of the people in it by taking advantage of entry into Europe.</P>
    <P>There are no radical changes.  So far as I am aware no detailed and deep analyses are being carried out.  It is a great pity that the present system with its inefficient subsidisation and antipathy between workers and administrators will continue to exist after we go into Europe.  If any changes come about they will not come through any thought or action on our part, but by force of the circumstance of association with the European Community in the intimate fashion in which it will obtain.</P>
    <P>In the December <i>Farm Bulletin</i> there is an article headed &ldquo;Irish Agriculture in the EEC&rdquo; and the author is Dr. E. A. Atwood.  He mentions the <Col N="1193" /> European Community agricultural plan and he emphasises that it is not a detailed plan but that it sets out certain principles which, by and large, appear to be acceptable to the European Community and which consequently will affect us in a very short time.  He regrets that the principles of the implementation of this plan have not been discussed here at all or hardly discussed.</P>
    <P>The first principle of this plan which he mentions is that it must be acceptable to farmers who have to participate on an entirely voluntary basis.  To my mind, there has been no education by the Department of the farmers on what this plan involves.  There has been no systematic campaign of lectures throughout the length and breadth of the country to make Irish farmers aware of what the European agricultural plan involves.  The Minister can complain in his statement in the bulletin that the anti-Common Market campaigners with their emotive propaganda can do harm but, in my submission, his Department are not doing sufficient to combat this emotive and superficially attractive propaganda by the Common Market study group against entry.  It is unfair to the farmers to leave them in a state where they do not know what agriculture in the EEC will mean for them.</P>
    <P>The second condition of this European farm plan is that it can be adapted to meet the varying needs of different regions.  I wonder has any study been initiated or even thought of by the Department as to how our farming region will fit into the overall European pattern, what the emphasis should be in production, presentation of products, marketing, and whether there are particular regional problems which we will have that should be drawn to the attention of our negotiators in Brussels so that account can be taken of them in the course of negotiations.</P>
    <P>Again, the programme will not be implemented by the European Community as such.  It will be for the member States to implement the farm plan. Have any preliminary discussions been initiated to decide how we might take advantage of some of the proposals contained in this, or how we will <Col N="1194" /> bring up the income of our agricultural workers to the level of their industrial colleagues, or how we will ensure that agricultural workers, people engaged in farm work, will have the same conditions&mdash;a five day week and annual holidays&mdash;as people outside?  Have we done any preliminary studies to see how this very desirable goal can be attained?  I am not aware that we have.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that any thought has been given to the change in the present structure of the administration of our agricultural industry.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that something radical may have to be done.  The present set up of the Department's advisory services on a county basis, the relationship with the various farming organisations and the marketing organisations, all these will possibly have to be drastically restructured before we can face Europe and before we can begin to think about organising ourselves to get the benefits of going in there.</P>
    <P>The first thing we have to decide is what new investment can be made in agriculture.  At the moment investment in agriculture, as far as the farmer is concerned is the payment of a grant for a specific purpose or he may get a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, or there may be hidden subsidies by way of support for milk prices or rates relief, but there is not a sufficient follow up to ensure that this investment is efficiently spent and that there will be a good return from that investment.  If a farmer wants to build a lean-to for cows he applies for a farm grant and gets it.  There is no investigation as to whether he needs it and there is no investigation as to whether his farm will be more efficient as a result of this investment by the Government.</P>
    <P>It appears from the White Paper on Agriculture that there will be a saving of at least £36 million per year in price supports and export subsidies which will be available for direct investment in agriculture by the Department.  This is a substantial sum and it should go a very long way towards providing adequate investment for any developments that might be intended.  The whole difficulty is that while there may be money &mdash;and I would hope that there will be money&mdash;to provide capital for this industry, <Col N="1195" /> there is no machinery for its proper investment.  If every farmer could get a cheque for whatever sum he thought fit for his needs there is no way of ensuring that his opinion of his needs is correct and that he will spend the money given to him and afterwards utilise the investment in the best possible manner.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to what I was saying originally about the lack of communication or the antipathy between the administrators who make these investment payments and the farmers who use them.  The local agricultural advisory services are the only bridge between the two sections and these are so taken up with advising farmers on the running of their farms on a day-to-day <i>ad hoc</i> basis they are unable to give long-term advice. Indeed, one wonders sometimes if these advisory services possess within themselves the necessary business acumen to ensure that the money is well spent. I have seen excellent farm land and I have seen land which has been completely unproductive.  A farmer is at the mercy of his local adviser for the proper management of a farm of perhaps 100 acres worth £15,000 to £20,000; one would imagine that for the care, management and control of such a capital sum highly skilled advice should be available all the way along.</P>
    <P>It is important that, if there is going to be a proper investment in farming, there should be full and complete co-operation with the farmers themselves at all levels.  They should have a voice in policy making and in the direction and spending of this investment.  We must have local enthusiasm and initiative. They are essential for the success of any venture.  At the moment we have not got this because there is too much centralised control.  What I would propose is that at this stage the Minister should take a very hard look at the present administration of the agricultural industry and the aim should be to involve all farmers more actively in that administration.</P>
    <P>I think, too, that some new body such as a rural development authority will have to be considered.  Such an authority would have to be organised <Col N="1196" /> on two levels, on a national level and on a local level.  On the national level, all the farming organisations should be represented, together with the representatives of manufacturing industries with interests in agriculture, representatives from the Department and, on local level, there would be officials from the national body plus local farmers and members of the advisory service together with some members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I have in mind that this rural development authority would take over many of the operating functions of the Department.  It would take charge of the advisory services and farm buildings.  It would, to be logical, take over the Agricultural Credit Corporation. It would also want to take over the Department of Lands, or certainly some functions of that Department, because, if it is to be a proper rural development authority, it must have control of everything affecting rural development.  I envisage a development authority on which farmers would be not merely represented but would be listened to and actually participate in decision-making.  That could lead to an upsurge of morale in the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>At local level it would again have to have fairly wide executive functions. It would not want to be just a debating chamber.  Organised on a local basis, it would be available for contact by the individual farmers, a body before whom they could go to put forward their views and make their problems easily known.  A farmer planning development, or seeking capital assistance, could go to his local branch of the rural development authority and put his plan before the skilled personnel manning it.  I would hope, too, that these local bodies would have their own budgets from which they could invest directly in their own local areas, with all the intimacy of supervision that that would entail.  This rural development authority would, in fact be the farmer's bank and the farmer's adviser and planner.  It would involve the farmer individually at all stages.</P>
    <P>Some of the facilities are already there from the Agricultural Credit Corporation but this body is based in <Col N="1197" /> Dublin and its administration is centralised. It has local agents in an effort to get the full picture on any application. My colleague, Deputy Finn, mentioned a constituent of his who, to all intents and purposes, qualified for a loan but did not get it.  If the structure were different, with a body at county level to which the farmer could go and be interviewed on the spot, the farmer could be satisfied that there were good reasons for refusal and he could be advised of some better investment as an alternative.  At the moment the body in Dublin makes the decision and that is the end of it as far as the farmer is concerned; we have yet another farmer with a sense of frustration and morale diminished that much more.</P>
    <P>The type of financing available for agriculture consists of subsidies which, of their very nature, are both indiscriminate and inefficient.  There are grants or short-term loans.  Very often these are personal loans.  Investment in agriculture should be considered on a different basis.  It should be considered as a long-term investment, as long as the term provided by the Land Purchase Acts, and the repayments should be a charge on the land and not a personal charge on the farmer.  If there was an investment of some thousands of pounds in a farm and the farmer decided to sell then the repayment of that investment would be carried over to his successor because the successor would be taking over the benefit of the investment.  That would make farmers keener to accept loans.  Many of them do not want to accept loans because they are afraid of the implications of a loan.  If they thought that the personal liability would run with the land there would be a greater willingness to accept investment by those farmers who need it.</P>
    <P>This authority could be set up.  The type of investment would be geared to that farmer's specific needs.  He would have the benefit of expert advice, not just local advice.  The administration of these ideas is something that would merit long and detailed discussion but something radical is required so that Irish farming and its organisation can be restructured away from the present position.  We are on the edge of Europe <Col N="1198" /> with a bland climate and in a position because of that principally and because of our soil characteristics to produce all types of food, with the possible exception of tomatoes, of a better quality and at a price cheaper than any competitor in Europe.  We could, in effect, become Europe's larder and it would be a pity if our industry was not geared to take advantage of these assets; to ensure that our production is efficient in relation to price and high in terms of quality and that the selling organisation is aggressive and vigorous and that the hall-mark of all our products would be quality.  These things can be achieved but I fear they will not be achieved under the present structure of Irish agriculture.  Radical changes must be made before all these things can follow.</P>
    <P>If we had this restructuring with a rural development authority at national level and its county boards at local level and if it got the confidence of the farming community you could then progress a further step towards the implementation of the European Farm Plan, the provision of the five-day week and holidays for farmers.  The only way this can be done is by farmers co-operating; whether in groups of two or six, I cannot suggest, but there must be some form of co-operation.  The individual unit, if the man living on it is to have any quality of life, cannot survive as we know it at present.  A whole mental attitude must change before the Irish farmers come to appreciate this and operate any system different from the present one.  A big factor in changing that mental attitude would be a complete restructuring of the administration of agriculture.  If you had the rural development authority with its local boards having real autonomy in their operation, I would visualise them getting the confidence of their workers and being able to arrange two-farm or three-farm operation, whatever might be desirable and necessary to meet the exigencies of any particular situation and area.  We could set a headline for other agricultural communities in Europe.  We could be the first country in Europe able to implement the European Farm Plan in terms of leisure and income for farm workers.  By farm workers I do not mean agricultural <Col N="1199" /> labourers but anybody working on the land, employer and employee.</P>
    <P>This should be a most exciting time for Irish agriculture.  There should be a wind of change abroad.  There should be active and vigorous consultation between all sections of the community, Government, farming organisations and advisory services, to see how best we can take advantage of this exciting time on the eve of entry into the biggest and richest market in the world.  But instead we have the sad spectacle of farmers' organisations mounting protests which are gathering momentum and which will lead to a difficult clash with the Government.  We have the spectacle of protests by Irish farmers taking place in our towns.  There is something seriously wrong when these things happen at this time.  I urge the Minister and his Department to realise that the people in the industry are more important than any principles of bureaucratic administration or any question of saving face or deciding who is the boss and that without the goodwill and enthusiasm of our farmers we shall not be able to take advantage of all that Europe can offer.</P>
    <P>The only way in which I think the Department can get back the trust of farmers&mdash;that trust has been lost for so long that it will be difficult to recover&mdash;is to offer a completely new deal on the lines on which I have been speaking, an undertaking by the Department to examine the structure with a view to setting up an entirely new structure in which the farmers will have a full and real voice.  If that can be done and the confidence of the farmers restored, with their energy and enthusiasm there will be no doubt that they will be able to turn their industry into a highly profitable and desirable one, to the benefit of the nation as a whole and to their individual benefit.</P>

      <P>Although many speakers have referred to various aspects of the Department's policy in this debate the first and most important aspect of it, to which I would direct the Minister's attention, is the present situation existing between the Minister, the Government and the farmers.  I am not blaming anybody for it but I am <Col N="1200" /> long enough connected with agriculture to know what can happen in a dispute of this kind.  I recently attended a meeting of the Beet Growers' Association and this matter was discussed at length.  I gave my advice: try to fix it up; try to settle it before it is too late; try to iron out whatever difficulties there are between the Department and the farmers.  Surely we are not going to dissipate the short time we have in which to organise before our entry into the Common Market by having rows between ourselves?  It is a shame and a disgrace and something for which future generations will blame somebody.</P>
      <P>I have a long memory of farmers having grievances with the Department and the Government and I well remember the results; I do not want to see that happening again.  There must be some way of coming together to iron out these problems.  We have various problems, problems within the State, but surely this is one problem on which we can come together to iron out.  I appeal to the Minister, the Government and to the farmers to get together immediately before disaster strikes the farmers and before we will be facing different situations that I am aware of.  These problems are not so serious that they cannot be overcome. The farmers state that their incomes have not increased in comparison with incomes of everybody else and nobody can deny that.  Their incomes have remained stationary while other incomes have increased by from 10 per cent to 30 per cent.  Let nobody tell me that they have not got a legitimate grievance. With goodwill between all concerned this matter could be settled in a very short time.  The first thing to do is to get together, not for an hour or two but for a day or a week, or a month if it is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Minister and the Government that the frame of mind among the farming community is deteriorating day by day and in the not too distant future, although I hope I am a bad prophet, something will happen which will make it a lot more difficult to arrive at some kind of agreement.  I am sincere when I urge that a meeting be called immediately to iron out this difficulty.  The Minister <Col N="1201" /> will be meeting a lot of people in the meantime; he will be going to the Common Market, he will be talking on various aspects of farming, but this is the most serious problem facing him. The people to whom I have been speaking make it quite clear that in the very near future the Minister will have something more serious on his hands if he and the Government do not come to terms with the agricultural organisations.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in farming organisations there are people who may be rash and hard to deal with but the vast majority are honest people anxious to see the country and agriculture advance.  That is the reason I am making this plea.  Something must be done about it very quickly.  I have had long experience of farming organisations; I have been a member of a county committee of agriculture for nearly a quarter of a century, Chairman of the Central Council of County Committees for a long time and I have had a lot of experience dealing with the Department's officials.  I should like to pay tribute to those officials.  They are the best set of officials in the country. They are dedicated men, experts in their own job and easy to discuss problems with, and I would say to the Minister that he has a more dedicated set of officials than any other Minister. Sometimes when officials are blamed for one thing or another it is not realised that they are only the mouthpieces, if you like, of the Minister, of the Government and they are just putting forward the policy handed to them. I know many of these men and I know their work and the improvements they have brought about in various aspects of agriculture, in regard to the advisory services that have grown up and generally the great benefit they have been to the community.  Such a dedicated group makes the work of a Minister easy and while the Minister also may be blamed at times he has to act within the limits of the finances the Government provide for him.  His officials are a credit to the Department and the country.</P>
    <P>Another very important problem facing us is our entry into the Common Market.  Have we done everything possible to prepare the farmers for this <Col N="1202" /> advance, as I would call it, this entry into the Common Market when we will be facing competition from countries like France, Germany, Holland and Denmark all with a tradition of farming and who have developed their farming industry to a very high degree? Having travelled a little bit around Europe I can say that our farmers are as good as the farmers in any other country and we have nothing to fear from them.  We have many advantages which farmers in Europe have not got. If we are geared for entry into the Common Market and if we get the necessary assistance from the Government and from our negotiators the farming community will be able to compete on the same terms as any agricultural community in the Common Market.  Have we made every effort to prepare the farmers for entry into the Common Market?  The answer lies with the Minister and with our negotiators.</P>
    <P>On many occasions our farmers were asked to produce certain commodities but when they did so they found that it was hard to dispose of them.  For years we have been exporting our agricultural products to the most depressed market in the world&mdash;the British market&mdash;in competition with the products dumped there by every other country.  Even in those difficult times the farmers did their best but I do not want to see this happen again.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated on several occasions, there should be a section dealing with prices and markets in the Department.  This section should carry out an investigation into market trends and be in a position to tell our farmers the likely prospects for various products during the year.  They should be able to tell the farmers when it is advisable to switch to another line of production and, in general, keep the farming community up-to-date with market demands. I should like the Minister to give us his views on this when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to the dairying industry.  Much money has been spent by the farming community in building up herds and in ensuring that the high quality of our milk is maintained.  It is now admitted throughout the world that our dairy products <Col N="1203" /> are a credit to this country and to the marketing organisations and we have reached the stage that we are unable to fulfil our export orders.</P>
    <P>The dairying industry is the foundation of agriculture in this country.  We are told that beef will be one of our major exports in the Common Market and that the prices obtaining there are much in excess of what we receive today. If we want a good beef industry we must have the calves and if a large number of farmers get out of milk we shall be in trouble.  I would appeal to the Minister to look into this matter.  It takes a long time to build up a good dairy herd&mdash;I would estimate ten or even 20 years&mdash;and it is disheartening to see people who spent much money in this line go out of dairying.  It is a tremendous loss to the agricultural community and to the country.  We should make every effort to encourage the farming community to continue with milk production because the outlook appears very good.</P>
    <P>A problem facing many beet growers is an increase in acreage.  This year is probably the only remaining year before we enter the Common Market when our quota will be taken into account.  For that reason we should make available as much acreage as possible for beet growing.  I asked the Minister a question on this matter recently and he said to me &ldquo;You have got enough mileage out of that&rdquo;.  I told him that I wanted acreage, not mileage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>You got that too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope when the Minister meets the beet growers he will discuss with them the matter of an increase in acreage.  This is an important industry for this country.  Beet is a rotation crop; it is good for the land and in addition there are the by-products needed for the feeding of cattle and sheep.  The distribution of the tops and pulp are of great assistance to farmers and represent a considerable saving.  For that reason when the Minister meets the Beet Growers' Association he should tell them that he will double the acreage for beet and make it at least 12,000 acres.  It would give <Col N="1204" /> employment and reduce the amount of animal feedingstuffs that are imported.</P>
      <P>Many skins and hides are exported and I have already stated that we should make some effort to process them and put them to use in this country. We are importing raw materials for many industries; we have these valuable products that would give worthwhile employment and would be of immense benefit to the economy. When we were exporting cattle on the hoof we had not that opportunity but now the meat factories&mdash;many of which have been set up by the farmers &mdash;give worthwhile employment.  Similarly, we should make every effort to see that all the skins and hides are sent to Irish industry and processed there.</P>
      <P>Many farmers have complained to me about the delay in the payment of grants.  Some people say the Government have a great deal of money.  I have never heard any of them admitting they were short of cash.  They should not be short of it because they have a good hold of it and it is very hard to extract from them grants which are awaiting payment sometimes for a year or a year-and-a-half.  Therefore I would ask the Government to pay these grants that are due as quickly as possible.  I come from Cork, a maritime county which has a very long sea-board and where a very important fishing harbour has been built recently. It is a credit to the Department that provided the funds and to the engineers and workmen that built it.  I would like to see it being fully utilised.  We have been told that a fishmeal factory will be established on an island near it, Dinis Island, Castletownbere.  This talk has been going on so long without anything being done that the people are beginning to think it has fallen through.  My information is that it is being investigated again.  The erection of that factory on the island, with a fine harbour and a great fishing potential near it, would not only give greater employment but also would supply a very important ingredient in our foodstuffs, protein, which we have been importing from other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort should be made before we enter the Common Market to gear <Col N="1205" /> our fishing industry to compete with the foreigners.  I am afraid it has been left too late.  I do not live too far from the coast and it is very sad to see Spanish and French trawlers fishing outside and within our territoral waters.  How can it pay fishermen from Spain, when they have to cross the Bay of Biscay, to come to our coast to fish?  We have the men and we ought to be able to provide them with boats and to educate them to fish in the waters that the Frenchmen and Spaniards find so profitable.</P>
    <P>There is great scope for expansion of our exports of mutton to the Continent and the prices are very good.  What are we doing to increase sheep and lamb production to meet this market?  This is an unlimited market available to us with excellent prices, but our sheep numbers have been reducing for a number of years.  Within the last ten years we have lost nearly a third of our sheep numbers; they have gone down from 6,000,000 to 4,000,000.</P>
    <P>The Department should find some way of increasing sheep numbers. There are many difficulties.  Farmers have had their sheep and lambs killed by dogs and foxes.  I would appeal to the Department to tighten restrictions on dogs roaming around the country, often without owners and also to deal with foxes in order to reduce their numbers.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of farming in which I am interested is herds and flocks. I remember a time&mdash;probably many other Members here do not&mdash;during the Economic War when the hide of a Hereford was worth only the same as the hide of a non-descript.  That position has changed.  At that time our cattle industry suffered a blow from which I do not think it will ever recover.  The then Government accomplished a great deal and we had as fine a herd of dairy shorthorns as was to be found in any country in the world. Much of the credit for that was due to former Ministers for Agriculture and to officials of the Department who bought the best of stock and encouraged farmers to breed from the best of stock.  It is most important at the moment that every animal reared is of the highest possible standard.</P>
    <P>The same applies to sheep.  Efforts <Col N="1206" /> are being made to improve the breeds of sheep and to get the type that is suited to the market.  It takes a long time to do this.  Sheep have been imported here from different countries of Europe for qualities that are needed here.  I hope to see the day when they will be distributed around to the farmers in order to improve our breeds of sheep.  I would appeal to the Minister and to the officials of his Department to do everything possible to improve the various breeds of farm animals.  Money spent in this direction is money well spent.  A large number of cattle were recently imported and they were quarantined in Spike Island where some of us were quarantined at a different time.  I hope they make better progress there than we did.  It is good to see Spike Island being used for something which is of value to the country.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with what I consider to be a very important aspect of agriculture&mdash;animal disease.  Have we done everything possible to reduce disease in our herds and flocks?  A great deal of money has been spent on bovine TB eradication.  We have built up through our veterinary service and through various offices in the country a team of experts and we have attacked the problem in a positive manner. But many farmers are asking: &ldquo;Have we gone far enough?  Are we getting results?&rdquo;  An earlier speaker said he did not think we were getting the desired results and I am afraid I have to voice the same opinion.</P>
    <P>It is disheartening to find that half the herds have gone down even though they have not had a reactor for maybe seven or eight years.  Other countries have got rid of TB and I do not see why we cannot do so.  I am sure the farming community are anxious to get rid of it because any farmer who has to test his cattle two or three times a year is in dire straits.  I appeal to all branches of the farming community to co-operate in every way possible with the veterinary service people in an effort to rid our cattle of TB.  If even one or two animals react another test takes place within 60 days and very often there is a chain reaction and the farmer cannot put his animals up for sale for 12 months.  This creates problems <Col N="1207" /> for the farmer both from the feeding and financial points of view.</P>
    <P>Cork was the first county to have an animal health committee.  It has done great work.  We are endeavouring to get rid of sheep scab which has had a very bad effect on our sheep flocks and has meant we were not able to export store sheep for a number of years.  We joined with Kerry and formed a committee to try to get rid of the disease and we should have it under control in a year or two.  They did it in Britain and there is no reason why we cannot do it.</P>
    <P>We co-operated with the Department in an effort to get a type of sheep dip that would be recognised.  We were told that experiments had been carried out for many years but they had proved unsuccessful.  We then put forward the idea of tagging sheep just as cattle are tagged for TB but we found there were not sufficient tags available.  There is a golden opportunity here for any industrialist to set up a factory to produce tags.  It amazes me to think that we cannot produce plastic tags in order to tag the sheep in Cork and Kerry.  If the idea was a success these tags would be used all over the country.</P>
    <P>My constituency probably produces the largest number of fat pigs in the country and we have been agitating for many years to get a bacon factory established in West Cork.  I have seen money subscribed by farmers only to find that vested interests have blocked the building of a factory.  At the present time we are trying to get a factory built.  We are also trying to increase the number of pigs produced because if we can increase the number of pigs the establishment of a new factory will not affect factories already in operation.  The co-operative society of which I am a member is building a factory at enormous expense.  We are hoping the Department will help us by giving us the same grants as they have made available to other counties and we shall be calling to their offices shortly to collect our share.</P>
    <P>We are endeavouring to build up an industry in a part of the county which has been traditionally a pig fattening area.  Small farmers breed and feed pigs.  They know how to do the job <Col N="1208" /> and if a bacon factory was established in the area it would be of immense help in keeping the population on the land.  The biggest difficulty has been the transportation of pigs to factories over 100 miles away and the importation of feeding stuffs at a higher price than was paid in other parts of the county.</P>
    <P>Our store cattle trade plays an important part in the economy.  The chairman of the Irish Cattle Exporters Association has said that the closing of Birkenhead may interfere with the export of cattle which will have a detrimental effect on farmers.  I would ask the Minister and his advisers to ensure that the ports of entry into Britain are kept open for the flow of whatever Irish store cattle are available.</P>
    <P>I will not go over the points made by other speakers.  I will conclude as I started by expressing the hope that the Minister, the Government and the farmers will get together and finish this squabble that is going on.  The farmers have the goodwill of everybody in this country.  I am sure the difficulties are not insurmountable, that they can easily be fixed up by people of goodwill. I am appealing to the Minister, to the Government and the farmers to come together as soon as possible and fix up this dispute which has now been carried on for a number of months and which is in danger of disrupting the whole agricultural community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin my contribution on the note on which Deputy O'Sullivan finished.  I add my voice to his in an appeal to the Minister and the Government to make every effort as soon as possible to bring to an end the unfortunate trouble that exists between the farming community and the Government.  I fail to understand the Government thinking on this problem. It has been pointed out to them very clearly and on numerous occasions, and on no occasion has it been contradicted by the Government, that there is a discrepancy between the incomes of farmers and of industrial workers of approximately £8 per week. This is something that may seem enormous in relation to the number of people involved, but it has given us an average figure.  Of course, one is left to <Col N="1209" /> understand that the difference in a great many cases is very much greater.</P>
      <P>It is true to say, as Deputy O'Sullivan has put it, that this is not an insurmountable problem.  He pointed out that if the two sides came together in a spirit of goodwill, in a spirit determined to find a solution, there is no doubt it could be attained.  The sooner it is, the better, not only for agriculture but for the nation as a whole.</P>
      <P>It has always puzzled me why other sectors in the community can have negotiations and can hammer out long term agreements and have them implemented without the slightest difficulty, yet the same thing cannot be done in relation to the agricultural community.  The position at the moment is that farmers do not know what their income is likely to be in 12 months time.  The changing pattern of farming activities, the possibility of our entry to the EEC, are just so many years ahead in terms of thinking that the farmers deserve the sympathy of the nation because of the manner in which they are being treated by the Government.  At a time when agriculture should be expanding at a very fast rate in order to put it in a position to compete with some of the nations whom we will be joining in the EEC, there is restriction rather than expansion.</P>
      <P>There may be farmers who are not in immediate need of new machinery, but the land is crying out for lime. There are farmers who need to replace old machinery with new, and the limestone is piling up in the quarries instead of being put out on the land. If this situation is allowed to continue not only will it have serious adverse effects next year and for many years to come but it is something that the Government should be looking at from other points of view, particularly from the probable increase in unemployment as a result of this campaign.</P>
      <P>As the last speaker said, the sooner this is tackled the better.  If the Government were to call in the NFA now, it does not matter how long it would take, a solution would follow.  Agriculture needs an annual review more than any other sector in the economy.  It is vital for farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We used to hear Ministers for Agriculture <Col N="1210" /> and Fisheries saying they were unable to deal with the farmers because they lacked unity because there were too many farming organisations and they could never get any two of them to agree on any one point.  We have now an organisation representative of every sector in agriculture, united in a determination to improve agriculture and to help the nation, and as such they should be given a hearing at the highest level at the first opportunity. That would solve a great many problems, economically and otherwise. We are being reminded continually of our adverse external payments, our balance of payments.  This also is a recurring problem but it could be overcome largely if agriculture were able to expand at the rate at which it is capable of expanding now, and in the time between now and entry to the EEC.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned some of the main problems confronting farmers. One problem which he touched on is the declining sheep population. It is hard to pinpoint the reason for this.  If we enter the EEC we will have a ready and lucrative market for mutton and lamb and in addition for the by-produce, the wool clip.  One would have to see the terrible sight of sheep being ravaged by marauding dogs to appreciate how quickly a farmer could drop entirely the production of sheep.</P>

      <P>The statistics for 1970 show a deficit in our balance of trade with the United Kingdom amounting to approximately £66 million. This position is substantially the same as in 1969 and, as in that year, is due to the general trend towards increasing imports of goods, many of which were not dutiable and were not, therefore, affected in any way by the duty concessions in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>

      <P>I understand there has been some concern as to the extent of pollution in the vicinity of the west pier at Dún Laoghaire.  This arose because of a discharge of crude sewage from some houses in the area but, according to my information, this has since been remedied by Dún Laoghaire Corporation.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte are anxious to secure the greatest possible participation by tourist interests in each region in overseas promotional activities and they expect the regional tourism companies to encourage such participation by representatives of the tourist trade in their area.  The involvement of the tourist trade in overseas <Col N="1214" /> promotion represents a valuable addition to the general promotional activities pursued by Bord Fáilte and the board consider that the encouragement of such involvement is the most effective role for the regional companies to pursue in this sphere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a very urgent need for a rationalisation of the whole approach to on-the-spot selling by the various regional groups?  During the past couple of years there has been a tendency for one group to go to Britain one week and for another to go the next week with the result that there has been a certain amount of wasted effort and also a lack of co-operation.  Would the Minister look into this question of the whole approach to marketing?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether he is satisfied with the degree of co-operation which exists between Aer Lingus, Bord Fáilte, CIE and SFADCO and the regional tourism companies in the field of tourism promotion and marketing; and whether he proposes to take any steps to secure greater co-ordination of effort by these bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>All the bodies mentioned by the Deputy work in close co-operation in areas of common interest.  Co-operation includes the co-ordination of a wide range of activities including joint advertising, joint promotional campaigns, joint film production, joint handling of press, radio and television units visits, co-operation in travel workshops and in the setting up of a suitable inclusive holiday offers.  In addition co-ordination committees on promotional and marketing activities, consisting of representatives of Bord Fáilte, Aer Lingus, CIE and SFADCO, are well established in North America, France and Germany and meet regularly.</P>
      <P>It is my constant concern to promote the optimum degree of co-operation between these bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the rosy picture which the Minister has painted regarding co-operation between the different companies mentioned, I should like to ask him if he is aware there is a considerable amount of rivalry and petty jealousy between some of these companies?  Is he aware, for example, that there is a considerable conflict of opinion between Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte on the one hand and between CIE and SFADCO on the other hand in relation to other aspects of tourism promotion?  Further, would the Minister agree to bring these bodies together with a view to enabling them to hammer out their differences?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I spend most of my time rationalising the particular situation to which the Deputy refers but I would like to put the whole matter in perspective.  From the point of view of the community, of the country and of the personnel concerned, it is very valuable that there be a degree of competition <Col N="1216" /> between State companies; otherwise, we would have no barometer as to their achievements or otherwise. My particular job is to ensure that, while having this degree of competitiveness, there is no overlapping and that we rationalise the competitiveness.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy has stated, this problem arises in regard to Bord Fáilte and our national airline and it arises also in regard to SFADCO and CIE.  We have reached an agreement on areas of development between them as regards the North-Atlantic carrier business in which both SFADCO and CIE are concerned.  These matters arise week in and week out.  It is important that we have the various companies on their mettle, so to speak, from a competitive point of view and, at the same time, that overlapping is prevented and that there is rationalisation which does not prevent them from being on their mettle.</P>

Would the Minister undertake to have periodic meetings with these different State companies who are engaged in tourism with a view to seeing to it that they do their job?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision under which a widower may be granted, as an addition to certain forms of benefit and assistance, an allowance in respect of a housekeeper residing with him for the purpose of having care of his dependent children.  There is, however, no provision under which my Department could pay an allowance to a widower for a housekeeper if he himself were not entitled to payment from the Department.</P>
      <P>It is open to a public assistance authority to grant home assistance in any cases of the kind mentioned in which the circumstances of the household so warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I should say that I am having a detailed review of the assistance schemes, already announced in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development, carried out in my Department.  In that connection, it was indicated in the programme that consideration would be given to the position of certain classes of persons for whom special provision may be required, including husbands whose <Col N="1220" /> young children are left without care through death or incapacity of mothers.</P>

As I said, if the husband is in receipt of any of the benefits from the Department he is allowed for a housekeeper as a dependant. In other cases if he is working he gets no allowance.  We have been required by the Third Programme to give special attention to such cases.  They were listed in the Third Programme and referred to in the same context as the deserted wives.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="1222" /> for Finance if, in view of the present serious credit situation and the consequences to business and commerce, he will consider the introduction of legislation to amend the retrospective effect of company taxation imposed under the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree that section 1 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1970, has retrospective effect and the question of introducing legislation as suggested by the Deputy does not therefore arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that a number of companies and business firms had already closed their books and they will now be obliged under these new provisions to find liquid cash to meet the taxation imposed? This will naturally cause difficulty. It has already done so for certain firms.  Does the Minister not consider that, in view of the decision to withdraw the Prices and Incomes Bill, this decision should also be reconsidered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;No&rdquo; is the answer to the last part of the Deputy's supplementary. With regard to the first part, I am aware firms had closed their books and have had to reopen them in order to meet this tax, but the reason for this is that they closed their books on the assumption that the tax rate would remain as it was.  They knew, when making the assumption, that they could be wrong.  They were wrong.  The logic of the suggestion put forward by the Deputy is that the tax rate could never be changed and that, if it were, it would amount to retrospective legislation. I do not accept that that is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this not the first time that taxation in these circumstances was made retrospective?  Undoubtedly tax rates change from time to time but, in this case, it was made retrospective long after the taxation period had elapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The tax became due in January of this year and the change was made in legislation passed prior to Christmas.  To that extent it <Col N="1223" /> was not retrospective.  It was not retrospective also to the extent, as I have explained, that the companies concerned made certain assumptions which turned out to be wrong.  There are precedents for this.  The same kind of situation did arise in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the estimated increase in the consumer price index because of the introduction of decimal currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>For the conversion of <Col N="1224" /> retail prices to decimal currency terms a standard shopping conversion table has been recommended by the Irish Decimal Currency Board.  The table is devised so that, over a range of retail prices, increases and decreases cancel out.  The use of this table, the good sense of traders, the force of competition and the public alertness which will result from the publicity of the Decimal Currency Board, will all help to ensure that decimalisation, as such, will not result in an overall increase in the level of prices.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce will investigate any case reported where there has been an apparently unjustifiable price conversion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that, as a result of decimalisation, prices will be rounded upwards rather than downwards and that will mean in actual fact an increase in the consumer price index?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As I have said, the conversion on the basis of the shopping conversion table taken over the whole range of pence will, in fact, work out at exactly the same&mdash;no variation up or down.  Of course, in a particular shop there could be a preponderance of items at 5d rather than 9d and this would result in a preponderance one way or the other but, taken over the whole range, it evens out.  There is no alteration at all in the case of anything costing £1 or 6d or any multiple of 6d&mdash;1s, 1s 6d, 2s and so on.  There is, therefore, no reason to believe that decimalisation should lead to an increase in the cost of living.  The experience of other countries which have converted to decimal currency with 1.2p as the minimum unit, shows that decimalisation conversion has not led to an increase in the cost of living.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The available information does not enable them to form any estimate, but I would point out that the last part of my reply was not theoretical; it was the practical experience <Col N="1225" /> of what has happened in other countries converting to decimalisation with a similar value to the lowest coins we will have.</P>

      <P>It has been said that life is larger than logic.  Have the Department taken any precautions against what many people have forecast, an increase in the cost of living? Do the Department take the position that, if all purchases are in pounds, there will be no problem?  The biggest problem will arise, of course, for those on social welfare benefits who purchase in small amounts.  Their cost-of-living increase will be most severe.  I would be interested to know when the Minister will come down from his Mandarin heights and say what he will do if there is this cost-of-living increase that is forecast?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there has been a considerable increase in the number of horses using the Phoenix Park in recent times and I share the Deputy's concern for the effect this is having on the condition and appearance of the park and on other users of the park.  The adequacy of the exising bye-laws to meet the demands of the present day user of the park is under consideration and any revision of the bye-laws will have regard to the horse traffic problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The redress available to any person who may be injured in the Phoenix Park by one of the horses would of <Col N="1229" /> course depend on the circumstances of the particular case.  <i>Prima facie,</i> if a ridden horse injured a person, the rider would be liable if he had been negligent and so caused the injury, but other people's negligence might have contributed to the accident.  In other words, the ordinary law relating to accidents would obtain.</P>

      <P>I would be concerned about circumstances where you may have a person who has no more than the 15s he is paying for the horse ride injuring somebody else in the park while horse riding.

The conditions under which a person may ride a horse in the park are quite detailed.  The Phoenix Park Act, 1925 vests the control and management of the park in the State and State property is not in effect Office of Public Works property.  In this connection, in the present state of the law, the Commissioners would be entitled to plead the State's immunity in tort.  The matter of bye-laws is under active consideration.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will make a statement on the bow and arrow and gun shot attacks on the deer herd in the Phoenix Park, Dublin; and why the gates are not being manned up to 11 p.m. and closed then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Last December two deer in the Phoenix Park herd were killed by arrows, and recently one deer was found with a bullet wound in its side.  Because of its condition the animal had to be &ldquo;put down&rdquo;.  In an effort to trace those responsible some of the park constables have attended for duty at daybreak on a number of occasions and in addition the gardaí were notified.  I regret, however, that so far the culprits have not been traced.</P>
      <P>The herd of fallow deer in the Phoenix Park is one of the major attractions of the park and it is deplorable that anybody should seek to kill or injure any of them.  I would appeal to the general public to help protect this beautiful herd by reporting any unauthorised interference with it which they may observe.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the need for maintaining proper control of the park and manning of the gates is an important factor in this.  Some improvement in the gatekeeping was effected during the past year with the recruitment of three additional gatekeepers.  The adequacy of the existing service is being studied in conjunction with other aspects of park control.  It is doubtful, however, if any increased gatekeeping service would, of itself, eliminate the type of vandalism referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I understand that problems have arisen for the firm referred to by the Deputy but that these are due mainly to a serious downturn in the capital goods industry and not to the failure to secure the contract mentioned.</P>
      <P>I understand that no redundancies have taken place as yet and that any immediate large scale redundancy is unlikely.  The company are making every effort to avoid the possibility of redundancies by seeking out additional engineering work to utilise excess capacity and are being assisted by the Industrial Development Authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

As I said, the Industrial Development Authority are busily engaged in conjunction with the firm concerned seeking out additional engineering work with a view to utilising the excess capacity for whatever length of time the recession may last, as well as, of course, with a view to trying to find additional engineering work which may continue as an adjunct to the present work when the recession period has been got over.</P>

You have the situation now in which people ask &ldquo;Why did the Government not do such-and-such a few years ago?&rdquo;  The Government did attempt to do it a number of years ago and had to cease doing it.  In fact, the incentives which were subsequently offered did attract prospectors into the country who have now created a situation in which the country is being looked at from a different point of view.  Certainly, as I said in my reply, if a change of legislation is required this can be done.</P>

On the corporation's recently revised waiting list, there are 222 such families of two persons approved for rehousing.</P>
      <P>Families in need of rehousing because of overcrowding or on other grounds are generally listed in order of family size and are offered accommodation in the area of their choice in order of priority of housing need.

    <P>I have seen the newspaper report to <Col N="1252" /> which the Deputy refers.  Article 4 of the Road Traffic (Removal, Storage and Disposal of Vehicles) Regulations, 1971, empowers a member of the Garda Síochána, or a person appointed for the purpose by a road authority after consultation with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, to remove and store an unlawfully parked vehicle.  The article empowers the member or person to take such steps, including the making of an agreement with any person, as he thinks fit for the removal and storage.  I understand that in Dublin County Borough, Dublin Corporation will be undertaking the removal of unlawfully parked vehicles.  The particular method of removal, whether &ldquo;tow-away&rdquo; or &ldquo;drive away&rdquo;, the persons to be assigned to it, as well as the question of insurance and of the licensing of drivers are, therefore, matters for the corporation.  I am satisfied that they are aware of their obligations in these respects.</P>

      <P>I presume that the question relates to the dumping or reclamation recently commenced.  I have no powers which are immediately applicable but as the Minister with overall responsibility for physical planning, I am very interested in the conservation of the unique features of Bull Island.  I recently issued a statement welcoming the action of Dublin Corporation in requesting An Foras Forbartha to conduct a study into the ecological effects of amenity development works either undertaken or proposed to be undertaken by the Corporation and affecting the island.  I hope that An Foras will be able to produce a report at an early date and I feel sure that this will be of considerable value to the Corporation and to other interested parties in assessing the complex problems involved.  In the meantime I have noted a press report that in connection with a High Court action taken against them by An Taisce, the corporation have agreed to defer any further dumping for a period of six weeks.</P>

      <P>In view of the High Court action taken by An Taisce against Dublin Corporation, it would not be proper for me to comment on issues that may arise in that action. The Deputy will have noted from my reply to the previous question that Dublin Corporation have requested An Foras Forbartha to conduct a study into ecological effects of certain works either undertaken or proposed by the corporation and affecting the island; such a study would no doubt deal with the bird sanctuary.</P>

I cannot therefore accept the Deputy's suggestion. Any question relating to the serving of documents on residents outside the jurisdiction should be addressed to the Minister for Justice.</P>

The Ballymun experiment will be in the nature of a pilot project and the question of making similar arrangements in other areas where the corporation have major housing estates will be considered in the light of experience there.</P>
      <P>The extension of the arrangements will also fall for consideration in the general context of the suggestions in the White Paper on Local Government reorganisation about the establishment of advisory area committees and local community councils.</P>

      <P>A contractor is at present installing automatic exchange equipment in new exchange buildings at a number of places, including Inniskeen, in the Dundalk telephone area.  Apart from the installation work mentioned, a considerable amount of work by Departmental staff, including the renewal of cables, of portions of subscribers' lines, <i>et cetera,</i> has to be done before the change-over from manual working at these places can be carried out.  It is expected that the new exchange at Inniskeen will be brought into service towards the end of the year.</P>

I cannot express an informed view about the policy of Kenya in relation to postal charges or the level of wages, standard of service and general conditions pervailing there.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the progress which has been made by Radio-Telefís Éireann in the preparation for colour television and the cost of this project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>RTE have informed me that some £115,000 has been spent on equipment capable of handling both black and white and colour programmes, of which about £25,000 might reasonably be attributed specifically to colour. The remainder was for replacements which are no longer readily obtainable in the form of monochrome equipment.</P>
      <P>As I have said in reply to previous questions, RTE have as yet no firm plans for the introduction of colour, that is, the regular home production of colour programmes.  Test colour transmissions using imported material are being continued and the equipment referred to above will enable the Eurovision Song Contest to be transmitted in colour in April next.  I understand that there will also be broadcasts in colour of some major sporting and other events.  These experimental or occasional broadcasts will not change the general situation. Regular or studio transmissions in colour cannot be contemplated for several years ahead having regard to financial conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1274" /> I am confident that the Authority will from their limited capital resources, allocate as much as possible to improving reception in areas where it is not satisfactory.  Unfortunately the cost of providing satisfactory coverage in many of these areas would be very heavy in relation to the population concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not the Minister agree that RTE are not being ethical in encouraging people to buy sets for colour transmission?  They are so encouraging people by announcing their experimental colour transmissions although it will be several years before we have colour television here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>To take Deputy Bruton's question first I understand that RTE have spent more than £400,000 on extra transmitters and transposers during the five years ended 31st March, 1970.  I understand also, that RTE are satisfied that 98 per cent of the country is covered satisfactorily by existing transmitters.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh's supplementary referred to communal aerials.  I do not think this question covers that matter but, from my own knowledge, I would imagine that if communal aerials are set up in areas where external reception is obtainable, these areas certainly would get colour transmission.</P>
      <P>With reference to Deputy Moore's supplementary, I understand that RTE are satisfied they will not be in a position to produce colour television for some time yet.  I spelled out the reasons for this.  It is my belief that the purpose of having experimental colour transmissions at present is simply to enable their technical people to gear themselves towards colour television.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>Before progress was reported I had been dealing with the problem caused to sheep owners by marauding dogs.  I am wondering when the Minister will do something about this very serious problem&mdash;a problem that is recurring year after year.</P>
      <P>A few years ago regulations were introduced whereby it was obligatory on dog owners to have a tag attached to the necks of their dogs showing the name of the owner.  However, it happens all too often that when sheep are killed by dogs and when the owner of the sheep may even take a dog back to the house of the owner, the people of the house will deny that the dog belongs to them.  Consequently, sheep owners must bear the loss.  It is understood that, if a farmer can prove who is the owner of a dog that killed his sheep, he can claim compensation accordingly but, of course, if the owner cannot be identified, the sheep owner must suffer the loss.  If this problem is not tackled very seriously and without further delay some legislation in respect of compensation for sheep owners will have to be introduced.  This is probably one of the reasons why in the vicinity of towns, where dogs are more numerous, the sheep population is declining more rapidly than elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan spoke this morning about the problem of sheep scab. A few years ago a Bill went through the Oireachtas called the Diseases of Animals Bill and one of the major diseases mentioned in it was sheep scab.  In my own county very energetic measures were taken to eliminate this disease.  We now have twice-yearly dipping. This is very effective and I must say the inspectors are very thorough. A few months ago at the General Council of County Councils a question was raised about the problem of sheep scab and what was being done about it by the various county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought the Minister's reply reflected a lack of understanding of the problem in so far as he blames the slowness of the eradication of this <Col N="1279" /> disease on the local authorities who are not providing dipping facilities for farmers. It is terribly wrong for one county council to be very actively engaged in eradicating the disease while in another county it is being done in a half-hearted manner because the local authority do not measure up to their responsibilities to provide facilities for dipping.  A remedy which could be employed in mountain areas, where sheep are rounded up about twice a year only, would be to have some type of dye supplied in the dip so that it would be immediately revealed whether sheep offered for sale had been dipped.</P>
    <P>One of the areas where the declining numbers of sheep could be tackled very successfully is on the plains of Kildare, on The Curragh.  At the moment there are two quite active organisations, one the Sheepgrazers' Association and the other representing the people with grazing rights.  I gather that those two organisations are coming together to see what can be done to make better use of a very large area of land that is not by any means being used to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>We know that this will possibly create problems.  One problem that comes under the Department of Defence rather than the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries is the problem of the grazing rights.  To increase the number of sheep on The Curragh, the number of grazing rights which are established by statute would have to be increased.  This is not an insurmountable problem.  To my mind a bigger problem would arise from the point of view of traffic hazards because, as the House knows, the roads through The Curragh are not fenced.</P>
    <P>There could be a great increase in production on The Curragh through the extension of land reclamation and by fertilising it.  There are large areas of The Curragh where there is just furze.  An ounce of fertilizer never goes out on the Curragh.  The increase in the grazing capacity of The Curragh would be fantastic if proper attention were paid to it.  It would further help to increase the number of sheep there if the Minister could see his way to extending <Col N="1280" /> the lamb subsidy to The Curragh men.  I understand they are quite prepared to surrender 5s per head towards a fund for reclamation and fertilisation provided, of course, that the lamb subsidy scheme is not extended to the entire nation.  It is limited at the moment and does not apply to The Curragh.  To expand the numbers of sheep there this scheme should be extended to The Curragh as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Last year on his Estimate the Minister for Lands described himself as being about to become redundant.  He thought that the two Departments of Lands and Agriculture and Fisheries could be very usefully amalgamated. He certainly has a point there because, if the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is aware of the land problems &mdash;and I am sure he is&mdash;he should have some control in dealing with them.  At present a very grave problem is arising for small-holders throughout the country.  Coming from a constituency like Kildare I might be regarded as coming from a place where there are no smallholdings but I can tell the House that in Kildare 29 per cent of the holdings are under 15 acres.  So, I have some knowledge of their problems. Their big problem at present is the fact that their incomes are dwindling because they are unable to expand. It is a case of get more land, or get out; expand or die.</P>
    <P>Again the question arises of land reclamation.  I should like to see the advisory services in the various counties and the committees of agriculture tackling this problem from the point of view of making a survey of every non-arable acre in the country.  On every holding there are a few acres that could be brought into maximum production by the expenditure of a few pounds.</P>
    <P>In some cases the land project people seem to fight shy of a big job.  They consider some schemes uneconomic. I could point to one case where there are approximately 540 acres of unproductive land because of the lack of drainage.  Yet, some problem is holding it up at land project level.  The Minister would be doing a good day's work if he were to issue an instruction <Col N="1281" /> to every land project officer that no problem is insurmountable, that there must be some way around it, and that every acre of land which is unproductive at present, because of the lack of drainage or for one reason or another, should be tackled immediately to help out not just the smallholders but the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>I do not know if millraces are governed by statute; I think weirs are. There are disused mills around the country and the millraces are holding back water and flooding acres of land. That happens in my own constituency. These could be removed by a stroke of the pen, should the Minister see fit to do so.</P>
    <P>I come now to the problem of farm credit.  Lack of credit has bedevilled agriculture for years.  It is vitally important that farmers should be given the maximum credit they require to enable them to keep pace with modern conditions and to expand production. One item which comes to mind is the matter of payment by the Department of Lands.  I seem to keep coming back to the Department of Lands, but they are relevant on this Estimate.  The Department of Lands should pay two-thirds of the cost of a new holding if the tenant agrees to self-migration. There are many smallholders who, if they had the credit, would be glad to expand.  Because of the increase in the value of land many smallholders are unable to buy and the Minister might very well whisper into the ear of his colleague, the Minister for Finance, that he should do something about death duties.  We all know of firms which have folded up as a consequence of having to pay enormous sums in death duties.  The same position could arise in the case of farms.</P>
    <P>Reference was made earlier to the unrealistic increase in grain prices.  The increase given in the case of barley will go nowhere towards meeting the increases in the price of fertilisers, seed, wages, machinery, diesel oil and so on.  Every encouragement should be given to barley growers because that will save the Exchequer a huge amount of money on the importation of foreign grain.  If more incentives are given <Col N="1282" /> more grain will be grown and less will have to be imported.</P>
    <P>Farmers appreciate and value the advisory service.  They took a little time to acclimatise to this service.  In the early days the advisory personnel were looked upon as Nosey Parkers and the farmer's ambition was to get rid of the agricultural adviser as quickly as possible. I think the change in approach is due largely to the establishment of Macra na Feirme.  Farmers have come to realise now the value of the agricultural advisory service.  It is something they cannot do without.  It should be expanded where possible.  Most county committees produce an annual report containing a wealth of information.  I should like to see that report in every farmer's home.  I do not know how the report is financed but the Minister should have a sympathetic approach and reimburse the committees in order to ensure that every farmer can provide himself with a copy of the report. I know the report is available, but it is a costly item to produce and distribute.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would appeal once more to the Minister to bring an end to the difficulties between the farmers and his Department.  It is an old saying, and a very true one, that a prosperous industry depends on a prosperous agriculture.  The two go hand in hand. If the present campaign undertaken by farmers to stop the purchase of machinery and lime continues it can have only one effect on both agriculture and industry and that is a bad effect.  The problem is not insurmountable. That there are problems nobody can deny.  That the farmers are getting a raw deal nobody can deny.  The Minister is himself a farmer, an excellent farmer, and I am sure he appreciates the problems as much as anybody.  He should be able to tackle them with a broad mind.  I would appeal to him to initiate discussions with the farming organisations at the very first opportunity and to draw up a long-term policy for agriculture to prevent a recurrence of these difficulties. There is plenty of goodwill on the farmers' side.  Let the Minister show his goodwill.  If he does he will do a tremendous job not just for agriculture but for the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one theme upon which I wish to touch.  It is a central theme in that, where agriculture is concerned, it is necessary to plan a few years ahead and to have some sort of rational estimation of what agriculture will be like not just this year but five years or ten years hence. In farming enterprises, particularly those relating to livestock, it is impossible to change direction very quickly, except at great expense.  Rational forward planning involves an assessment of perspectives.  From the point of view of perspectives, there are two alternatives; within a period of a few years we may find ourselves inside the European Economic Community or, with Britain, we may find ourselves outside that Community.  Notwithstanding what seems to me to be a general acceptance of the proposition that we will probably go in, my view is that it is only 50/50 as to whether Britain will go in.  That is the way the betting goes in my opinion.  It has nothing to do with us.  It is a matter of the British political and economic situation.  It is a long shot.  A possible alternative is that we may try to enter without Britain. That is not an impossible alternative, but it is one I do not propose to explore.  It had hardly been explored at all until the very recent past.  The reason I want to talk about this is that there is a chorus of voices from farm organisations, NFA and Macra.  In passing, may I say that although I disagree with them about this I am an admirer, supporter and generally an upholder of their activities and beliefs. I think they are both wrong in their assessment of EEC prospects but when we get the farming press, farming organisations, radio and television and two out of three political parties all saying the same thing, farmers are likely to take that as being the probable outcome.  In that I am bound to say I think they would be wrong and that this mistake, while it might not cost the farming organisations or the media or the political parties very dearly would cost the farmers themselves very dearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the Chair that although on occasions I have spoken at great length I do not propose to do so now.  I have been rather reproached, <Col N="1284" /> myself and a few others, by the Taoiseach for doing so recently.  I have done it deliberately at certain times and, I feel, properly.  I have used this as a parliamentary weapon and would use it again if necessary and I am glad to be able to use it.  Certainly, to the extent that we get the prospect of Parliamentary reforms and we get co-operation from the Government we will co-operate with them in getting business through Parliament.  Therefore I do not propose to speak on many agricultural issues of great interest at all or on this issue at great length.</P>
    <P>We have a very misleading circumstance which is that from the middle 'fifties until the very recent past the price of all agricultural produce inside the European Community has been vastly higher than that which obtained on world markets or than that obtaining in Ireland.  I do not propose to analyse reasons for that but it is a fact.  We had applications in the early 'sixties and all you had to say to farmers at that time was: &ldquo;You are getting so much per gallon for milk and so much for beef or so much for lamb and your opposite numbers in the Community are getting perhaps twice as much, perhaps 60 per cent or 80 per cent more&rdquo; and all the farmers said was one voice &ldquo;Would it not be marvellous to get a crack at that market on equal terms?&rdquo;  The short answer is: &ldquo;Of course, it would be marvellous.&rdquo; But to present that and nothing else is to present a vastly distorted picture that will lead farmers into errors of planning and very serious loss and damage in my view.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to analyse why Community prices were so much out of line with world prices but very briefly I must refer to the fact that these very high Community prices produced the surpluses that we have all heard about inside the Community, and produced the so-called butter mountain and all the other mountains of surplus produced in the Community and apart, for example, from disrupting the world's dairy industry when the Community offloaded at horribly low prices their surplus in markets where we might have hoped to do well, it also had the effect of creating a profound crisis in the EEC agricultural <Col N="1285" /> policy.  As of the end of 1968, when the document now known as the Mansholt Plan was presented to the Council of Ministers by the Commission there is evidence for all who are willing to look, of a major change of price policy inside the Community. Mansholt says quite explicitly in the December 1968 document that the agricultural policy of the Community is in crisis; that more realistic farm prices must be adopted&mdash;a whole series of statements which make it absolutely clear that farm prices in the Community will come more and more into line with world prices and that in real terms they will come down.</P>
    <P>In answer to this it may be said that in the next few months we shall see a small rise in Community prices for commodities such as butter and beef.  That is true but they have said that will be the last rise before the culmination in either failure or success of the present negotiations to admit four new applicants.  The reality of prices in the Community is that although it is politically almost impossible to reduce farm prices in formal terms, in real terms farm prices in the Community have been reduced quite sharply and will go on being reduced. The technique is that which we see in operation in many countries every day &mdash;to hold the price at a set level and allow inflation to erode it every year by 5 per cent or 7 per cent or, perhaps, 10 per cent or whatever rate at which inflation happens to be running.</P>
    <P>Real prices inside the Community, apart from the odd reduction such as the reduction in the butter prices which was a formal reduction, are being reduced and will be reduced.  Community prices will come more into line with world prices.  That is the prospect of the evolution of prices.  When you say to an Irish farmer: &ldquo;Perhaps you will get 3s 8d, or the metric equivalent, per gallon for milk; perhaps you will get 60 per cent or 70 per cent more for beef&rdquo; that is true at this moment but one has to have extrapolations a few years hence and we have no reason to believe these price differentials will exist to anything like the same extent in the near future.  It is true also that if we had got into the EEC in 1961 we <Col N="1286" /> would have had a decade of far higher prices than we have enjoyed but that hay-making period is over in the Community; the good decade for small farmers in the Community who made big profit is over because those big prices created the mountains of surpluses and created the crisis.  We have no right to tell Irish farmers that they can expect the price differentials currently existing between Community prices and our prices to last for any significant distance in the future because all indications are that they will not.</P>
    <P>This is the first point that must in fairness be made about Community prices.  Secondly, I want to make a point about British prices.  In the whole life of this State we have had the awful national tragedy which is the fault of nobody and which is certainly not a political football but something everybody regrets, that the whole of Irish industry, every Irish farmer and all the Irish people have suffered bitterly, because the British used their wealth to subsidise their own farmers but, as the greatest food importing nation in the world, they bought on the world at extremely depressed prices, whether from the New Zealanders, the Irish, the Danes, the Argentinians or the black African countries supplying tropical produce.  All supplying countries were seriously exploited by this classical neo-colonialist trick which impoverished all of us.  Of course the ending of that situation and a crack at the British and European markets on equal terms with anybody else is something our farmers very much desire and undeniably it would be vastly to the benefit of our agriculture, but the plain fact is that as early as two years ago the British Conservative Party were saying explicitly through their then agricultural spokesman, who did not become Minister for Agriculture, that they proposed the dismantling of their price support system.</P>
    <P>Under the prevailing economic ideas of the British Conservative Party, now the Government, and in view of the difficulties under which the British economy is now labouring, that price support system costing £300,000,000 or £400,000,000 a year is in the process of being dismantled and British home <Col N="1287" /> prices are being permitted to rise and the cost of food to the British housewife is being permitted to rise.  We can expect the spillover of that policy under the Free Trade Agreement to permit a rise in our farm prices for the products we are sending to the British market.  This is why, three, four or five years hence, we have even less reason to expect a very large differential between the prices we get in Britain&mdash;assuming we stay out and Britain stays out&mdash;and the prices we would get on the British market assuming we are both in.  That differential will become less in the light of economic forces already in operation. That is the final long-term argument in regard to food prices.</P>
    <P>I have not analysed the reasons why prices were high in the Community in the sixties They were high, there is no question about that.  There were perfectly good reasons but it would take more time than I am prepared to take to outline them.  In the long run, the prices of food, the prices paid to farmers, the prices paid by the housewife inside large dynamic industrial countries are subject to certain tendencies which were visible in the UK in the last century when there was a battle over the repeal of the corn laws; which have been visible in the battles between the industrial and farm lobbies in the United States and which have been visible in every large dynamic industrial area.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the history of the development of the dynamic economies in the world over the last century and a half, there is a tug of war in regard to the price of farm produce. On one end of the rope tugging it towards higher prices there is the farm lobby and on the other end pulling towards lower food prices there are two forces.  One is the force of the industrial employers, the business force.  They have to compete for exports and they want the lowest price possible so that their exports will be competitive and since for working people food represents such a large proportion of their total expenditure the employers want the lowest possible price for food so that wages can be <Col N="1288" /> as low as possible and therefore their products can be as competitive as possible.  The workers also want the lowest possible price for food so that they will have wages to spare for other things.  If you have a tug of war with the farm lobby on one end of the rope and on the other end you have the employers and the workers, who is going to win?  The latter group are vastly more important than farmers, farmers who are diminishing in numbers and therefore in political leverage, and farmers in Ireland are tragically divided so that they cannot even pull, with the diminishing rate which they do possess, in a unified way.  Of course the farm lobby loses.</P>
    <P>Of course the long term tendency inside the one-quarter of a million highly industrialised European Economic Community is towards low food prices notwithstanding the fact that when the Community originally came into existence the price of food was very high.  That is the long term tendency. We would be misleading farmers to pretend anything else.  We would be misleading them if we urged them to do their long term planning, their long term investing in the expectation that the present rate of profit on a gallon of milk or on a fat beast would remain as it is now.</P>
    <P>The other great consideration is that farmers are not in the least concerned, any more than a businessman or anybody else who produces products for sale, with how much they actually get for the product; what they are concerned with is the profit on it.  If the price of the in-goods rises steeply then you have to calculate your profit not just in the light of the selling price but in the light of the cost of production as well.  We therefore have to explain to farmers &ldquo;sure, you will go to 3s 8d per gallon now or something like that, but not just will it be eroded in the long term by the processes I have been outlining but also your in-puts will get more, will cost more&rdquo;.  You cannot get an efficient dairy cow producing effectively on roughage, you have to put concentrates into it.  All right, what do the concentrates cost? These are relevant questions as well as the question &ldquo;how much does the <Col N="1289" /> gallon of milk cost?  How much does the end-product cost?</P>
    <P>When we look at the EEC let us take the example of pig producers. Do not say &ldquo;How much is the pig going to the factory&rdquo;; say &ldquo;What is the profit on the pig in the Community?&rdquo; No gain on the current situation and possibly a slight loss for producers. I am not saying it is a slight loss; I do not know whether it is a slight loss or a slight gain or whether it is exactly the same.  Anyway it is going to fluctuate from month to month.  For pig producers as a whole there is no significant advantage.  I am also saying in terms of real costs there is a good deal less advantage for milk producers than there seems to be on the face of it. I do not want to overstate what I already consider to be a strong case, and which I do not wish to mar by overstatement, but certainly there is, especially in view of our grassland capacity and our expertise with livestock, real benefit in beef and probably in sheep products also.</P>
    <P>Let us tell it like it is and not as if it were to be the solution to all the farmers' problems.  Let us not feed them with the pap that everything will be great on the day because then they will make mistakes, mistakes which will cost them dearly.  If one reads what is published about the forward planning for agriculture for the Community quite clearly the long-term intention is that farmers will certainly live well in the way that Mansholt says but there will be much fewer of them.  They will be big efficient units that can generate the sort of productivity that will give them a good life without very high prices, without a very high profit per gallon of milk or per beast.  You have to get the through-put either in milk or in beasts or whatever it is to get the good living.  I have no doubt this is the long-term intention.  They have been quite explicit about it.  I do not want to raise the hair on anybody's head with the terrors of Mansholt but the long-term intention is a much smaller number of very efficient, bigger farmers living well but also producing food cheaply and efficiently.</P>
    <P>There is no place for the inefficient, small producer in this perspective. <Col N="1290" /> Mansholt talks about humane measures of retraining, of retirement, of purchase of the land from small producers, but he talks about all these things in the context of having a very dynamic local industry where the displaced workers can go.  It is a valid plan for the circumstances on which his experience is based, in Holland, but what if we do not have the dynamic industries to take in the displaced small farmers who have been displaced by the erosion of profit margins?  That is how they will be displaced, not because of promises of retraining, or promises of pensions; they will be forced out by the erosions in their margins. If you have a Mansholt situation with booming industry, and the booming industry of Holland is sucking in workers even from North Africa and from Turkey, then your displaced people can get jobs near their homes, inside their own language and cultural areas.  If we can be guaranteed that we will get a booming industry in European Community conditions where the displaced small farmers can go, great, but how can that be guaranteed when the Community's regional policy is non-existent, when the Community's regional policy is the same sort of pap as the pap being served up to farmers about agricultural prospects?</P>
    <P>We cannot guarantee that for small farmers and therefore we are not in a comparable position to the Dutch, French and Germans who have not just places for the displaced rural workers but who have indeed an acute labour shortage.  We cannot in conscience tell the small farmers that they have a future in ten, 15 or 20 years in the Community.  The whole concept, the whole ideology, the whole trend of development is away from that.  The Community have thought up through the Mansholt Plan a mechanism by which this transition can be made humane in the circumstances of the Six.  The plan was not thought up for Ireland and does not apply to Ireland.  In these circumstances, which in my view are perilous for our small and medium farmers, and we have no option but to tell them that, we should be taking certain long-term policy steps in a very vigorous and organised way. <Col N="1291" /> I have been trying to be temperate and constructive in what I have said and I will try to go on being so.  I have to make it clear that I think there have been serious failures of initiative in the whole of our agricultural thinking, in the light of the pressures that will face us either in or out and in my view they are not so very different.</P>
    <P>Let me speak first about the question of the volume of production.  I know the arguments that increased production means that you have to put money from other sources into the countryside. I know that the amount of money currently put into the countryside is high, having regard to the size of our economy and the spare wealth we have. Were I in the position of having to make a budget, I do not think I would apportion the funds available in a very different manner.  I am not complaining about the amount of money that has been spent in this direction.  On occasions I have said harsh things about Government policy, but in terms of allocation of funds the Government have been generous to the countryside.</P>
    <P>However, they have been extraordinarily unwise and lacking in creative policy.  We have seen that funds alone solve nothing and very often they aggravate problems.  Regarding the volume of production, recently we have had a price system in milk which has bitterly discouraged the people who were most efficient and productive in milk.  When I was responsible for informing the farming section of new ideas and techniques, the advisory services, the farm journalists and I urged men with 15 cows to borrow in order to go into the business in an intensive way.  We told them to build silage lay-outs, build cubicles, increase the number of cows, to intensify stocking rate per acre and to apply fertilisers. We said this with passion and conviction and in the belief that this is what the nation needed.</P>
    <P>I think that was correct then but I know that the reversal of policy on the part of the Government when they introduced a steep multitier price system led in a number of cases to such a revulsion on the part of the Minister's servants who had carried <Col N="1292" /> out the Government's policy honourably that they could no longer serve the Government.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to the principle of a tiered-price system.  It is proper to make compensation in areas of difficulty, and to make compensation on a scale.  I am not asking for a flat rate although I think a flat rate is what exists in the Community.  I believe the number of steps and the nature of the graduations were such as to discourage profoundly the most creative and vigorous section of our milk producers who were getting their costs right. These people considered they had been let down and betrayed.</P>
    <P>Had we had some sophisticated forward planning in relationship to Europe and had people thought politically about the evolution of the European price scene in the way I have tried to indicate, then the change of policy inside the Community could have been seen.  We could have seen that the change of policy would put farmers out of milk in Europe, that the butter mountain would rapidly dwindle and that we could have used extra milk production just at the time when we had not got it.  We have not enough milk now and because of incorrect policy at a crucial time we are losing our place in the British Market and the possibilities of expansion.  Expansion is not just desirable in a flat rate kind of way.  The more you can increase volume, the easier it is to get costs right.  The greater the volume, the better the costs picture.</P>
    <P>One might say the same thing about the pig situation on the British market. Lack of sophisticated economic analysis about demand and lack of political thinking about the political economy of demand in the United Kingdom and in the Community led to diametrically wrong policies so that we were wrong-footed time after time in regard to the possibilities of outlets.</P>
    <P>There were serious errors in regard to the efficiency of production all along the line.  It is a truism&mdash;and nobody in this House can quarrel with it&mdash;that the real cost structure is set by the efficient producer.  The small producer either exists by subsidies or else he goes to the wall.  The only way one can <Col N="1293" /> be competitive is to get costs right.  You can get the big units either by co-operation or by bankrupting the small producer, but it is impossible to get costs right on five or ten cows.</P>
    <P>Livestock is a lucky industry in view of the evolution of Europe, the evolution of incomes and public taste.  We have a great climate and great possibilities in regard to grassland and we have the good fortune to be in livestock.  At least we have a bit of luck in that respect because we have the expertise and the climate.  However, due to a series of mistakes and instances of incompetence, the basic stock is very poor.  Our basic milch cows are rotten as productive units. One might possibly make the argument that the milch cows of the sagas of 1,800 years ago were better than the stock today.</P>
    <P>In beef we tried to get some European strains.  While the English buyers may like our product, when we get down to basics of how efficiently can the product be converted and what is the cost of production, we have a bad performance.  In cattle, pigs and sheep, because of our climate and the aptitude of our people for livestock, not alone could we be, much better but we could have the bonus of supplying the world.</P>
    <P>Who comes to us for our products? It is only for the odd beef animal and the thoroughbred horse.  Scandinavian pigs can get a premium; they are smuggled all over the world because the Danes refuse to let them out.  Nobody wants our pigs because they are not that good.</P>
    <P>On the question of product development and market research, we have spent large amounts of money&mdash;which I do not deplore&mdash;on various kinds of agricultural research.  However, it is not nearly enough for specific development and market research.  We could import the result of fertiliser trials from other countries of comparable size and climate.  What we want to do is to spend our resources of men and money on product development and market research, on economists, on finding out what kind of packaging we need, and the structure of industry.</P>
    <P>We need rationalisation in all our bacon factories and the creameries.  I <Col N="1294" /> understand the attachment of farmers to the local creamery but one must look at costs.  We all have a duty to be tougher with the natural feelings of people to defend small inefficient local institutions.  If the Minister wants to push amalgamation we are not going to play politics and we will support it. No politician will quarrel with any Minister who pushes rationalisation and amalgamation.  Matters such as farm ownership of the processing factories, matters of vertical integration, where it is possible to get costs right from the farm gate into the market are neglected and ignored.  We have the irony of branded Danish meat products selling in Ireland and no comparable branded Irish meat products selling in Denmark.  I do not wish to mention brand names.  This is a failure. This is a big league but the Community is a much bigger league.  If you do not have millions of pounds for advertising, product development, packaging, all that, you are simply not in the hunt.  Our good climate, our understanding, our expertise, our love of livestock, will be fine as a basis but not enough.  It must be carried on to market research, product development and so on.  Here we have been noticeably weak.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the subject matter of Question No. 39 of 4th February on the Adjournment because, in my opinion, I did not receive a satisfactory reply from the Minister.  In that question I asked him:</P>
      <P>If he will make a statement on the proposed closure of the Booth Poole car assembly plant which will result in the loss of jobs for over 140 workers especially in view of guarantees given in respect of the car assembly industry under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.</P>
      <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the decision to cease assembly was taken on the grounds that the relatively small <Col N="1295" /> volume of assembly was proving uneconomic. I understand further that the company's assembly activities will be undertaken by other assembly plants in the group of companies of which Booth Poole &amp; Co., Limited, is one and that the decision to transfer assembly was taken in the interest of achieving increased efficiency and thereby preserving employment within the group as a whole, at the maximum level consistent with economic production.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce said in a statement on 23rd April, 1968, that he got an assurance under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement for maintenance of assembly at the general level achieved immediately prior to the conclusion of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement when assembly operations were at a very high level.  He said there was also an expression of intent to expand such assembly operations in so far as this might be consistent with the economics of the operation and the development of the market.</P>
    <P>Despite all these assurances and the guarantees given in relation to the car assembly industry, we have had fully assembled cars being imported.  These fully assembled cars were previously being assembled by Booth Poole and they are being imported in ever-increasing numbers.  Without any advance notice the employees were told they would become redundant.  The Minister's office was not made aware of this fact until the afternoon of the announcement, and the Minister has said this.  On the Monday afternoon, 1st February, representatives of this company went to the Minister's office and told him they would make the announcement an hour or two later.</P>
    <P>That is scandalous treatment of the workers in the car assembly industry, these people who have laboured for years in this business, who find themselves now on the slag heap and who find they will not be re-employable. The Minister for Industry and Commerce must have been aware that this was a very shaky industry.  He got the assurance that the same number of people would be employed in the car <Col N="1296" /> assembly industry.  Despite these assurances he could not give an assurance that these 140-odd people would be re-employed in the assembly which is now being taken over by Brittains, the motor car assemblers.</P>
    <P>I maintain that if the same level of employment was to be guaranteed we must have an assurance given to these workers that they will be employed by the new company that has taken over Booth Poole.  I could not get such an assurance from the Minister.  Indeed, his apathy was perhaps more annoying than anything else, the fact that he took it so casually that he should be informed only a few hours before the decision to make public their announcement of closure.  It is showing contempt for a Minister for Industry and Commerce that they should tell him at such a late stage. In a supplementary question on 4th February I asked:</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that a guarantee was given that the staff would be retained, does the Minister not think that this was broken by that decision?</P>
    <P>He did not answer the first part of the question, but he was very anxious to answer the second part about take-overs and rationalisation.  We can have rationalisation, take-overs, mergers, call them what you like, but the real issue here is men, human beings, who are now in their forties and who will not be re-employed as car assemblers here.  A car assembler cannot very easily get a job elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is a very high rate of unemployment, 70,000-odd people.  It is difficult enough to get a job and I certainly know this from trying very hard for young people, but anyone who looks at the appointments page in his newspaper will see that 35 is the upper age limit for employment.</P>
    <P>This is a disgraceful way for Booth Poole to treat workers.  I do not think the company have the right to do this. I would ask the Minister to investigate this and demand that these workers be taken on in this new assembly that is going on in Brittain's factory.  I made inquiries from the workers in this assembly plant.  I am not denying <Col N="1297" /> that a small assembly plant is uneconomic, but what I am saying is that the Minister and his Department should have been making these investigations earlier.  The onus was on this company to say to the Minister &ldquo;In twelve months time we plan to cease production and we will now see what we can do to have these people integrated into the assembly plant at Brittain's&rdquo;.  This is the least the Minister could have expected from this company, the head of which was a former Member of this House.</P>
    <P>The head of the company, who, as I say, was a former Member of this House, has condemned the Government because he says the Government's repressive measures on the expansion of the company have been the cause of its closure.  If such be the case I should like to know what can be done even at this late stage to rectify the situation.  I should ask the Minister has he had any discussions with him since I put down the question to know what percentage of the workers will be re-employed immediately.  I should like to know, also, has he had discussions with the company that has taken it over, Messrs.  Brittain.  Has he had assurances that these 140-odd people will be re-employed?  If we are to have an assurance that the same number will be kept employed in the car assembly industry, I should like to know the number employed in the car assembly industry at this time as compared with 1965 prior to the signing of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.</P>
    <P>This afternoon I read what the former Taoiseach said about the signing of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  I found it a very valuable exercise to read what he had to say. He said everything would be great, there would be no danger to anyone, we would be ensured of increasing employment and increasing prosperity. If this is a sign of what is going to happen even before our entry into the EEC I cannot see anything but a complete collapse of the car assembly industry with consequent unemployment.</P>
    <P>No company have a right to make decisions without referring to the workers.  Workers have a right to be <Col N="1298" /> consulted on matters affecting their own future because they are part of the industry.  It is not good enough to say they will be paid redundancy payments.  Redundancy benefits mean very little when one is faced with having to live on unemployment assistance for the rest of one's life or face separation from one's family and seek employment in Britain.</P>
    <P>I should like to know the number of fully assembled cars which were imported by this company during the last two years.  We must know this in order to find out whether they were really making an effort to keep this car assembly plant going or whether they had decided to run down this car assembly plant in order to prove that it was uneconomic.  No company have the right to say it is uneconomic if they have been availing of the concessions which would not normally have come into effect until 1975.</P>
    <P>One of the Minister's predecessors said that the manufacturers and assemblers of British vehicles had given him satisfactory assurances of their intention to support the continued assembly of their motor vehicles in Ireland on a long-term basis.  In return the Government agreed to extend immediately to these manufacturers the duty reductions on fully built-up vehicles which would not otherwise fully mature until 1975.  If these concessions had not been granted would this car assembly plant still be in operation?  From what I have heard from the workers about the number of fully assembled cars that were being imported, I believe had this concession not been granted this car assembly plant would still be functioning and there would be no signs whatsoever of its closing.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister, first of all, arrange a meeting immediately with the owners of Booth Poole and, secondly, seek a meeting with the Brittain car assembly plant and obtain guarantees from them that these workers will be re-employed in the major car assembly plant which has taken over from Booth Poole? This is the least I can ask the Minister to do in order to give these people and their families some feeling of security about their future.  If the Minister does this he will be fulfilling the <Col N="1299" /> terms and using the guarantees that were promised.  I would ask him very sincerely to do this without delay.</P>

      <P>I can appreciate the Deputy's concern about this matter.  I do, however, have serious objections to the Deputy's saying that I took the whole situation casually.  It is rather unfair to suggest that because I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, do not find myself in a position to turn around to an employer, when I am informed that he has to close down for one reason or another, and say to him &ldquo;I will not allow you to close down.  You must continue to remain in business despite whatever you say are the justifications for closing down&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked me if I had any idea of the numbers employed in the car assembly industry now as compared with the numbers employed in 1965.  While it is difficult to obtain accurate figures of the numbers engaged in the industry on assembly operations as such, on the basis of information available from the Central Statistics Office I am able to inform the Deputy that, comparing like with like, 300 more people were employed in motor assembly plants in 1970 than were employed in 1965.  That is to say, 3,765 people were employed on assembly in 1970 as compared with 3,449 people in 1965.  These figures are an indication of the success of the arrangements made in relation to protecting employment in the car assembly industry.  It was because my predecessor felt there was a degree of worry about the future of the car assembly industry some years ago, that he had this arrangement with the assemblers drawn up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of cars assembled in 1970 as compared with the number assembled in 1965 show a comparative increase.  The total number of vehicles assembled by the Irish car assembly industry in 1970 was 52,976, which is almost 53,000, as compared with 49,709 in 1965.  These figures indicate that the operation of this arrangement has worked successfully and that the assemblers have, overall, honoured the <Col N="1300" /> obligations entered into by them.  This is one of the reasons why in the interests of the people working in the industry the Government are at the present time endeavouring, in relation to our negotiations for entry into the EEC, to retain the existing scheme for its full life span.  The particular cessation that has taken place is relatively small when compared with the volume of the car assembly industry.  I understand that a union official on television conceded that the Booth Poole affair, as such, was an isolated one.</P>
    <P>Early in the afternoon on the day the announcement was made, when my Department became aware of this impending rearrangement or closure or tie-in with Brittain, I was asked positively by Deputy Corish would I not think, to say the least of it, that it was an unsatisfactory way to treat the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the records of the House show that Deputy Corish did not even let me away with a nod&mdash;that I positively said I agreed with that observation.  I have no reason to change my mind on that. I do not think it was a fair way to have dealt with the closure announcement, both from the point of view of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and of the workers.  Indeed, the workers were made aware of the closure before me.</P>

      <P>I had to attend a function in Cork that night and I did not hear of it until I got there.  A question was asked about efforts to find alternative employment for the 140 workers.  In relation to the development of the Brittain group, they are hoping to employ as many as possible of the people who have become unemployed. This is being done to the maximum extent and it is hoped to re-employ gradually as many as possible.  The number will depend on how soon the group's Long Mile development will develop.  A certain number of the workers have been offered employment by British Leyland and every effort is being made by my Department to get as many as possible absorbed.  It may have been <Col N="1301" /> said that the Minister treated this matter casually&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We should not say that.  We should say, though, that the Minister should speak out against it. This is very important.</P>

      <P>I do not think I was slow in any way.  Attention was drawn in the Press to the fact that I had attended a function organised by the motor car assemblers the previous week.  Somebody stated that Government taxation was responsible for this thing and it was thought that, having met the president of that organisation, I might have had something whispered in my ear.  I wish to say categorically that there was no reference to this. Indeed, I was most disappointed when I arrived in Cork to find this information awaiting me.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not make it known that he would be glad if manufacturers who are having <Col N="1302" /> trouble would tell him well in advance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, it must be remembered there is a balance. Let us be quite frank about this. The Minister for Industry and Commerce does not want to begin to invite manufacturers in and to have them say: &ldquo;Listen, we may have a bit of trouble.  Would you have a chat with the Minister for Finance?&rdquo;  There are two sides to this question.  Naturally, I was disappointed over this matter but it should positively be understood&mdash;I said this at the function to which I referred&mdash;the future of the industry is pretty assured.  I said that the Government are dedicated to trying to ensure through EEC negotiations that this position will continue. I wish to reiterate my views in that regard.</P>
