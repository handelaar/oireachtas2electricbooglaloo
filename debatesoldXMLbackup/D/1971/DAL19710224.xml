      <P>The yearly average of the consumer price index for the year ended November, 1970, was 8.2 per cent above that for the previous year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only said about ten words.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the average increase in the consumer price index in the EEC countries during the same period was in the region of 5 per cent? If these are countries to which we will want to export, how do the Government expect industry to compete with this kind of inflation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been great difficulties in framing this particular section in legislation which otherwise is ready.  We are nearing the end of the difficulties which arose in regard to this particular section and I expect we shall produce the Bill before the end of the summer session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that as this is such an urgent matter it should be dealt with almost immediately, particularly in view of the fact that the difficulties have been overcome?  There would be a unanimous agreement in the House to have this regularised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question about an agreement.  There should be a section of this kind in legislation.  The difficulty was in framing it.  Discussions have taken place with all the authorities involved and there was a disagreement of opinion about the manner of its framing but I am glad to say that disagreement is largely ended and I hope to introduce the Bill in a reasonable time.</P>

      <P>There has been a change as from the year 1968 in the code on the international classification of diseases in accordance with which there is a variation in the recording of the statistics in which the Deputy <Col N="1946" /> is interested which makes it impossible for me to give him a straightforward comparison year by year from 1965 onwards as he requested.  I have, however, had compiled two tables, one from 1965 to 1967 and the other for 1968 and 1969 which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.  These, I trust, will give the Deputy the information and the comparison he requires.  Statistics for 1970 are not yet available.  The following are the tables:</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>As my reply is a lengthy and detailed one, I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the reply:</P>
      <P>The applicant countries will be required to accept the Treaty of Rome and the decisions taken by the Community to implement its provisions.  One of the provisions of the Treaty is that the EEC Council shall issue directives to enable nationals of one country to acquire and use land and buildings situated in any of the other member counties.  But it is specified that, in the application of this provision, there should be no conflict with the principles of the Community's common agricultural policy.  These principles, which are at the basis of the common agricultural policy, are clearly set out in the Treaty of Rome and they require that account should be taken of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  the particular nature of agricultural activity in the Community resulting from the social structure of agriculture and from the structural and national disparities between the various agricultural regions in the Community.</P>
      <P>(2)  the need to effect the appropriate adjustment to the common agricultural policy by degrees; and</P>
      <P>(3)  the fact that, in the member States, agriculture constitutes a sector closely linked with the economy as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Article in the Treaty on the <Col N="1951" /> right of a national of one member country to purchase land in another member country is an enabling one&mdash; it must be implemented by specific directives of the Council of the Communities. To date full right of establishment in agricultural land has not yet been introduced.  However, a number of directives have been issued on this question and the present position is that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  nationals of one member country now have the right to acquire farms in other member countries which have been left abandoned or left uncultivated for more than two years; and</P>
    <P>(2)  nationals of one member country who have worked as paid agricultural workers in another member country for an unbroken period of at least two years have the right to acquire a farm or farms in that member country.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, other directives have been issued by the Council which provide for equal rights as between nationals of a member country and non-nationals to change farms and legal equality as between nationals and non-nationals in respect of accession to leases.</P>
    <P>The situation, therefore, has not yet been reached where nationals of one member country are fully free to purchase farms in any other member country.  The Council has had before it since January 1969 a draft directive which, if adopted, would grant, in effect, full rights to nationals of one country to purchase farms in other member countries.  It is not possible to say at this stage when this draft directive might be adopted.  It is possible that it may be adopted between now and Ireland's accession to the EEC; or perhaps its adoption will not arise until after accession.</P>
    <P>The Land Act of 1965 governs the purchase of agricultural land in this country by non-nationals.  The Act prescribes that all non-nationals who have not lived continuously in Ireland for at least seven years cannot buy rural land except with the permission of the Land Commission.  Rural land required for industrial purposes and holdings of up to five acres required <Col N="1952" /> for residential purposes are exempt from this requirement.  Non-nationals who have lived in Ireland for seven years or more may purchase land on the same terms as Irish nationals.</P>
    <P>When Ireland accedes to the EEC, the directives already adopted by the Community on right of establishment in land will be applicable here.  The present directives would enable non-nationals to buy agricultural land which had been left abandoned or uncultivated for more than two years; they would also enable non-nationals who had worked in this country as paid agricultural labourers for a continuous period of two years to buy agricultural land here.  It is not expected that the acceptance of these Community directives would create any serious difficulties in so far as our national interests are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Government attach the utmost importance to this question of land purchase.  I, therefore, raised the question at the very outset of the negotiations. In the statement which I made at our first negotiating meeting with the Communities in September of last year, I drew attention to Ireland's present controls on the purchase of land by non-nationals.  I explained that these controls were necessary in pursuance of the Government's policy of achieving equitable distribution of land and creating viable agricultural holdings. I also informed the Community that, in relation to the possible introduction of full right of establishment in agricultural land, we would raise in the negotiations our need to maintain sufficient control over the disposal of land in Ireland in order to enable us to pursue policies to deal with such structural problems as exist.  It is proposed to pursue the matter at an appropriate stage in the negotiations.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> If it is not in the nature of statistics, and I am sure it is not, would the Minister not consider it better to give it to the House by way of an oral reply? Is it a fact that assuming we do enter the EEC it will not be possible for us to impose a restraint on the purchase of land based on nationality?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a long answer and it was agreed among the Whips that <Col N="1953" /> these long answers would be entered in the Official Report for ciruculation. The answer to the Deputy's supplementary is that the draft directive from the Commission to the Council which would give right of free establishment has not as yet been adopted.  The present position and if we were a member now would not give free right of establishment to everybody and we would have national controls possible to us as we have at the moment, but if the draft directive before the Council is adopted then the right of establishment would be given to any member of the Community in relation to other countries which are members.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will make a comprehensive statement as to the reasons for the widening of the margin between the Central Bank's rediscount rate and the commercial banks' overdraft rates since 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank's rediscount rate is normally determined each month primarily by reference to the discount rate for Exchequer Bills which in turn is related to the average discount rate offered at the weekly tender for British Treasury Bills in London.</P>
      <P>The commercial banks' overdraft rates do not necessarily vary with the Central Bank's rediscount rate.  They are influenced by factors such as the general cost of money and the interest rates of the British commercial banks.  At the present time, the Central Bank considers that the level of overdraft interest should not be such as to promote excessive demands for consumer credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the rediscount rate of the Central Bank, if it is to be used properly, should be a weapon to force the commercial banks to charge a proper rate?  In the two years since 1968 it has moved approximately 1½ per cent from the Central Bank rediscount rate. This is jacking-up unnecessarily the profits of the commercial banks.</P>

Is he aware that some people claim they intend to use farms for certain purposes in order to get possession of them, and then do not carry out what they say is their intention; yet they get possession of the land.

In any event such a record might not, of itself, accurately reflect the number of really qualified claimants inasmuch as all eligible persons&mdash; irrespective of whether they have lodged a formal application or not&mdash;are automatically considered by the Land Commission for allotments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>As pointed out in a press release issued by my Department on 17th February, there is no fall in milk production in this country.  The decline of about 2 per cent in creamery milk deliveries in 1970 was more than made up for by the increase in milk fed to calves by former creamery milk suppliers who had changed over to the beef incentive scheme in 1970.</P>
      <P>Much of our exports of milk products realise very low prices on a number of overseas markets and entail heavy trading losses.</P>
      <P>Ample supplies of our milk products will be available for the British and such other markets as give a far better return than the very unprofitable overseas markets I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>I am aware that some people fail to recover the full amount of their loss through the operation of the average clause.  The effect of this clause is to put on the policy holder <Col N="1982" /> the obligation of insuring his property for the full amount of its value, by providing that he must bear a <i>pro rata</i> proportion of every claim where the property concerned is insured for an insufficient amount.  This is a practice which no doubt will be considered by the Insurance Committee and I should be unwilling to reach any conclusions about it before I have seen the committee's report.</P>
      <P>I understand that it is not the policy of insurance companies to take it on themselves to advise people as to the amount for which they should insure their property and that this is a matter for determination by the person taking out the policy.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the shoe factory mentioned by the Deputy has closed down and I understand that there has been a move by a local co-operative to purchase the factory and recommence the production of shoes.</P>
      <P>It is clear that, from the point of view of unemployment and its causes in the boot and shoe industry, a case for the limitation of imports or the seeking of special terms for the industry within the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement could not, at present, be sustained.  I am informed that difficulties facing certain footwear factories including that the name of which was supplied by the Deputy, arise not because of imports but from problems related to the particular manufacturing units concerned.</P>
      <P>Special terms for the footwear industry are not being sought in EEC negotiations because the time available up to the end of the transitional period should suffice for that industry to prepare for Common Market conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I forgot to mention one point in connection with the man who in the strike previous to the last strike lost so much money over cheques which he had cashed and who was charged income tax by the Revenue Commissioners on the amount of money he had lost.  The man charged the person involved and in court the judge's decision was that in the normal course of business you could cash up to £100 or £200 in order to help a customer but you could not act as a banker by cashing more.  We would all agree that in normal times a retailer would not be keen to cash cheques of a greater value.  However, during the bank strike the people were trying to keep the economy going&mdash;the Government allowed the <Col N="1986" /> strike to continue&mdash;and it was the retailers who kept the economy going. If they make a loss because of this the Revenue Commissioners still charge the traders income tax on foot of money never received.  Another point is that three or four years ago it was normal for a person to get an overdraft for perhaps five, six or seven years but now the position has developed that you will only get an overdraft for a year or a year and a half and you have to go to a merchant banker to whom you will pay 2 per cent more.  The Minister should get the banks to do what the American banks do, that is, loan money at a certain rate for a certain number of years, depending on your security, depending on the number of years for which you require it and also depending on what the proposition it.  This would be a far better system than the present one where people have to pay 2 per cent more, which is creating inflation because if a person has to pay 2 per cent more he has to charge his customers to get that money back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government borrow money, as they have been borrowing, it means that there is less money for private enterprise, less money to be lent by the commercial banks, and if there is less money on the market a person must go to the merchant banks which, as I said, are more expensive. In regard to the point that 5 per cent of customers' lodgments must be deposited with the Central Bank this is quite a good idea from the point of view of the safety of the people's money but surely if 5 per cent is taken from the banks, money which they cannot use, this will lead to a higher rate of interest.  Will they be getting interest rates from the Central Bank?  The Minister mentioned that originally he thought that three directors should be appointed from the banks but that now he thinks two will be sufficient.  There are five other directors to be appointed. Who will these be?  Where will they come from?  Will they be picked at random, or one from each profession, will they be from business groups or will they be nominees of the Minister from his own Department?  I know there is one from his own Department but can there be any more?  I am <Col N="1987" /> always frightened when a Government, and this party in particular, have a choice as in this case where the banks will put forward a panel from which the Minister can pick.  The Minister might quite easily pick two friends of his or two men of his own party.  The banks themselves as they know the people who worked with them over the years should appoint one, two or three directors, whatever it will be.  I think it should be three or four.  We accept this Bill in principle.  The Minister is making certain amendments to it and I think on this side we will accept it practically in detail.</P>

      <P>It is desirable that Members of the Dáil should have an opportunity to discuss a subject which hitherto has been regarded as having an aura of mystique about it. While, perhaps, there are relatively few Deputies competent or expert enough to discuss banking and finance it is important that this topic should be discussed in Parliament.  The changes contemplated in the Bill are long overdue.  Many people who are interested in economic development, and this includes people who have been involved in industrial, agricultural and tourism development have, for a long time, been aware of the need for modernising and rationalising our banking system.  As the Minister pointed out, this Bill will be the first major change in banking legislation since the Central Bank Act of 1942.  This is an indictment of Government policy and of the economic and social thinking of the Government.  A monetary policy is an integral part of an overall economic policy.  It is important that the two should be co-ordinated.  The Minister admitted this in his statutory speech and he went into detail about the relationship between monetary policy and economic development.  This might appear to be a highly academic topic but it is a vitally important matter. Many people who have been involved in economic development have been aware of defects in our banking system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1956 Fine Gael pinpointed certain necessary reforms.  In the policy document of Fine Gael issued in 1965 <Col N="1988" /> it was stated that our party believed it was vitally necessary to bring about effective co-ordination between economic and monetary policies.  They considered that alterations in the present framework of our banking system were necessary.  They stated that if the policies suggested by Fine Gael were not adopted economic growth might well be impeded; if they were adopted economic development would be facilitated.  I was a Member of the House at that time and I played a small part in the drafting of the original <i>Just Society</i> document.</P>
    <P>It is a welcome change to find that the Government at this late stage have come to accept the idea that changes in our banking system are necessary.  I recall that during the 1965 general election, when our clear-cut statements on the need for a reform of the banking system were made, there was much political controversy.  The slogan used was &ldquo;Hands off the banks&rdquo;; it was stated we were going to nationalise the banks, and so on.  I have studied the Minister's speech almost line by line with the 1965 Fine Gael policy document and I find that basically it is the same as our document.  The only difference is that the Fine Gael policy document in relation to banking went much further than the Minister as regards analysing the entire banking structure.  Fine Gael welcome this first piece of new banking legislation since 1942.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outlined in detail the enormous growth of banking institutions in recent years.  He pointed out that we have had an &ldquo;open door&rdquo; policy in relation to the establishment of banking and financial institutions. There is no doubt that from an economic development point of view the changes are necessary.  It is also true that the mushroom growth of new banks makes it imperative that tighter controls should be imposed.  In so far as changes are contemplated by the Minister regarding the laying down of new regulations for registration of new banks, these are desirable and necessary.</P>
    <P>I have been astonished at the figures produced by the Minister in relation to the number of bankers' licences in <Col N="1989" /> force in this country; 70 such licences are currently in force.  The cost of the licences will be increased and the amount to be deposited with the Central Bank will be increased also.  These are necessary and desirable safeguards. I am not familiar with the actual mechanism in relation to the establishment of banks.  The entire question of banking has come into the public arena in a dramatic way in the past six or eight months because of the bank strike or lock-out&mdash;whichever term one uses.</P>
    <P>I understand that an examination of the entire banking set-up as regards staff relations and so forth, and also regarding the alternatives to the banking system which were utilised during the banks closure, is being carried out. This examination is being conducted by Professor Fogarty and I know that when he issues his report it will be of considerable interest.  Knowing the calibre of this gentleman and his competence to undertake a report such as this I would predict that the report will come as a bombshell.  This will be all to the good as it may serve to focus public opinion on the matter.</P>
    <P>One of the big problems in relation to banking has been that it is regarded as a rather mysterious operation.  Any discussion on banking or finance tends to become emotional.  I hope that the changes now contemplated in this Bill and the publication of Professor Fogarty's report will lead to much better informed public opinion.</P>
    <P>Various viewpoints have been expressed regarding the causes and consequences of the long close-down of the banks last year.  I do not propose to go into the pros and cons of the matter; I merely express the hope that every effort will be made, and all reasonable precautions taken, to ensure that such a long close-down of our banking institutions will not occur again.  I shudder to contemplate the consequences of another prolonged closure similar to the one we had recently.</P>
    <P>We have reached a sad state of affairs when the banking institutions of this country, which are expected to be leaders not only in the matter of finance but also in other spheres of public life, <Col N="1990" /> should have had such an abominably bad record in staff relations&mdash;such a bad record in staff relations that in recent times there have been three periods during which the banks were closed down.  The question of proper industrial relations is of paramount importance. Let me be quite blunt about this: the fact that this strike lasted so long is, first of all, an indictment of the staff relations system operated by the banks; and secondly, an indictment of the Government and particularly the Minister for Finance in that when it became apparent after five or six weeks that the bank strike would be prolonged, there was a bounden obligation on the Government, and particularly on the Minister for Finance, to intervene with a view to securing a speedy settlement of that dispute.  I admit that that is a debatable point but I am convinced that the Government should have intervened.</P>
    <P>In relation to the piece of legislation that is before the House, I hope it will achieve two main objectives: (1) that it will enable the banking system to play a more realistic part in all fields of national development, in agriculture, industry, tourism and so on; and (2) that the lesson has been learned and that the tragic consequences of the recent bank dispute will never be repeated in this country.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Dispute&rdquo; is a lot better than &ldquo;strike&rdquo; but I would prefer &ldquo;lock-out&rdquo;, which in fact it was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is a dispute or a lock-out makes no difference. We are on the side of the staff, as is Deputy Coughlan.  Let me refer to it as a close down of the banks.  That is the best way to get around it.  There is an absolute need for the introduction of a proper staff relation system in the banks.  I am glad to learn that some of the banks have already departed from the traditional mode of entry to the bank.  We all know that the traditional mode of entry to the bank was the system of nomination.  I do not intend to go into detail about the mechanics of having somebody nominated <Col N="1991" /> for the banks.  It was an outrageous system and it was a total contradiction of the principle of equality of opportunity.  There is no doubt that in relation to entry to the service of the bank some were &ldquo;more equal&rdquo; than others.  Therefore I was very pleased to learn that one major banking group have advertised and are now aodpting an open competitive system.  The Bank of Ireland Group, as far as I remember, operate a very modern scientific system of aptitude testing.  The old ways seem to have gone.</P>
      <P>Banking is a highly skilled and a highly technical business.  If the Irish banking system is to progress and to meet the needs of the Irish economy, all aspects of banking will have to be modernised and the most modern techniques must be adopted.  This applies particularly to the recruitment to the service of the banks.  I am very hopeful that as a result of Professor Fogarty's examination of the recent bank dispute a new era of particularly good staff relations will emerge.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a very important point when he referred to the widespread penetration of Irish banking by external interests.  Apart from the general growth of banking institutions of all kinds, merchant banks, hire purchase companies and so on, a considerable number of foreign banks have set up branches here.  The Minister has stated, and rightly so, that we are already over-banked.  That is an original expression and I think it describes the situation very well.  I agree with the Minister that in regard to the opening of new banks in the future there is need for caution.  Perhaps it was a good thing that there has been a certain amount of development here by foreign banks.  From the point of view of capital for industrial projects, tourist projects and so on, the foreign banks have been providing substantial capital but, as I said, future applications from foreign banks to establish branches here will have to be carefully considered, and I agree fully with the Minister about the need for caution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also points out that if we become a member of the EEC our <Col N="1992" /> policy in relation to banking and so forth will have to take into account any obligations we might incur regarding participation by non-nationals.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other aspects of this Bill with the details of which I am not competent to deal, but the Bill has been generally welcomed by this side of the House.  I particularly, having been involved in the formulation of the <i>Just Society</i> document in 1969, could not but be struck by the similarities between the Minister's speech and that document.  I sincerely hope that the objectives which the Minister has set out to achieve in this Bill will be realised.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a very interesting point to which I had intended to refer at the outset in regard to the role of monetary policy in economic development. The Minister said:</P>
    <P>There can be no question about the responsibility of the duly-elected Government for national economic policy of which monetary policy is an important and integral part.</P>
    <P>The Minister then referred to the relationship between the Government and the Central Bank and the lines of communication and the liaison between the two.  The intention is, as I understand it, that the Central Bank will be an autonomous body, that there will be close contact with the Minister and the Government and that there will be frequent meetings between the Governor and the representatives of the Central Bank and the Minister.  This is very necessary.  That is all I want to say on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this Bill has ranged quite far and quite wide, as was to be expected in the case of a debate on a Bill of such wide scope and implications. One of the points raised, and raised repeatedly, is not directly relevant to the Bill, strictly speaking, I suppose, but may be by implication, that is, the long bank closure which we had, the causes of it and the messages to be got from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I may be allowed to make a few comments in reply to what has been said about that.  First, I should <Col N="1993" /> like to say again, and categorically, that the Government did not desire a continuation of this dispute for the reason that the absence of banking facilities might damp down inflation, or for any other reason.  This allegation has been made from time to time and I should like to refute it categorically. In fact, during the closure in 1966, credit expanded and this experience alone provided a good reason for not relying on the bank closure last year to do the opposite.</P>
    <P>We do not yet know precisely what happened in 1970 because the necessary details of statistical information have not come to hand.  There are some preliminary indications that credit also expanded on this occasion.  Those who claim that the Government took no action to settle this dispute appear to forget that there was negotiating machinery in operation over the many months of the dispute, trying to bring about a settlement and that, in fact, the settlement which was eventually effected came about through that negotiating machinery.</P>
    <P>However, if the normal negotiating machinery which is provided for the settlement of disputes is to be set aside in one case, there is every likelihood that a similar solution will be sought in other cases, with the ultimate result that the normal machinery would simply disappear.  Deputies on all sides of the House recognise that fact.  If what they meant to say was that the implications of this dispute for the whole economy were so great that it was not to be regarded as a normal dispute, they should have said so, and they should have gone further when they did say that the Government should have stepped in, and should have spelled out what they had in mind that the Government should have done, having regard to the fact that for most of the time during the dispute, the machinery available through the Labour Court was in operation and that conciliation was actively in operation in this dispute.</P>
    <P>What did they have in mind if the Government had stepped in?  Is it that the Government should have stepped in and forced the banks to concede in full the claims made against them?  If <Col N="1994" /> that is what anybody had in mind, I think he should have said so and accepted its implications.  If that is not what was in mind, we are entitled to know what Deputies did think the Government should have done if we had swept the Labour Court aside and stepped in.  What different approach should the Government have made in that regard?  I do not think the implications of what has been said in this regard have been fully realised, or perhaps accepted, by some of the people who made these claims and these allegations.  It has been said that the Minister for Education has stepped in in the teachers' dispute.  However, this is really irrelevant.  There is no comparison because the Minister for Education is one of the prime parties involved in that dispute.</P>
    <P>At no time did I pretend that the long bank closure in 1970 did not give rise to hardship or inconvenience to the community.  I am well aware of that hardship and that inconvenience.  I am also aware of the valuable contribution made by shopkeepers, and traders, and businesses generally, by cashing cheques and providing other facilities for customers.  Indeed, I am also aware of the valuable contribution made by the non-associated banks.  I should like to thank them for it and to place our gratitude to them on record.  However, I am sure that none of those people would object if I also say&mdash;and I do not mean this in any derogatory sense &mdash;that there was, of necessity, a measure of enlightened self-interest in their attitude during the closure.</P>
    <P>A very important contribution was also made by the special arrangements which were introduced to maintain and increase the supply of currency, both notes and coin, in circulation. This involved action by all the Government Departments in conjunction with the Central Bank which played a key role in these arrangements.  Incidentally, I think there has been some misunderstanding of these arrangements in some quarters, on the ground that it was felt that Government Departments, and those employed by them, were placed in a privileged position.  It is true that wages and salaries were paid in cash in State Departments, but this <Col N="1995" /> cash circulated to pay, in turn, the wages and salaries of many others who would have been badly affected if this had not been done.</P>
    <P>The arrangements also included provision for paying social welfare benefits and cashing pension warrants.  In the case of the building industry special arrangements were made for payment in cash of the wages of workers employed on State and local authority building contracts where hardship would otherwise have resulted. Further, the number of post office remittance transactions increased enormously during the period of the dispute.  Special arrangements were made to cope with the demand for the services and to facilitate those using them.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would profit us very much at this point to continue turning over the dead leaves of a past dispute. Detailed inquiries into its causes and effects are at present in train, as I indicated when introducing the Second Stage.  When the reports are available it will be possible to make a more informed approach to the whole subject. Our concern should be with the future because this is what really matters in this whole question of the banking system in this country.</P>
    <P>As the dispute lasted for the greater part of 1970 and a vast accumulation of work arose it was only reasonable to expect that difficulties would arise when the banks reopened.  I do not accept that thousands and thousands of persons and businesses have been pushed by the banks into a state of insolvency while they are, in fact, creditworthy, as has been implied by remarks made in this House during the course of the debate.  This is a gross exaggeration.</P>
    <P>Virtually all the cases of difficulty that have come to my notice have been cases of what I might call &ldquo;credit holidays&rdquo; where the persons concerned had exceeded the permitted limit of their overdrafts.  The few cases which I have seen where the banks appeared to have acted rather harshly were settled satisfactorily on representations being made by the customer to the bank.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to comment on directives that some banks may <Col N="1996" /> have issued to their local managers. Any such directives would be private documents to which I would not have access.  Nevertheless, as I have told the House before, the Banks Standing Committee had indicated to me that the banks are prepared to examine all <i>bona fide</i> cases of difficulty sympathetically on representations being made to them.  I have no reason to suppose, whatever mistakes they may have made in the first instance, that they are not now doing so.  Indeed, it would be very foolish of them not to do so because common sense would seem to dictate that it should be a first priority of the banks to win back and retain the goodwill of their customers. There are, in fact, many indications that matters are gradually returning to normal.  Persons who awarded themselves extended credit during the closure cannot of course expect the situation to be allowed to continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some misapprehension regarding the purpose of Part III of the Bill which deals with bank mergers.  I want to make it clear that there is no question of the ground being prepared by this Bill for the merger of the two big banking groups. The main purpose in view is to facilitate the separate internal integration of the Bank of Ireland and the Allied Irish Bank groups respectively.  At present each of these groups consists of three separate banking companies. Each group has announced its intention to weld its constituent banks into a single bank and plans to this end are in train at present.  The relevant provisions of the Bill are designed to protect the rights of staff and the rights of customers and to overcome the various legal and technical difficulties associated with these plans.  I believe what is proposed will in time contribute to greater efficiency, to better use of resources and to better services to the public.  Perhaps I might add that the Minister for Finance under the provisions of this Bill will not be obliged to approve any rationalisation or merger scheme if he sees objection on the grounds that a monopoly would be created or for any other reason.</P>
    <P>Divergent views have been expressed <Col N="1997" /> here as to lack of competition, on the one hand, and excessive competition, on the other hand, between banks. There are two aspects of this: first, there is the question of a choice of banks being available.  There is, I think, a not unreasonable choice of banks available to the public at present.  Real competition, of course, involves more than a choice of banks for the customer. It is not intended that the Bill should restrict competition.  In fact, the reverse is intended.</P>
    <P>In relation to the clearing system, for example, the Bill contains provisions which are designed to place all banks on a similar footing and to prevent the emergence of practices which could defeat this.  There is already considerable competition for business between the different groups of banks. Deputy Coughlan spoke about this and obviously he did not like the recent sample of competition which he had experienced, but I do not think he can deny that the banks did compete for business on that occasion.</P>
    <P>The general commercial banks are also facing growing competition from other banks.  Many new deposit-taking institutions and new savings media are now operating including, of course, the non-associated banks.  I should like to make it clear that it is not my intention that the associated banks should be protected from fair and reasonable competition from the non-associated banks. A question would arise in my mind regarding extensive take-overs of Irish banking business by non-associated banks which are controlled from abroad and hence the note of warning which I sounded in my opening statement.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps mention that a number of references have been made in regard to the associated banks and the question of the disclosure of their true profit and loss accounts and balance sheets in future in a form showing their actual profits and total reserves.  As the House will know, the associated banks announced that they intended to do this at the end of 1970 but they had to postpone doing so because of the banks closure.  It is now intended that the new arrangement will come into effect next year.</P>
    <P>The question of Government borrowing <Col N="1998" /> was raised by Deputy O'Donovan and referred to by other Deputies.  Deputy O'Donovan suggested that our recent borrowing operations were unsuccessful.  In fact, the National Loans taken together, and this is how they should be looked at, raised a total of £45 million between new money and the re-investment of redemption money.  This amount is the highest ever raised at one time and, given the upset caused by the long suspension of normal banking services, must be regarded as very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan complained that the Government were taking too much of the credit resources of the country. He said that out of a total of £75 million available from the associated banks the Government were to get £50 million, leaving only £25 million available for everybody else.  Whether the Deputy intended it or not this gave the impression that the Government were getting twice as much credit as all other sectors.  The Deputy must know that this is not so.  The £75 million, £50 million, and £25 million referred to relate to new or additional credit.  The total amount of advances outstanding during 1969 in the case of the associated banks varied from £532 million to £613 million.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that the total amount of advances outstanding in 1969 varied from £532 million to £613 million while Government borrowing attributable to the associated banks did not exceed £167 million, or 27 per cent of the total at most.  On the basis of the Central Bank guidelines the 1970 Exchequer proportions would not have been very different if the banks had been open. <Col N="1999" /> There have been a number of comments about foreign borrowing and, indeed, the whole operation of foreign borrowing has been called in question. Our policy in this regard has been outlined in the Third Programme and it is that external borrowing should be undertaken only to a limited extent to fill residual needs and only when it is advantageous to do so.  This policy has been followed to date and it is the intention to continue to follow that policy.</P>
      <P>The State Sponsored Bodies (Foreign Borrowing) Bill which has been circulated and it was referred to during the debate is fully subject to this policy.  The Bill is a technical Bill designed to ensure that the various State-sponsored bodies will be able to borrow in a foreign currency if this should be necessary and within the limits of borrowing policy which I have indicated.  The Government, of course, would prefer to fill all their needs from domestic sources and it is only when this is not feasible that recourse will be had to outside borrowing.  The amount obtained from domestic sources could, of course, be increased by reducing the allocation of credit to the private sector but, as we have already heard, there is a complaint that too little is being left to that sector. Alternatively, the Exchequer needs could be reduced by cutting down on the public capital programme.  It must be remembered that a very large part of the funds for that programme go to meet important investment requirements in agriculture, industry, tourism, transport, housing and schools and most people would be slow to recommend any drastic reduction in that kind of activity.  Nevertheless, all proposals for capital expenditure are being subjected to a very close scrutiny with the aim of keeping the programme within reasonable bounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully alive to the inflationary effects of foreign borrowing at present but I would point out that productive investment, in particular productive investment giving a continuing production of goods or services for sale abroad, is a counterbalance to these effects.  In the inflationary situation in which we <Col N="2000" /> find ourselves it is clear that we cannot be generous in the allocation of credit as has been suggested, urged on us, indeed, by some Deputies, including Deputy Enright.  We must keep a tight rein on credit, at the same time giving priority to requirements for the productive type of projects on which we must rely to increase our real incomes and help overcome the inflationary forces with which we are dealing at present.</P>
    <P>Views which were quite conflicting and diametrically opposed were expressed by Deputies regarding the composition of the board of the Central Bank.  On the one hand it has been suggested that there should be no representative of the commercial banks on the board and on the other that representation should be given to the non-associated banks which are not now represented.  There is something to be said for both points of view.  The Bill attempts to steer a middle course between them.  It reduces the representation of the associated banks from three to two, proposing that the Minister for Finance should be enabled to appoint a further director.  In making changes in the composition of the board it is necessary to move slowly. Long before the Central Bank was set up in 1943 the banking directors of the associated banks were giving service in their own banks and then when they were appointed to the Central Bank in 1943 they continued to give excellent service in the Central Bank as directors of that bank, as distinct from being directors of the associated banks, and no difficulty has arisen since 1943 in this regard or in regard to any conflict of interest.</P>
    <P>I would not be disposed at this stage to go beyond what is proposed in the Bill.  I appreciate the point regarding the representation of non-associated banks but there are difficulties attending the course advocated.  First, there is an important principle involved in giving representation to externally controlled banks which might possibly be influenced more by their interests abroad than by their Irish interests. Secondly, there is a practical difficulty in that there is no one association representative of all the banks, although this might, perhaps, be got over as <Col N="2001" /> suggested by Deputy O'Higgins.  While I have no final view on this subject as yet, it might be better if we adopted some other machinery under which all banks would have a ready means of making their views known to the Central Bank on matters affecting them.</P>
    <P>There has been some comment about appointing the secretary of my Department as a member of the board of the Central Bank.  This has been the custom for many years and it has worked well.  Many urgent and important matters in the field of monetary policy come before the board from time to time and there is constant need for consultations between the governor and my Department which is responsible for advising me on general economic and fiscal policy.  Monetary policy is bound up with these matters and it is necessary for me to be able to refer quickly to the board through some person who is familiar with all of these matters.  I consider the present arrangement is satisfactory and that the appointment of some other persons to the board would not help the speedy dispatch of business.</P>
    <P>There are a few other miscellaneous points which I should like to mention before I conclude.  First, no cases of what I might call &ldquo;shaky&rdquo; financial institutions are known here.  However, there have been such cases abroad, particularly in England.  Provisions in the Bill are intended to guard against similar cases occurring here in the future, possibly in the case of firms controlled from abroad.  I consider a policy of prevention is better than one of cure in an area such as this.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that we should encourage in a more positive and active manner the introduction of foreign banks in this country.  We must steer a careful course in this regard because too many foreign banks could involve effective foreign control over a large sector of the national savings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, <Col N="2002" /> this matter is not settled in the Common Market.  Secondly, within the Common Market the situation is rather different.  The banks coming in here at present are not operating within a controlled community like the Common Market and may perhaps be operating almost entirely on the basis of their head office requirements in a country outside the Community.  A preponderance of foreign banks can also lead to an undesirable outflow of funds.</P>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Donegan who raised a question about section 27, which he said prohibited banks from advertising for deposits.  I do not blame the Deputy because when I read the section that is what I thought it said. However, I am assured it does not; what it is intended to say is that this prohibition applies to unlicensed banks. Nevertheless, I shall have a look at the wording to try to ensure that it is a little more clear.</P>
      <P>With regard to the transfer of the Exchequer account from the Bank of Ireland to the Central Bank, a question was raised that no compensation is, in fact, being paid to the Bank of Ireland for the loss of this account.  I was also requested to clarify the matter of the disability of the Bank of Ireland.  Under its charter and an Act of 1929 there is some doubt as to whether the Bank of Ireland can engage in certain subsidiary banking activities carried on in other banks. There are also restrictions on voting by shareholders which do not apply under the Companies Act, and thus do not apply to other banks.  We are putting the Bank of Ireland in the same position as any of the other associated banks.  I should like to make it clear that it is not intended that the Central Bank shall engage in general commercial banking.</P>

    <P>With reference to statements made by Deputy Coughlan, it should be self-evident that the banks closure did not bring about the close-down of the Hibernian Transport Company; it may have aggravated the position but it could not have caused the close-down. In regard to some of the statements made by Deputy Coughlan in this instance, he would probably be wiser to <Col N="2003" /> speak with a little more restraint because if what he says is true certain proceedings might well take place.</P>
    <P>Failure to exercise restraint in referring to the matter in this House could well result in the failure of such proceedings, which, I think, is not Deputy Coughlan's objective.</P>

      <P>I am not commenting on whether the Deputy was telling the truth.  I am simply saying that on the basis of what he was saying I think it is easy enough to deduce what he would like to see done.  By going a little too far he could well prevent the achievement of the objective which he would like to see achieved.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donovan asked what was the meaning of &ldquo;integrity of the currency&rdquo;. I would refer the Deputy to the report of the Central Bank of July, 1969 in which this question was discussed at some length.  In regard to gold which the Deputy complains has been sold, I would point out that the value of gold would need to be doubled every seven or eight years to compensate for the loss of interest at 7 per cent per annum, which we are getting on some of the assets we converted from gold.</P>
      <P>I was amazed to hear Deputy O'Donovan accuse the Central Bank of inadequate criticism of Government expenditure.  Whatever criticism might be made of the Central Bank over the years&mdash;and there has been much&mdash; this accusation could not fairly be levelled against the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the fact that there has been a degree of adverse criticism, I am glad that the Bill generally appears to be acceptable to the House.  I welcome the constructive comments made and I assure the House that they will have my close attention and consideration. I should like to make it clear that the provisions in the Bill designed to protect depositors are not specifically directed against banks that are operating here at present.  Rather are they <Col N="2004" /> a method of guarding against occurrences of the kind that happened in other countries.</P>
    <P>I referred to some amendments I shall be bringing in at the next Stage.  I think I made reference to the Supreme Court judgment in the marts case.  I should like to make it quite clear that what is involved is not, as was implied during the debate, that these amendments are designed to circumvent the judgment of the Supreme Court in some way.  In fact, the direct opposite is the case.  The amendments recognise the judgment fully and the environment in which it was given.  They are designed to ensure that banks which are being asked to comply with certain conditions will have a clear opportunity of making representations in regard to any difficulties which may be involved, if they wish to do so.  They will also ensure that where the Central Bank proposes to impose a restriction on advertising by a bank it can do so in the interests of the proper regulation of banking.  I have not dealt with all the points raised but I think many are more suitable for comment on the Committee Stage.  No doubt we will get the opportunity of dealing with them, but I hope I have dealt with the major points raised in the debate at this stage.</P>

    <Title>International Health Bodies (Corporate Status) Bill, 1970 [Seanad]:    Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a short Bill providing, in a fairly straightforward way, facilities to permit the incorporation in this country of international bodies in the health field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill started its journey through the Houses of the Oireachtas in the Seanad and I must say, in this regard, that the decision to introduce the Bill in the Seanad was a most fortunate one.  It was given a very detailed scrutiny on all Stages and due particularly <Col N="2005" /> to the hard work of certain legally expert Senators, notably Senator FitzGerald, an improved Bill has emerged.  I think the instrument now before you is a happy blend giving reasonable safeguards for everyone including the citizens of this country, and easing the incorporation for international organisations seeking this facility in Ireland which is so essential if we are to attract them here.</P>
    <P>The need for the Bill arose because the International Federation of Voluntary Health Service Funds was anxious to be incorporated in Ireland but found our existing legislation unsuitable.  This body, which had its origins at the first international conference on voluntary health insurance held in Dublin in September, 1966, has as its aim the development and study of voluntary non-profit making health insurance services throughout the world.  It is not itself a commercial organisation but rather a deliberative, study and research organisation in the field of voluntary health insurance.  Its membership at present consists of 90 organisations which provide health insurance services, broadly speaking, similar to those which are being provided by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board which is the Irish organisation in membership.  The then general manager of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board was appointed the first secretary general and treasurer of the federation.</P>
    <P>An examination of existing legislation confirmed that such legislation was not, in fact, appropriate to the type of body such as the International Federation of Voluntary Health Service Funds is.  I felt it desirable that a body of this kind should be encouraged to set up its headquarters in this country and, indeed, I feel that this might be the first of many international health organisations who might be attracted to come here.  The House will readily appreciate the significance to the country and the economy, in prestige and economic terms, if we were to become a recognised centre of international activity in the health field.  We have much to offer in location and facilities and the benefit to our tourist industry would not be inconsiderable. For these reasons, therefore, I agreed <Col N="2006" /> to sponsor the Bill now before the House and, as you will note, it applies to international health bodies generally and not solely to the federation.</P>
    <P>In sponsoring the Bill I have borne in mind the type of body that we wish to encourage to set up here.  These will be organisations of an international character whose aims and functions will relate wholly or mainly to deliberation about the health of persons, health insurance, the care and treatment of the sick or infirm, the administration of health services or medical, including dental, research. These will all be organisations who will not engage in commercial or trading activities in this country.  I will have to be satisfied that their standing and reputation is above reproach before I would consider making a corporate status order.  Moreover, I have built into the Bill an additional safeguard under which a corporate status order cannot be made until the draft order has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.  If there were anything questionable about such a body, or about the way it might conduct its affairs, both Houses of the Oireachtas would, in effect, have the power of veto over its incorporation.</P>
    <P>A corporate status order, which can only be made after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, will confer on the body the right to be called and known by the title specified in the order, the power to sue and be sued in its corporate name, and the right to hold land.  It will be required to maintain an office in the State to which communications may be addressed and at which documents may be served, to supply the Minister for Health with any information, including copies of annual or other duly audited accounts and a copy of its constitution together with where necessary a translation, as he may reasonably require.  The Minister, on the other hand, must maintain a register of bodies to which corporate status orders relate and make this register available for public inspection. The Minister must also submit an annual report to both Houses of <Col N="2007" /> the Oireachtas on the exercise of his functions.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate in the Seanad I accepted a number of amendments and refused to accept others.  Perhaps this is the appropriate time to comment on one proposed amendment which I did not accept and which I promised to look at again.  The proposed amendment provided that the corporate status order made by the Minister in relation to a body would be conclusive evidence that all the requirements of the Act and all matters precedent and incidental thereto had been complied with and that the body was a body corporate duly incorporated under this enactment.  I have considered the proposed amendment again, as I promised I would, and I am advised that the amendment is unnecessary.  What the Senator concerned&mdash;Senator FitzGerald &mdash;aims at achieving has been done already by section 4 of the Documentary Evidence Act, 1925 and section 17 of the Minister and Secretaries Act, 1924.  These two provisions oblige courts to accept certain copies of orders of the Minister as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the order which was made until evidence is given to the contrary.</P>
    <P>I consider that this Bill is desirable and that any development of this country as an international health centre should be encouraged.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a happy and a pleasing thing that the Minister in introducing this Bill in this House should have referred to its initiation and passage through the Seanad and in doing so should have paid a well-deserved tribute to the work done on the Bill by many of the Senators there, and in particular by Senator FitzGerald.  Undoubtedly Senator FitzGerald in dealing with the Bill in the Seanad did bring to it a great deal of expert legal knowledge which the Minister has frankly acknowledged and has benefited from, so that the Bill has undoubtedly been improved as it emerged from the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to see that the idea of this Bill springs from the first international <Col N="2008" /> conference on voluntary health insurance which was held here in September, 1966.  It is a good thing that from that conference the idea which led to this Bill being introduced has come. While the Bill is intended to meet the organisation mentioned here which is going to set up its headquarters in this country, very correctly the Minister has made the Bill to be of such a nature that it can be used and can be suitable for other similar organisations should they wish to set up a headquarters here.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Seanad debate that questions were raised as to the need in law for a Bill of this kind.  My own assessment of that debate would rather indicate that the matter is still an open question.  Nevertheless, I would feel, on balance, that it is more desirable to have this kind of legislation which can be easily used and which can provide in a very quick way for the setting up of a suitable body corporate here. I join with the Minister in hoping that the example being set here may be followed by other countries, and that we may get the name and the prestige of being a country where suitable legal machinery is available for international organisations dealing with health.  So far as we are concerned, this Bill is agreeable and we accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who has read the Seanad debate on this Bill must concur with what has been said here by the Minister and Deputy O'Higgins, that Senator FitzGerald and Senator Robinson made very useful contributions to the Bill and obviously to its improvement by the amendments they suggested and which the Minister accepted. This is a very technical Bill in some respect and I certainly do not feel in any way competent to criticise it at the level at which they dealt with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder why the Bill was brought into the House.  Why was it given priority over what I would have felt were more urgent matters relevant to our own community here?  Has the Minister for Health no other legislation that could have been introduced, such as an amendment of the Mental Treatment Acts?  Surely other Departments of State could have used the time of <Col N="2009" /> the two Houses to provide additional and better services in relation to their Departments than are likely to follow on the passage of this Bill through the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister could have spared us the suggestion that this will alter or improve in any significant way the tourist industry or our economy.  This kind of silly euphoria about matters of this kind, and such arguments in promoting a provision of this kind, bear no relation to the facts, quite obviously. This Bill will make little or no difference in that regard.</P>
    <P>The wording &ldquo;deliberation of the health of persons&rdquo; seems to be very clumsy phraseology.  &ldquo;Deliberation&rdquo; means the careful consideration or discussion of reasons for and against something. In his opening statement the Minister used the phrase &ldquo;development and study of voluntary non-profit making health insurance services throughout the world&rdquo; which seem to be a very much clearer set of objectives.</P>
    <P>If it is accepted that the function of this body is to concern itself with consideration and discussion and research of bodies of this kind, why is it necessary to include the word &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; in the section?  Why not just say &ldquo;whose constitution consists wholly of the deliberation of the health of persons&rdquo; or &ldquo;the development and study of voluntary non-profit making health insurance services throughout the world&rdquo;?  I am worried about this and I hope the Minister will be able to reassure me.  This whole activity of the health or the care of sick people and the expansion of health services is an extremely controversial subject.</P>
    <P>One aspect which might possibly be concerned here is the possibility of people using Ireland as an accommodation address for a purpose such as fund raising of one kind or another of a reputable or possibly a disreputable nature.  To what extent could this happen under these powers?  I presume that when the Minister sees the constitution of these various bodies which compose the federation&mdash;and the aims and objections will no doubt be included in the constitution&mdash;will it be possible also to see the balance sheet relating to past activities?  Will all of this information be available to <Col N="2010" /> the public in English?  I see that the Minister says that where needed translations can be made available.</P>
    <P>Will all this be made available to any member of the public who wants to inquire into the proposed activities and past activities of any group or body who may choose to use this facility which we are now providing? Is there to be a central secretariat here?  If there is, has the Minister any idea of its proposed size?</P>
    <P>If there is to be a secretariat what is the position in relation to employees of that body?  Will non-nationals, for instance, be facilitated in getting permission for employment here?  Will they have any special rights as a result of the passage of this Bill which will allow an international federation to employ anybody it wishes?  Is there any kind of provision whereby a certain number of Irish nationals will be employed in either the central body or any of the 90 or so organisations which may decide to set up here?  I do not know whether my fears are justified but the Minister will recall that there has been a good deal of exploitation of illness for illicit fund-raising purposes both here and elsewhere.  Are we protected sufficiently well from any such possibility in this Bill?</P>
    <P>It is strange that this body should decide to set up in Dublin when it has generally been accepted that Geneva was the city in which most of these bodies have been chosen to establish themselves.  Even from the Minister's speech and from reading the speeches in the Seanad I am still at a loss to know what the ultimate purpose of this body is likely to be and in what way it can be of any great value to those concerned in the methods used in different communities for funding health services of one kind or another.  Does this body have a central organisation? Does it have an executive and does it have formal discussions in the organisation established in Dublin?  Is that what is likely to happen?  Is it something like the World Health Organisation?  Does it restrict itself exclusively to the various forms of voluntary health insurance schemes or has it a wider function?</P>
    <P>When the Minister says that we have <Col N="2011" /> the right to veto any order he makes I presume he will allow us to see an annual report in regard to its function. What would our position be if we wanted access to the balance sheets of these various organisations as well as a general report from the Minister as to what he might consider to be the various activities of this body?  Apart from these few points as far as I am concerned, the sooner the Bill is passed the better so that we can get on with some worthwhile work in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was first introduced in the Seanad in 1970 and objections and exceptions were taken to certain sections of it.  Many Senators wondered why the provisions of the Companies Act were not suitable or adequate to deal with this particular type of organisation.  Company law was updated a few years ago and the late Deputy Sweetman, who was an expert on company law, had a big hand in the 1963 Act.  Many Senators were, however, of the opinion that as our company law had been updated it could cover this type of body, but it was found inappropriate.  The Minister in his introductory remarks today mentioned the fact that the decision to introduce the Bill in the Seanad was a most fortunate one and I entirely agree with him.  It shows the excellent type of work that can be done in the Seanad and I hope the Government in future will introduce many more such Bills there because some Senators are expert in this particular type of work and certainly as far as this Bill is concerned they did a very good job on it.</P>
      <P>In his Second Reading speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>It was given a very detailed scrutiny on all stages and due particularly to the hard work of certain legally expert Senators, notably Senator FitzGerald, an improved Bill has emerged.</P>
      <P>I think everyone will agree with the Minister in that regard.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>I think the instrument now before you is a happy blend giving reasonable safeguards for everyone including the citizens of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2012" /> I entirely agree with that.  The Minister should be congratulated and complimented for his helpful and co-operative approach towards the many amendments that were proposed in the Seanad.  I believe in giving credit where credit is due and so far as the present Minister for Health is concerned he listens to what people have to say and he endeavours to meet their wishes. After all, that is what Ministers are for.  The present Minister for Health is one of the few Ministers who tries to meet people half-way and he certainly did so as far as this Bill was concerned.  It is a pity that some of his colleagues would not follow in his footsteps.</P>
    <P>As far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned we welcome the Bill without reservation.  We should encourage in every way possible the setting up of international bodies here.  We should do our utmost to expedite the setting up of the headquarters of this international organisation.  The establishment of such an organisation will be of enormous benefit to the country as a whole and of great benefit to the Irish medical profession.  I hope that other bodies will follow in their footsteps. I am inclined to disagree with Deputy Dr. Browne who did not think such a body would attract tourists.  I think such a body can help to bring prestige to a small country like ours and help to focus the proper type of attention on our country.</P>
    <P>This Bill was introduced into the Seanad on 24th May and was finally passed in June.  What was the reason for the delay in introducing it into this House?  I should have thought the Government would have tried to deal with it during the Autumn Session but perhaps they may not be setting up here for another few months.  At the present time the Food and Agriculture Organisation has its headquarters in Rome, the World Health Organisation has its headquarters in Geneva, the International Atomic Energy Authority has its headquarters in Vienna, the Council of Europe has its headquarters in Strasbourg and the new International Organisation for Cancer Research has its headquarters in Lyons.  Many distinguished Irish men and women are working at all levels in those institutions. <Col N="2013" /> The benefits of an international organisation like the International Health Bodies cannot be overemphasised.  It will help to put this country on the international map.  It will provide much-needed employment and Deputies on all sides of the House are interested in giving employment to people at home.  Any type of international conference brings a constant stream of visitors to the country in which it is being held.  No doubt the same would happen in this case.  We would expect to have a constant stream of visitors attending conferences and the scientific aspects of those organisations, and we would expect a great stimulus to local development in the various areas that those organisations would cover.</P>
    <P>If this Bill goes through and if these bodies are acting as agents for local authorities, local authority employees will in effect be working for some authority other than that which first employed them.  If given the chance such an employee might not like to work for that particular authority.  It is only a technical point but I was asked to raise it by an employee.  I suppose he could opt out.  We welcome this Bill and we are prepared to give the Minister all Stages now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their kind reception of this Bill.  The matter of employment of staff by any international body would be a matter entirely for themselves but they would have to observe the laws regarding the employment of non-nationals&mdash;that, of course, does not include British citizens with whom we have reciprocal rights &mdash;so that the likelihood of anybody employing an undesirable number of non-nationals when nationals could perform the task is very remote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne asked why we used the word &ldquo;deliberation&rdquo;.  We decided to use that word because it seemed to be the best word to describe an organisation which, above all, was not going to be a trading body.  If it were a trading body, then, obviously, it would have to observe the whole of the Company's Act legislation.  It was because this Bill applies only to international deliberative organisations who come together to consider the latest medical techniques, to discuss every <Col N="2014" /> possible subject related to health but who do not trade themselves that we use the word &ldquo;deliberation&rdquo;. The Deputy need not worry about international bodies who are going to raise funds for some wrong purpose coming here.  It would be quite possible for me when submitting an incorporation order to the House to be assured of that.  I do not think that the kind of bodies which are likely to apply here would be ones for which I would have to provide the balance sheet to be scrutinised by Members of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The immediate body, the International Federation of Voluntary Health Service Funds has as its general secretary the now retired manager of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board here.  He is a person of such integrity that I would never dream of questioning him or the activities of his body when he comes before us and, as I hope, presents the constitution in full of the International Federation of Voluntary Health Service Funds.  I do not think the House will have any difficulty agreeing to the incorporation of that body in this country knowing the reputation of the ex-manager of the Voluntary Health Board and the splendid work he did when he held that office.  The board is one of the most successful boards of voluntary health insurance that could be conceived and they have made tremendous progress.  He and his staff were responsible for that and we can be happy that the first body is one of whom he is the secretary.</P>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo; is put in for a purely legalistic purpose. While these bodies who wish to be incorporated are deliberative they will employ staff and, therefore, are not totally deliberative.  They must employ staff and they must rent premises: therefore, we use &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo;. It could be possible that a body whose deliberations were 90 per cent concerned with health could on occasion examine some other aspect of sociological work of one kind or another and it would be a pity to be unable to incorporate them if they so desired if their objectives went slightly beyond what strictly could be regarded as a health matter but also included matters <Col N="2015" /> relating to studies of sociological aspects of services in various countries.</P>
    <P>If one were to ask what we shall gain in health knowledge from this international federation the answer is that one of their objectives is to try to get reciprocity between various countries by the nationals of those countries if they leave one country and go to another, that they should be able to carry the insurance they have accumulated and have it applied in the other country.  Then of course this body engages in the complex studies of the whole principles of insurance, of actuarial values, makes comparisons of sickness rates and so forth and much useful work can be done by making these comparisons and examining changes which have taken place in the scope of the various voluntary health insurance schemes in different countries. That is the kind of deliberative work in which this body engages.  I do not think we need worry about the body forming an accommodation address for some nefarious purpose because the provisions of section 6 would quickly uncover any such address.</P>
    <P>This body is not a large one and would employ a comparatively small staff.  We look forward, if we can, to seeing other international organisations here.  As the House knows, we have a very considerable number of international medical conferences every year and we hope that some of them may establish their headquarters here. There is already a very considerable tourism income from the many international associations who have their annual conferences here.  We have two or three, if not more, coming in the next financial year for whom receptions have been arranged.</P>
    <P>I would be very glad if the House could give me all Stages now because in the Seanad no less than ten changes were made all designed to ensure that bodies that came here would be properly supervised and to protect the public against any body that might come here for a nefarious purpose or to protect the public in case the body became bankrupt.  I have asked my officers and they cannot recall the disappearance through bankruptcy or the <Col N="2016" /> failure of any major international health organisation.  There is an enormous number of these international colleges of cardiologists, and there is an international association for almost every discipline in the world, and we cannot recall a scandal connected with any one.  Bearing that in mind, with the safeguards in the Bill, the House can be satisfied that they will have sufficient control over the arrangements made for the incorporation, or, as we hope will never happen, the revocation of corporate status orders.</P>

      <P>As I have said, the purpose of this short Bill is to enable the Minister for Local Government to establish by order, from time to time, corporate bodies to provide specified services for himself and for local authorities.  In its present form, the Bill was passed by the Seanad on 10th February, having been introduced in that House some weeks earlier.  A similar Bill was introduced in this House in July last but this was withdrawn on 27th January last, so as to enable the Bill to be introduced in the Seanad.</P>

    <P>The immediate need for a power to establish corporate bodies to provide services for local authorities arises from representations by trade unions and staff associations on the one hand, and the county and city managers on the other, about the impracticability of operating the present Local Authority Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme in a satisfactory manner in present circumstances.  At present, the managers as a group&mdash;who constitute the official side under the scheme&mdash;cannot provide themselves with the staff and other facilities they require for the purpose <Col N="2018" /> of examining salary and wage claims and engaging in prompt and meaningful negotiations with the staff side.  It is essential that action should be taken to provide the facilities required by the official side.  Effective steps cannot, however, be taken without legislation and, for this reason, the present Bill was introduced.</P>
    <P>Although the immediate need for the legislation stems from the necessity to establish a particular body, the Bill is framed in general terms so that it can be used to establish bodies to provide other services for local authorities, or for the Minister, if this is found to be necessary or desirable.  While no decisions have yet been made to provide other services for local authorities by corporate bodies, it would be a pity not to avail of the opportunity of making general statutory provision to enable other services to be made available in this way if the need should arise.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a relatively simple and straightforward one.  It is based, to a large extent, on the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, under which corporate bodies may be established to perform functions in, or in relation to, the provision of health services.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (1) is the key provision in the Bill&mdash;it is this subsection which confers the power to establish corporate bodies by order.  The effect of section 2 is that such bodies may be established only to provide services for the Minister, or for local authorities within the meaning of the Local Government Acts, or health boards.  However, under section 3 (3), a corporate body, once established for the purpose I have just mentioned, will be able to make its services available, on agreed terms, to other bodies, provided that these are designated by the Minister by order under section 3 (2).  Examples of the kinds of bodies which might be designated are vocational education committees, county committees of agriculture, boards of conservators of fisheries, harbour authorities and corporate bodies established under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961.  The power to designate would be used only if the body in question sought the services of the corporate body and, when the designation is made, it would be <Col N="2019" /> for the corporate body and the designated body to agree whether the services should be provided, the extent to which they should be provided and the terms and conditions that would govern their provision, including the making of an appropriate charge.</P>
    <P>Section 4 sets out the kinds of provisions which may be included in establishment orders; these relate to administration, finances, membership, staffing and so on.  On staffing, I might mention that provision is made for applying, in appropriate cases, the Local Appointments Commission machinery and the Local Government (Superannuation) Acts.  In so far as finances are concerned, the House will appreciate that this is a matter which will have to be considered separately in each case.  Provision is made, however, for grants, for levies on local authorities and for the charging of fees, so that a suitable method can be selected in each case.  I should mention here that I gave an undertaking in the Seanad, which I now repeat, that provision will be made in each establishment order requiring the accounts of a corporate body to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 7, in addition to providing for the laying of every order made under the Act before each House of the Oireachtas, requires a copy of every order to be sent to each Member of each House as soon as possible after it is made.  There is also provision for annulment within seven sitting days after presentation.  These provisions are similar to those of the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961.  They will apply to establishment orders, designation orders under section 3 (2), amending orders under section 3 (8), and revoking orders under section 5.</P>
    <P>In other legislation the period during which a resolution for the annulment of a statutory instrument may be moved is 21 sitting days.  Deputies will appreciate, however, that if a corporate body established for a particular purpose is to get on with its job, it cannot do so if the threat of dissolution by reason of annulment of the relevant establishment order is hanging over it for the long period which might be <Col N="2020" /> represented by 21 sitting days.  Under the proposed procedure, the making of the Order will have been brought immediately to the notice of every Member. In these circumstances, I am confident that the House will agree that the period of seven sitting days is not an unreasonable time in which to allow a Member to move to secure annulment if he wishes to do so.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not intended to interfere in any way with, or detract from, the powers of local authorities, nor is it a move towards centralisation.  Its sole object is to enable suitable machinery to be established to make available to local authorities certain kinds of services which, of their very nature, need to be organised on a countrywide basis or which, for one reason or another, cannot be provided by local authorities individually.  The procedure proposed for establishing corporate bodies is a convenient, speedy and cheap one. Moreover, it will ensure that the Dáil and Seanad, and individual Members will be kept informed of the establishment of any corporate bodies and that the Oireachtas will, in the last analysis, have control over the establishment of such bodies.</P>
    <P>The powers which the Bill would confer are urgently required so as to enable the Local Authority Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme to operate more efficiently and more expediously. Accordingly, I would commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to this Bill.  In fact, anyone who read the debate in the Seanad would realise that it would be repetitious to address remarks on this matter to the Minister, because most of the questions that might be asked were answered in the Seanad.  I welcome the use of the Seanad for this purpose&mdash;and I am sure this view is shared by other Members.  Non-contentious Bills can be introduced and dealt with in the Seanad, perhaps in a better atmosphere than here, and in this way we can ensure that some progress is made towards getting legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the events of the past 12 <Col N="2021" /> months, which topic I do not wish to introduce into this non-contentious piece of legislation, the amount of legislation that has not been dealt with is colossal.  Failure to enact legislation has meant that in many cases the livelihood of people has suffered to a great extent.  I welcome the fact that this Bill, and the previous Bill dealt with in this House, were introduced in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I find one slightly amusing aspect to this Bill, namely, where there is reference to town commissioners.  The White Paper issued by the Minister will take care of some of them&mdash;if not all of them.  Therefore, town commissioners might be excluded from the Bill.</P>

      <P>Mr. Chairman, in relation to Private Members' time, there are a number of motions on the order paper for quite a considerable time in the name of a number of Deputies from the Fianna Fáil Party.

      <P>It is contrary to Standing Orders not to take motions in rotation in relation to the parties. Since Private Members' time started a number of motions have been taken from Fine Gael and Labour.  As an ordinary Member of Dáil Éireann, irrespective of party, I wish to point out that this means that the motions of the Deputies of the Government party have not been taken by agreement or otherwise and we are being deprived of an opportunity of expressing our opinion on such motions in <Col N="2022" /> relation to matters affecting the people we represent.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann bearing in mind the necessity of striking a balance between its rights and the need to safeguard the commercial freedom of semi-State bodies, requests that a permanent Dáil Committee, representative of all Parties, should be established for the purpose of examining and reporting on the activities of these bodies.</P>
      <P>This is not the first occasion on which a motion of this sort has been discussed in the Oireachtas.  It has been referred to many times but I might, perhaps, mention in particular the debate in Seanad Éireann on the 2nd March, 1950 on a motion by Senator Orpen.  It was a preliminary kind of motion:</P>
      <P>that Seanad Éireann is of opinion that a Joint Committee of Members of both Dáil and Seanad Éireann should be set up to consider and report on what steps (if any) should be taken to provide for a periodic review of the operation of companies in which the State holds a majority of the issued shares.</P>
      <P>Among the people who contributed to that debate was Mr. Patrick McGilligan, then Minister for Finance. I am aware, and people who read his contribution will be aware, that he had made a serious study of the matter.  He ended up with a suggestion&mdash;for reasons which he considered good and sufficient&mdash;that the motion should be let rest having been discussed.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2026" /> I ask the Seanad, having given me the benefit of their views, not to pass the resolution but to let the matter rest here.  If it should become necessary, I will come here and indicate what is going on and let the Seanad pass its views on it, or come back and ask to have this resolution resubmitted, so that it could be assented to and the committee of inquiry referred to set up.</P>
    <P>That is a quotation from column 726 of the Official Report of the Seanad Debates of 2nd March, 1950.</P>
    <P>There have been many references to the matter since but that certainly was the most important one.  There is general agreement that it is a very awkward problem.  The British have come to no decision about it, although they considered it many times.  The Swedes have a system very like our Committee of Public Accounts.  The chairman and senior officials of semi-State bodies, the equivalent of our semi-State bodies, come before their Committee of Public Accounts and bring their papers with them and they are answerable in much the same way as our accounting officers are answerable.</P>
    <P>The motion deals with a serious basic problem and attempts to tackle the problem have been made in many countries.  On the whole, when we find that very practical people like the English are reluctant to start something, we have cause to think twice about it.  It is now 21 years since 1950 and, of course, the position has changed very considerably in the interval.  At that time the total capital programme of the State was somewhere in the region of £30 million. Now it is approaching £200 million. Whatever reasons there were&mdash;and there were enough reasons at the time &mdash;for suggesting that if at all possible, some method should be found of investigating these bodies, these reasons are all the stronger today.</P>
    <P>The directors of these semi-State bodies are expected to run them in the public interest but we know that the directors of private enterprise companies frequently have little or no regard for the interest of the shareholders <Col N="2027" /> but have a great deal of regard for the institutions themselves.  That is to say, if you like to make a comparison, that the people who would be running the semi-State bodies would have more regard for the interests of tourism, or transport, or what have you, than they would have for the welfare of the people of the country as a whole, to use the phrase in some of the Acts.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that as the semi-State bodies grow older, this tendency will develop and it is likely that they will be run more in accord with the views of the officials who staff them, than in accordance with the interests of the people of the country.  These are public boards run on public money and operated by people who are, in fact, if not in name, public servants.  They are certainly public servants in the general sense of that term.  In many cases the money imposes a liability on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking policy is based on the terms of Acts of the Oireachtas. These semi-State bodies are supposed to be governed by these Acts.  We all know that the general fashion in which Bills have to be phrased, the general language in which they have to be couched, means that they have very little influence on how these bodies carry out their work.  Perhaps I should mention that, up to the present, the main reason why there has not been any interference was the feeling that the State sets up these bodies in this particular way to take them away from the direct control of Parliament and the Comptroller and Auditor General, so that they will have freedom, being commercial enterprises in many cases, to carry out their business without being answerable for their day to day administration.</P>
    <P>There is a world of territory between day to day office administration and broad lines of policy.  It is here, of course, that the serious problem arises. That problem is not answered by the reports and accounts that are usually presented yearly to the Oireachtas.  All the time there is a desire that these bodies should be autonomous and that they should not be interfered with.  It is a question of whether this form of <Col N="2028" /> autonomy must be maintained at all costs.</P>
    <P>I should like to give some examples of what can happen.  Following the passing of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1947, which was an ideal moment, agricultural prices being at rock bottom, the board of directors of the company continued to make no loans, in effect, lending just a couple of hundred thousand pounds a year.  This went on until the present chairman, Mr. Considine, became chairman of the board.  Then the policy changed.  I noted in answer to a Parliamentary Question put down last week by Deputy Bruton that the Agricultural Credit Corporation lent £5 million during a limited period recently.</P>
    <P>The fact was that the corporation in its early years had been lending fairly broadly and then ran into serious trouble in the agricultural world of the 30s.  They got such a severe lesson then that they almost literally went out of business.  What was of significance was that the commercial banks would not lend the farmers 1s at the same time. The minute the Agricultural Credit Corporation, under the guidance of Mr. Considine, began lending money to the farmers, the commercial banks said: &ldquo;We too.&rdquo;  They began to pour money into agriculture as well as the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  Indeed, this country suffered very severly in the early part of the 50s because of the non-operation of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1947.</P>
    <P>Let me speak about another body.  A booklet was published last week&mdash;or at least I got a copy of it in the post&mdash; by the Institute of Public Administration entitled <i>Cost Benefit Analysis of the Operations of Bord na Móna.</i> One reason why I was interested in it, apart from the fact that it was about Bord na Móna, was that I do not really understand exactly what cost benefit analysis means.  It is one of these new things which have been brought into economics since I was at college.  I thought this provided an ideal opportunity to learn what is was all about.  I do know a good deal about Bord na Móna and I have a great admiration for the manner in which that body has conducted its affairs.  What shocks me about this booklet is that <Col N="2029" /> the two learned gentlemen from Trinity College, Dublin who wrote the book, took the year 1968-69 as the base for the purpose of their report.  I do not know whether or not it is coincidental that 1968-69 was the best year Bord na Móna ever had.  Through no fault of its own it had six very bad years climatically from 1960 onwards.  This suggests to me that this is not a fair financial analysis of the position of Bord na Móna.  It suggests also that academics employed to do such a job do not show very good judgment.</P>
    <P>It has been said that if a committee of the Dáil were set up we could not get people in the House with the necessary experience because of the diversity of operations of these bodies. I do not accept that view.  Members of this House come from a great variety of occupations and strata of society, if that be of any significance.  Semi-State bodies vary greatly quite apart from the different projects they undertake and difference in size.  Giants like the Central Bank and the ESB have a capital in excess of a couple of hundred million pounds whereas small bodies like Bord na gCon and Bord na gCapall have a very small capital, and bodies such as the Rheumatism Clinic have a nominal capital.  The fact of the matter is that these bodies at the present time are responsible to nobody.  I do not think this particular position applies anywhere else in the community except in the case of complete private ownership.  This should not be allowed to continue indefinitely.  The expenditure of these bodies has increased fantastically in recent years.</P>
    <P>How the committee would operate is the question.  The present commercial accountants are not worth tuppence in this context.  I once had a problem about which I consulted the then Comptroller and Auditor General who was the commercial auditor of a particular company.  He said, &ldquo;I can do nothing about it; I am only the commercial auditor in this case.  If I were acting as Comptroller and Auditor General I could do something about it.&rdquo;  All these bodies have commercial auditors although there was a period when the Comptroller and Auditor General was, in fact, made the commercial <Col N="2030" /> auditor but, if he has not the power to act as Comptroller and Auditor General, he is no better in that context than a commercial auditor would be.</P>
    <P>The British used to have a system of sending to places like Egypt a man called the Treasury Remembrancer. He was usually a senior official of the Treasury who had to be put out to grass because he was not able to cope with the hurly-burly of life around Whitehall.  In these foreign places he had the power of complete veto.  I would not suggest such extreme action but I do think the committee might have attached to it an internal investigator. We all know what an internal auditor is in a single company.  An internal investigator should be a person of real administrative and financial experience who would act on such information as he could collect himself or on information supplied to him by members of the committee or other responsible people.  He would then do the preliminary work for the committee which would call the directors and senior officers of these companies before them and ask them whatever questions they thought appropriate.</P>
    <P>Most of these companies are run by part-time directors.  These part-time directors receive low remuneration although on occasion there are suggestions that they also receive fringe benefits of certain kinds.  They do not tend to interfere with the full-time officials. At the weekly or monthly meetings they tend to accept whatever is put before them by the full-time officials of these organisations.  There are many reasons for this.  First of all, a lack of intimate knowledge about the business, second a fear of upsetting the machinery of management in the company and third the nature of committee control itself.</P>
    <P>I am not to be taken as suggesting that we have suffered in any way severely from the kind of thing that is said to have happened in Australia where many retired and defeated politicians have been placed on the boards of semi-State bodies.  There is a special reason for referring to Australia in this connection because Australia was <Col N="2031" /> the first country in the world to set up this kind of organisation.  For a time they were a great success but it was later suggested that the boards of such bodies were being loaded with politicians who were either retired or defeated.  There is no coercive evidence that this is true but it might be said that some of our directors are people who have backed one Government party or another.  As the present Government party have been in office for 33 years I suggest that an analysis of the political opinions of directors of semi-State bodies would indicate a substantial majority of supporters of the Government party.  There are, however, some directors I know who are not just Tadgh an Dhá Thaobh but are Tadgh an Trí Thaobh, everything to Fianna Fáil, everything to Fine Gael and everything to Labour, as befits the government at a particular time.</P>
    <P>There is limited control at present from Ministers and their Departments. There have been two occasions when Ministers did harm by interfering, although I do not think that is the case at the present time.  One occasion was in relation to the ESB.  If a Minister is inclined to be a busybody he is more likely to intrude in the affairs of the semi-State bodies with a great deal more irritation than any committee of this House could intrude on them.</P>
    <P>What is a day to day matter and what is a matter suitable for decision by Government policy?  Would a £¼ million grant for a new industry or £100,000 for a hotel in the west be matters decided by the Government or by the semi-State body concerned?  I think it would be a matter for the semi-State body.  I do not think the Government would intrude.  So extensive has expenditure become that a proposition would have to cost about £1 million before the Cabinet would become closely concerned with it.  There is a method by which the Government can control them at present but it is a very slow one.  If a Minister disagrees with the directors of one of the bodies for which his Department are responsible, he can gradually remove them. A director is generally retired each year, but this is a very slow method <Col N="2032" /> of changing policy.  The only other method he could operate would be to introduce an amending Bill altering the nature of the board but that might run into very serious criticism.  He might, of course, make things so difficult for the board of directors that some of the more independent members might resign.  However, I do not think that would be desirable because while it was going on the board would be affected and the people working on it would be aware of the difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Ministers in charge of Departments which are responsible for individual companies must act as kind of overlords and co-ordinate the work of the companies.  Usually companies attached to the Department of Agriculture are agricultural companies, those attached to the Department of Finance are financial companies, and so on, and there is no doubt that the Minister should have the right to co-ordinate policies between various groups.  There has been great reticence about doing anything about this awkward problem, for quite good reasons.  The day has arrived when it will have to be tackled. The capital budget for 1970-71 was estimated at £200 millions in round figures of which about £80 millions was spent by semi-State bodies and the remainder by the local authorities and the Government on housing, health and so on, but the air companies at the beginning of the year were expected to spend £24 million and the ESB £23 million so that these two giants have been responsible for about 60 per cent of the capital expenditure of semi-State bodies, although they employ only about 20 per cent of the workers employed by semi-State bodies.  This is one of the difficulties.  Despite the efforts made since the end of the last world war to come to a conclusion about this matter the extent of the capital expenditure now controlled by these bodies is such that the matter cannot be put on the long finger any longer.  I know of no method better than the method suggested in this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I intend to be brief because frankly the points I had intended mentioning have <Col N="2033" /> been covered adequately by the proposer and in a much better fashion than I could have covered them.  We are asking for a permanent committee of the House to be set up to examine the expenditure of State bodies and realising the nature of these bodies and of the desirability of giving them very considerable latitude we even embody that in the motion.  These bodies are growing more and more powerful and influential and in some cases more and more expensive to the taxpayers and therefore there should be a procedure whereby they will be accountable to impartial people on behalf of the taxpayers who contribute very considerable sums of money.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donovan has given examples of other countries in which they deal with this problem but we think the solution to our problem lies in the setting up of a committee on the lines of the Committee of Public Accounts which has displayed impartiality and objectivity in its normal sittings over a long number of years and therefore this motion should commend itself to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We support this motion because it is part of our stated policy; we stated this before the last general election and during it.  We support the motion in no desire to interfere with the activities of State companies in any way.  Deputy Cluskey has expressed the same idea.  The figures given by Deputy O'Donovan for the capital moneys going into these companies year after year indicate that they are becoming a very major feature of our lives.  More and more people are being employed by them and the semi-State bodies are indulging in more and more activities, some of which we might commend and some we might not, but in which we might desire that they should not indulge.  It does seem extraordinary that Parliament should have no voice, in the working of these bodies whereas Parliament has, this year, expressed itself through the committee of Public Accounts in regard to the expenditure by the State of State funds.  I cannot see why, except that it is just one move further ahead, this Committee can investigate the actions of a Minister, <Col N="2034" /> the work of the Revenue Commissioners, the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the work of various Ministries and the expenditure on various things like education, fertilisers, subsidies, grants and so on, and cannot examine the commercial accounts of Aer Lingus, the ESB, CIE, Bord Fáilte, Coras Tráchtála, the IDA or Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>We are parliamentarians and it is from this House that the Government get their power but surely the Opposition as well as the Government should have some voice if not in the decisions to be made in relation to the allocation of funds for semi-State companies then certainly in the examination of how those funds are applied?  If they have that voice in the Committee of Public Accounts in regard to State Departments why should they not have a voice in regard to the expenditure of State companies?  There is the natural political reason and it seems to be the only reason why the Government have resisted this suggestion and I am sorry to say that I feel they will resist this motion also.  The Government want to keep all influence, all power and all the information except what is sent to us in the form of a report of a semi-State company and what we see in their balance sheets and profit and loss accounts.</P>
      <P>Parliament desires to know more and is entitled to know more.  With regard to this motion what will happen is that Fine Gael and Labour will vote for it and the Government will vote against it.  That is a prognostication that may not come true; perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will say that the Government are accepting the motion.  I have been a Member of this House for 16 years and, if I know the thinking and the feeling of the Government that they must keep the maximum amount of information to themselves, that will be the pattern of voting at the end of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That does not mean that the Ministers involved in the running of semi-State companies do not want the companies to succeed.  The Minister for Finance is the person responsible for allocating funds; the Minister for Agriculture is concerned with the Agricultural <Col N="2035" /> Credit Corporation and the Minister for Transport and Power has various companies under his control.  They are all anxious that the semi-State companies will succeed because, to a large extent, their political future depends on the success of the companies.  However, up to the present the Government have wanted to do it their own way, without Parliament having a voice even in the examination of how work has been carried out.</P>
    <P>This is a negation of democracy.  The Committee of Public Accounts have shown the way and the interest that is being shown by the people in the examination being carried out by that committee would be similarly evident if the affairs of Aer Lingus, Bord Fáilte, Córas Tráchtála, Bord na Móna, the Industrial Development Authority, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the Industrial Credit Company, the ESB and CIE were under examination. If these organisations were the subject of helpful scrutiny&mdash;not critical or destructive&mdash;by a responsible committee of this House, this would be welcomed by the majority of people in the country.</P>
    <P>Of course, there would be dissentient voices.  I disagree with the idea that the ESB should increase constantly the sale of electrical appliances because they have a tremendous advantage over the ordinary trader.  If a person buys an appliance from the ESB and is unable to pay the hire purchase instalments the ESB will switch off the light and this is leverage the trader has not got. A man who is employed in the ESB with perhaps seven people under his authority will get practically double his salary if he can succeed in increasing the volume of business&mdash;eventually he will have 14 people working for him. This is the form the salary structure of most semi-State companies takes.</P>
    <P>This tends to ensure that people will try to increase turnover when, in fact, they may not be making a profit.  If the semi-State company is also engaged in numerous other activities this provides an opportunity in the charging of the various costs to the different activities of the company to cloak real losses.  I would mention the example of <Col N="2036" /> Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and what one penny on a lb of sugar would mean in revenue and then take note of the various other activities of the company. Some of those activities incur heavy losses, although I agree that in some cases they are of benefit to the country. It is common knowledge&mdash;I use those words rather than common gossip&mdash; that losses which have been suffered by the company in activities divorced from the manufacture of sugar have been shown as being far less than the actual loss.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of a company &mdash;not a semi-State company&mdash;that could move items from one part of the profit and loss account to the other before proceeding to the charging of expenses.  Let us take the example of flour mill and bakeries both held by the same company.  In the event of both concerns using vehicles owned jointly, if there is a common transport manager and joint garage and petrol facilities it would take a most detailed scrutiny to decide the cost of transport in relation to the 2lb loaf or the sack of flour.  This is a problem that has to be faced by a commercial company.</P>
    <P>One can consider the varied nature of the activities of a semi-State company&mdash;Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann is the perfect example.  In very many cases only the most scanty information is given in regard to the many activities of the body concerned.  When this happens in the case of a semi-State body there is a necessity for a committee, such as the Committee of Public Accounts, to analyse the situation and ask questions that must be answered.</P>
    <P>I sat on the Committee of Public Accounts some 12 or 13 years ago.  I remember the head of the Revenue Commissioners coming in.  I asked him the question what was involved in an item of £7,000 for &ldquo;awards&rdquo;.  There was a stunned silence and then the answer was given that it was a reward to people who told tales on others who were not paying their income tax and the following morning, to my astonishment, the item of £7,000 got banner headlines in three national newspapers.</P>
    <P>As an example of the great variety of activities I have instanced, CIE, not <Col N="2037" /> only transport people and goods but are also hoteliers.  What is the charge to each section of the company?  Something is not doing so well and an officer of the company desires that this be not publicly shown.  He believes that in a few years or maybe in less than a year things will improve.  Very often&mdash;I am a business man myself&mdash;there is an arbitrary decision as to what particular section of an account one charges a particular item.  All the civil servants, accountants, auditors and fellows with letters after their names until you would be tired writing them down, cannot change that fact.</P>
    <P>There is every necessity for a committee such as I have described.  It should not be a committee to pull the place apart but a committee that has at heart the interests of the semi-State company and the people who work in it, a committee that will examine the actions of that company and see whether the public interest is being served.  It is in that interest that we in the Fine Gael Party have produced a policy as close as makes no difference to the motion which the Labour Party have now put down, and when the division takes place it will be voting with the Labour Party on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to support this motion tabled by the Labour Party.  As the spokesman for my party on Transport and Power I am very conscious of the need for improving the relationship between Parliament and the nine or ten State companies. We in the Fine Gael Party clearly spelled out in our policy document issued some years ago our attitude to this question of the Parliamentary control of semi-State bodies and I have given a good deal of time to studying this problem.  The Fine Gael Party believe that the ideal solution to this question of public accountability is by means of Parliamentary committees. For that reason the motion tabled by the Labour Party is, in my opinion, very much on target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of almost two years experience as my party's spokesman on Transport and Power, having had contact with at least nine State bodies, covering Bord na Móna, tourism, aviation, <Col N="2038" /> industry, Bord Fáilte, ESB, a wide variety of companies engaged in complex and scientific processes, my conclusion is that there is not sufficient scope for studying these bodies. The only opportunity Dáil Éireann has at present to express opinions on the policy of these companies is by means of the annual Estimate debate or occasionally when special Bills in relation to one particular company or other are introduced into the House.  There is only limited scope at Question Time. My experience has been that the Parliamentary Question is totally unsatisfactory from the point of view of a Deputy seeking information regarding State companies.  I am reminded of a rather amazing coincidence in relation to a question which I tabled last week to the Minister for Transport and Power seeking information about new developments in CIE.  You, Sir, in your wisdom disallowed the question by reason of the fact that the Minister had no responsibility.  Not for one moment, Sir, would I question your ruling, and have never done so, but it is a common feature that questions I have asked in relation to Transport and Power in the last two years on the activities of various State bodies, have been disallowed by you on the ground that the Minister had no responsibility in the matter.</P>
    <P>So far as the average Deputy is concerned&mdash;and I regard myself as only an average Deputy&mdash;it is impossible for him, no matter how assidious, studious or capable he might be to become <i>au fait</i> with the activities and the workings of every one of the State companies.  I have made a fair attempt to do this and I have considerable contact with the various bodies under the control of Transport and Power. The present system of Parliamentary control of State companies is totally unsatisfactory. It is unsatisfactory both from the point of view of the Members of Dáil Éireann and of the people of this country who, it must never be lost sight of, are the shareholders in the State companies.</P>
    <P>The only opportunity we have of questioning or discussing the activities of these State companies is the annual Estimate debate, and this is not good <Col N="2039" /> enough.  The question of the control by Parliament of State companies is a subject which has been discussed at length not merely in this country but in several other countries.  It is a very controversial matter.  The Devlin Report on the Public Services deals very extensively with this question of the structure of State bodies and their accountability to Parliament and to the people.  There is no satisfactory way in which the people of this country or a Member of Dáil Éireann can assess the performance of these companies.  I have been horrified to find in page 45 of the Devlin Report paragraph 34, under the heading of &ldquo;Accountability&rdquo; that: &ldquo;In theory, State-sponsored bodies are responsible to their Ministers and through the Ministers to the Dáil.&rdquo;  That is the theory but: &ldquo;in practice there is no effective machinery in Departments for the appraisal of their results.  Departments are not equipped effectively to examine the accounts of the state bodies.&rdquo;  Imagine that!  &ldquo;The multiplicity of accounting practices makes comparison difficult.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This motion which we are discussing now is very valid.  It makes a case which must be met, in my opinion.  A system will have to be devised whereby the people of this country, who are shareholders in State companies, and we their representatives in Parliament, will be able to ascertain, and assess, and judge, the performance of the various State bodies.  Time and time again, Ministers have come in here and looked for money.  As recently as last December the Minister for Transport and Power, at short notice, looked for £3 million for CIE.  How could I, as the Fine Gael spokesman, or Deputy O'Donovan, who is better qualified than I am to assess it, judge?  We had not access to the type of information we would need to enable us to decide whether CIE were entitled to this £3 million.</P>
    <P>This has happened in the case of Aer Lingus and in the case of subventions to all the State bodies.  We have no way of knowing this, other than from the annual reports which, as Deputy O'Donovan rightly said, are <Col N="2040" /> purely commercial presentations and do not present a true picture of the performance of the various State bodies. Over the past two years, every time I had the opportunity in a debate on State companies under the aegis of the Department of Transport and Power, I have referred to the need for introducing a proper system of accountability for State bodies.  In other words, these bodies should be made accountable to the people, the taxpayers, who provide the finance for them.  The way to make the State bodies accountable to the people, is through the elected representatives here in Parliament.</P>
    <P>We feel&mdash;and so far as I can gather the Labour Party have the same idea in mind&mdash;that the obvious way to make State companies accountable to the people of Ireland, through Parliament, is by means of Parliamentary Committees.  Deputy Donegan mentioned the Committee of Public Accounts.  I do not think that one committee would be able to examine fully the affairs of every State body.  There should be a series of Parliamentary Committees to examine the various related State bodies, for example, transport, CIE and Aer Lingus, and the various other ancillary off-shoots of aviation such as the meteorological services and air traffic control.  There should be a committee of Parliament on aviation, and one on surface transport, shipping, and so forth.  This could be done by means of Parliamentary Committees, as suggested in the Labour Party motion.</P>
    <P>This system of public accountability by State bodies through Parliamentary Committees is, in fact, in operation in Great Britain and it is working very satisfactorily there. Experience in Britain has shown that Parliamentary Committees and Inquiries are very beneficial and, in fact, the management and directors of the various State bodies in Britain have welcomed the establishment of Parliamentary Committees.  I am not advocating a Parliamentary Committee which would, as Deputy Donegan said, tear these companies apart.  I am not even advocating that these Parliamentary Committees should have the authority to pry into the day to day affairs of these companies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2041" /> The Parliamentary Committees should be able to obtain enough information from the various State bodies to enable the Members of this House to arrive at a logical decision, when they were fully informed of the pros and cons, as to whether X company was entitled to £Y million.  I am aware of, and very much conscious of, the inadequacy of the present system of accountability by State companies in so far as it applies to Members of Dáil Éireann, but I was shocked to find that Departments of State, the Government Departments under whose control these companies are, have no effective way of judging their performance.</P>
    <P>This clearly calls for a new approach.  It calls for the setting up of special Parliamentary Committees. Deputy O'Donovan referred to the fact that an argument which had been advanced against the setting up of these committees is that we, as Members of Dáil Éireann, would not have the technical know-how or the capacity to discuss the working of a company such as Aer Lingus, or the operation of a company like the Electricity Supply Board, or any other such State company.  If we were supplied with enough information every one of us, in our own way, would be quite capable of making a rational decision regarding the performance of any of these companies.  We cannot do so at present except by hit and miss methods and by means of contacts.</P>
    <P>I do not mind admitting that most of the information I have been able to get regarding the State bodies under the aegis of the Department of Transport and Power over the past two years, since my party appointed me as spokesman on these matters, came from contacts within the State companies, and not through questions at Question Time.  I have had questions shot down time and again because of the fact that the questions related to matters on which the Minister for Transport and Power had no function.</P>
    <P>We have an outstanding case for the setting up of these Parliamentary Committees. Taking all the State companies, there is one striking case which calls for a special method of accountability and that is the case of Bord <Col N="2042" /> Fáilte in relation to hotel grants.  Time and again Deputy Murphy and I and other colleagues of mine have adverted to this fact.  We have pointed out that the Industrial Development Authority in their annual report gave details of the grants paid to every industry, big or small and details of other grants are available from other Departments, but there was no way of knowing how much any hotelier received by way of grant.  The Minister for Transport and Power has at last agreed to furnish this information in future reports.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte is responsible for a major national industry, which has grown fantastically over the past ten years&mdash;an industry which has implications directly and indirectly for many sectors of our economy.  In view of the difficulty which Members have had in obtaining information about Bord Fáilte from the Minister, it is essential that some means be devised whereby Members of this House can assess the performance of Bord Fáilte, the difficulties of the tourist industry, the progress being made and can suggest improvements. Deputy Tully is very interested in the tourist industry and has on many occasions referred to the fact that tourism was a major national industry.  I am sure he will agree with me that the big difficulty for Deputies interested in the tourist industry is in obtaining information regarding the performance of a company.  This motion appeals to me because of my experience as a Fine Gael spokesman on Transport and Power over the past two years.  It gives me great pleasure to support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In tabling this motion the Labour Party are not denouncing or decrying semi-State bodies.  Indeed, it is the policy of the Labour Party where the interests of the public are concerned that organisations such as these should not be in private hands.  We feel the Government on behalf of the public should have control over bodies such as these. Certainly, we do not intend that semi-State bodies be abolished.  We do, however, feel that public accountability is very important.  We do not feel that national monopolies should exist or continue to exist without the public <Col N="2043" /> having some control or say in the running of them.</P>
      <P>I find very little fault in many of these companies.  It is good to see semi-State bodies operated in a businesslike manner as opposed to operating under the Civil Service red tape which can strangle a company.  The Government hold the shares of these companies on behalf of the public who are, in fact, the real shareholders.  Yet the taxpayers are the only people who do not have any say in how these companies are run.  Members of this Dáil are ridiculed by the public because they cannot ask questions about semi-State bodies.  Is there anything more humiliating to a Dáil Deputy than to have to tell a constituent, &ldquo;I cannot bring this question up in Dáil Éireann because it involves a semi-State body&rdquo;?  The ordinary man in the street will reply, &ldquo;Surely this is an ordinary semi-State body?  You must be able to ask a question about it&rdquo;.  But we have to say, &ldquo;No, this is a semi-State body and we have no control over it&rdquo;.  Parliament is held up to ridicule when the elected representatives of the public cannot ask questions about semi-State bodies on behalf of the public.</P>
      <P>There would be no question of Deputies sitting as a court reviewing the affairs of semi-State bodies interfering in the day-to-day affairs of such bodies.  I remember Mr. Lemass when he was Taoiseach saying, &ldquo;Yes, it was desirable, it would be considered&rdquo;.  The present Taoiseach is now saying, &ldquo;Yes, it might be considered&rdquo;.  No one wants to come to grips with the situation and say, &ldquo;Yes, we must do something about it&rdquo;.  The Labour Party tabled this motion because they took it that the Taoiseach was sincere and earnest about wanting to do something.  The motion states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann bearing in mind the necessity of striking a balance between its rights and the need to safeguard the commercial freedom of semi-State bodies, requests that a permanent Dáil Committee, representative of all Parties, should be established for the purpose of examining and reporting on the activities of these bodies. <Col N="2044" /> I do not think that is too much to ask.  I hope the Government will not force this to a vote but instead will say, &ldquo;Yes, we agree with it.  We think it should be done and we shall make arrangements accordingly&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to learn that Deputies could not find out what grants were given to hoteliers even though public money was involved.  Evidently it was not in the public interest that they be told.  Where taxpayers' money is concerned there should be accountability to someone.  I do not think the purpose of semi-State bodies when they were originally set up was to make them immune from parliamentary inquiry.  It is a good thing that the ESB should be financed by the State because if private enterprise had taken on the job people in remote parts of the country would not have the facilities and services now provided by the ESB.  Had CIE not been made a semi-State body commercial interests would find it was not profitable to provide a road or rail service in particular parts of the country. There is a social obligation on the company to provide such services and for this reason I think semi-State bodies are excellent.  To appoint men with business experience is a good idea.  Aer Lingus is a very good example.  It has done wonders for this country and has put our name high on the list of international airlines.</P>
    <P>I do not think these companies have anything to hide.  I am sure they do not want Dáil Deputies meddling in their everyday affairs&mdash;we are not asking for that.  All we are asking is that a body representing Parliament should have the power to review the activities of these companies so that if complaints come to the notice of Deputies they can be forwarded to the committee. The committee could check the validity or otherwise of the complaints and then see how they could be rectified. I do not think semi-State bodies would resent this.  It would be in the interests of everybody if it was done. The fact that the public know so little about these companies engenders a certain amount of suspicion in their minds.  This is a great tragedy.  It is often said, &ldquo;The less you know about things, the more you suspect&rdquo;.  If we <Col N="2045" /> have public accountability this suspicion might be removed because there is abroad a great deal of suspicion that appointments within these bodies at a high level are political.  I do not think they are but it is said &ldquo;Oh, he is a political appointee&rdquo;.  This suspicion is dangerous.  We read in the newspaper the other day of the suspicions about Parliament and Deputies.  There was a survey carried out amongst 70 people and they felt that Deputies were in the Dáil for personal advancement and their own personal power and influence. They felt that you could get something only through political influence. We should try to rid society of this kind of thinking.  It is very much in evidence with regard to semi-State bodies.  If there was this machinery for periodic reviews we might rid people's minds of this idea that money was being squandered or misappropriated. As long as this idea exists we will not have a healthy society.  This was very much in evidence in regard to Bord Fáilte's grants to hotels.  For everybody's sake we should try to see that suspicions about graft or political corruption are dispelled from people's minds.  People lose respect for Parliament and politicians when there is this suspicion.</P>
    <P>I fail to see how the Government can put this motion to a vote.  Fine Gael have indicated their support for the motion but I cannot see how the Taoiseach who talks about reform can in all sincerity put this motion to a vote.  The motion does not ask for a lot but just that the taxpayer who is being continually overburdened will have some knowledge about where the millions which are invested in these companies go.  I am not saying it is being squandered but there is the impression that it is.  We like the idea of the semi-State bodies and it is in the public interest to have them but it was never intended that they should act as monopolies free from accountability. Take the case of CIE.  We have lots of grievances about CIE.  Originally we got the impression that when CIE became a semi-State body their workers would be treated like civil servants and their conditions of service would be ideal.  Unfortunately this has not been so and we find that the conditions <Col N="2046" /> of employment of many workers are not as they should be and we have no means of inquiring into this.  The CIE Inchicore works is in my constituency and I get a lot of complaints about conditions of employment and certain aspects of policy within the works which are not in the interest of the workers or of the people.  As I have not got any means of inquiring into this position I am not able to act properly as a public representative.  We saw recently what happened in regard to placing a contract abroad and we know that there were internal problems but these problems might not have arisen if there had been a committee to look into the affairs of CIE.  There are other aspects of CIE policy which are not in the interest of the public.</P>
    <P>Recently we heard about a semi-State body purchasing goods from China and the Minister's answer in regard to that was far from acceptable. He said that unless the price of the Irish products was as good as that of the imported products they would favour the imported product, or something to that effect.  This is a very dangerous thing to say.  Even though the price may not be as good there are other aspects to be considered.  The price factor should not be the only factor because we have to consider the conditions under which the product was produced abroad and if there is slave labour, or if workers' conditions are not ideal, we should not encourage the buying of these goods from places such as China where workers are not given a proper wage.  It would seem to me to augur very badly for Irish workers that the Tánaiste, who answered for the Minister for Transport and Power, should make a statement like this.  It would seem that, in the Common Market, Irish goods would not stand a chance; if goods came in from abroad we would not favour the Irish product.  This would be very dangerous.  Our whole policy should be to favour Irish products.  If there were public accountability such purchase of foreign goods would not happen.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Bill, 1971 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is similar to that passed in 1961 in relation to health measures.  It is necessary to have this kind of tidying-up legislation which helps local authorities to carry out various functions they are not authorised to do at the moment.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would let me know if the County Managers' Association could be sued for its actions?  As I understand it, the association negotiates with trade unions.  Our policy on Louth County Council is that matters relating to conditions of employment and to wages and salaries are left to the County Managers' Association.  When agreement is reached the county council merely pass the statutory resolution.  From what the Minister said it appears to me that up to the present we were merely acting in this way in good faith and that if an individual considered he had been treated wrongly he could have taken action against the County Managers' Association.</P>
      <P>There is also the point that if local authorities do not desire that such a body be set up, the Minister could go above their heads and set it up.  This legislation could be used for the following reasons: it could be used for the excellent reason of helping local authorities to come together and of creating institutions whereby the local authorities could act in a more effective way.  At the same time, it could be used to denude local authorities of some of their functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not one of those people who disagree with the establishment of the health boards.  There is so much to be done by county councils and the larger urban authorities that it is better that members devote as much time as they can to their work in these bodies.  However, I have a reservation in that this legislation could, on certain occasions, <Col N="2049" /> be used to denude local authorities of their powers.</P>
    <P>For instance, if the Minister made an order in relation to a certain duty of a local authority in an area, say, involving the Meath and Louth County Councils, and created a body that would look after that function, there might be a situation whereby democratic action to its full extent might not be carried out.  It might happen that one county would have more representation than another and, as a result, might exert its influence to the detriment of the other body.</P>
    <P>There is also the point that a Member of the Oireachtas cannot be a member of these bodies.  As I see it, there is too much of this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I accepted an amendment in the Seanad which allows Members of the Oireachtas to become members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. On the copy of the Bill which I have there is no change&mdash;I must have got the old Bill.  However, I am glad to have the Minister's assurance on this point.  On the question of recoupment, I gather the Minister is the person who decides the recoupment for actions of these bodies which result in expenditure and I wonder if this is a wise feature.  I realise that it is necessary to act on what one can do rather than what one might desire to do and for that reason I do not criticise this point. However, I should prefer if recoupment were on the basis of rateable valuation rather than the present arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that the nub of the Bill is in the third paragraph of the Minister's speech and, while I am not opposing the Bill, I should like to ask a few questions.  Does it mean that it is a device for the purpose of providing the County Managers' Association with staff?  Perhaps the Minister would let us know the position on this matter.  The Minister states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, the managers as a group&mdash;who constitute the official side under the scheme&mdash;cannot provide themselves with the staff and other facilities they require for the <Col N="2050" /> purpose of examining salary and wage claims and engaging in prompt and meaningful negotiations with the staff side.  It is essential that action should be taken to provide the facilities required by the official side. Effective steps cannot, however, be taken without legislation and, for this reason, the present Bill was introduced.</P>
    <P>If the official side does not mean the County Managers' Association, I should like to know what it does mean. The next paragraph says:</P>
    <P>Although the immediate need for the legislation stems from the necessity to establish a particular body, the Bill is framed in general terms so that it can be used to establish bodies to provide other services for local authorities or for the Minister, if this is found to be necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>Perhaps when the Minister is replying he would explain that.  There may be a perfectly logical reason for putting that in in that way and, if so, I would like to know what it is.  In regard to the length of time, the Minister says in page 3 of his statement:</P>
    <P>In other legislation the period during which a resolution for the annulment of a statutory instrument may be moved is twenty-one days.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to say that 21 sitting days might be too long and on the basis that the order will have been brought immediately to the notice of every Member seven sitting days is proposed.  Seven sitting days could be two weeks.  The Minister may not be aware that we have sat on four days some weeks and, as a matter of fact, consecutive weeks.  It could be two weeks and this might be a relatively short time.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to other health authorities and things like this.  Is there a danger here that the cost of this may be an extra burden on the rates?  We are all conscious of the fact that additional staff provided means extra money on the rates.  The Minister makes provision whereby he will pay some of the cost but will we find that for the purpose of having the same work done we shall have to pay for <Col N="2051" /> extra staff?  It is becoming evident in the health authorities&mdash;it may be for a short time or for a number of years&mdash; we shall be paying a great deal extra for a service similar to what we have at the present time.</P>
    <P>Local authorities do not engage in negotiations every day of the week, but the County Managers' Association have been getting together and negotiating as a group.  There is one thing of which I would like the Minister to take notice.  For instance, in the managerial, clerical and engineering grades there is a standard rate which applies all over the country.  When it comes down to the road staff every local authority wants to have its own conditions of employment and wages.  There should be a standard for this also.  If the clerical officer in County Dublin is receiving the same rate for his work as the clerical officer in Meath and Kildare, why should not the road staffs employed in Dublin, Meath and Kildare receive the same rate of wages? There must be some good reason for that.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am not opposing the Bill.  Sometimes when we are attempting to negotiate rates of wages with managers we often wish they knew a little more about negotiating rather than kick to touch when they come up against a sticky point and adjourn the conference for a fortnight or three weeks, because it is the devil's own job to get them to come together again.  If the Minister's proposal can cut that out, I think every trade union, no matter what staff or grade of employee they represent, will be very glad to see it being put into operation. It should teach them how to negotiate better than they have been doing for some time past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with Deputy Tully in welcoming this piece of legislation.  It will certainly introduce a more effective and rational management structure in local government.  I understand that the staff side of the authorities concerned have asked that this legislation should be implemented as quickly as possible.  I welcome the fact that the Bill went <Col N="2052" /> before the Seanad before coming to Dáil Éireann.  It was a valuable means of speeding up legislation going through the Oireachtas, having had full and thorough examination.  Since it is a non-contentious measure I have no doubt that it will go through this House this evening even more expeditiously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Along with my colleagues I should like to welcome this Bill.  It is non-contentious and will not have any voice against it on this side of the House.  I welcome it particularly because, as a member of a local authority for 12 years and also as a member of a trade union, I have often found myself in the strange position of meeting county managers on the side of fellow trade unionists in local government and also of having to put up with the frustration of waiting for months and months for cases to be heard.  I do not think there has been any serious problem in relation to the officers of the local government service. Back in the twenties was the last time there was a strike situation at that level of the local government service.  However, the situation became so serious recently that I think the passage of this Bill will be welcomed by all sides.  If this Bill means that a special research office and secretariat will be set up so that claims can be speeded up, it will be a great improvement.</P>
      <P>One example of the delay which can take place in dealing with claims is that of the Town Clerks' Association. They made a status claim in 1965 and it has been completed only a few weeks ago.  Such delay can be most frustrating for any body of workers and it is miraculous that the town clerks have been so patient.</P>
      <P>I would not hold up this Bill on any account.  My colleague has said the work of the County Managers' Association has a difficult side to it.  I do not think many county managers are suitable at all for the job of negotiation. It has got to the stage where many of them have opted out of it and there are just a few left with the task.  Some of those who are left feel they have the right to stonewall everything on behalf of the ratepayers and this causes such frustration that a strike may result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2053" /> Another very serious situation at the moment is that of the ambulance drivers.  This is a claim for overtime rates that has gone on for a very long time.  An offer has been made which, in effect, would give four shillings an hour waiting time to ambulance drivers.  That offer could not possibly be accepted and has not been accepted. Negotiations have been delayed to such an extent that a strike or at least a ban on overtime could take place among ambulance drivers.  The seriousness of the situation must be realised by everybody here and by the country at large.  The amount of overtime work required of ambulance drivers in the city is immense.  If, under a measure like this, a body can be set up which can process claims much more quickly than they are processed at present, that will be very welcome indeed.  Together with my colleagues I welcome this Bill if it will have the effect of speeding up the claims which are put before the County Managers' Association.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I propose to detain the House only for a moment or two on this measure.  It was fully debated in the Seanad and it was welcomed there.  It has also been welcomed here.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill or, indeed, the purpose which prompted the Minister to introduce the Bill, is to provide a corporate body which will enable the County Managers' Association to operate more effectively and to negotiate on staff matters.  That is something which all Deputies consider desirable and necessary.  However, I should like the Minister to give us some indication of what other bodies he and his advisers have in mind, because he appears to be availing of this one necessity to provide himself with the machinery to set up all sorts of un-named or unascertained bodies as of this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite admit that I am inclined to look with some suspicion at all proposals by Governments to take wide powers.  I suppose it is the duty of the Opposition to inquire into the purpose behind all these measures.  In his opening speech here at any rate, the Minister has not made a case for the wide powers which this Bill confers <Col N="2054" /> upon him, and the House is entitled to an explanation from him.  The Minister conceded that:</P>
    <P>Although the immediate need for the legislation stems from the necessity to establish a particular body, the Bill is framed in general terms so that it can be used to establish bodies to provide other services for local authorities, or for the Minister, if this is found to be necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that no decision has yet been made to provide other services for local authorities by corporate bodies.  Indeed, I know that in the Seanad a suggestion was made that something like what the Minister is doing now should have been done on a previous occasion.  I know that was said and I know that Senators took the view that this blank cheque should have been given to the Minister previously.</P>
    <P>That is the only point I want to make.  I should like the Minister to elaborate on this aspect of the measure and the intentions behind it when he is replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>First I should like to thank the House for the welcome given to the Bill.  It is a very important measure, even though it is a simple one, because of the services which can be provided under it when it becomes an Act.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh was quite right in what he said about the many frustrations among the employees of local authorities because of the long delays in dealing with wage claims, and other claims, which have to be processed by the city and county managers.  The managers are hamstrung inasmuch as they have no staffing facilities to enable them to deal with the large volume of claims coming before them under the local authority conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Some assistance was needed, and that assistance can now be provided when this Bill becomes an Act and an establishment order is made, establishing a body to provide such services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the points raised merit some <Col N="2055" /> reply and some explanation.  I will deal with them very briefly.  Deputy Donegan raised the question of whether the City and County Managers' Association could, in fact, be sued.  At the moment the managers could be sued as individuals but, of course, when the corporate body is set up, any charges that are made against the managers could be made against the corporate body so, in that way, the managers are being protected.</P>
    <P>I should point out here that any person who is aggrieved by a decision of a city or county manager dealing with staff matters and wages and salaries has the right to appeal to the Minister under the Local Government Act, 1941.  There is no question whatsoever of taking away any of the functions of the local authorities as they exist at present.  I dealt with this point fairly fully in my introductory speech. The only purpose we have in mind is to provide special services to facilitate the efficient operation of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for local authorities.</P>
    <P>On the question of the recoupment of expenses, each establishment order will provide for matters of this nature. The establishment order will, of course, come before each House of the Oireachtas.  If anyone wishes to object, the orders can be annulled by resolution either in this House or in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>This brings me to Deputy Tully's point about the 21 days.  It is only fair to point out that, although this House may sit for three days a week and sometimes four, if the resolution is being moved in the Seanad, which does not sit regularly and, if we were to wait for 21 days, the period could be quite long.  I think it would be unreasonable to suggest any change in that regard.  Seven days is ample notice bearing in mind, of course, that if there were a long delay in regard to this matter of a resolution annulling an establishment order, the corporate body would not be able to do any business because no body would deal with it if that were hanging over its head.  This could prove a great disadvantage if it <Col N="2056" /> were allowed, and I would suggest to Deputies that they should accept, as the Seanad did, the seven days provision.</P>
    <P>The number of staff required to operate the corporate body, which will provide services for the city and county managers, will not be very big.  The staff will be of great assistance to the managers not alone in providing them with information but also in carrying out many of the negotiations and in acting at the Labour Court on behalf of the managers.  They could bring the discussions right up to final stage and present the matter to the managers for decision.  This would enable managers to carry on with the very onerous day to day responsibilities which they have in their own areas and in that way, the Bill will add greatly to the more efficient running of the counties of those managers who are now involved in this type of work.  It is not the purpose in setting up the corporate body to provide staff for the City and County Managers' Association.  It will provide staff for the general body of local authorities and help them carry out the functions and negotiations I have mentioned.  As Deputies well know, managers have responsibility for dealing with all staff matters.</P>
    <P>An obvious question to ask is: what other type of bodies may be set up? When introducing a Bill of this nature it is common sense to introduce the Bill in fairly general terms.  I have no intention at this time of establishing any body under this Bill other than the one I have been dealing with.  It would be foolish, however, not to avail of the opportunity of including provision in this Bill to enable some other services to be provided for local authorities at a future date, if this is considered necessary and beneficial to them.  The Minister may wish to have some service provided for him which could be done efficiently and effectively by a corporate body.  It could happen, for instance, that local authorities in future may require a computer service and a corporate body could be set up to establish such a service and make it available to local authorities as a whole.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress last night I was dealing with the position of small farmers in my own area.  I asked the Minister to see that they get every type of help possible. In the past large numbers of animals were held but the tendency now seems to be to have a lesser number of animals and this is bound to affect cattle numbers.  The Minister would be well advised to get large land owners to go into breeding in a bigger way.  We do not appear to have got the production of cattle on the lines we had anticipated.  When the heifer scheme was introduced there was an increase in the production of calves.  There must be greater opportunities of introducing more cows into the midland plains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Silage is playing a very big part in the activity of milk farmers in Kerry. I should like to see this extended to mountain areas as well.  Farmers are turning their attention to silage because all too often the hay which has been saved is damaged by weather and rendered useless.  The efforts of members of the Minister's Department should be directed towards getting more silage used.  This is very necessary. It is a useful system of providing adequate feed for animals in the best conditions.  The sheep position is much more serious particularly in the mountain areas of Kerry.  It appears that the younger men are no longer interested in the large tracts of mountain areas which formerly carried extensive numbers of sheep.  In the MacGillicuddy Reeks area and the Dingle range it is only the older men who have the flocks of sheep and this is a very serious position because sheep can be a great source of wealth for the country, to our export trade and so on. I cannot suggest anything that will help to correct that position.  The people engaged in this business are quite satisfied with the existing subsidy for mountain sheep but this is not attracting young men to take over the large tracts of mountain land to keep up this sheep breeding scheme.  The idea of living in a mountain fastness <Col N="2060" /> does not appeal to them and many are leaving the area to try to find a better way of life.  This is to the disadvantage of the country.  Serious consideration must be given to the matter of increasing our sheep population in the lowlands as this would appear to be the only place in which you will get the increased production.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects of the agricultural industry in Kerry in former days was pig rearing on small holdings but this is an aspect of life which has now almost completely disappeared because of the high cost of feeding materials.  In other days we were able to get Indian meal in large quantities very cheaply and the bacon factories could not deal with all the pigs that were produced.  Eggs to an extraordinary tonnage were the order of the day.  I remember in my young days seeing ten 10-ton wagons packed with eggs leaving Killorglin station every Friday but now I can hardly get an egg for my breakfast.</P>
    <P>However, I want to impress on the Minister that the small farmer, the smallholder, is the man who will stand up to Common Market conditions irrespective of all the statements made by the pundits inside and outside the country.  We have in Kerry a pattern of production that is only equalled or beaten by County Dublin which has a very large horticultural production, through glasshouses and so on. County Kerry is the next highest producer per acre, per holding or per £ valuation, whichever way you take it, and is in all cases four times as high as the good land in the midlands and in the plains.  This was brought about by intensive production on the farm and by adopting every method that can be devised to increase output.  Some 84 per cent of the holders in Kerry are under £10 valuation and that valuation in any other part of the country means that the person is an extremely small landholder. Our farmers have a reasonably good way of life and seem to be happy. Their production is four times as high as that of the better-off landholders yet they are the people who are being down-graded by those who say that there is no place for them.  In Kerry we have never accepted this.</P>
    <P>There are people who do not agree <Col N="2061" /> with the Mansholt Plan and the idea of accepting the Mansholt Plan as a guideline is dangerous for this country, and, indeed, for any other country, because the plan seems to idealise the system of very large landholders of 400 acres or 400 cows, or whatever size it may be, as the only standard by which a living can be wrested from the land.  This involves heavy labour costs and leaves a country, in the event of war, in a bad position, dependent on production from people who cannot get labour at that time and probably cannot get the necessary machinery or the fuel to operate it.  Our eyes must be turned to the small man who has always stood up to the various difficulties we have encountered.  In the last war he saved our country.  He is there and always will be there to help us out in difficult periods, and we are bound to run into difficult periods because history has proved this.  Any idea that the present Utopia will continue cannot be accepted.</P>
    <P>I should like to say again that the different Departments who can help to make the small farmer's way of life easier are not getting the type of co-operation, between all these Departments, that is necessary.  Last night I mentioned the necessity for having water and good roads laid on; in addition, there are many stretches of good land which are completely under water and are awaiting arterial drainage. Unfortunately, these are being held up and as far as I can see this drainage will not be carried out in the next 50 years.  The Minister should endeavour to get the present system changed so that large tracts of land which can be drained in small sections, and where there is no serious trouble with the outfall of water, will be drained and improved for the benefit of those who are trying to improve our cattle.</P>
    <P>Our farmers are doing a great job under adverse conditions because they have not always had the free and open road that was necessary to help them to do the job of work they wanted to do.  However, they have come a long way.  They have improved their cattle and their milk standards and their feeding systems out of all proportion.  They have also improved their grasslands <Col N="2062" /> and for this we must be eternally grateful to them.  I should like to see them getting every assistance possible, particularly our milk farmers whose prices are at a standstill.  Although the Minister has made provision for extra money by way of subsidies, the money does not seem to reach the farmer.  I have met many farmers in County Kerry who supply the various creameries in the area.  They do not obtain more than 2s per gallon&mdash;many receive much less&mdash;and this is for top quality milk.  This is a ridiculous state of affairs and I would ask the Minister to do something to help them to achieve a better standard of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped to have read the report on the review of State expenditure in relation to agriculture because I regard it as the most relevant document to date on this matter, apart from the Minister's speech.  I regret I have not had an opportunity of reading it, apart from glancing at some of the recommendations contained therein, and I do not therefore propose to pass judgment on the report.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that the farming organisations had not yet furnished a response to this report. I hope those organisations will give the report the attention it deserves because, from my scanty reading, I could see that it is an important contribution towards agricultural thinking, particularly in relation to State intervention.  It has grasped a number of nettles which many of us have been afraid to touch.  I hope the farming organisations will come forward with their considered and detailed statements in relation to the recommendations and the thinking behind this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point I should like to mention.  From what I can see, this report was in the hands of the Government in January, 1969 but it was not published until May, 1970.  Certainly the introduction bears the date of January, 1969 and, therefore, I presume it was with the Government at that date; however, it may be that I am misinterpreting that date.  As the report was not published until May, 1970 the Government had more than a year to consider the matter.  Instead of <Col N="2063" /> sitting on this report, as apparently they did, they should have released it immediately in order to get comments at that stage.  It is a little late now for the Government to express disappointment that the farming organisations are not in a position to respond as quickly as the Government would like.</P>
    <P>One of the themes of the report is that State intervention in relation to agriculture should be divided into social expenditure and economic expenditure. In practice it is difficult to make this division but an effort must be made.  Economic assistance by the State might mean those elements of State intervention which are concerned with bringing an immediate cash return to the farmer.  They are influenced by considerations of whether it is desired to preserve the maximum number of farmers on the land or whether it is considered that help should be given to small farmers.  When one uses an economic yardstick, one is concerned with maximising income on the farm without regard as to who gets it or the social effects of this policy.</P>
    <P>Many people would react to a policy of the Department of Agriculture which might be governed by social considerations by immediately thinking of dole.  People in the cities tend to have strong feelings about what they consider is dole for agriculture.  Social expenditure by the Department of Agriculture in relation to farming is not of a dole nature.  It can have many justifiable reasons.  It is in the national interest, apart from economic considerations, to maintain a large number of people on the land; if they are not earning as much as people elsewhere, the difference must be made up by the Government.  The social justification for this might be that it avoids excessive urbanisation.  Anyone who has read about the USA will realise that excessive urbanisation can have undesirable social consequences.  It can lead to an increase in crime, to pollution and, generally speaking, can lead to much unhappiness.  It is fair to say that life in rural areas does not have such problems to the same extent; frequently it has a sense of values that are absent in urban living.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2064" /> If the State intervenes without an immediate clear economic justification but in order to keep people on the land, this is not necessarily a kind of dole exercise.  Possibly it is an exercise in social engineering that can be justified in the light of the wider considerations of preserving a regional balance in the distribution of population and in order to minimise the problems of crime, pollution and so on.</P>
    <P>Obviously it is impossible to use the purely social considerations as a yardstick because one would then be making an open-ended commitment with no clear point at which to stop.  If purely social considerations were the yardstick, the case could be made for increased expenditure all the time and it would be impossible to continue indefinitely on this course.  Therefore, it is necessary to intermingle the social objective and some hard economic realities.</P>
    <P>In relation to agriculture the European Economic Community tends to apply to an excessive degree the economic yardstick; it does not take into account the social implications.  I know that EEC policy in relation to agriculture is greatly misrepresented.  When speaking about the Mansholt Plan people do not talk about it as it exists at the moment but rather discuss the proposals that were put forward in the past and which have since been modified. At the same time, the idea behind Mansholt is that State support to agriculture should gradually be phased out and that the farmers should be able to stand on their own completely in the economic sense without any intervention from the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>This may sound very fine to economic theorists but the implications of this may be such a fall in the agricultural population that the social problems to which I referred and which result from excessive organisation could come about.  The idea is that instead of people just leaving the land and going to a very big city they should be able to find employment in their own neighbourhood.  It is quite possible that the cost of providing dispersed industrial employment to cater for these people and to enable them to live at home and work in industry <Col N="2065" /> might be even greater than the cost to the community of keeping them on in agriculture.  The result might be that if you do not keep them on in agriculture they might end up in big cities which have social disadvantages.  However, we just do not know this.  It is something which needs to be studied.  I certainly have not thought about it as much as I should.</P>
    <P>It is fairly clear that if we are to preserve any sort of a proportion of the population in agriculture, then we must expand exports to a very great extent.  Lambertine-Yeates wrote in the late fifties&mdash;he was one of the foremost agricultural economists in the world&mdash;at least he was when he wrote this, and I do not know if he is alive now&mdash;that only a country which exports twice as much agricultural goods as it consumes at home can hope to support 20 per cent of its population in agriculture at a remuneration comparable to that in other sectors.  That is applying the economic yardstick.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that anything less than 20 per cent of our population being kept on in agriculture would be unacceptable.  We must have at least 20 per cent in agriculture.  It is also clear from looking at the figures that we certainly do not export twice as much as we consume at home.  In fact, we export less than we consume at home.  We export 47 per cent of our agricultural production, whereas we consume 53 per cent.  Therefore, applying strictly economic considerations, if we are to preserve 20 per cent of our population in agriculture&mdash;and it is an objective which most people would agree with&mdash;we must more than double our exports of agricultural produce, that is, if we accept this man's thesis and I think it is a reasonable one.</P>
    <P>Where are we to find the markets for these exports?  This is where the crucial argument comes in in relation to agriculture, the EEC, international trade and so forth.  We just cannot find markets at home to maintain the population in agriculture.  To my mind, the EEC is probably the best way of keeping people on the land because it does provide us with export outlets for our agricultural produce which are so vital <Col N="2066" /> if we are to maintain at least 20 per cent of our population in agriculture.</P>
    <P>One of the important points in relation to achieving this increase in exports and maintaining employment in agriculture is that there should not be any disincentive to expansion built into any State support to agriculture. It is difficult to know whether or not a particular differential subsidy is, in fact, a disincentive to expansion.  It has been argued by the farming organisations that the present scale support for creamery milk is a disincentive to expansion in milk production, because the price which farmers get for milk produced above a certain gallonage begins to fall to the extent that they have no incentive to go beyond that gallonage.  It is difficult to be sure about this one way or the other, but I think the indications are that there has been in recent months a fairly substantial fall in creamery milk production. I suppose it has been due to other factors as well as the scale system of price support but at the same time there seems to be a <i>prima facie</i> case for saying that rather than benefiting the small farmer this system has had the result of acting as a disincentive to expansion of milk production on his part.  The case is not proven, I can see, but there is a fairly good indication that that is the case.</P>
    <P>Another question which we have to look into is that of the average age of our farm population.  I have not got these statistics with me but I think it is true to say that one of the great problems is the late age of inheritance of farmers.  Very often a farmer does not come into ownership of the land until he is 40 or 45 years of age or the father may live on and retain ownership right up to his death.</P>
    <P>If the State is going to intervene in other areas of agriculture there is possibly a case for some more attractive incentive to older farmers to transfer their land to their sons.  I have not thought sufficiently about this to be able to make any definite suggestion but, as far as I can see, the present policy only has the effect that a pension will be given if a man actually hands over his land to the Land Commission or to some other State body. <Col N="2067" /> That, as far as I understand, is what is envisaged by Mansholt, that the farmer will not get the pension unless he hands the farm over to a State body who may distribute it to anybody, maybe somebody who is not related to him at all.  I think it is necessary for the State to step in and possibly underwrite a pension or some regular payment which the farmer might receive from his son if the land is transferred from father to son.  There is a need not only to encourage the transfer of a farm by an older farmer to the State for distribution but also to encourage the transfer of a farm from father to son.  I know this is getting into a difficult area, but the implications of the high age of inheritance are so great for agriculture that there is a strong justification for trying to ensure that young farmers would be in charge of farms, and I would hope that this would be considered by the Government.  Of course, it would have to be in the nature of an incentive.  There could be no question of anybody telling a man he must transfer his land to his son.  That would be interfering altogether too much with the basic rights of inheritance and of people to dispose of their own property. There is a case to be made for some form of incentive to encourage a father who is getting on in years to transfer land to his son.</P>
    <P>Rationalisation is needed in relation to the industries which are spin-off industries from agriculture: for instance, the creamery industry and the bacon industry.  The case has been made repeatedly, and I do not think there is any need for me to make it, that there is a need for rationalisation here.  I was glad to learn from the answer to a Parliamentary Question yesterday that at last a proposal has been referred to the study group which was set up to consider practical proposals for creamery rationalisation. The Parliamentary Secretary, or the Minister, assured me that there were further proposals in the pipeline.  I am very glad to hear this.  However, I hope that decisions will be taken as soon as possible, and that we can get on with this job, because it is clear that the smaller creameries just simply cannot compete and cannot pay to the farmers <Col N="2068" /> the price which the bigger creameries can.</P>
    <P>It is very important, therefore, that this rationalisation should take place. It is not enough for the Government to wash their hands and say: &ldquo;These are independent co-operatives.  We do not want to interfere with private enterprise.&rdquo; The Government have the responsibility in the long run, because Government intervention in relation to agriculture has been very great indeed. The influence which the Government can exercise is very great.  It is important that, while not interfering to an excessive degree, influence should be used to secure rationalisation and to ensure that the farmer is not forced to accept a lower price than he could get elsewhere because his local creamery or pig factory failed to amalgamate with another in order to achieve the level of efficiency which would facilitate the payment of sufficiently high prices.</P>
    <P>There is one point which I would very much like to welcome in this report on the review of State expenditure in relation to agriculture, that is, that the aids to farm efficiency, for instance, land improvement, farm buildings and water supply grants, will be integrated into a comprehensive farm development scheme.  The idea here is that these grants would be paid to farmers who take part in an overall scheme for development of the farm. The basic criterion to be applied would be whether or not a sufficient increase in farm income would result from this expenditure.  There is a lot of irrational activity in the field of farm buildings, and land improvement, and so forth.  A certain farm building might be erected and a considerable amount of State funds might be pumped into it and, in fact, the benefit which the farmer would derive from this improvement, which he had initiated, would not be as great as it should be, and the return on the State investment would not be very great.  However, these aids should be given as part of a comprehensive scheme with an applied standard to show whether this improvement would, in the comprehensive setting of the whole comprehensive scheme of development of that <Col N="2069" /> farm, result in an increase in income for the farmer.  I hope the Minister will make haste in putting this proposal into effect.</P>
    <P>It would also bring to a wider number of farmers this concept of farm planning.  It is vital that a man should realise that what he is doing now, and the investment he is making now, are part of a scheme of phased development over a period of years which he has worked out in consultation with his adviser.  The idea of setting targets for two, three or four years hence, and paying a man when he achieves them, is very important.  This whole idea of giving a man something to aim at in the context of a farm plan is very important, to my mind.</P>
    <P>I have criticised the present small farm incentive bonus scheme, which covers this area, because it does not apply to a sufficiently wide number of farmers.  I forget the details now but I think it applies only to a farmer who is earning less than £700 per annum and who can reach £700 per annum at the end of a period.  Farmers who can hope to earn much more than £700 per annum at the end of a period, say a five year period, could also benefit from the idea of having this type of farm plan worked out in co-operation with the advisers.</P>
    <P>I hope that, as an interim measure, pending the introduction of this idea of a comprehensive farm development scheme outlined in the report, the Minister will raise to £1,000 the potential income.  That would not cost very much.  The case for it is pretty clearly made in a reply which I received to a question I put down today about the small farm incentive bonus scheme. There has been a pretty serious decline in the number of farmers who are applying for this scheme because the idea of getting only £700 per annum on the farm has now become quite unrealistic with the increasing cost of living.  Farmers realise that a scheme which they can enter only if they can get up to £700 per annum is no use, or not much use.</P>
    <P>In the last quarter of 1968, 1,210 farmers were accepted under the scheme.  In the last quarter of 1969, this figure was right down to 418.  In the <Col N="2070" /> last quarter of 1970 it was down to 374.  Therefore, there has been a very substantial decline, year by year, in the number of farmers who have been accepted under this scheme.  It is quite clear that the terms are not attractive enough.  They may have been attractive when the scheme was started, but since then inflation has obviously had its effect and the incentives which are being offered, and the income targets which are being set, no longer mean what they did when the scheme was initiated.  An improvement in this scheme is now well overdue.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to see in reply to a question to the Minister for Finance yesterday that there has been an increase in agricultural credit.  To be honest, I thought there would not have been in view of the increasing restrictions on credit to other sections of the community.  I was glad to see that the number and the volume of loans approved by the Agricultural Credit Corporation were higher in the last quarter of 1970 than in the last quarter of 1969.  I hope this will continue to be the case because it is very important that farmers should be able to make these investments in farm development which will enable them to compete in EEC conditions.</P>
    <P>To that end I hope the present difficulties between the farmers and the Department will right themselves in due course.  Perhaps greater clarity on both sides would be a help.  I have not studied the proposals put forward by the National Farmers' Association. Some people are not absolutely sure what the immediate demands are which the farmers' organisation are making. Maybe I am misinformed, or maybe I have not read all the documents I should, but I think it would be helpful if we could have, shall we say, in normal bargaining terms, a statement of the immediate objectives of this campaign, and a corresponding response from the Government stating what they are prepared to offer and gradually, through the process of negotiation, we could come to an agreement.</P>
    <P>I think there is certainly in the public mind at the moment an absence of information as to the immediate concrete objectives and the immediate concrete <Col N="2071" /> offer the Government are prepared to make.  This may be cleared up in the pre-Budget talks which are taking place between the Government and the farmers in the near future.  I hope it will. I hope that the differences will not continue for any longer than they need and I hope that the Minister will be able to make a satisfactory offer, an offer which will re realistic and can be accepted by the farmers.  In this context, I think that perhaps a rather typical example of the conduct of the Government which has led to this impasse has been their attitude to the call for an increase in liquid milk prices.  I think it is fairly clear that in 1970 alone there has been an increase in the cost of production of a gallon of milk equivalent to 6d.  In that period, admittedly, increases were granted of 3d per gallon, but these increases were only compensating for increases in costs which had taken place in 1969 and did not take into account, as they were granted early in 1970, of increases in costs subsequently taking place for farmers during 1970.</P>
    <P>This is a very bad situation and the Government have had the views of the farming organisations and the submissions of the liquid milk producers for some considerable time now and they know very well, I am sure, that the case for an increase in liquid milk prices is very strong, but they have, to my mind, unnecessarily dawdled in the granting of this increase which I think the Minister agrees as much as I do is necessary.  But instead of taking the action which he knows should be taken and granting this increase, he is delaying, and this naturally leads to the frustration which has resulted in the present differences between the Department or the Minister for Agriculture or the Government&mdash;wherever is the door at which it should be laid&mdash;and the farming community&mdash;conduct like delay and lack of preparedness to come out and say exactly what the Government are prepared to offer.</P>
    <P>I realise that there are problems in that the Minister might want to give something but he has to go to the Government as a whole and they continue to delay and are preoccupied <Col N="2072" /> with other matters and do not come to a decision.  This is all very fine&mdash;they may be preoccupied with matters concerning the internal security of their own party&mdash;but it is not much use to farmers who want increases and a decision on their submissions.  They are not getting this decision and that is the reason to a great extent for the present impasse between the agriculture community and the Department and the Government.  I hope that this will be remedied and I hope also that there will be brought across to the public in clearer terms exactly what the immediate concrete demands are from the farming community and exactly what the Government, on the other hand, are prepared to offer, so that as in any normal trade dispute&mdash;I will not call it a trade dispute but discussions as to what should be the right policy&mdash;there will be clearly stated alternatives and we will be able to come to concrete conclusions as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Returning to other matters which I was discussing earlier, one of the most important things in relation to agricultural development is the question of education in the wider sense of the term.  It is absolutely vital that farmers be well up to date on the latest technical development in relation to agriculture. The answers to two questions which I had down today disclosed rather disquieting facts in regard to this. First of all, there is the fact that the number of people going to agricultural colleges has not appreciably increased between 1966-67 and 1970-71.  In 1966-67, 565 people went to these agricultural colleges; in 1967-68, the number came down to 530; in 1968-69, it came down again to 514; in 1969-70, it was up slightly but not at all as high as in 1966-67 at 532; and I am glad to see that in 1970-71 it has gone up to 598 but overall the impression we get is of a fluctuating number going through these colleges without any overall increasing trend, without any trend which indicates an overall increase.  I think this is very bad because it is clear to me that we do need more and more young farmers who have had the experience of going through an agricultural college and it is rather disquieting that this number has not shown any very dramatic increase.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2073" /> Another item in this regard which does not show the scale of increase which I feel is essential is the number of farmers who have consulted their agricultural adviser at least once a year.  In 1969-70, 36 per cent of the farmers were visited by their agricultural adviser at least once a year.  We could analyse all day what happened in relation to the 36 per cent but the interesting thing about that situation is what happened to the 64 per cent who did not have any consultation with their agricultural adviser.  Why did they not feel it necessary or did they not bother to have consultation with their agricultural adviser?  I am not suggesting that the fact that they do not do so is the fault of the Government or anything like that, but I think the Government are not perhaps giving the leadership.  It is possibly not making the advisory service attractive enough to induce farmers to consult with it and the point which I would also like to make is that the figure which was 36 per cent in 1969-70 was 34 per cent in 1965-66.  There has only been a very slight increase in the proportion of farmers who consult their adviser once a year.</P>
    <P>This is something which again should give grave cause for concern because if that trend continues, it will be 20 years maybe before we will have attained the position where 43 per cent or 44 per cent of the farmers will be consulting their agricultural advisers. That just would not do at all in EEC conditions, so obviously we must have some dramatic rate of increase in the number of farmers who consult these agricultural advisers.  We have to take a hard look at the agricultural advisory service to see what way this can be achieved.</P>
    <P>There was a plea made here by Deputy L'Estrange against the idea of putting the agricultural advisory service on a national basis. He felt very good contributions were being made by the county committees of agriculture. I do not have any experience in this matter so I cannot comment on that. A hard look needs to be taken at the agricultural advisory service.</P>
    <P>One of the problems is that agricultural <Col N="2074" /> advisers do not stay in any area long enough to develop a personal relationship with the farmers, which is so important if they are to be invited frequently by farmers to give advice. It is very important that advisers should on their own initiative offer advice to farmers.  If a man is in an area long enough he will get around to calling on farmers who have not sought his advice whereas if the adviser is constantly moving from one area to another he will spend all his time with those who seek advice and will never get an opportunity to give advice to those who do not seek it.</P>
    <P>Agricultural advisers need to stay in the same place for a considerable length of time.  This is not happening because the system which obtains at present means that promotional opportunities are greater for the man who moves around than for the man who remains in an area.  If his superior is not much older than he is, his promotional opportunities are next to nil. We must endeavour to find a way to encourage advisers to stay in an area for a reasonable length of time in the interests of the farming community. The best approach to this would be the payment of an extra increment to men who stay in an area for a specified number of years.  It is necessary to compensate advisers who do this because they are possibly foregoing promotion by staying in that area.</P>
    <P>I want to make one or two points in relation to the eradication of animal diseases.  As far as I can gather from a reply made by the Parliamentary Secretary today it is not the policy of the Government to eradicate warble fly completely.  He said we could never hope to eradicate the warble fly.  If a concerted effort were made, warble fly could be eradicated in one year instead of having this extended State expenditure over many years without getting the desired results.  This could be done by compulsory autumn dressing of all cattle at a cost lower than the 4s per beast which is at present borne by the farmer.  This would involve the State subsidising the cost of dressing.  It would be acceptable if the State put up 2s and the farmer put up the other 2s and it would ensure that farmers would <Col N="2075" /> co-operate fully in the general autumn dressing, which is something which did not happen last year.</P>
    <P>If the Government are not prepared to spend the money now they are being penny wise and pound foolish.  It will cost them a great deal more than the 2s per beast because if warble fly is not eradicated the scheme will have to be reintroduced in a few years time. It should be announced that spot checks will be carried out and farmers who have not had their cattle dressed should be liable to penalty.  This type of system was operated in relation to the dehorning of cattle.  If this policy were adopted we could have total eradication of warble fly in a short period of years.  The present attitude of the Government is defeatist.  They seem to think we will never get rid of warble fly.  This is not a veterinary problem, it is a political one, of lack of resolution on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>At the present time we have no farm plan.  The great defect of the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development is that it does not set targets for the various agricultural commodities.  There is no way of knowing what Government policy is in relation to sheep, cattle or milk.  The programme sets only an overall target for &ldquo;agricultural output&rdquo;, which is meaningless.  If the Third Programme in relation to agriculture is to be meaningful, targets for each commodity must be set.  The Third Programme does not do this although the Second Programme, for all its faults, did.  I do not understand why the Government went back on this.  The only explanation is that some commodities, particularly sheep, failed dramatically to reach the targets set out in the Second Programme, and this led to so many red faces in the Department of Agriculture that they were not prepared to commit themselves to any targets in the Third Programme.  This may keep everybody in the Department of Agriculture happy but it is not in the best interests of the agricultural community.  We should at least have some targets so that when we are discussing the Third Programme we will know which commodities are living up <Col N="2076" /> to expectation and which are not.  The lack of targets should have been contested more vigorously at the time the Third Programme was introduced.</P>
    <P>From a reply to a question I had down yesterday it would appear that the 1¾ per cent growth target was not achieved in the years 1969 and 1970. The excuse made by the Minister was that the base year, 1968, proved to be a high one and it was consequently very difficult to improve on the 1¾ per cent in 1969.  I cannot understand why that was not taken into account in the reply to my question.  Possibly an adjustment could have been made to take account of that so that we would be able to see whether or not we are proceeding towards the target at the rate of expansion which was set out.  I did, in a supplementary question, ask whether the Department or the Government expected to achieve the 7 per cent overall growth rate in agricultural output over the period but the Minister was not prepared to commit himself as to whether or not they would achieve the target and more or less told me to wait and see the review of the Third Programme.  That sort of question should be answered and the Minister should be in a position to answer it at all times.  There is no point in having a programme like this unless the Minister is in a position to say at any given time whether the targets set out are being attained or are in the process of being attained.  If that sort of question cannot be answered there is not much point in publishing a document like this.</P>
    <P>One of the most welcome trends in farming in recent years has been the development of vertical integration by the farmers.  We now have the farmers themselves going into the meat processing industry in a big way through the IMP.  This is very valuable and is something which should take place over the whole range of agricultural production because in this way the farmers are in a position to ensure that they get a fair price.  There is no necessity for them to take over the whole industry.  If they can take over the significant sector of it and ensure that it is run in the best interests of the farmers then they will be able to call the tune for the other sections of the <Col N="2077" /> industry, because if the other sections do not keep pace with them in this regard all the farmers will be selling to the farmer-owned business and not to the others and the others will then be forced to come to heel.  If we could find a way of getting an IMP situation over the whole agricultural industry, whereby the farmers would be going into the processing of their own goods, and possibly into the retailing of their own goods, they would then be in a position to ensure that they got a proper price for their goods.  I hope that such a development will take place.</P>
    <P>One point which I raised on many occasions here and which came home again to me with increasing force last night when I was speaking to a number of farmers is the question of compensation for reactors in the brucellosis eradication scheme which is now becoming really effective in County Meath.  The idea of having a limit of £120 is wrong; there should be no limit. You can have a cow in calf the combined value of which would exceed £120 but under the present scheme only £120 can be given.  If the Department's valuers are competent they should be in a position to decide the worth of the animal.  If the animal is worth only £120 the valuer will not offer more than that if he is competent, and if it is worth £130 he would, if there was no limit, be in a position to offer more than £120.  At present he cannot do this.  This limit is a declaration on the part of the Government of their lack of confidence in their own valuers.  They feel they have to put this rein on their valuers and that they cannot allow them freedom to value the animals at their true worth.  They are, in effect, saying to them &ldquo;We believe that if we let you go beyond £120 you would be doing it all the time and you would not be doing it competently, that you would be giving the farmers more than the animals were worth.&rdquo;  This is the implication.</P>
    <P>There are one or two interesting statistics in this document on State expenditure on agriculture which are indicative of the way in which Government intervention can distort to bad effect the pattern of agricultural production. One thing which has been repeated <Col N="2078" /> in this debate is that there has been a failure to keep sheep production up to the requisite level.  The target in the Second Programme was only half achieved and, in fact, I think there was a decline in sheep production over the period of that programme, whereas an increase of 200,000 was envisaged. The explanation for this appears to be that Government intervention inadvertently had the effect of discouraging sheep production by making other lines more attractive.  This should not happen and Government intervention should be reviewed to ensure that it is not distorting the pattern of production as a whole.</P>
    <P>Figures which were presumably available to the Government in 1967 should have warned them that this was going to happen.  They should have seen that the output of a particular product per £ of price support by the Government as between the different products was very different, that for every £ of price support given to cattle production the output was £19.3 worth of cattle; for pig production it was £19.8 worth of pigs; for milk production it was £3.7 so that for every £ in support given by the Department only £3.7 worth of milk was being produced, but for sheep production the figure was quite alarming &mdash;for every £ of support given by the Government £56 worth of sheep were being produced.  Obviously in this situation it was quite unattractive for farmers to go into sheep production because the Government were not supporting sheep production nearly as much as they were the other areas of production.  There was an obvious incentive as a result of Government intervention to go out of sheep and into other lines.</P>
    <P>It was not, as the Government appeared to imply, that international market conditions had made sheep production unattractive to farmers.  The Government's policy had made sheep production unattractive by giving it such a relatively low share of price support.  As I said, the Government should have been aware of this as far back as 1967 but apparently they did little or nothing at that time and as yet there is no concrete evidence that sheep numbers are beginning to recover.  The <Col N="2079" /> Minister says he has evidence of that but he has not produced it.  I hope that the Government will be in a position to offer reasonable increases in agricultural prices so that the dispute between the farming community and the Government can be ended and so that farming can get back on to the road of high production which it must be back on if it is to compete in EEC conditions.</P>

      <P>This debate has ranged over a great many aspects of our big and complex agricultural industry and it is not surprising that the views expressed on it have been many and diverse.  In fact, in many cases the views have been in conflict although they came from the same benches.  However, I am glad that Deputies have had an opportunity of making their views known particularly as it has been suggested more than once that there has not been a full-scale debate on agriculture for a long time.  On that point it is necessary to state that there was a lengthy debate on the 1967-68 main Estimate for Agriculture in May and June, 1967. There was a two-day debate on the Supplementary Estimate early in 1968; there was a two-day debate in December, 1968 on the Estimate proper and the Supplementary Estimate for 1968-69 and in March last there was a debate on the Supplementary Estimate for 1969-70.  It must also be remembered that the current debate is a resumption of a full-scale debate which began early last December.  In the time available I shall do my best to deal with some of the points raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell and others contended that there had not been any real effort to formulate and implement a comprehensive and long-term policy for agriculture.  I do not know how the Deputy or anyone else could make this assertion.  Even though he referred to the Second Programme, the Deputy does not seem to realise that so far as agriculture is concerned the publication entitled <i>Agriculture in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> dealt in detail and in a most comprehensive way with agricultural policy. <Col N="2080" /> In addition to setting targets for agricultural expansion, it indicated the Government's measures that would be operated to encourage farmers to achieve these targets.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone will deny that these measures were substantially and extensively enlarged and have been improved and expanded during the years.  There was a further overall review of those measures in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development.  This continued and further developed the policies that have proved so successful in the First and Second Programmes.  The Government's agricultural policy objectives have been accepted as being soundly based.  All the measures the Government have taken have been designed to further these objectives.  With the aid of these measures our resources of manpower, land, buildings and equipment have improved, their more efficient use has been promoted and both the quality and the quantity of output have been improved.</P>
    <P>It is rather peculiar to hear Deputy O'Donnell say that our agricultural targets under the Second Programme were too low when, from the same side of the House, it has been said that they were set unrealistically high.  The targets were an estimate of what was considered capable of achievement in view of likely outlets but they were not, in any sense, an upper limit.  Even though the basic assumption of accession to the ECC did not materialise remarkable progress was achieved and in many cases the targets set were surpassed although increases in output involved a higher use of inputs than had been anticipated.</P>
    <P>The 1970 target for cattle output was 1½ million head; the actual output in 1970 is estimated to be at least 1.45 million head.  The Second Programme envisaged a rapid increase in cow numbers from 1.3 million in 1963 to 1.7 million in 1968; the figure of 1.7 million was achieved in 1970.  The output target set for milk was 760 million gallons; the output in 1970 is estimated at approximately 660 million gallons, compared with 525 million gallons in 1963.  In evaluating the 1970 figure the substantial increase in the amount of milk fed to calves must be taken into <Col N="2081" /> account as well as the generally unsatisfactory state of world markets for dairy products.</P>
    <P>The output target of 2 million pigs was achieved in 1969 and 1970.  The output target for sheep was 2½ million head; output last year at around 1½ million head was far short of the target, as has been pointed out.  I admit this is a disappointing result but the main reason was the relatively greater attractiveness of other enterprises, as Deputy Bruton pointed out.  Deputy Bruton's construction of this phenomenon was quite remarkable.  He was reluctant to acknowledge the very heavy price support given especially to milk.  I am endeavouring to quote the Deputy from memory, but I think he stated that it required £1 of Government input to produce £3 worth of milk and in the case of cattle and pigs the figure quoted was £19.  I do not know the source of these figures but I think this is what the Deputy said.  However, he sought to demonstrate that for that reason and because of the heavy concentration on the build-up of cattle numbers&mdash;which has been so successful&mdash;that sheep numbers diminished somewhat.  In one sense this is true.  The numbers diminished because the cattle trade has been so buoyant, as have other lines of production.</P>
    <P>The decline in sheep numbers between June, 1969 and June, 1970 was only about 30,000, as compared to 70,000 in the preceding year.  It would appear that the downturn in the size of the national flock is beginning to be controlled.</P>
    <P>The 1970 target for wheat of 300,000 tons was surpassed in the three years, 1968, 1969 and 1970.  A rapid growth in the output of barley to 600,000 tons by 1970 was projected.  Actual output in 1970 is now estimated to be somewhat more than 600,000 tons.  An output target of 1.2 million tons for sugar-beet in 1970 was projected and it is estimated that the output in 1970 was about 1 million tons.  For potatoes the target of 600,000 tons was set.  An output of a little less than 500,000 tons was achieved in 1970.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell claimed that nobody refuted the often-heard assertion that farm income is £8 per week less <Col N="2082" /> than the average in other sectors.  This figure of £8 per week is fallacious.  It is arrived at by working out two simple averages and the difference between them but this disregards the facts and the complexities of the situation.  The average income of the self-employed person in agriculture can be worked out in a simple fashion&mdash;in too simple and facile a fashion&mdash;by taking total family farm income and dividing it by the total number who were reported as self-employed in agriculture.  This total number includes juveniles, female relatives assisting, elderly widows, elderly males who in other occupations would be regarded as having retired, and smallholders who are in receipt of substantial social welfare payments as well as farmers actively engaged in commercial farming.  It includes persons with as little land as two, three and four acres and who are not in fact commercial farmers.  The average farm income arrived at in this way takes no account of the wide differences which exist between the incomes of individual farmers.  There are numerous reasons for these differences.  There are variations between the resources of individual farmers, between their efficiency, between the efficiency with which these resources are used and the size of farm businesses.  Even as between farms of similar size of business there can be and are differences in profitability depending on such factors as the system and pattern of farming and where the farm is, the actual geographical location.</P>
    <P>The Government in reiterating in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development their commitment to maintaining a reasonable relationship between farm and non-farm income, made it clear that the Government's objective to establish the conditions where those in farming can earn a reasonable living from agriculture applies to the farmer who works his land fully and efficiently and where the holding is small an acceptable income can realistically be expected only if the farmer engages in lines of business not dependent upon the extensive use of land.</P>
    <P>For the second side of the comparison the proponents of the £8 a week gap take the average earning of one <Col N="2083" /> specific category, adult male workers in industry, despite the fact that outside agriculture incomes vary widely within occupations, as they do in agriculture and also between occupations. In addition to all those considerations, there are the facts that farmers' incomes, which are net of rates on land and farm buildings, are not liable to income tax whereas the incomes of industrial workers are; that industrial workers have to pay rents for their homes and transport costs to and from their work, and that they have less job security than farmers.</P>
    <P>To be brief about it, there is no satisfactory method of comparing levels of incomes in farming with those of other occupations.  The £8 a week figure is based upon assumptions which no fair-minded person would, or could, accept.  What comparisons based on average do is to indicate broad trends in income changes.  The figures available show that the average per head income of the self-employed in agriculture has, since 1968, been increasing more slowly than the average per head income of employees of other occupations.  It is in the light of this and taking account of the effects on agriculture of inflation and rising costs that the Government on two occasions during the past year introduced a series of measures to improve the income position of farmers.  The cost of these in a full year is £10 million.</P>
    <P>Some people try to question or to write off as irrelevant the fact that the amount of money provided by the Government in relation to agriculture is now approaching £100 million a year.  The figure, however, cannot be shrugged off, and certainly nobody has suggested that any of the items in it should be dropped; at least if they have I have not heard about it.  It represents about 16 per cent of the total Government expenditure, both current and capital, which is a higher proportion than is to be found in most other countries.  Two items together account for about half the total sum; creamery milk, about £30 million, and rate relief, about £20 million.  Both of these directly affect farm incomes.  If this money were not spent farm income would be less by these amounts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2084" /> Other items include the price support for beef, lamb and pigs, totalling nearly £6 million; grants for land reclamation, farm buildings, beef cattle, sheep and all the rest of it, amounting to a total of £16 million; the eradication of disease which is also of direct benefit to farmers accounts for another £4 million.  The total administration cost is about 5 per cent.  It is often said that a great proportion of this figure is absorbed in administration. There is the actual figure&mdash;5 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is fallacious to argue that where aid to agriculture has a parallel in aid to industry the amount should be deducted from the £100 million spent on agriculture.  If this argument were reversed industry could claim that it gets little or no aid.  I am not arguing that the £100 million is not justified. It is fully justified, but surely we should not pretend that it does not exist?</P>
    <P>Constructive criticism and suggestions in regard to our application for membership to the EEC are to be welcomed.  The Government have never said that once we are a member all our problems will automatically be solved.  Neither have I claimed that it would be all plain sailing for farmers or for anybody else.  What I have said and what I now again affirm is that in the EEC our farmers, for the very first time, will be able to compete on equal terms with farmers in Britain, in the Six Counties, in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Luxembourg and Norway on the basis of good prices and in a market of 250 million people. Secondly, our agriculture has no prospects if we are out and all the other countries are in.  I do not think that the most vociferous anti-marketeer has yet come up with an acceptable or plausible answer to this inescapable conclusion.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking on the Estimate in December last, Deputy Keating accused me of talking in veiled terms of certain groups and personalities and of being abusive rather than critical of their anti-Common Market propaganda. Is he not aware of the lengthy statement I issued last September commenting in detail on a publication of <Col N="2085" /> the so-called Common Market Study Group and entitled &ldquo;Irish Agriculture in the Common Market: The Consequences and the Alternatives&rdquo;?  In that statement I named the group and the publication and I showed that by any acceptable definition of objective criticism the group's arguments against EEC membership for Irish farmers, and the spurious alternatives to membership proposed, should only be described as distorted and unbalanced.  The Deputy should read my statement and judge it for himself.</P>
    <P>Can he, for example, in this era of large trading blocs honestly subscribe to the view that we could, through bilateral trade agreements, secure stable and remunerative markets for our expanding agricultural surplus?  Can he support the idea that we could, through an association agreement with the EEC, a highly improbable arrangement, fare just as well as if we were a full member?  A fact of our economic life which does not seem to register with some people is that our welfare is more dependent on foreign trade than that of most other countries.</P>
    <P>In 1968, our total exports constituted over 26 per cent of our gross national product, as against under 4 per cent for the USA, and 14 per cent for the United Kingdom.  Approximately half of our exports are farm products.  If the export markets for these were disrupted, there would be a disastrous fall in farm income and in the national income.  It is idle to pretend that we could find remunerative export markets if we remained outside the EEC and all the other European countries to which we export were in.  Those who talk about lucrative trade bargains in such circumstances are just living in a world of unreality and are, in fact, misleading our people.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I find it puzzling that people who have criticised our traditional dependence on one country and on one market, should now oppose our participation in a trading community of nations, with the same rights as a member as all the other members of that Community.  We would certainly be more genuinely free inside this Community than as a mere mendicant outside it, hoping for whatever benefits <Col N="2086" /> the Community might choose to concede to us.</P>
    <P>Presumably Deputy Keating has seen the Common Market Study Group's other booklet, <i>The Common Market: Why Ireland should not Join</i>.  On page 24 he will have read the amazing allegation that Irish farmers would lose £36 million because of the cessation of price support subsidies on entry into the EEC and that this would be&mdash;and I am quoting&mdash;&ldquo;a certain and inevitable loss and would drastically curtail incomes of many farmers, particularly the smaller ones&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This argument certainly reaches the heights of fantasy.  Of course price supports will go, but they will be more than compensated for in the market prices which our farmers will get under common agricultural policy.  Take the milk prices for example.  Prior to the last adjustment, it was calculated that our creamery milk producers were getting an average of about 2s 4d or 2s 5d a gallon, including subsidy.  The European Economic Community target price is 3s 9d a gallon, so that not only would our farmers not lose, but they will gain very considerably indeed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating questioned the validity and methodology of my Department's publication, <i>Irish Agriculture and Fisheries in the EEC</i>.  This publication was based on the work of professional economists, both within and without my Department, using all the available historical facts and trends and scientific forecasting techniques to arrive at their conclusions.  These conclusions have not been questioned by any recognised agricultural authorities or interests except, of course, those who have a vested interest in opposing them.</P>
    <P>More than this, I would refer the Deputy to a study published recently by the Applied Agricultural Economics Department of University College, Dublin.  This study gives the results of a practical survey conducted among farmers on how they see their future within the EEC.  The results of this independent survey are strikingly at one with the findings of my Department's analysis.  I would remind the Deputy that these results are based on the observations of practical farmers whose business it is to know the <Col N="2087" /> score in relation to agricultural trends and prospects.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy foresees in the Common Market a concerted conspiracy among the mighty industrialists to keep down the price of food.  He overlooks the fact that Western Germany, one of the leading industrial nations, had a policy of high agricultural prices long before becoming a member of the EEC and that the German prices were one of the main influences in working out the EEC common prices.  He also overlooks the fact that the industrial nations generally have been providing massive supports for their relatively small agricultural sectors, and are in a position to do so precisely because of their industrial might.</P>
    <P>Britain had a cheap food import policy but, nevertheless, she gave very substantial agricultural supports to her domestic farming sector.  Even the British are now changing their policy and switching to a system where market prices for food in Britain will be significantly higher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Has the Deputy finished?  Any suggestion that the EEC aim at lowering agricultural prices is completely at variance with past experience and current trends. Past proposals for reducing prices have been strongly resisted and were not accepted.  The price proposals of the 1971-72 season are at present being considered by the Community, and, contrary to what some Deputies forecast, the indications are that producer prices in the EEC will be increased for a number of commodities.  These would include commodities of particular interest to this country, for example, beef, milk and barley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keating did not tell us why the Community agricultural prices were above world prices.  Perhaps I should remind him of the real reason, namely, that one of the basic principles of the common agricultural policy, as enshrined in Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome, aims &ldquo;to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture&rdquo;. Deputy Keating went some way towards admitting that the Mansholt plan for the reform of agricultural structures was a comprehensive attempt to humanise, within the Community, the worldwide movement of people out of agriculture into other economic sectors.  However, he glossed over the voluntary nature of the Mansholt proposals, the fact that they are as yet only proposals and the fact that we have a more favourable structural position than the existing members of the states of the Community.  I am afraid that I cannot find in the Mansholt <Col N="2089" /> Plan the statement attributed to him by Deputy Keating, that the agricultural policy of the Community was in crisis and that farm prices would have to come down.  What the plan did say was that market and price support policy alone cannot solve the fundamental difficulties of agriculture, that these must be accompanied by appropriate structural improvement in social policies.  I cannot see any reason for quarrelling with this type of reasoning.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to another fallacious argument which is going around.  It is contended that outside the EEC, we would only have to surmount a relatively small tariff barrier, of the order of 7½ per cent, to send our exports into the Community.  So far as our agricultural exports are concerned, the people who push this argument must have very short memories indeed and very scant knowledge of the working of the EEC import levy system.  They seem to forget what happened to our vital cattle industry in 1966 when continental markets were suddenly closed to us by import levies. Do they know that even now, when the EEC levy on cattle is operating at only half rate, it amounts to no less than 53s 4d per cwt. live-weight or about £26 10s for a ten cwt. bullock, and that on top of that, there is a duty of 16 per cent?</P>
    <P>One final point on the EEC question&mdash;it relates to the concern of the anti-Common Market lobby for the future of our small farmers.  In the context of comment on the Mansholt Plan, it has been alleged by some members of Deputy Keating's party&mdash; I mean the Labour Party&mdash;that the EEC membership will spell disaster for the small farmer and will put an end to the grant of aids to these people. Nothing could be a greater distortion of the Mansholt proposals which, in essence, are designed to help small farmers and their families.  The plan does not set out to create any particular size of farm but rather to create viable production units.  It would not prevent any farmer from participating in the higher prices of the Community, so far as State aids are concerned; it merely states that investment aids should not be given to units which <Col N="2090" /> cannot be made viable.  Does Deputy Keating object to this criterion, or is he advocating a policy that the farmer and his family in a production unit which cannot be made viable must be condemned to remain there for ever, irrespective of what is done for the rest of the community?  Apparently these champions of the small farmer, &mdash;who incidentally number among their ranks a remarkably small number of actual real farmers&mdash;wish to deny to Irish farmers, big and small, the opportunity that we waited for for so long of getting a remunerative return for their labour and their produce, of expanding their enterprises and raising their standard of living.  Of course, it is very easy for people who are far removed from the daily struggle and hardship involved in life on the inadequately sized farm to advocate a continuance of the present unsatisfactory conditions for somebody else.</P>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange talked about the need for aggressive young salesmen to sell our agricultural produce abroad. We have to remember that so far as EEC countries are concerned, salesmanship will not overcome the very high levies on imports of cattle, beef and dairy produce.  These levies, of course, will be a protection to us when we become a member of the Community, but while we are outside it, they are prohibitive in effect.  As regard the British and American markets which are at present the biggest outlets for our agricultural exports, it cannot be said that our exporters, whether private firms or public bodies, are lacking in drive and efficiency. How otherwise could our total agricultural exports have increased from £115 million to £180 million in five years, despite the big reduction of our outlets in the EEC caused by the levies?</P>
    <P>Information was also sought during the debate about consultation between my Department and farming organisations on the EEC negotiations.  Close contact is being maintained with the farming organisations and other agricultural interests and my Department have had meetings with such bodies as the NFA, the ICMSA, the IAOS, the General Council of Committees of <Col N="2091" /> Agriculture and Macra na Feirme.  In addition, there have been meetings with the various state marketing and promoting bodies and a number of exporters' organisations.  In some instances there have been meetings and we shall continue to meet the various organisations about developments during the course of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of Government policy towards the creamery milk industry.  It is alleged that there has been a fall in milk production.  This is not so.  While deliveries to creameries in 1970 were lower than 1969 the decline is more than compensated for by the increase in the amount of milk diverted to calf feeding as a result of the beef cattle incentive scheme which is costing almost £5 million in the present financial year and in which over 50,000 herd owners are now participating. The true position is that people who sent milk to creameries in 1969 produced more and not less in 1970. About 25 million gallons went to calves instead of creameries because an increasing number of producers opted for the beef cattle incentive scheme.</P>
    <P>While people are bemoaning the decline in milk supplies to creameries they are not acknowledging the benefits which will accrue to the many thousands of farmers from the increased emphasis on beef.  Is there any reason to bemoan the fact that most of the milk used for beef production would otherwise have been disposed of at prices representing no more than 3d a gallon exclusive of skim to the creamery?  This increased stimulus for beef production is fully in line with the objectives of the Third Programme which stated that marketing difficulties for dairy produce were likely to continue and that it was clearly necessary for farmers in a position to do so, to apply increased resources to other lines of production for which markets and market prospects were better.</P>
    <P>The generally unsatisfactory state of international marketing for dairy produce poses big problems for any country exporting dairy produce.  This was illustrated by our experience in the <Col N="2092" /> past year.  An Board Bainne entered its 1969-70 financial year with a large surplus stock of butter which the board had not been able to dispose of satisfactorily in the very poor market conditions of the time.  This surplus stock of about 8,000 tons was eventually disposed of on overseas markets in the early months of 1970 at a trading loss to the board of £3.2 million, of which £2.1 million fell to be recouped out of Exchequer grants to the board.</P>
    <P>The board entered the 1970-71 financial year with a more normal stock of about 3,000 tons.  With a view to ensuring that it would not again be forced into unprofitable stock piling, which, incidentally, is extremely costly, the board entered into large forward contracts for the supply of butter to overseas markets at the relatively low prices prevailing on those markets in the early months of 1970.  These forward contracts necessitated drawing on supplies of butter which would otherwise have been available for other market opportunities involving smaller losses that arose later in the year principally in the British market.  There is no foundation for the allegation that export requirements could not be met because of a so-called shortage of milk.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of the international marketing situation our creamery milk price is not high compared with other countries but it is costing the Exchequer some £30 million a year to enable this price to be paid. There is very little acknowledgment of this massive support to the creamery producer.  In recent years the Exchequer has provided an increasing proportion of the prices paid by creameries to their suppliers.  In fact, since 1964 practically all the increases in creamery producers' receipts have come from the State.  In 1969 the gross value of creamery milk output was £58 million, of which half was provided by the State.</P>
    <P>I realise the fundamental importance of the creamery milk industry and that many farmers have invested heavily in it.  The Government recognised this by twice increasing the support for creamery milk in the past year and by making important changes in the tier structure.  The amount of Exchequer resources which can be devoted to support <Col N="2093" /> for milk is not unlimited.  It has been necessary for the Government to try and strike a balance between the dictates of efficiency, on the one hand, and equitable distribution of available moneys, on the other.</P>
    <P>In our revised milk price structure we have given a powerful incentive to the efficient and progressive smaller producer to expand production by increasing the subsidy on the 20,000 to 30,000 gallon range by 3d a gallon.  I believe so long as the taxpayer has to meet the bill, such producers deserve a higher rate of support per gallon than the large producers whose unit costs of production are less.  There has been very serious misrepresentation of the actual effects of the present revised tier structure.  Even allowing for recent improvement in export market prices the total State subsidy to the farmer sending 30,000 gallons of milk to the creamery is over £1,600 per year, for a milk producer sending 40,000 gallons it is £2,000 per year, and for a producer sending 60,000 gallons is over £2,500.</P>
    <P>The principle of a two-tier system of milk price was first advocated by a producers' organisation in the sixties. Opinions may, of course, have changed since then.  I have asked the Dairy Organisation Council, whom I expect to meet soon, to let me have their considered views as to what further adjustments they would like to make in the present structure.</P>
    <P>My Department are co-operating fully with the IAOS in their efforts to rationalise the creamery industry. Considerable advances have been made in this direction in the past year or so but I should like to see faster progress being made.  The difficulty is that we cannot compel creameries to rationalise and we would not wish to impose any particular scheme on them. We have already agreed that the Dairy Disposal Company creameries will be included in the overall reorganisation of the industry and permission has already been given for the company to open negotiations for the transfer of some of its creamery interests to co-operative ownership.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully urged that the date of the first inspection under the beef <Col N="2094" /> cattle scheme be changed to the 1st May instead of 1st March.  He said that the change to 1st March would result in reducing by half the amount the Government would pay by way of grants.  There is no question of applicants losing grants by having their herds inspected early.  If a cow has not calved on the day of inspection a prepaid postcard is left with the herd owner and as long as the cow calves before the 31st July and the postcard is returned to the local office before that date another inspection will be arranged with a view to the payment of the grant.</P>

      <P>I understand that the position is that the temperatures at which tinned dog meat is processed are so high as to rule out the possibility of the survival of any infection.  Animals <Col N="2097" /> which die of any common endemic disease, such as pneumonia, hoose, or parasitic diseases, do not constitute a risk of spreading disease.  There is a legal obligation on each stockowner to report any suspected case of serious infectious disease, for example, foot and mouth disease, anthrax and swine fever. There should therefore be no question of the movement of carcases of such animals to knackeries or kennels unless the carcase first has been cleared of suspicion by veterinary examination. The fact that a high proportion of farm animals nowadays receive veterinary care is of course an added safeguard against the spread of disease through the movement of fallen animals into knackeries.  Any person operating a knackery is required to obtain a licence for the purpose from the local sanitary authority and must comply with the requirements of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts and any bye-laws made thereunder.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell complained about the lack of a policy for co-operation in agriculture and said that advisers should be trained to organise small farmers into groups.  The fostering of co-operation in its various forms among farmers has long been a basic aim of the advisory service.  Many farmers' co-operatives, clubs and associations owe their formation either directly or indirectly to the activities of the local instructor.  As educators advisers have to deal with groups and so must of necessity receive training in working with them.  The work of a majority of pilot area advisers has developed around the neighbourhood groups. These as well as other similar groups gave rise to special interest groups.  The Department and the agricultural faculty of UCD have been concerned with developing further the advisers' understanding of group work.  An important part of the post-graduate course for advisers organised in the past three years at Lyons' farm has been on the organisation of groups.  These courses will continue and, in time, will be extended.  This year there is a special short course for advisers to service discussion groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell spoke about a proper formula for group farming. <Col N="2098" /> There is no single formula, nor is there likely to be.  When two or more individuals decide to farm together many problems are presented.  The Land Commission have been making efforts to promote the idea of farming together among their allottees but farmers have not fallen over one another to become involved.  Some progress is being made and the advisory officers are anxious to help.</P>
    <P>The Government have announced their readiness to assist financially group farming projects.  The formulation of a suitable scheme under which groups might be aided has been under consideration and there have been consultations with the advisory services. Proposals submitted by some groups are being examined at the present time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond advocated that the fertiliser industry in the country should be brought progressively either under total State-sponsored co-operative control or general public control, otherwise price and import policy may pass out of the influence of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  As the Deputy properly acknowledges, a significant section of the industry is already vested in a State-sponsored company&mdash;Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta.  It is primarily designed to produce nitrogenous fertilisers and also produces a wide range of CCF&mdash;complete compound fertilisers&mdash;the form in which compound fertilisers are now most commonly used.  The largest operating company in the fertiliser industry is one of the longest established companies in the country and I have no reason to believe that in recent years it is being operated to make vast profits for its owners and shareholders at the expense <Col N="2099" /> of the farming public.  I do not want to go into any lengthy discourse on the commercial profitability of the fertiliser industry but I believe that manufacturers here, in common with those in other countries, have not been making inordinate profits, due perhaps to competition at home and from abroad.  Another factor is that world fertiliser capacity is in excess of effective demand and this situation can frequently ensure that supplies, particularly of fertilisers which we do not produce, can be secured on world markets at keen prices.  Deputy Desmond will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has a control function in relation to prices and imports of fertilisers, in the exercise of which he will have regard to farming interests.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooney advocated a rural development authority.  So far as decentralisation of administration and close contact with farmers are concerned these are desirable objectives, but a rural development authority is not required to meet these objectives. Such an authority would have to look to the State for money and the State must obtain it from the taxpayers. Therefore, the democratically-elected Government cannot abdicate their functions in favour of a bureaucratic authority that would have power, without the responsibility of raising the money from the taxpayers.  During the years my Department have introduced a large measure of decentralisation in regard to a number of activities. Instances can be seen in the operation of the local veterinary offices, the Land Project, the farm buildings schemes and the advisory services.  This policy will be continued and the services provided will be improved progressively and will be rationalised.</P>

    <P>Reference was made in the debate to the financing of An Foras Talúntais. The grant provided in the current Estimate is £2,295,000.  In addition, An Foras derives income from the sale of livestock and produce and from the investment of the US grant counterpart moneys.  Its total income is now running at about £2,900,000 per year.  This is a considerable sum and the amount <Col N="2100" /> now being provided for agricultural research compares favourably with the position in most countries.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to a dispute with farming organisations.  Let me repeat, I am not in dispute with any farming organisation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I raise is the delay by the Department of Health in announcing the amount of health grants to local authorities for the year 1971-72. My reason for doing so tonight on the Adjournment is twofold: first, because of the outmoded arrangement in this House whereby matters of urgent importance cannot be raised in any other way; and, secondly, because I wanted some information from the Minister which it is important that local authorities would have this week. I want to apologise to you, Sir, and to the people who are being kept here, particularly the staff who I know will have to work overtime without getting any pay for it.  I have 20 minutes to make a case.  I propose to take two or three minutes at the most and I am quite sure the Minister will be as brief in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I simply want to know why it has not been possible up till now to notify local authorities of the amount of health grant which they will be given for the year 1971-72.  For the past few weeks preliminary estimates meetings have been held all over the country. The object of these meetings by the local authorities is to strike a rate for the coming year.  In each case it has been found impossible to strike a rate because no county council knew what amount of health grant they would receive.  The matter is made more complicated this year because, <Col N="2101" /> for the first time, from 1st April, the new health committees will come into operation.  It is bad enough to have these arrangements to make having found out what money we have to work on, but it is worse when the local authorities cannot say what the amount of the health rate will be or what the amount of the rates will be because of this failure of the Department to supply the information.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister can say that the county council have quite a long time yet finally to strike their rate. That is quite true but take the case of the county council which have had one or two preliminary meetings and have reached a figure except for health and have arranged to have their ordinary meeting next week to strike the rate and who still find they can get no information from the Department of Health as to what the amount of the health grant will be.  If the county council are unable to strike the rate at their meeting next week they must then go to the trouble and expense of calling a special meeting at a later stage for the purpose of striking the rate.  If it were a question of not being able to supply the information I could understand it.  However, the Minister will remember that several weeks ago I asked him in this House if he was aware of this situation building up and if he would do what he could to ensure that the information would be passed on in good time.  He told me that, while he could not guarantee it would be done, he would do everything possible to ensure the information would be in the possession of the local authorities in time for the striking of the rate.</P>
    <P>I do not know who is responsible. The bush telegraph tells me it is not the Minister, that he is as anxious as I am that the information should be available, but that in fact the Department of Finance are the people who, for some peculiar reason of their own, cannot be forced to disclose the information which we want.  I want to know from the Minister tonight if he can supply the information to the local authorities this week and, if he cannot, if there is anything this House or anybody can do to try to get that information.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2102" /> We talk about co-operation between local authorities and various other types of co-operation, but this is the greatest example of lack of co-operation where a Department of State have failed to give vital information to the local authorities.  Not alone my local authority but every local authority are in this position.  They have not got the information and there is nothing they can do about it.  If the Minister can say that the information can now be made available I will not delay the House any longer.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Deputy Tully has said.  This information should be made available immediately. I hope it will be made available in this House, and that the Minister or the Government do not use a function in some part of the country to make it available, as has been happening so often.  The Minister should try to see that this House functions properly.  The Government are by-passing this House too often.</P>
      <P>From the information I have it seems that the county councils of Ireland are looking for increases ranging from 15s to £2 in the £.  Those increases are, on average, three to four times the amount sought in any previous year and the members of local authorities will try to hold the scales as evenly as possible between the people who sent them there and the services that require money.  They realise the demands place a huge burden on the backs of the ratepayers. Another matter which must be taken into consideration&mdash;perhaps it does not arise here&mdash;is that the road grants have been cut for the past few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  I am mentioning it only in passing, which I am certainly entitled to do.  I remember Dr. Ryan telling us that the extra cost of health would not amount to more than 2s in the £ for the different county councils of Ireland.  We were told in a White Paper that was issued prior to 1965 that it was the <Col N="2103" /> Government's intention to stabilise the health rate, but it has not been stabilised since.  It is a huge burden and the time has come for the Minister for Health to take action.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully has spoken about the county councils meeting.  The county council of which I am a member is meeting next week.  It must be remembered that the rate must be struck within 21 days of the first meeting. The county councils of Ireland will be facing the problem which Deputy Tully has mentioned.  Therefore, it is the Minister's duty to supply this information so that the county councils can carry on with their work as expeditiously as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House knows the regulations in regard to the expenditure of the Department of Health under the Health Act, 1970, provide that there will be grants to defray one half of the expenditure of the boards, other than capital expenditure, and expenditure on loan charges as authorised under the Act which is not met by receipts other than grants and contributions under this section.  Then supplementary grants are given for a percentage over 50 per cent of the cost of the services after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I can quite understand that the members of local authorities wish to know the amount of the contribution from central sources as soon as possible and I will do my very best to make that information available within the course of the next seven days.  I cannot go further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible to have it this week, because most of the meetings are on Monday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be possible this week but I cannot give a guarantee. I will do my best to get the information in time for local authorities to know the position before Monday, but I cannot absolutely guarantee that.  The reason for the delay lies in the preparation of the Budget.  This is not the only <Col N="2104" /> country in the world where the Budget has been very much affected by inflation. Inflation can be seen all over the world in a variety of countries, some of them with extremely stable Governments like our own&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has his tongue in his cheek when he says that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and some of them in countries where the Government may be changing from year to year. The pattern is more or less common. There are one or two countries which seem to have a gift for avoiding excessive inflation.  We are not one of them at this moment.  We have had many debates on the character and origin of inflation.  I think the House knows the position.  It is true to say that, if we have not been able to adopt the concept that increases in incomes and prices should only be in accordance with the growth of production, we are, to say the least, in extremely good company. It so happens that our inflation was serious for ourselves in 1969 and 1970.</P>
      <P>It is equally true to say that there are other countries in Europe&mdash;and I will not keep the House by elucidating the information&mdash;where their inflation in a particular year, such as 1970, has been extremely serious.  That does not excuse us from not trying to get away from this infernal inflation.  We ought to learn gradually the rules about inflation so that we can surpass other countries in an endeavour to avoid it.</P>
      <P>That is the reason for the delay.  The Government must consider the Budget as a whole, bearing in mind the inflation that will be known to every Deputy in the House.  Every Deputy in the House will know that we have to consider the Budget as a whole and, in the context of the Budget, we are considering the contribution we can make towards the relief of rates.  As the House knows already, in many of the rural counties the Government are paying 75 per cent of the total cost of the health services through the element of agricultural relief grant that applies to the cost of the health services in those counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some of the cities and larger towns where a local rate is struck, it is <Col N="2105" /> quite evident that the figure is not 75 per cent.  It is nearer 58 or 59 per cent of the total cost, as it was in the passing financial year.  That is the position and all I can say is that I will promise the House that I will do my best to get this information through as soon as possible.</P>
