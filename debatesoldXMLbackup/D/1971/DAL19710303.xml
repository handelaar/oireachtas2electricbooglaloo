      <P>In my speech on the 20th February, I suggested a number of economic matters which I thought that North and South should examine together: I attached no political considerations.  In my statement of the 25th February in response to press inquiries, I said that I was hopeful that we could soon proceed to expert examination of practical matters in economic development in which North and South could agree to co-operate for the benefit of everyone.</P>
      <P>That is still my position.  Ministers of Government and senior officials are available for consultation with their opposite numbers as soon as the Stormont Government are ready to partake in such discussions.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a question in the House on 9th December last <Col N="156" /> (vol 250, No. 4, cols. 453-455) the Government are examining the possibility of introducing a contributory insurance scheme for persons in the middle income group.  This examination is not yet complete and it is not yet possible to make an announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate the fact that at the moment most local authorities are striking the rate and that it would be extremely beneficial to them if the Minister could give some indication as to what contribution will be made from central funds towards stabilisation and the prevention of the escalation of the rates which appears to be the problem of every local authority in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt whether the announcement of the contribution at this stage would alter the financial position faced by local authorities which, as the Deputy knows, is due to inflation, to the fact that people requested increases of incomes that were bound to increase the cost of remuneration in State and local services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that what he has said is just a rehash of what he said on the Adjournment last week when he said he would try to get the figures for this year notified to the local authorities before Monday?  Is he aware that so far no figures have been given?  Does he not realise that at least for this year notification of the moneys that will be given would help to keep the rates down. otherwise there will be a position which cannot be rectified at a later date?  Would the Minister not make some statement on the matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the national rate increase is about 75p in the £ and health charges are about 75p in the £?  Is he not further aware that his predecessor, the late Deputy O'Malley, indicated that additional increases from the year 1968-69 would be borne entirely by the Exchequer?  In view of that assurance would the Minister not consider increasing the central authority contribution so that this additional burden of 75p would not be placed on the rate-paying community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the Deputy is misinterpreting the actual words of the White Paper in regard to increase in the rates.  I do not need to repeat what the White Paper actually said.  Secondly, it would be quite impossible for me to make a promise at this stage that I would stabilise the rate at its present position.  I could not do that for the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister refers to an insurance contribution, would this be compulsory or voluntary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have to be compulsory to be any use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate that in Mayo we have the highest rate in the country?  Our council is meeting on Saturday next to strike the rate.  Could the Minister tell me whether the necessary information will be available in time for that meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy very carefully examines the White Papers that have been introduced on the subject of rates he will find that there may be a difficulty in the towns in certain parts of Mayo.  He will also find out, if he looks at the rate actually paid per head of the population in Mayo and compares it with that in Sligo and Limerick and Clare and Cork and Kerry, that an anomalous situation is created by simply speaking of Mayo as having the highest rate in the country. I invite the Deputy and all other Mayo Deputies to read the White Paper issued on rates.  I know that rate per head of the population may not necessarily be an absolutely equitable method of comparison but at least it is some comparison.  Deputies and <Col N="158" /> county councillors from Mayo, when they talk about the highest rate, should compare the rate per head of the population.  When I last saw the figure about four years ago it was something like £5 9s per head of the population compared with £5 and £6 and figures of that order for other western counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply to me the Minister said that the escalation of the rates was due to inflationary conditions generally, but I want to ask him does he not accept the fact that in every local authority in Ireland the rates are rising due to the health charges?  Therefore he has the paramount responsibility in this matter. Could he state one way or the other whether he proposes to give a bigger grant from the central Government to control the rates?  That is the whole point of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy that the announcement will be made as soon as possible.  The Deputy will also be aware of the fact that everybody who is not employed in a health authority and who asks for an increase in salary or wages far in excess of national productivity should by now know that he or she is automatically taxing himself or herself by the inevitable growth in the cost of the health services.  People who are employed in the health authorities naturally require the same increases in wages and salaries as other people in the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of the marked need throughout the country for occupational therapists, he will consider as a matter of urgency an improvement of their pay, conditions and opportunities of promotion with the aim of bringing back those abroad and encouraging more people at home to enter the profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The salary of occupational therapists employed by local authorities was increased as recently at 11th February last.  The new scale is £1,145 × £45-£1,550 × £50-£1,600 per annum.  This compares favourably with the scales of remuneration for para-medical personnel generally.</P>
      <P>The extensive provision of occupational therapy in the health services is comparatively new and the development of a promotional structure will be considered according as the service develops.  The Deputy will of course appreciate that any such development will be considered in consultation with the new health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is still grave discontent amongst the occupational therapists and para-medical workers generally?  In view of the important and laudable work they do, would he again consider as a matter of urgency bringing some kind of realistic grading system into their salary and conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree that there is grave discontent.  As I have said, new scales have been created for physiotherapists and the matter can be considered again when the health boards are formed.  It may be necessary to undertake some further regarding because of the larger area in the health board as compared with the health authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether a <Col N="161" /> special tourism promotional campaign is being launched in North America; if so, whether tourist interests from Ireland will participate; and, if so, if he will give details of the campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether Bord Fáilte are organisating tourist workshops during 1971; if so, when and where; and whether any innovations are being introduced this year in relation to the organisation of or participation in these workshops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a special promotional campaign is being under-taken by Bord Fáilte in our main tourist markets, including North America, with a view to attracting additional tourist traffic in 1971 and subsequent years.  The campaign includes increased consumer advertising backed up by public relations and sales activity with appropriate supporting print and distribution.</P>
      <P>As part of the campaign, tourist workshops are being held at five centres in North America in the course of the present month.  Thirty organisations representing hotel groups, carhire organisations and handling agents are participating in these workshops, which are also being supported by the major carriers.  This is the first occasion on which workshops have been organised in North America and they will provide the participating organisations with the opportunity of meeting leading United States and Canadian travel agents and other traffic generators.</P>
      <P>The promotion of tourism through workshops has become an integral part of Bord Fáilte's marketing programme. Workshops will also be held in Britain and Germany during June.</P>
      <P>The 1971 workshops will be organised on broadly the same basis as in previous years.  As in 1970, the travel and tourism interests participating will contribute towards the costs of these promotions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Question No. 9, while I agree with the desirability of accelerating the campaign in North America, could the Minister give any reason as to why this campaign was not carried out earlier? It is a bit late now to be going on a marketing campaign for the 1971 season.  Why was it not done last October, November or December?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under a misapprehension.  The money was made available last October.  It was spent on a planned basis.  This is the culmination of promotional work in North America, Britain and Europe since last October.  This is the precise on-the-ground selling.  This is the appropriate time for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Again in relation to Question No. 9, is the Minister aware of the fact that these workshops have now proved to be very doubtful ventures?  The workshop in London last year proved to be a complete fiasco.  Is the Minister further aware that the people in the tourist trade, the travel agents and tour operators, are amazed that Bord Fáilte are repeating what has proved to be a complete fiasco?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If this is the case, the Deputy must be under a very gross misapprehension, because £40,000 is being contributed by the Irish tourist trade towards Bord Fáilte expenditure on the five workshops in North America.  That is £40,000 from the actual tourist trade, the hotel trade and the carrier trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not in the question but for the overall campaign it is £395,000.  It is split 50/50 roughly &mdash;I have not got the exact figures&mdash; between North America and Europe and Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>11.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether, in view of the fact that the peak period for the tourism promotional campaign for the 1971 tourist season is now drawing to a close, he is satisfied with the progress of the campaign to date; and whether any special additional promotional effort will be necessary to ensure that the projected targets for 1971 will be realised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will indicate in respect of (a) Great Britain, (b) North America and (c) Europe how the volume of tourist bookings to Ireland compares at present with the volume of bookings this time last year.</P>

    <P>13.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 11, 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>It would be unrealistic to attempt at this stage to make any detailed assessment of bookings or of the general prospects for the 1971 tourist season.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a special promotional campaign has been initiated by Bord Fáilte in our main markets with a view to attracting additional tourist traffic in the coming season.  Bord Fáilte have told me that they are generally satisfied with the progress of the campaign in North America and Europe and that the present indications from these markets are reasonably good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Britain, inquiries to Bord Fáilte offices were running at a particularly high rate before the commencement of the British postal strike.  The board have taken special measures, in conjunction with the trade, to offset the worst effects of the strike.  These include the facilitation of telephone bookings, the promotion of the new computerised reservation service and increased direct promotion to consumers <Col N="164" /> through meetings and travel agents and film show evenings.</P>
    <P>I understand that the level of bookings for the cross-Channel and Continental ferry services is satisfactory and shows an increase on last year's figures.  However, Deputies will appreciate that having regard to the continued interruption of British postal services and the renewed disturbances in the North any estimate of 1971 tourist traffic at this stage would be conjectural.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Question No. 10, is it not a fact that the Minister's optimistic forecasts when he returned from the States, and in his reply to that question, and all the replies he has given here since last June, are sheer unadulterated bluff?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that all the evidence at our disposal, as a result of the marketing campaign over the past three months, clearly indicates that 1971 will be a very difficult tourist season?  Would the Minister not agree that something more than the haphazard hit and miss type of marketing effort that is being carried out by Bord Fáilte is necessary, and that only a sustained intensive campaign until June will enable us to break even or to come up to last year's figure?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The report on marketing is one of a number of reports which the board commissioned on various aspects of tourism.  Other studies deal with the board's budgetary and planning system and the accommodation needs of the <Col N="169" /> tourist industry up to 1985.  These reports will be considered by Bord Fáilte in conjunction with each other so as to ensure an integrated approach to the development of tourism policies and programmes.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have informed me that arising from the report they are arranging for consultation with various sectors of the industry, particularly the National Tourism Council and the Irish Hotels Federation.  It will then be a matter for the board to formulate proposals about future policy and to make such recommendations to me as they consider appropriate.</P>
    <P>This report was commissioned by Bord Fáilte for their internal use only and the question of circulating it to Deputies does not, therefore, arise.</P>
    <P>As to the outlook for tourism in 1971, I would refer the Deputies to my replies to other questions on today's Order Paper.</P>

So far the council of the EEC has not made any definitive pronouncement on these proposals but I understand that they may come up for discussion shortly, arising from a resolution submitted last month by the commission to the Council of Ministers.</P>

    <P>Though the life annuity scheme authorised by section 6 of the Land Act, 1965, is less successful than originally anticipated it is not abortive.  There are, in fact, 31 applicants receiving pensions varying from £79 to £904 per annum.  These have surrendered about 1,550 acres for land settlement purposes. There is a special provision in <Col N="176" /> the scheme whereby a vendor may be granted a right of residence for life in the dwelling house on the lands being sold&mdash;and he can also get a letting of a small area of accommodation land if he wishes.  In the case of elderly or blind vendors so much of a life annuity as does not exceed £3 a week is not reckonable when computing means for old age pensions Acts purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to tender advice to the Government that any such arrangement should be made.

Is he further aware that the present methods employed have resulted in a serious deterioration in our educational standards?

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. Research has established beyond doubt that children of normal ability suffer no intellectual retardation through learning a second language even at an early stage.  My view is that every child is entitled to learn his own language and whatever the child may do afterwards is his own business.  It has always been national policy that every child is entitled to learn his own language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for a comprehensive school in the Glin/Tarbert area is generally accepted but it has not been found possible to get agreement locally on whether it should be located in Tarbert or in Glin.  Until this question has been resolved, no progress in the matter can be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the money available to me for comprehensive schools is limited.  Naturally, I have given precedence to areas where agreement has been reached.  Agreement should be reached on this matter in the area.  This would be preferable to my making a decision, which in the long-term I will have to make if we cannot get agreement.  In the interests of the children's education, the two areas should come together and try to reach some agreement.  As I have said, this will be helpful to all children, irrespective of whether they are in Glin or Tarbert.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the Minister to say whether it will be erected in Tarbert or Glin.

      <P>In the course of a reply to a question on 9th December last I undertook to let the House know if and when the World Bank approved any loan to this country.  I now wish to say that the Bank has sanctioned a loan of $20 million to the Electricity Supply Board.  The loan is repayable over a period of 17 years, including a five-year period of grace, and interest is payable at 7¼ per cent per annum. Payment of the interest and repayment of the principal have been guaranteed by me as Minister for Finance under powers given by the Electricity (Supply) Acts.</P>
      <P>The loan will be used to meet part of the cost of a major extension to the generating station at Tarbert.  It is expected to cover 70 per cent of the total cost.</P>
      <P>The proposed project will be the first major section of the ESB's development programme during the present decade.  The expansion is necessary to meet the growing demand for electricity arising from the expansion of the economy and in particular industrial development.</P>
      <P>This is the second loan which the World Bank have made to the ESB&mdash; the first being a loan of $14½ million sanctioned in 1969 to assist in financing the board's pumped storage scheme at Turlough Hill, County Wicklow.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is not my intention to take up much of the time of the House on this measure.  I rose shortly before the House adjourned last night to make one net point which occurred to me during the debate.  This Bill proposes to increase the liability of the State in respect of indemnity granted to exporters to cover risks of various types to which exporters in this country are exposed in sending their goods to foreign countries for sale and in so far as the Bill does that this party has expressed its complete approval of it.</P>
      <P>When this procedure was introduced I think the State accepted responsibility up to the limit of £2 million. That was increased to £10 million by the Insurance Act of 1969 and it is now proposed to increase that to £30 million because, I suppose, the volume of our exports has increased, the value of our exports has certainly increased and the risks have increased.  We are dealing with strange customers; I do not say that in any offensive way but we are dealing with new customers of whom we have not had experience before and losses are more likely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I understand the measure correctly it means that the national Exchequer accepts responsibility up to a limit of £30 million.  In his opening speech recommending the Bill the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that it is extremely unlikely that we <Col N="198" /> would ever be called upon to foot such a bill unless everything went wrong and went wrong at the same time.  The Minister does not propose to operate this insurance scheme himself directly. He proposes to operate it through the agency of an insurance company in the State, an insurance company, let me hasten to say, for which I have the height of respect and an insurance company which has been established here for a long time and is a solid insurance company&mdash;I want to make that clear. Apparently a policy with a limit of £30 million would be placed with this company but the company will never be called upon to pay anything because if any claims are made they would be paid by the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister in introducing this Bill gave us a little bit more information than he might have and for that he is to be thanked and congratulated. He was frank with the House and that is what one expects from Ministers of State although we are not always afforded the same degree of frankness. The Minister told us that he intended to appoint one insurance company as his exclusive agent in the issue of insurance policies and he said, later in his speech, that he intended eventually or in the long run or indeed, I suppose, immediately, that this scheme would be self-supporting and would not be run at any expense to the State.  That means to me that a premium will be charged which will cover the risk and presumably the operating charges involved. That suggests to me that we should operate this scheme in such a way that we will obtain the best terms possible. I venture to suggest that the best way of getting competitive terms, and the only way of getting the best terms, is by competition, by shopping around and by inviting tenders.</P>
    <P>We have in this country&mdash;and we should be grateful for it&mdash;a goodly number of reputable insurance companies. A number of them are owned exclusively by Irish nationals.  I think the State has an interest in some of them.  All of those to which I refer are based here and have branches throughout the State, giving good employment and a good service.  Therefore, it is unreasonable so far as the other insurance <Col N="199" /> companies in the State are concerned &mdash;and it is not in the best interests of the taxpayer&mdash;that we should be told by the Minister that he proposes to appoint this particular insurance company as his exclusive agent for the issue of this type of policy, on uncompetitive terms.  The reason he gives for this is that this is the only company which has been issuing policies covering commercial and political risks for some time.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that, if that is so, it is probably so because it has already been given a monopoly under the Acts which we are amending. If an urban council are buying a receipt book, or a quantity of receipt books, they are required to get tenders and, all others things being equal, they are required to give the order to the lowest tenderer.  If a local authority are building one public authority house, or a number of public authority houses, they must seek tenders.  Indeed, they must submit these tenders to the Minister for Local Government for approval. How often have we had these tenders thrown back at us on the grounds that they are too high, and not competitive?  We are asked to readvertise and to get better tenders, to get better value to save the money of the ratepayers and the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Here we were blandly told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce last evening that he proposes to give this £30 million insurance policy to one company without any competition.  I do not know what they will charge him, but they will charge him.  I confess that it is difficult to understand completely the workings of this scheme.  We are told in one of the earlier Acts that the Minister may make arrangements, but we do not know what the arrangements are.  I am taking it, until I am told to the contrary, that the procedure is that the insurance company concerned operates the scheme in the knowledge that it cannot be at any loss because it will be indemnified by the State to the tune of £30 million.</P>
    <P>On behalf of this party and on behalf of the ratepayers and taxpayers, I want to express my disappointment at this type of procedure.  There should <Col N="200" /> be competition and at least the other companies in the State should get an opportunity of quoting.  Indeed, there are precedents for going outside the State, not that I think that is desirable or to be encouraged.  In one field or other, the Government have gone outside this country and brought in experts for one purpose or another because they could not get them here, or they could not get what they wanted here, or they could not get them at the right price.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to labour this point any further but I want to say again that I have no axe to grind.  I have nothing against this insurance company. I am speaking solely on a matter of principle.  Some of my own business is with this insurance company.  I am against this in principle because I think it is out of line with what is required by the various Departments of State from the local authorities which are subject to their sanction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I must be completely honest and say that my knowledge of the insurance business is very limited indeed.  I have little or no practical knowledge of it.  Like most other people, I have a life policy on myself and members of my family, and an insurance policy on the house.  Apart from that I know little or nothing about the insurance business.  Any insurance implies that a risk is involved and, in accepting a risk, an insurance company naturally tries to balance the cost of the policy against the likelihood of the risk arising.</P>
      <P>The Minister said last night:</P>
      <P>The operation of the new scheme of export credit insurance has been entrusted by me to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd. which, for some time, had been the only company issuing policies covering commercial and political risks and which henceforth will act as my exclusive agent in the issue of export credit insurance policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to comment on that statement. As other Deputies have said, it is either a piece of supreme honesty on the part of the Minister and the Government, or a piece of supreme arrogance, to state bluntly that they are going to hand <Col N="201" /> over £30 million worth of business to one firm to the exclusion of all the other insurance companies operating in the State.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the Wicklow Harbour Board I have had some experience of this company.  Since the Minister has mentioned the name of the company it is fair for me to comment on the experience we in Wicklow had of this company.  If other people who have to do business with this company as a result of this Bill meet the same problems as we did, I do not know how the Minister will react.  If I tell him our experience it might have the effect of making him look twice at handing over all this business to this one company.</P>
    <P>On 11th December of last year the insurers of the Wicklow Harbour Board, the holders of the limited liability policy on the harbour, and they were the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, wrote to us stating:</P>
    <P>Dear Sirs,</P>
    <P>We have been considering the question of renewal in this case, and have decided that we should not invite renewal of the Policy.  However, in view of the short notice (the Policy was due for renewal on December 1st) we have decided to extend the Policy to December 31st at no additional premium to give you an opportunity of placing the risk elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We are attaching suitable Endorsement Slip noting the extension of cover.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Your faithfully,</P>
    <P Just="Right">S. MAHER.</P>
    <P>General Accident.</P>
    <P>When the letter was received, the Harbour Master got in touch with me and asked for advice as to what we should do about the matter.  This was a few days after a board meeting had been held and there would not have been another meeting for a month.  The letter came at an unsuitable time because it is often almost impossible to locate people around Christmastime when they have started on their rounds of parties and so on, particularly in the city of Dublin.  In any event, I came to town in the hope of seeing Mr. <Col N="202" /> Maher.  I did locate him but he refused point blank to comment on the letter other than to say that the decision was standing.  He also proffered the information that this situation was likely to arise in the case of the Galway Harbour Board.  I should mention here that during the past few years both the Wicklow and Galway authorities have experienced unfortunate accidents at their docks which resulted, in both places, in loss of life.</P>
    <P>When we were told by the Insurance Corporation that they did not intend to renew the policy, we were placed in a most difficult position because when one is turned down by any insurance company, he will find it difficult to persuade another company to take the risk of covering him.  In fact, it is almost impossible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>When I put it to Mr. Maher that perhaps he was seeking an increase in the premium and that this matter could be discussed, he still refused, on behalf of his company, to renew the policy with the result that we were left in the position in which, for two months, there was no public liability insurance on the harbour in Wicklow.  If any accident such as had occurred in 1969 had occurred during those two months, the harbour commissioners themselves would, I understand, have been liable.  We all act in a voluntary capacity on boards such as these.  People give of their free time and, in some cases, of their working time, to attend meetings of local authorities and other boards.  This action appeared to be very high-handed on the part of an insurance company dealing with a local authority or a public body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I bring this to the notice of the Minister because he is standing over all this business to an insurance company which, he claims, is the only company issuing cover for commercial and political risks.  If our case is to be an example, this is not so because during the past few weeks we have been able to arrange cover with the Irish National Insurance Company which, I believe, is an Irish company.  Therefore, I would <Col N="203" /> like the Minister to tell us whether this particular company have been approached in connection with this business or whether any company other than the Insurance Corporation of Ireland have been approached.  As I see it, it is a piece of supreme arrogance on the part of the Government and the Minister to hand over this business to this particular company.  In the past this kind of thing was cloaked up and, perhaps, only leaked out after action had been taken but in this case we have it in black and white.  It is only right that the Minister be put on his guard so far as this company are concerned.</P>
    <P>I hope that if this company get business of this kind handed to them on a plate, they will regard it as being incumbent on them to take the more risky type of business such as is involved in harbour and public liability policies.  While I was speaking to Mr. Maher he said &ldquo;You know, we are in this business to make money as is the case with any other business&rdquo;.  I appreciate this but, as I said at the beginning, insurance implies risk and one would imagine that, as Deputy Coughlan says, they must be prepared to accept the cream as well as the skim and not accept the cream only while leaving the skim to somebody else.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister would have exhausted all other sources before finding that this company were the only one that would accept this type of business.  If free enterprise is to flourish in this country in all other aspects of business and commercial life, it should flourish also in so far as insurance companies are concerned and, if possible, public business should be sought either on a contract or tender basis such as suggested by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I hope that before the Bill is enacted, we, in this party, will have put down one or two amendments. This part of the Minister's statement was the only one in which I found any ground for comment.  This type of Bill was introduced by the first inter-Party Government.  It was welcome then and we welcome it now.  We concur wholly with the changes that are to be made, for instance, the raising <Col N="204" /> of the limit from £10 million to £30 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Overall, I agree with the principle of this measure.  I am convinced that it is absolutely necessary. We all know that people who engage in business and particularly those who have accounts with firms outside the country, are usually a little anxious about the creditworthiness of these firms at home.  Because I have had personal experience of the export business during a number of years, I appreciate fully the worries and anxieties that people have.  It has been my experience that most of the risks relate to firms inside this country, particularly in this city, rather than to firms outside the country.</P>
      <P>However, I consider this measure to be necessary.  I recall a situation during the last war when, through circumstances beyond our control, it was necessary for the Government and the Department to establish agencies which dealt directly with the British Government. This was done because of the emergency conditions which prevailed at the time.  I know from personal experience that those engaged in the export of eggs and poultry from this country had no worry about accounts because Eggsports Éireann, Limited, had this State guarantee and the exporter knew that his money was absolutely safe.  Indeed, one effect was the creation of very keen competition because, when one knows one is absolutely sure of getting one's money, one is in a position to write off charges to cover certain risks one might have to carry.  As I said, the result was the creation of very keen competition simply because exporters knew their money was safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, credit was available.  One could go to one's bank for short-term or long-term credit.  One could submit statements, though usually bank managers knew all about these activities and were quite prepared to advance any credit needed.  Credit was very readily available.  They knew the risk was very slight and bank managers were quite generous about credit to those who deserved it.  I availed of this credit for short periods myself.  It was <Col N="205" /> very convenient and I never had any worry.  If one's account was in the red one could arrange payment direct and one did not have to worry about lodgments. I should like to make the point here that exporters should know that they would be fully guaranteed against any risks that might arise.</P>
    <P>With regard to insurance coverage, it is a strange thing that we all seem to believe that insurance companies are always making millions.  Perhaps we get a little bamboozled with the £20 million and the £30 million that we see advertised as assets.  Not being accustomed to dealing in millions we come to the conclusion that these people are making money night, noon and morning. But that is not always the case. Insurance, like banking, must be run on a proper commercial basis.  If it is not it will run into financial difficulty. That has happened in England; a certain insurance company is in financial difficulty there.  One can easily go into the red in insurance.  Some insurance companies specialise.  Some have a big line in life assurance.  Indeed, most companies seem to be very keen on life assurance.  They send agents all over the country canvassing for business.</P>
    <P>There are risks, such as Deputy Kavanagh mentioned, on which the Irish Insurance Corporation does not seem to be very keen.  As the agent quoted by Deputy Kavanagh said, they are in the business for what they can make out of it.  They are people of experience and they know where the risks lie.  They are not slow to pull out if there is danger.  One has only to try to insure a boy or girl of 18 or 20 years of age for the purpose of driving a car to discover how difficult it is to get cover.  Insurance companies are well aware of the high accident rate in this particular age group.</P>
    <P>I am not to be taken as defending insurance companies generally.  They are well able to look after themselves. I cannot understand why the Insurance Corporation of Ireland was selected in this case.  I do not think the Minister has been quite frank about this.  I agree with Deputy Tully that there should be a greater element of competition. We would all feel happier if we thought <Col N="206" /> that other companies had had an opportunity of quoting.  After all, £30 million is a sizeable sum and most people would assume they would get a good rate for this.  Probably these people will not know for a few years exactly what they will have.  They do not know whether or not it will be profitable.  It is impossible to forecast at this stage.  If there was a slump across the water and a number of companies suddenly went bankrupt the amount of money that would have to be paid out in compensation would be very great and it is at that point that the insurance company would have to remind the Minister for Finance that they would need to take another look at the rates payable.  Ultimately they may have to come back and charge more.  It would be healthier, I agree, if we had more open and freer competition. Perhaps the Minister, shopping around, discovered there were not many people interested in this kind of business.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by saying I welcome the measure.  I would appreciate it if the Minister when replying would deal with some of the points raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to this debate on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is at present engaged in Seanad Éireann.  The three main points made during the course of the debate are: First, the insurance practice of averaging has been attacked.  Deputies have urged that a provision should be included in the Bill to prevent the application of this doctrine of averaging to export credit insurance.  Second, concern has been expressed and objection has been raised to the selection of one company to act as the Minister's exclusive agent to operate the scheme of export credit insurance.  Third, Deputies want to know why, if we have to have one company, it should be the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to deal briefly with those points as follows: On the question of averaging the position is, when an exporter takes out export credit insurance, he pays his premium on the basis of his estimated export turnover for the 12 months ahead.  At the end of the year he furnishes a return of his actual export turnover.  If this is less than the <Col N="207" /> estimate he receives credit for the excess premium paid and if his export turnover is greater than he had estimated he pays an extra premium on the difference.  There is no question of average, or an averaged clause, in export credit insurance.  If a claim arises the liability of the company will not be affected by any difference between the export turnover estimated by the exporter and his actual export turnover.  Claims arising under these policies can arise only in relation to specific transactions covering goods sold or agreed to be sold to foreign buyers.  In any such case the value of the goods is the price at which the exporter can show he has contracted to sell them.  No dispute should therefore arise between the insurance company and the exporter as to the price of the goods.</P>
    <P>There is considerable misapprehension on the selection of one company. The Bill does not purport to prevent any insurance company from engaging in this business.  There is no provision in the Bill which even faintly suggests that.  The difficulty has arisen in regard to the Minister's statement, which may have been misinterpreted.  It seems to be thought that a monopoly is being given to one company.  This cannot be said if in fact any company may engage in the business.</P>
    <P>The position is that this is a State scheme and the Insurance Corporation of Ireland will act as the Minister's agent and any other company is free to engage in this business.  It is unlikely that they will engage in it because as I will show in a moment it is not very attractive and it is unlikely they could compete with the terms of what is an effective State scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that. I want to make it quite clear that there is no question of precluding any other company from engaging in this business. What is involved is the appointment <Col N="208" /> of one company as the exclusive agent of the Minister for the purpose of administering a State scheme.  One of the basic misconceptions here is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy allow me to proceed and if at the end he is unhappy I shall endeavour to answer any question he has?</P>
      <P>The amount of export credit insurance business available in this country is quite limited.  It is estimated that up to now the aggregate premium income derived from the Minister's scheme of political risks in insurance together with the sale of commercial risks insurance by two insurance companies in all amounted to no more than £40,000 per annum.  Even if there is a considerable increase in business as a result of the introduction of the new scheme the total premium income would not be sufficient to enable a worthwhile insurance scheme to be operated with reasonable benefits to exports and competitive premium rates if the business could not be concentrated in one organisation.</P>
      <P>The second reason for entrusting the scheme to one company is that it was considered desirable by the working group to which the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred that the new scheme should be in the hands of one responsible body which would launch an active selling and information campaign about export credit insurance. Some Deputies may be under the impression that almost all exporters would find it necessary to take out export credit insurance and therefore the volume of business would be very great.  However, as I have indicated the facts are otherwise.  If this were correct the scheme would be much more attractive from the point of view of exporters than in fact it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We expect that the suggested limit of £30 million on the Minister's liability will be sufficient to last for at least three years.  This figure can be set against total exports for 1970 of £468 million.  Experience in other countries shows that the volume of exports insured varies from as little as 5 per cent to a maximum of 35 per cent.  That <Col N="209" /> maximum is attained only in Britain. So far as we know no other country insures anything like this proportion of its exports.</P>
    <P>Under this scheme premium scales will be fixed by the Minister and not by the insurance company.  The Minister's aim is that these premiums should be reasonably competitive with what other countries charge.  When the premiums are collected they will not be the property of the insurance company; they will be remitted to the Minister less an agreed commission.</P>

The level of commission being received by the company will be reviewed annually in the light of the actual experience of the costs of administration.  I have here specimen copies of export credit insurance standard shipments policies and standard contracts policies which are issued by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  They refer to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, &ldquo;as agent for and on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce here-inafter called the `company' &rdquo;.

      <P>The final decision in all matters relating to the scheme will rest with the Minister and not with the company.  It is not however intended that the Minister will interfere in the day-to-day operations but <Col N="210" /> arrangements have been made to have the working of the scheme reviewed at frequent intervals, probably quarterly in the beginning and later at six-monthly intervals, so that any difficulties can be identified and dealt with.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have also been made for consultation with representatives of exporters about the operation of the scheme so that any problems arising for exporters can be brought to light. This consultation will be carried out by the Department of Industry and Commerce who will remain very closely in touch with the operation of the whole scheme.</P>
      <P>I have personal knowledge about why the Insurance Corporation of Ireland was selected because what I am talking about now occurred when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce. The background to this is of course that competitors of our exporters have better facilities available to them.  The whole object is to give our exporters a chance to compete on reasonably level terms with their competitors. When the introduction of the scheme was planned there were two Irish-owned and controlled insurance companies both of which were engaged in export credit insurance or had experience of it.  On general principle I prefer not to mention the names of companies unless it is necessary.  One of the companies was the Insurance Corporation of Ireland and there was also another company.</P>
      <P>In addition to the two Irish-owned and controlled companies, there were two other companies known to have engaged in the business but they are no longer Irish-owned and controlled. We considered it desirable that a State scheme should be entrusted to an Irish-owned and controlled company and I think that, on reflection, Deputies would agree that this is as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two Irish companies were approached. The company other than the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, after some discussion, indicated that they would not be prepared to handle this scheme.  I think that, in itself, indicates that there are no vast profits to be made, even if there are no great <Col N="211" /> risks involved.  In fact, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will ensure that there are no vast profits made out of it.  The Insurance Corporation of Ireland were prepared to handle this scheme and they were chosen.</P>
    <P>The Insurance Corporation of Ireland are by far the most experienced company in this field.  They have been engaged in export credit insurance for 15 years continuously and they do the bulk of the business done in this country.  This is a field in which experience and technical knowledge on the part of the underwriters is of great importance.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to get involved in the case referred to by Deputy Kavanagh. I would point out to him that he was talking about insurance other than export credit insurance.  I think he was talking about&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone can have difficulties with his insurance company and the fault may not always be on the side of the insurance company in any particular case.  As far as I am concerned, the Insurance Corporation of Ireland have the technical know-how in this field.  The company are most reputable and have a high standing both here and abroad.  They have been carrying this export credit insurance, profitably, presumably, on their own account in relation to commercial risks.  They will no longer be able to do this because they are operating this scheme and they will be confined to acting as agents of the Minister for an agreed commission.</P>
      <P>I think when Deputies realise what the actual position has been and the choice open to the Minister, they will agree that there was no alternative for him.  There were two Irish companies operating in this field: both were offered the business; one declined and the other accepted.  It is as simple as that.  I hope that the House, on knowing the facts, will agree that it was the only way the Minister could administer the scheme.</P>

      <P>That it is expedient to authorise such payments out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present session to establish a body to be known as An tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas, to define its powers and duties and to provide for related matters.</P>

    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 2, line 12, after &ldquo;such member&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and for the full duration of his period of membership&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the academic members so described will be genuine academic members, by which I mean people who not only at the time of their appointment but throughout their period of service on this body are live academics currently engaging in academic activities.  Without this amendment there could be the danger that academics <Col N="213" /> would be appointed towards the end of their working life in universities or colleges of higher technology, or indeed any institutions eventually included.  They would be members of this body for a period of time which might run into their period of retirement and this could be undesirable.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 4 (2) of the Schedule would enable such a person to be a member for five years, renewable for another five years.  If my interpretation is correct it might not be required that the person be an academic at the time of renewal, so long as he was an academic on appointment. This would mean that it would be possible for people to be members of the body when they were in their late seventies.  That body could, in fact, have a high preponderance of elderly people.</P>
    <P>This is no dream&mdash;or nightmare depending on one's viewpoint.  It may be seen if one looks at some academic bodies at the moment.  In the Senate of the National University of Ireland, to which body the Minister may be applying his attention shortly, the membership, if renewed for one year in accordance with recent legislation, will consist to an extent of 45 per cent of people aged 70 years and over. The fact that this is so indicates a tendency in bodies of this kind to appoint people towards the end of their careers, when they have reached positions of eminence.  The result may be that they are no longer in touch with university affairs.</P>
    <P>The Minister's intention is clearly to ensure adequate representation on this body of academics who are in touch with academic life.  It is not that they will represent particular interests but they will be people who are familiar with current problems of academic life and it is important that this intention should be fulfilled.  There should be no question of any significant number of these members being retired academics, thus creating the kind of situation which now faces the Senate of the National University of Ireland, which is causing intense dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>The position is that one of the colleges has five former members of the <Col N="214" /> staff on the Senate of the National University of Ireland.  They are all retired, although the President of the college is a member of the Senate.  We are seeking to avoid this kind of situation. This amendment is designed to ensure that academics are appointed at an age that they will not become retired in the ordinary way during their period of office or, alternatively, they would cease to be academic members of the body if they cease to hold an academic post.  This amendment is entirely in the spirit of the drafting of the Bill.  I should like at this point, though it may be more proper to the section, to welcome the fact that he has included this provision.  He will recall that the Commission on Higher Education for some curious reason recommended that in the equivalent body to the one now proposed there would not be any academic representation as such and the Minister's decision not to adopt this proposal but to provide for a significant body of academics on this authority is one which we welcome.  It is in the spirit of his decision to do that that I move this amendment in order to secure that the intentions behind his proposal are fulfilled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite possibly the Deputy overlooked section 10 of the Schedule when he was discussing this. It states that where a member of An tÚdarás attains the age of 70 years he shall thereupon cease to hold office.  I felt that quite possibly what the Deputy had in mind was that when a member was appointed as an academic, if he ceased to be an academic member during the course of this period he should resign.  I think the Deputy will agree that where a member is an academic when appointed and if he serves for some time and if at that stage he changes to some other position which does not permit him to regard himself as an academic any longer, he would, in the first place, have his academic experience and he would also have the experience and expertise he would have gained on An tÚdarás.  For that reason, a man of this calibre should be kept on the board until the end of that term but I would agree with the Deputy that he could not be <Col N="215" /> appointed subsequently for a further five years because at that stage you would create an imbalance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy FitzGerald's amendment. Leaving aside the question of the person who reaches an advanced age which as the Minister said is to some extent legislated for in the Schedule, I would also fear the situation of someone who had given token service in an academic teaching post which might subsequently cease to function.  The argument comes in then&mdash;in a sense that is in the later amendment; we have the next amendment by Deputy FitzGerald but there is no guarantee at this stage that amendment No. 2 will be passed; in fact it probably will not.  In addition to Deputy FitzGerald's fears, my fear would be that someone could be seconded to an element of teaching which qualified him to be described as the holder of an academic post under this Bill and then could give up his post and continue apparently to represent the academic world.  It is a bit loose here.  If we are to have academic domination by the Minister we should be quite clear as to who is an academic.</P>
      <P>Let me give an example to the Minister: a university administrator suddenly starts to give a course of seven lectures a year in quaternion studies or something like that and then ceases to give them the year after.  Would he be eligible for appointment as an academic member?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will see that the Minister would be concerned with the calibre of An tÚdarás and that when he appoints academic members he will ensure that they are, in fact, academic members.  Let me point out that the academic members like other members are not chosen on a representative basis but are chosen because of their individual experience. There is at least the safeguard that an academic member who ceases to be an academic at some stage of his first period as a member of An tÚdarás he cannot be appointed for the next five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point.  I had in fact overlooked the reference in section 10 of the Schedule.  When he mentioned it, I remembered seeing it earlier.  It does meet my point, although we are still in the position that in the case of somebody who retires from a university post to some other post or who has retired at the age of 65 and whose appointment is not renewed or, if retiring age in universities is lowered to 65 as has been proposed, somebody who retires at that age and who is no longer an academic&mdash;in all of these cases the person concerned would remain a member of the body.  I would be less worried about that on two conditions: one which the Minister is prepared to meet that the renewal of an academic member as such takes place only if he is at the time a live academic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my interpretation and it is the legal interpretation as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we could come back to that.  It could be clarified in the amendment to the Schedule, if the amendment is necessary and is put in and in the second amendment which we are not yet discussing, that the academics appointed should be full-time academics.  Then I would be reasonably happy to allow the situation where somebody would be allowed to complete his initial five year term of office even if he ceased to be an academic.  However, it would be helpful to know whether the Minister accepts that academic members should be full-time academics and that part-time appointments, including part-time medical appointments, would not qualify for this purpose.  I do not want to anticipate the next amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that Deputy Thornley does not support my amendment&mdash;and possibly the Minister does not either&mdash;should not prevent our discussing them together.  It does not mean we would have to vote on them together if a division arose.  I think Deputy Thornley is agreeable to that.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister's view on the question of whether he would be prepared to agree to this requirement that any academic should be full-time.  There is the possibility of people holding part-time posts in the university.  Sometimes they give only a couple of lectures.  I received a letter from Queen's appointing me a part-time lecturer, to my astonishment, when I had agreed to give a lecture some time this term or next term and I was honoured with this great appointment there.  Therefore I felt that such a person coming to give a lecture in UCD from Queen's or in the other direction should not on that account be entitled to be an academic member representing Irish universities on this body.</P>
      <P>Therefore in view of the very loose character of part-time appointments, that they can be confined to people giving only a couple of lectures, it is necessary to say that a person to be a genuine academic must be fully involved in the life of the university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment.  As I said in my reply on the Second Stage, it would tend to confine the choice and would exclude from academic membership many eminent academics who, as the Deputy has mentioned, are in medicine and law&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where, I am told, a high proportion of professors and lecturers are part-time.  There again you will accept that a Minister concerned about the composition of <Col N="218" /> An tÚdarás would ensure that only eminent persons would be appointed and he would not like to cut himself off from the right to choose certain people if they as individuals were the best people he could get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want to deprive the Minister of the right to appoint eminent persons but the Minister has ample room to appoint eminent non-academics in the ordinary members or the non-academic members. What I am concerned about is that he should not palm off somebody who has got a couple of lectures to give in the college, and who might not even be living in this country, as an academic member representing the academic community.</P>
      <P>Moreover, I am unconvinced, frankly, by his reference to eminent people, part-time professors or lecturers in medicine or law.  Their eminence in their own subject may be undoubted, and the university may be very fortunate to have their services for the courses of lectures they give, but it is a notable feature, especially of those who are engaged in the medical faculty, that their interests, to a remarkable degree, lie outside the university in many cases.  As one who has suffered through the controversies about the united or non-united medical schools for the past four years of the merger discussion, I would not be very happy, nor would many others, if the interests of the university were represented by some, at least, of the part-time medical people who have fought this hospital battle over the dead bodies, virtually, at this stage, of the academics in the university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is precisely because it is important that, if there is to be any representation in the loose sense of the word of, for example, academic medicine, it should be genuine academic medicine. The full-time professors and lecturers on medicine in the university are the kind of people who should be there, and not part-time hospital appointments who will fight out in An tÚdarás as they fought out in the universities the Mater versus Vincent's battle which so little concerns the rest of us ordinary non-medical mortals. It is because I fear that kind of representation, <Col N="219" /> either by people whose connection with the university is very slight indeed&mdash;just a couple of lectures &mdash;or people who, although they may be much more involved in the university, as many of these part-time medical appointments are, are, nevertheless, primarily orientated towards the hospitals rather than the university, being described as academic that I am concerned about this amendment.</P>
    <P>That such people should be on the body is entirely proper.  Their eminence in their own walk of life would suggest that, and that there should be people representing the viewpoint of the teaching hospitals as non-academic members may be quite proper, but I do not think some of us would be entirely happy with them having academic representation in medicine confined, as it might be, to such people.  I hope what I have said will not be misunderstood by any of my medical colleagues, but we are concerned here with the representation of academic institutions rather than hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister here.  I accept Deputy FitzGerald's first amendment but not his second one.  Already we are in danger of slipping into a slight dilemma here, that is, that both Deputy FitzGerald and I bring to this subject the advantage of academic experience, but we are in danger of bringing to it a little too closely particularised academic experience and of reaching a point where we will be talking to ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know what Deputy FitzGerald is getting at and I can see a difficulty here which I too, would like to get around; the difficulty of appointing people as academics who are not meaningfully academics.  He mentioned specifically legal and medical people but I would also think of those who might be primarily administrators and only secondarily exercising teaching functions. Frankly, I think Deputy FitzGerald is trying to put into statutory terms a degree of particularity which is just impossible to achieve.  How will the Minister determine what is and what is not a full-time academic?  He has excluded one obvious category of part-time <Col N="220" /> academic, to wit, Deputy FitzGerald and myself, in a subsequent section of the Bill.  To ask the Minister to adjudicate on what constitutes a part-time or a full-time academic in terms of a statue, is just splitting hairs a bit too far at this point, and I accept the Minister's argument on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>After that ministerial speech it is scarcely necessary for the Minister to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Hardly.  It struck me when Deputy FitzGerald was speaking about the troubles in relation to the medical schools that it is not only the part-time professors and lecturers who can fight very hard for their own spheres.  Deputy FitzGerald mentioned that these people could be appointed as non-academics but, if we were to add them to, say, seven full-time academics, that might tend to lay an undue emphasis on the university viewpoint on a body which will be responsible for the co-ordination and development of the whole system of higher education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;student member&rdquo; means a member of An tÚdarás, who at the time of his appointment as such a member, pursued a course or courses of study leading to a university degree or diploma or to a qualification of equivalent standard recognised by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these amendments tend to have the same effect.  Whether they are <Col N="221" /> adopted in Deputy FitzGerald's wording or Deputy Desmond's and mine really does not matter substantially.  As the Minister is well aware, representations have been made by the student bodies for inclusion upon this body, the Higher Education Authority.  In viewing those representations, I see two difficulties which the Minister mentioned on Second Reading.  One is that the HEA is not a representative body. In my opinion, with due deference to a subsequent amendment of Deputy FitzGerald's, and to the representations made by the Irish Federation of University Teachers, it is correctly not a representative body.</P>
    <P>A second difficulty I see is that the claim of the students for, as I recall it, six representatives is excessive and unrealistic.  I further recall that the Minister made the point that one of the difficulties in bringing student representation on to a body of this kind is that the degree of experience which would be requisite to allow a student to make a valuable contribution to the HEA would not be attained until he was near the conclusion of his academic career.  A problem would then arise as to how long he should be continued in this office after he had ceased to be a student in any meaningful sense.</P>
    <P>This is an argument which has some validity but surely, if this argument is valid, it applies equally to the composition of, say, governing bodies of universities in the same sense.  Yet this point of student representation has been conceded in respect of precisely those bodies.  I would regard six not merely as being too many but as introducing an element of massive representation which would be dangerous to the entire principle under which this authority is constructed.  I would be happy, and I would not stand too violently over the amendments, if the Minister used the powers which he has left to himself of adding further members to the HEA.  As I recall it, the complement of the HEA is not yet full. If the Minister were to give an assurance that he would use these powers to co-opt, say, the president of the Union of Students in Ireland, or one or two more student representatives, this would be adequate.  At this point, to give <Col N="222" /> statutory authority to a higher educational body which does not include students, is retrogressive.  It is only a matter of time until student representation is accepted in principle on this body as it has been on the actual university bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Before developing my own point on this amendment I should like to put a query to Deputy Thornley about his amendments. Amendment No. 3 defines a student member but amendment No. 38, if I understand it correctly, does not specifically define these people as student members.  I presume I am right in taking it that his intention is that the three members to be appointed on the recommendation of the National Council of the Union of Students in Ireland are to be as defined in amendment No. 3.  I am not entirely happy about this because it seems to me that his amendment No. 3 would require the people appointed to be students at the time of their appointment to this body.</P>
      <P>Personally, I visualise that for this body, as distinct from other bodies, within the colleges, the most appropriate kind of student member would not, in fact, be somebody who was a student at that time, and who might not have the necessary expertise or, indeed, the time to devote to the work of a body of this kind, but rather an officer, more likely of the Union of Students in Ireland who have full time staff, who, as I said on Second Stage debate, do excellent work and who could contribute, judging from the quality of the material that I have seen them produce, as well as and, perhaps, even better than academics who do not have full time staff to help them in this job; that is, staff associations as distinct from governing bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I put it to Deputy Thornley that while his amendment No. 38 would, by itself, meet my point &mdash;although I think that two members rather than three are sufficient&mdash;I wonder whether he is being somewhat restrictive in amendment No. 3 by excluding the very people who are likely to be most effective student representatives.  Perhaps he might consider <Col N="223" /> not pressing amendment No. 3 on that account.</P>
    <P>I shall not dwell at length on the substance of the issue.  I am clear that this is not a body on which large numbers of students are going to play an effective part and, as a consistent advocate of student representation at every level, I would say that at each level we must consider what is the most appropriate form.  In this instance, it seems to me, that a small representation of students rather than a large one is appropriate.  When it comes to the financing of universities, students have a contribution to make.  They should have a contribution to make to the whole question of how this financing should take place and its adequacy. These are matters in which student representatives will have a particular interest and whose expression, if accompanied by sufficient experience to give it weight, could add considerably to the work of this body.  Indeed, it may well be that the kind of student representation which I and others have advocated within the universities, while I favour it and believe it is at worst a useful safety valve, I recognise that in some cases it will not be much more than a safety valve and that the actual contributions students make within a university may not always be that great.  But the kind of student representation I am thinking of in connection with this body would probably be more consistent in the contribution it would make and its contribution is more needed in relation to matters such as financing of universities even than representation of students at certain levels within the universities themselves although I would advocate that too.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that he should give serious consideration to my amendment.  This amendment and the accompanying amendments are modest in that they would involve two student representatives on a body of 14 to 18 people.  That is not an excessive weight of representation and I believe it would be useful.  The kind of experience and knowledge that they can bring would be enlightening on this body.  I would ask the Minister to consider the amendment as one <Col N="224" /> which is not unduly ambitious and which could be helpful particularly as I have made it clear that the representation could come from one of these student representative bodies and not necessarily be confined to people who are themselves students.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, perhaps I could answer Deputy FitzGerald by expressing a preference for my own amendment rather than his.  Could I suggest to Deputy FitzGerald that he is being a little inconsistent here&mdash;an academic is to be an academic and an academic is to be a full time academic for every minute that he is on the higher education authority.  A student can be a full-time officer of a student organisation even if he is not himself a student.  I do not see the consistency between these two view points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, in reply to the Second Stage debate, it is my opinion that the demand for student representation on this body is based on a misconception.  An tÚdarás is not part of the university or of a higher education institution.  It is a separate organisation which was set up for the specific purpose of giving independent advice to the Minister.  The amendments and, in particular Deputy FitzGerald's amendment, would lead to the appointment of members who are committed to act as representatives of the student body.  As I explained earlier, it is not intended that they should be a representative body in that sense.  It is my belief that, in practice, no student would be likely to remain in office for more than two years so that he would not be likely to become fully effective as a member.  To be quite frank, it is my opinion that such appointments would simply be empty gestures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stated already that I am particularly anxious that students play their role in the development and operation of our educational system.  It is for that reason that I do not consider I should accept this amendment. Appointment of students to a membership of a body to which, realistically, they cannot be regarded as qualified to make a useful contribution, would tend <Col N="225" /> to discredit the concept of student involvement in the conduct of higher education institutions.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that I am in favour of students having a role in the development of higher education. Indeed, I was the first Minister to appoint a member to a governing body and since then I have appointed students to various governing bodies.  It is because I am concerned with ensuring that the role of students in higher education will be seen to be a real one that I do not think I should accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>In so far as students are concerned they could and should have a place on the advisory committees which will be set up by the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My trouble with the Minister's remarks is that he did not show much signs of relating them to what I had said but, rather, that he related them to a different case that might have been made.  The only part of his remarks that related to the kind of representation I was talking about was the suggestion that the type of representation I was proposing would be such that the people concerned would consider themselves under an obligation to report back to their members.  I do not see why that should be so.  If the Minister would choose&mdash;my amendment leaves it open to him to choose &mdash;as student representation, one or two persons who were full-time officers of a national student organisation, I do not believe that such people would be under any obligation to report back any more than the academic members who would come from a particular institution, being members of the staff of such institution, would consider themselves to be under any obligation to report back.  Nothing that I have said suggested they would have to report back.  On the contrary, I would hope that they would consider themselves not to be under any such obligation.</P>

    <P>The remainder of the Minister's remarks related to the idea of appointing current students and, while I have left this open in case the Minister should <Col N="226" /> consider that some such person was qualified for this body.  I visualise that any members would, in practice, be more likely to be full-time officers of one of the bodies I mentioned.  Because of the work that is done in regard to research and so on by the Union of Students in Ireland&mdash;I do not speak about their conferences which are often tempestuous rather than informative&mdash;and which work bears the mark of experience it is my opinion that it would be proper to have people representing these bodies &mdash;people who are doing this kind of work, work which nobody else is doing at the present time and which is particularly suited to this body.</P>
    <P>To exclude them, as is implicit in the Minister's rejection of the amendment, seems to me to be a pity.  I wonder if the Minister would not consider the point I am making rather than object to a proposal I am not making.  If the Minister wishes to eliminate even the possibility of his appointing someone who is currently a student and to confine it to the officers of these bodies I would not be unduly concerned, but I merely put both alternatives in to leave the Minister freer in the matter.  What we want to ensure is that it is a person who has experience and who has shown he has the experience and is able to do a good job in this sphere.</P>

      <P>As I said, I am mainly concerned with ensuring that where students are appointed they will be able to show they have an effective role on the body to which they are appointed.  As consumers they are entitled to be on the governing bodies of the universities and, in fact, when the omnibus legislation in relation to universities comes before the House, I propose to concern myself with this particular aspect.  In spite of what Deputy FitzGerald says I have not the slightest doubt that in practice, whatever we may say about the theory of it, the student members would have to report back to their respective bodies and in that sense, therefore, they would be representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on the Second Stage, students are not ineligible for membership and it may be that at some future <Col N="227" /> date they may become members.  I have given this very weighty consideration. I have concerned myself with it and I think that the conclusions to which I have come, weighing everything in the balance, are the right ones.</P>

      <P>The Minister seemed to me to give a ray of light there when he said students were not ineligible for membership.  There are two points Deputy FitzGerald made.  First of all, in defence of students, may I say it is not students only who hold conferences which are tempestuous?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Registrar of Trinity College is on this body.  The Registrar of UCD is on it.  This does not mean that they go back and answer to their constituents.  The Minister is sticking on a very small point in an uncharacteristic way, as far as he is concerned, if I may pay him the compliment. He has sufficient flexibility&mdash; some think too much&mdash;to appoint people and surely he could have an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement to bring on an official of the students' union from time to time and, perhaps, terminate his appointment rather more rapidly than he would that of a senior academic member.  He has got this flexibility and it would take a very small assurance from the Minister that he would extend his last reference to the effect that students are not ineligible and utilise his powers under this Bill to bring on one, two or three students, whatever number he thinks best.  If I do not get that assurance I am afraid I shall have to stick on this.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot give that assurance now.  All I can say is that they are not ineligible.  I have considered this very carefully.  In the interests of the students themselves and their effectiveness on bodies, such as governing bodies, I believe I am adopting the right attitude here.  It will be <Col N="228" /> possible, as I said, for An tÚdarás to appoint students to committees where they can make an effective contribution. Let us see how that develops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may find that he is asked these questions when we reach the section.  However, at the moment we are discussing amendment No. 6.  The purpose of this amendment is to modify the procedure by which additional institutions are brought within the scope of the <Col N="233" /> Higher Education Authority's work and responsibilities.  The system proposed at the moment is that the Minister, having consulted with An tÚdarás, will designate by regulations institutions of higher education for the purpose of the Act.  The requirement to consult An tÚdarás is, no doubt, a good one but to our mind it is quite inadequate.  The matter of whether a body should come within the framework of this Bill is one in which we believe An tÚdarás, should have an important role.  We accept that the decision on this matter must rest with the Minister.</P>
      <P>An tÚdarás could not be in the position of automatically extending the financial liability of the Minister by having the sole power to designate bodies; we recognise and accept that the decision must be the Minister's; but the effect of the amendment would be to modify the procedure so that, while the Minister would have the deciding power, he would be unable to act unless he had a recommendation from An tÚdarás.  This would mean that the Minister would not be in a position to add to the responsibilities of An tÚdarás and to recognise as of university or institution of higher education status a body which An tÚdarás did not consider ought to come within the scope of their activities.</P>
      <P>In a matter of this kind it is important that the sole power to designate should not be left to the Minister, although the ultimate responsibility for doing so must be his.  The amendment is a logical one from that point of view and I hope the Minister will accept that by taking this amendment he will be giving to the various academic institutions an assurance that there would be no question of arbitrary action on his part to add to the list of bodies covered by this authority any body which it was not appropriate to deal with in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy FitzGerald, I would say that in practice what this amendment proposes would not work out satisfactorily.  An tÚdarás may not have any specific knowledge concerning an institution not already designated by the Minister but which would be receiving assistance from the State.  The Minister would have this knowledge and if he considers that an institution should be designated he can raise the matter with An tÚdarás.  I think this is a reasonable way in which this should be done.  An tÚdarás will have intimate knowledge of the institutions that come within its ambit at the moment and with others after they have been designated. However, before the bodies are designated An tÚdarás may not have the specific knowledge which is necessary. I consider the proper procedure is that the Minister, who will already be dealing with these institutions and will have this specific knowledge should be the person who should raise the matter with An tÚdarás.</P>

    <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper for some time and was not moved because other opportunities presented themselves in debates here to discuss and deal with the problems that unfortunately have been the subject of so much concern in the North of Ireland in the last 18 months or so, The reason for bringing forward the motion at this point is our concern for the serious turn of events, so serious for all sections of people in this country and so tragic for those who have lost <Col N="236" /> their lives or been injured in the conflict as well as for those who have suffered material loss of one sort or other.</P>
    <P>Some 18 months or so ago, after the events of August, 1969, the House discussed the situation that had developed and taken such a serious turn in the North of Ireland.  At that time the steps being taken to deal with the situation and provide remedies for some of the evils which existed offered some prospect of success and there was a general recognition by Deputies on all sides of the House that an opportunity should be given for the promised reforms to take effect.  Unfortunately, the trend of events and the manner in which the situation has deteriorated in the intervening period, with a few brief exceptions, now warrants serious consideration by the House and the country.</P>
    <P>At this juncture it is obvious that first priority must be given to the restoration of peace in Northern Ireland and the achievement of justice and equality amongst all sections of the community there.  In order to achieve that objective, everything said and done in this part of the country must be directed towards that end.  For that reason I believe, just as much as any of my colleagues, that now is the time for Dáil Éireann clearly to express on behalf of the country the basic unity of purpose and outlook which I believe the majority of the people share here as to the aim and objective of securing not only the ultimate unity of the country but agreement on the necessary steps which can be regarded as making a constructive contribution to that ultimate objective.</P>
    <P>We believe no one has the right to play politics with the question of Partition or to seek personal advantage from that situation.  The aspirations of this country and the different shades of political opinion on unity are too well known to need assertion at this time. Nor is it necessary to get involved in legalistic or other descriptions in order to emphasise the aim and objective of unity for the country.</P>
    <P>What we must do&mdash;and this applies as much if not more to the Government than to any section of the community&mdash;is <Col N="237" /> to make clear our abhorrence of and opposition to the violence that is being used in the North and our determination to do all in our power to end that either by restricting or inhibiting the activities of those who encourage or are in any way associated with violence in the North.  We must be concerned, as Irish men and women, at the continuance of a situation in which ordinary people going about their everyday activities can be injured or killed by a bomb thrown or shots fired as part of a sectarian struggle or by the casual misuse of firearms.</P>
    <P>Our endeavour at the present time must be to bridge the gap between the two communities in the North of Irelanr which has become very wide in recent months and weeks.  We have repeatedly said&mdash;but it may be necessary to repeat it in order to ensure there is no confusion about the approach which we advocate&mdash;that we reject the idea of the use of force to compel one group of Irishmen to live with another group. We do not believe that any form of reunification can have a full meaning if it is achieved by the imposition on the people of the North of Ireland of a particular version of Irish nationality to which they cannot be expected to subscribe.</P>
    <P>Such reunification can take place only on the basis of the freely expressed wish of the people and any ultimate solution will have to recognise that the political, cultural and religious traditions of the Protestants of Northern Ireland must be given their full weight in the policies and institutions and set-up, if you like, of a 32-County Ireland and that, unless we are prepared to do that, we cannot expect those who have different traditions to believe that we are genuine and sincere in our efforts to understand their thinking, or to allay their fears.</P>
    <P>We have consistently and traditionally expressed that view and it is possibly appropriate to quote a short passage from a speech made almost 50 years ago by Michael Collins in which he said:</P>
    <P>Let us advance and use these liberties to make Ireland a shining <Col N="238" /> light in a dark world, to reconstruct our ancient civilization on modern lines, to avoid the errors, the miseries, the dangers, into which other nations, with their false civilizations, have fallen.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>Whatever form of free Government we had, it would be the Government of the Irish nation.  All the other elements, old Unionists, Home-Rulers, Devolutionists, would have to be allowed freedom and self-expression. The only way to build the nation solidly and Irish is to effect these elements in a friendly national way&mdash;by attraction, not by compulsion, making them feel themselves welcomed into the Irish nation in which they can join and become absorbed, as long ago the Geraldines and the de Burgos became absorbed.</P>

      <P>These sentiments, expressed with great clarity and simplicity, have always been followed by us as our approach to this problem. The events of the past 18 months have reinforced the conviction that the time has arrived when any form of double talk, or any form of approach that is not clear and definite, will undoubtedly mean for some the rejection of past attitudes and past approaches.</P>

      <P>It means approaching the problem in a realistic and practical fashion, accepting the situation as it exists, and trying to work from that towards an ultimate settlement that will enable all sections of the community to live in harmony and concord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately over the past 18 months, the efforts made to establish and introduce the reforms that were promised have been only partially successful. Unfortunately the reforms that have been introduced have been partial and some of them slow in their actual operation.  The promised undertaking to disarm the elements that had unauthorised or illegally held arms has been partial and one-sided.  We are fully aware of the difficulties involved under the terms of the Charter of the <Col N="239" /> United Nations and also the practical and other difficulties involved.  We recognise that the minority in Northern Ireland do not accept&mdash;and events justified their disbelief&mdash;the <i>bona fides</i> of the approach to disarmament. Unfortunately there has not been an impartial approach to this disarming by the British troops.</P>
    <P>We appreciate that the majority up there, the Unionists and those associated with them, would regard a force such as a United Nations force as unacceptable. We believe that while this is primarily a problem for Irish people in both parts of the country, the British Government cannot opt out of their responsibility.  There is an obligation on them too.  In other areas of the world in which British influence and military power existed, there have been examples of a more enlightened approach than that which has characterised their approach to the problem in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>While we recognise the difficulties in the introduction of a United Nations force, it is obvious that over the past 18 months or so the approach of the military has not been impartial, with the result that there is a lack of trust on the part of the minority. Because of the violence on the part of both sides there has been a recurrence of demands by the right wing of the Unionist Party, and those associated with it, for more drastic measures to deal with the problem, always on the assumption that the drastic measures would be used against the minority and not impartially.</P>
    <P>Therefore we want at this point to try to get some joint authority that will enforce equal treatment and ensure that not merely is equal treatment given but that it is incorporated in legislation to be operated in practice.  The reforms have been slow and incomplete.  We want to try to ensure by the introduction of reforms, fully implemented and completely operated, that the feelings of hostility will be discouraged.  We want to make it quite clear that, so far as this part of the country is concerned, we are prepared and have always been prepared to go more than half way.  Having said that, it is right <Col N="240" /> that we should rid the minds of the majority in the North of Ireland of the idea that paper changes or verbal concessions are of any real significance if they are not backed up by a full measure of equal treatment as has been made available here since the setting up of the State.  There is no real merit in and no demand for some of the Constitutional amendments that have been suggested.  The fact that they were written into the Constitution is a matter of regret.  As I said before, they were introduced at a particular time for party political purposes.  It is being suggested now that they should be removed from national political interests. It was a mistake to introduce them initially and it does not make a great deal of difference whether or not they are changed at the present time.</P>
    <P>Any suggestion that we should legislate for divorce is bad from a social point of view, not to mention the fact that it is unacceptable to all Christian denominations.  I say that as a Catholic and as a Christian and I believe the other Christian churches do not wish to have divorce introduced.  Therefore, we should not be considering the unimportant matters.  The important thing is to ensure that national policy, decided on here has the backing of every section of the community and of every political party, and that there is not this lingering suspicion that a minority or any sections of minority groups are saying one thing and practising another.</P>
    <P>We want the voices of the people of this country, as expressed in this Parliament, to be heard by every section of the community in the North of Ireland.  We want them to realise that any ambiguities in policy that may have existed here during the years are now ended.  We want them to realise &mdash;in so far as it is possible for them to realise it from the elected representatives who were elected as a result of an election in which this particular problem was not in any sense an issue but who, nevertheless, believe that they reflect the opinion of all sections of the people of this country&mdash;that the Irish people want a peaceful solution because a united Ireland that would come through the enforcement or the <Col N="241" /> subjugation of one section of the community by another is a unity not worth having.  That is a unity that the majority of the people in this part of the country do not wish for.  That must be clearly understood.  What we seek is that the minority in the North of Ireland will be treated with the same respect and have the same rights guaranteed to them as the minority in this part of the country have always enjoyed.</P>
    <P>Recently, as reported in the <i>Irish Times</i>, Major Chichester Clark said, when speaking of the minority in the North, that it was the policy of the Government that there should be no second-class citizens.  He said he accepted that this meant more than mere fairness; that it meant a chance to participate at every level of society and in every aspect of its institutions. That right has been guaranteed in practice here to every section and we want to ensure that the steps that will be implemented in the North of Ireland will, in practice, guarantee these rights fully to the minority there.</P>
    <P>In considering the different aspects of this problem, concerned and anxious as we are that no words or speeches or actions that may be indulged in either in a feeling of disappointment or anger at what has happened, should in any sense exacerbate the situation or worsen relations, we believe that the time has come when a determined effort at the highest diplomatic levels, with full support of the Government acting with the full authority of this Dáil, should be undertaken in order to get under way, either directly or under any other auspices, a joint authority to ensure that all sections of the community in the North of Ireland will have equal and fair treatment; that every possible step that can be taken will be taken to ensure that disarming of all sections who are not authorised to carry arms in the course of their duties, will be undertaken impartially. To that end, we must reinforce the suggestions that have been made to the effect that gun clubs or other groups who hold firearms licences should be examined carefully so as to ensure that no unauthorised guns find their way <Col N="242" /> into the hands of those who use them for political or other purposes.</P>
    <P>Of course, this is a problem that has bedevilled the position in the North, particularly in recent months.  The fact that the position has deteriorated in recent weeks has resulted in a strenuous reaction from the right wing of the Unionist Party or the extreme elements. In the circumstances, we believe that not merely is there a clear obligation on the Government to take the necessary initiatives with the Government in the North but that it is at this point that the British Government are involved also.  Undertakings were given publicly by the last Labour Government and by the present Conservative Government that the disarming of all sections would be undertaken impartially and fairly.  It is now obvious that this has not been done and this is a rebuke to their undertakings.  It is a rebuke to the Governments concerned that they have failed to match their undertakings by their deeds.</P>
    <P>That is possibly the biggest single dangerous factor in the present situation and it is because of that we believe that steps should be taken to initiate discussion at the very highest level recognising that while there are difficulties, there are also advantages in a situation in which the British Government do not want to be paraded before the world as being responsible in this age, an age in which they have shown in different parts of the world, not without considerable effort on the part of the peoples of the countries involved, in certain respects a more enlightened approach, an approach uncharacteristic of previous British Governments, in colonial or semi-colonial matters.  In a situation in which the glare of world opinion is directed on Britain through bodies such as the United Nations, the European union in the organisation of the EEC, and other European bodies, it is an embarrassment to the British Government and the British people to have this continuing festering problem at their own door.  It is one that reflects little credit on their statesmanship and little credit on their sense of justice and fairplay.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to suggest, as has been suggested from time to time, that <Col N="243" /> this is a matter for solution by Irishmen North and South.  We have, of course, a serious contribution to make and we have an obligation to deal with the problem directly, but they too have an inescapable responsibility to play a part, a part that will contribute towards a solution of the last remaining political question between ourselves and Britian.  We believe the time has come to make a real effort to establish some joint authority, under whatever auspices offer the best prospect of success in order to bridge the widening gap between the two sections in the North of Ireland.  We are concerned, as everyone in the country must be concerned, at the deterioration in the situation there in recent weeks.  The situation has deteriorated to such an extent that the use of the word &ldquo;anarchy&rdquo; to describe it is not too strong.</P>
    <P>This is a situation that involves everyone in this country because the repercussions and the reactions, social and economic, are bound to affect all of us.  Indeed the ordinary day-to-day existence of people in all parts of the country and their interests are put in jeopardy.  It is in those circumstances and because of our desire to bring to bear as much goodwill and statesmanship as possible on the situation that we decided to bring forward this motion to make it quite clear, without any doubt or ambiguity, without any inhibitions because of past attitudes, that whatever lingering suspicions may exist because of speeches made, phrases used or claims asserted, whether constitutional or in any other form, we seek the reunification of our country on the basis of the right of every section of our people to co-exist in harmony, guaranteed equality of treatment, fairness in appointment to public positions and in the implementation of legislation.</P>
    <P>We want to make it clear that this Dáil speaks on behalf of the people as a whole, that it will take whatever measures are necessary to ensure that whatever policy is decided upon by the Dáil will be effective, effective because it represents the view of the people of this country and represents that view irrespective of our own political attitudes on economic, social or other <Col N="244" /> questions.  We believe we could make a contribution towards allaying the suspicions which, rightly or wrongly, exist among certain sections, suspicions that have caused not merely the recent outbreaks of violence, bloodshed, loss of life and suffering, but suspicions that prevent people coming together in the realisation that nobody, with the possible exception of a dwindling number of people in Britain, are interested in this problem.  Its solution devolves on the Irish people themselves and, if we do not settle our own problems, no one else will settle them for us.  We must realise that other countries, other peoples and the world generally are more preoccupied with other matters, domestic, political and economic and, if we do not solve our own problems, or make a realistic attempt at solving them, we cannot get and will not get anybody else to solve them for us.</P>
    <P>Our approach has been consistent. It has never changed.  It has been clear and definite.  The fact that it is now more widely shared is some satisfaction to us.  No matter how difficult it was politically we never flinched from asserting what we believed was in the national interest and in the interests of every section of the people North and South.  The fact that our approach is now more widely shared may be a source of satisfaction or gratification to us, but the only real success any of us wants to see is the success of a policy that will bring peace to every section in this country and particularly peace to the North of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Is mór an onóir domsa cuidiú leis an tairiscint a mhol an Teachta Liam Mac Cosgair, Ceannaire Fhine Gael agus lucht an Fhreasúra sa Dáil.  Um an dtaca seo caoga bliain ó shoin&mdash;i 1920&mdash; reachtaíodh an tAcht a chuir tús le críchdheighilt na hÉireann le bunú Pharlaimint Stormont.  Is mithid dúinn, mar sin, breathnú ar an dul chun cinn atá déanta againn i rith an tréimhse sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of the use of force is not very far from the political mind of this country and has not been for the last 100 years or more and it does not come easily to some who have sat in this Dáil to admit that the measure of <Col N="245" /> freedom which we enjoy in this part of the country was achieved not alone by the use of physical force but by the coming together of people of that mentality with those who were constitutionalists and acted in a constitutional way.</P>
    <P>It gives me great pleasure to second the motion before the House and especially to draw attention to the fact that Dáil Éireann is asked formally to reject the use of force as an instrument to secure the unity of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Force is not confined to one or other section of the country.  In the founding documents, if one could call them that, of the two sections of this country, mention either explicit or implicit is made, and I quote:</P>
    <P>...all whose names are underwritten, men of Ulster, loyal subjects of H.M. King George V ...do hereby pledge ourselves in solemn covenant to stand by one another in defending for ourselves and our children our cherished position of equal citizenship in the United Kingdom and in using all means which may be found necessary to defeat the present conspiracy to set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland.</P>
    <P>One can see from that the implicit appeal to arms.  The second quotation is:</P>
    <P>We declare the right of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible.... We hereby proclaim the Irish Republic as a sovereign Independent State and we pledge our lives and the lives of our comrades-in-arms to the cause of its freedom, of its welfare, and of its exaltation among the nations.</P>
    <P>Why then is it opportune that this Dáil should at this time unequivocally renounce the use of force as a means of achieving what we all desire, the unity of the two parts of this country?  The simple answer is that we have moved fifty years on from those times.  Times have changed and what may have been useful and proper at a previous time no longer suits the exigencies of the political situation in this country.  It is <Col N="246" /> important that we in this Dáil, in formally rejecting the use of force, appeal particularly to those sections within the Twenty-six Counties who are still misguidedly calling upon the youth of this country and on others to bear arms in the cause of Irish unity.  It may take courage to do this but it is necessary that we do so and do so unequivocally.</P>
    <P>If there is trouble in certain parts of Belfast let us be honest enough to admit that some of the trouble may, in fact, be caused by groups who arrogate to themselves the right to arms to achieve political ends.  It is not going to be easy to change the mentality of that section of the Irish people who still appeal to arms.</P>
    <P>Is there anybody here who will not admit that the teaching of history which he received in his education in school was coloured, to put it mildly, to some extent by a romanticising of the physical force element in our history?  Even in such an innocuous fashion as the taunt to King James as he rode away from the Boyne; the taunt about O'Connell and his alleged cowardice at Clontarf in 1843; the lauding of the Fenian tradition.  I submit that in questions of social and agrarian reform in the last century there may have been some justification for resorting to arms.  In fact, there may have been some justification for it in the achievement of our freedom but we must now unequivocally send out a message from this House to all organs of opinion and all the people we can influence as Deputies to cease forthwith any one-sided, romanticised, glorification of physical force.</P>

      <P>I, perhaps, more than most Members of this Constituent Assembly, can appeal to my former colleagues in the teaching profession, that we, as a profession have something to be blamed for in our presentation of the facts.  I remember two or three years ago a colleague of mine felt it necessary to send his child, a teenage schoolgirl, back to her history teacher to point out that the facts of the history lesson, as presented to her, were not complete.  Lay teachers and religious teachers are <Col N="247" /> equally at fault in this regard.  It is about time we faced up to this matter.</P>
      <P>It may be said that some of the difficulties which this party has had to face is that it has never deviated from the democratic line it took in the early years of this State.  I would ask my fellow-teachers and colleagues to examine themselves to see if they, in fact, are in any way to blame for the perpetuation of this glorification, this idea that young people have that there is something romantic and something to be achieved by taking to arms.</P>
      <P>I do not hesitate in this House on behalf of this party to repudiate and condemn in the strongest possible terms the shooting and the killing which has taken place not only last week but over the previous months and years.  If we are honest with ourselves and examine our mentality honestly we can ask ourselves: Did we, in fact, experience a shudder of horror when we heard of these events?  Are there any citizens of this part of the country who felt that there was something good in these killings?  if so we must, as a Parliament, appeal to them to reexamine their attitude towards these affairs.</P>
      <P>August, 1969 was a watershed in the evolution of politics in this country because for the first time in many years we were faced with a concrete situation where decisions had to be made. It is not for me, with a limited experience in public life, to criticise those who are my seniors in this Parliament, but I suggest we take note of the fact that since 1968-69 a new type of politician has emerged in the North of Ireland, one who to me is worthy of the utmost praise.  I refer to the young men who have, perhaps, at some risk to themselves politically forgotten the old orthodoxies of nationalism and have come out in favour of civil rights, social and economic rights for all the people.  It is also opportune at this time that we appeal to our people to move away from the rigid orthodoxies of what I might call mystic republicanism which have dominated political life in this country to its detriment for so many years.</P>

      <P>Would it be too strong to say that we in this part of the country have not had a worthwhile policy in regard to the North of Ireland for the 50 years of the existence of this State?  I do not accept that pious statements of aspiration or talking about the inalienable rights of the people or the injustices perpetrated on this unfortunate country by the British are substitutes for worthwhile policies. In this regard, without making too much political play out of it, I would draw the attention of the public to the fact that in September, 1969, Fine Gael, with characteristic courage, produced a policy document, many of the provisions of which have been implemented or are in the process of being implemented. I quote from page 3 of that document:</P>
      <P>Towards these ends the Government should press the British Government to reconstitute the RUC as a civil unarmed police force, similar to the Garda Síochána, recruited from all groups in the community, and confined to normal police duties.</P>
      <P>We do not claim that it was solely our advocacy of that policy which achieved the disarming of the police. One is heartened by today's news that the Prime Minister of the North of Ireland is resisting calls for the rearming of the police.  It has been rightly said that guns will not protect policemen in the carrying out of their civil duties.</P>
      <P>In the quotation from the 1912 Covenant which I read out at a further point it states:</P>
      <P>The people in the North of Ireland refer to the following: being convinced in our consciences that Home Rule would be disastrous to the material well being of Ulster as well as the whole of Ireland, subversive of our civil and religious freedom, destructive of our citizenship...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this part of the country we must face the fact that there is a section of the population which would regard the reunification of the country as being bad from a material point of view.  If we are serious about seeking unity, is it <Col N="249" /> not appropriate that everyone in this part of the country should do everything possible to improve our economic and social situation so that if&mdash;and we do not concede it&mdash;our standards are not yet as high as those in the North of Ireland, with effort and a short passage of time we may attain a standard of living that would be attractive to the people in the North of Ireland, so that the taunt about depreciation or lowering of material standards will not carry the weight it did formerly.</P>
    <P>I must confess to a personal difficulty in regard to the references made in the media and throughout the country to the question of reform in the Constitution.  As the Leader of this party has rightly said, the much-maligned Free State Constitution introduced by Cumann na nGaedheal is now turning out to be a liberal Constitution and the 1937 Constitution is fraught with many alleged difficulties with regard to civil rights and so on.  I do not speak for the party on this but I personally am not able at this point to advocate the repeal of section 41 (3) and (2) about the absolute prohibition of divorce.  All I can say is that this was not in the Cumann na nGaedheal Constitution.  These provisions were put there in the 1930s, at a time when we were supposed to have a radical, progressive Government.  What price now that radical, progressive Government?</P>
    <P>With regard to the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, section 17) forbidding the sale and importation of contraceptives, again, personally I would have difficulty&mdash;as I am sure would others&mdash;in relation to the repeal of this type of legislation.  However, I speak only for myself on this.  It behoves everyone in this Parliament to respect the moral courage of those who advocate changes in these matters. Their moral courage should not be thrown back politically in their faces for the purpose of securing votes.  That is as far as I am personally able to go in relation to these matters at this time.</P>
    <P>What does the future hold for the unity of Ireland?  Obviously the extension of the 1937 Constitution to the whole of Ireland is not a foreseeable possibility.  In this connection, the <Col N="250" /> Article in it which claims sovereignty over the territory&mdash;even though suspended in its application at the moment and even though every nationalist would like to assert such a right&mdash;is undoubtedly by statement of the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland giving offence to that section.  If I remember correctly, the Constitution Committee suggested that it should be replaced by some pious wish that the Irish nation seek the reunification of its territory.  I must confess I do not see the necessity for such pious aspirations.  Matters put into the Constitution, such as Article 44, which had no legal bearing should not be put into the Constitution.  If we want to take out an Article, let us do so, but why substitute it with a meaningless phrase?</P>
    <P>Having been educated and brought up for a period in a part of the country which, if I am not too unkind, was clouded in a fog of obscurantist Republicanism in the '40s and '50s, I would put it to the Dáil that quite a number of people in the south and west and in other parts of the country do not really understand the Northern Ireland population or situation.  However, things are improving.  The filming of all the events that have taken place in the North and the propagation of the films to all parts of the country will do something at least to give everyone in this part of the country a knowledge of the real facts of the situation. No longer will there be justification for anyone to counsel action on false information.</P>
    <P>It is piteous that the youth of this country in the '40s, '50s and '60s were led astray by propagandists of the physical force mentality and that they went to their deaths in the North of Ireland in a futile effort to change the situation there.  I would point out that there were Deputies on the other side of the House who followed the funerals of some of these unfortunate men who were killed.  Their motive might have been one of Christian charity but one begs to suggest that it might not have been.  In such circumstances, Fine Gael could never be accused of doing anything which would lessen the authority of the existing Government in these matters.  I should like to draw the attention <Col N="251" /> of all, North and South, to this fact.</P>
    <P>People in the North of Ireland, as I read out in this quotation here, regarded people in the South as somewhat backward.  Historically this may have been so.  We realise this from reading of the differences between the system of tenancy and the holding of land in the South and in the North.  We have witnessed the gradual economic development in the North of Ireland, as distinct from the South.  We realise perhaps, why these ideals were in the minds of the people in the North of Ireland.  However, even if it was true some 50 years ago, this is no longer the case.  This part of the country is no longer backward and credit must be given to all Governments.  It should be characteristic of this Parliament that, in future, generosity in handing out compliments for achievement should be the order of the day, not the contrary as is sometimes heard here.  I should be very glad to congratulate those people of all parties, in all Governments, who have helped in the development of this part of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not want to continue for too long as I wish to give an opportunity to others to speak.  I will conclude with a quotation from a man who, if anyone could be said to be a friend of Ireland from an English point of view, was a friend of this country.  This is a quotation made nearly 80 years ago when the question of a limited freedom for this country was first adumbrated, or at least seriously so.  Maybe it is impolite to praise a British statesman in this House but I am not afraid to do so because his sentiments were right. He was referring to those in the Opposition of the day who were making it difficult for him to hand out a measure of freedom to this country. On a Second Reading of the Home Rule Bill, 1886, Gladstone, speaking to the House said, looking into the future</P>
    <P>As to the harvest of the future, I doubt if you have so much confidence&mdash;</P>
    <P>Referring to his opponents,</P>
    <P>&mdash;and I believe there is in the <Col N="252" /> breast of many a man who votes tonight against us a profound misgiving approaching to a deep conviction that the end will be as we foresee and not as you, that the ebbing tide is with you and the flowing tide is with us.  Ireland stands at your bar, expectant, hopeful, almost suppliant.  Her words are the words of truth and soberness. She asks a blessed oblivion of the past and in that oblivion her interest is even greater than yours.</P>
    <P>I would address those very same words to those who influence opinion not alone here but in the North of Ireland. Let us remember that blessed oblivion of the past and in that oblivion the interest of all sections of this nation will be the greater.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to try to define what I mean by &ldquo;full fundamental rights and full freedoms for everyone&rdquo;.  For us to talk about full fundamental rights and full freedoms for the people of the North without also and at the same time talking about those things for the people of the South would be an impertinence. We have the right to talk about what happens there precisely to the extent that we have the right to talk about what happens in the whole country.  I choose therefore to consider that the last sentence of this motion refers to the whole country.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Full fundamental rights and freedoms for everyone&rdquo; means not simply a series of negative things: freedom from want and the freedom from fear that we recall from a quarter of a century ago at the end of the war.  It means positive rights and positive freedoms. If you were to express those in the briefest possible terms you would say it was the right of every individual born to develop his or her potentialities to the limit of what lies in them.  However, in order to do that you must have a whole series of positive freedoms. For example, regardless of the income of the house into which you happen to be born, you must have the right to education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome, of course, progress that has been made in giving that right more widely in this part of the country in <Col N="253" /> recent years.  Everybody does, but it would be a mistake to pretend that the freedom of education exists in this part of the country now.  It will exist when we have university students going to university in precisely the same proportion as their different occupations and background exist in the country.  It will not exist until then.  If we are talking about freedoms and rights it is fair to say that availability of education, of State assistance for education, in this part of the country at this moment is not equal for Catholics and Protestants. There may be reasons for that but that is the case.</P>
    <P>Then there is freedom of health, protection from disease, protection from the economic disaster that comes from ill health.  Health is bought and sold here.  The progress that has been made here is welcome but let nobody pretend that access to every sort of medical treatment is equal here as long as medical care is bought and sold.</P>
    <P>A great freedom is that of knowing you can defend your rights before the courts of your country but that freedom exists for those with money to pay, with money to buy legal aid.  Our legal aid system is a rather trivial joke. Therefore the freedom of access to one's legal rights exists for the rich and not for the poor.  We have the right to point a finger at the gross and scandalous inequities in regard to housing that exists in the Six Counties.  However, here we may not differentiate on a religious basis; we differentiate often because the houses do not exist or if they do exist people do not have the money to pay for them.</P>
    <P>There are basic democratic rights, for instance, that every institution of the State, be it be the public service, be it the health service or the educational service, is open to be influenced and to be participated in by the people as a whole.  There is the basic right, in one case, of the worker in a factory, for example, participating in the management.  That basic right does not exist North or South.  It seems to me we have the right to talk about the lack of certain fundamental human liberties in the North if we recognise the lack of those in the South, if we recognise that we may not legislate for certain <Col N="254" /> areas which are properly the preserve of individual consciences.</P>
    <P>In this context let me make specific reference to the beam in our own eye. The great inadequacy in the situation in regard to contraception is a good example.  It is a good example because it is a matter of private conscience to be forced on no one who has the least reservation about its use, to be denied to no one who feels the right and the duty to avail of it.  We cannot seriously talk about uniting a country where one million-odd people will have an absolutely sincere conscientious feeling that they have a claim, without breaking the law, to that basic right.</P>
    <P>One might make a list of the basic liberties about which we try to legislate about which, in my view, we have no right to legislate.  When we face what exists here we shall have the right to look across the Border.  We have the right to express all the horror and sham and disgust that in us lie in regard to the differentiation against one part of the population on the basis of the religion they happen to possess. But let me give three examples from this House in the limited period of my membership of it which indicate that we have some putting in order to do.</P>
    <P>The greatest moment of shame I experienced since I came in here was hearing Deputy Billy Fox shouted down in his maiden speech.  A campaign had been mounted against him that he was a B Special.  It has been a sectarian campaign against him and when he produced evidence to refute it he was shouted down in this House in a sectarian way.  Over and over in this House I have heard the phrase &ldquo;non-Catholics&rdquo; used&mdash;a trivial phrase perhaps. I would be deeply offended to be called &ldquo;non-Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.  I belong to a party which has a name.  If a person belongs to the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church, the Methodist Church or any other recognised denomination I am saying something offensive towards him if I call him &ldquo;non-Catholic&rdquo;.  Our contact with them must be so limited if we do not know that.  How do we not know that it is a rude thing to say?</P>
    <P>The other day the Minister for Education referred to the &ldquo;Hierarchy&rdquo;.  The <Col N="255" /> first time he said it I said nothing because anybody can say it casually just once but weeks later he said the same thing, the &ldquo;Hierarchy&rdquo;.  Embedded in this was the feeling that this is the way you describe the Hierarchy of the majority Church.  You do that once by accident.  You do not do it repeatedly if you are really non-sectarian.  These are three examples of sectarian thinking in this House in my time.  My experience of life in the Republic is that every aspect of our thinking is permeated and invaded by these attitudes. It is like saying: &ldquo;Some of my best friends are Jews.  Some of my best friends are Protestants.  Am I not great to have Protestant friends?&rdquo; You claim benefit for it.  You offer it up.  We are aware of the differences and we think that it somehow proves our emancipation, being aware of them that we somehow transcend them.</P>
    <P>Until we get to the stage in our feelings, and not just in our public image, where these things are of no importance to us, we will not have got the deep feelings out of our own systems. We can say why they are there.  We can cite the past to justify them.  We also know that the great glory of Republicanism, back to Tone, is to replace the names of Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter with the common name of Irishmen.  We know that this is central to Irish Republicanism.  We know that the abhorrence of sectarianism is central to Republicanism, and yet we feel it.  It will take a long time to root that out but, if we try to root it out from all aspects of our national consciousness, we will be morally justified in pointing the finger of scorn and contempt at people north of the Border who do the same thing the other way around.  Of course we have the right to condemn it in part of the country.  Of course we have the right to condemn it in the North.  We also have the right, of course, to condemn it wherever it comes from.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about Irish unity since Irish unity is mentioned here and is in a sense what the motion is about.  I hope I do not misquote him but my recollection is that the Taoiseach said in an important speech that this is an <Col N="256" /> Irish question.  I do not see it that way, with respect, and I am not trying to score political points.  Ireland has suffered and gained by being close to a stronger and larger power.  Ireland was partitioned by Britain in an Act of the Westminster Parliament.  Ireland has suffered from British imperialism. The persistence of British imperialist power in Northern Ireland, in my view, is the political and economic motive for the fomenting of sectarian differences systematically by Unionists in the North of Ireland.  It is not just an Irish quarrel.  It is an Irish quarrel which is continually intruded into.  It was originated and fomented and rolled on and encouraged by British imperialism for what is, to me, a fairly easily identifiable purpose.</P>
    <P>It is not fashionable to talk about imperialism any more.  The last person, apart from myself, I heard doing it in this House was the man who was then Deputy Boland who is no longer a member of the House.  I disagree with him in many ways but I cannot accept that the problem is just an Irish problem. The centre of the problem is Westminster. Reunification of Ireland will not be possible except with the benevolence and encouragement of Westminster or against Westminster. We cannot depend on the neutrality of Westminster.</P>
    <P>The other strand in this motion is the question of force.  I will be referring to some people in the North later on, but let me say one thing now in illustration of what I will say about force in a moment.  I have been in the house of a man I am proud to know, whose courage I find extraordinarily inspiring, and whose recent speeches I find even more inspiring.  I am talking about Gerry Fitt in Belfast.  I have been in his house when his wife has picked up the telephone and an anonymous caller at the other end of the line has threatened her husband's life.  This is what people like Fitt live with, day in, day out, month in, month out.  One might almost say sadly, year in, year out. Gerry Fitt and Paddy Devlin have found the courage in recent times to denounce a certain sort of use of arms and force inside their own community. It is easy to do that from here.  It is <Col N="257" /> an extraordinarily noble action to do it from where they make their speeches.</P>
    <P>We have to make a distinction.  I do not know if I am being honest about it or about how I would respond in the circumstances.  I believe that in defence of my family in my own home I would use force if it were available to me.  I believe I would, and I certainly could not point the finger at anyone else who did just that.  I believe it would be the action of the vast majority of humans, on their own ground, under attack.  The distinction we have to make is the distinction between an entirely protective and defensive action which is, perhaps, worthy of being condemned but which, in honesty, I find it extremely difficult to condemn, and the offensive action on the other hand which is aimed at killing people who are citizens of the same country and who very often are also working people who are not then attacking one.  This action is very often the carrying on of a sectarian feud which culminates in the sort of horror we have to admit has occurred as, for example, after the accident at Ibrox Park where Rangers supporters died and Celtic supporters did not, and this was made the subject of widespread sectarian comment in Belfast by Irishmen, by citizens of this island&mdash;such a degree of shame as one would never hope to reach.</P>
    <P>We have this horrifying situation on which I do not propose to comment now, partly because of my membership of the Committee of Public Accounts, and partly because I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss these matters here in greater detail at another time when we are not discussing a motion of this sort.  We have the situation where a chain of command has been broken up in the North of Ireland and where, with connivance from this side of the Border, moneys have been used and arms procured, not in a protective or defensive way, but in a sectarian way, in a way that can only drive on the killings between religious groupings, and drive on the bitterness, and drive further away the day of national reconciliation and national reunification. It seems to me that people who do that have the most appalling crime on their hands in terms of national <Col N="258" /> honour, national unity and national reconciliation, and that it is a total travesty of the Republicanism which some of them profess, in my view absolutely falsely.</P>
    <P>We are not a party, and we never have been a party, of guns or of violence.  That is not the tradition of the Labour movement and it never has been.  We are very proud and very glad that we have not got a civil war tradition either way.  Perhaps that is one of the reasons why we are a little less bitter.  The point has to be made that there is a fountain-head of sectarian feeling in Northern Ireland, which is the determination of a Protestant ruling class to go on ruling. Therefore, they benefit from the divisions, from the weaknesses, from the hostilities, from the conflicts, between two sections of the working people. They have a vested interest in persistent sectarian disorder, and in the oppression of both sections, but the greater oppression of one section, the Catholic section.</P>
    <P>There is historical evidence of this going back well into the last century when the Orange card was the card to play.  Therefore particularly noble is the emergence in the North in the past year or so of people who have said in the face of the most appalling physical attacks with stones and bullets and pickaxe handles, and also the most appalling vilification, that the issues were issues of basic civil liberties and basic human rights and that it was as important to secure these for the Protestant working-man as it was for the Catholic working-man who approached the deprivation of civil liberties in a non-sectarian way, who approached the demands for the enrichment of life and for the granting of all liberties to all sectors without asking the question.  It is not that we want more for, or that we want a levelling for, Catholics but what is required in the North, as in the South, is more for everybody.  The question of religion in regard either to the granting or the withholding of civil rights is an irrelevance.  It is one that, although it has been forced in consistently during hundreds of years, from the point of view of my party and from the point of view of the Labour movement in general, has <Col N="259" /> always been declared to be irrelevant. We are proud of that.</P>
    <P>The other thing that must be put forward as a key to the sort of thinking that can bring unity is the concept of the multiplicity of Ireland.  Of course, there is a Celtic Ireland, undisturbed in its language and in its culture, stretching back for a long time, for almost longer than any other European nation. We are right to cherish this culture of which we are proud.  There is the Ireland of the Scottish settlers, there is the Ireland of English settlers, there is the Ireland of the Pale, the Ireland of the Norman times as well as the Celtic Ireland.</P>
    <P>The source of our richness, the source of the special things that make Irish people so proud to be Irish is not to belong to one or other traditions but to recognise and be proud of and love every tradition.  When we appreciate and love sufficiently every tradition, we will be unable to fight for the civil liberties of one or other just as we will be unable to refer to people as non-Catholics, as we will be unable in ways that indicate that, although we may put a non-sectarian veneer on our conversation, deep within us we are profoundly hostile towards other groups. It will be a long time before we reach that stage but it is the only sure key.</P>
    <P>It is the love of the diversity and the recognition of every strain of this nation that is required.  I agree with Deputy Richard Burke as to the need to teach this more deeply in our schools.  The multiplicity of Ireland and the love and recognition of all strands is the basis of the unity of people.  If we wish for a unity of people on the basis of love, it is obvious that force is irrelevant and is against ourselves in seeking national unity.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the only way we can bring about the unity we all seek with justice, with honour and with equality is, firstly, by the love of all these strands of the country and, secondly, in all parts of the country, by deepening all of the liberties for all of the people that I have tried to enumerate.  We are entitled to make the demands and to carry on the struggle in the Six Counties only to the extent that we make the demands in 32 counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this motion I, as a Deputy from the North, would ask the House to consider that, after 50 years of trial and error, we have matured politically enough to realise that, north of the Border, there are almost 1,000,000 Irishmen who, up to this time, have not been persuaded by the use of force that they have anything to gain by rejoining this part of Ireland.  I have spoken here on a number of occasions on this particular matter.  I have said that, irrespective of whether the present generation of public representatives of Irish people, Catholic or Protestant, Nationalists or Unionists, believe that Partition was right or wrong, no one has yet said what could have been the alternative to Partition.</P>
      <P>Personally, I had many misgivings as a young man as to whether Partition was right or wrong.  Possibly this was due to the type of education I received at school or it may have been due to the upbringing I got from my late father and his family.  Nevertheless, my views were strong in that this country should be united and that Partition was wrong.  That period in Irish history of August, 1969 will be long remembered but perhaps, that terrible week did some good because I believe that it forced a complacent Irish people&mdash;complacent in the political sense&mdash;to rethink and think clearly about the Irish problem.</P>
      <P>Deputies who, like myself, come from the northern part of the country, meet North of Ireland Unionists in their everyday life.  From conversations I have had with these Unionists I am satisfied that they have certain thoughts about a united Ireland.  A united Ireland would be acceptable to them in a certain manner but certainly not in the manner in which misguided Irish people, who proclaim to have pure Republican principles, projected their image to the Northern scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Partition may not have been right but no one has said what would have been the alternative.  Surely after 50 years, and in circumstances in which it has become as much a part of Irish history as has the Battle of the Boyne, as has the Plantation of Ulster or indeed the many other aspects of national and historic importance, we, <Col N="261" /> at this point of time, should realise that the Northern Ireland Parliament is there by some right or other, irrespective of whether we accept or reject that right.  When the Taoiseach says that this country will not be united except by the majority of the people north of the Border&mdash;let me say now that I support him completely in that statement&mdash;what he is telling us is that the majority of the people north of the Border will be given a democratic right to decide, if and when they wish to decide, to rejoin this part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>If this is to be achieved and if this Government, this Parliament, and the Irish people wish to make that abundantly clear to our brothers north of the Border, then I believe that the time is now ripe when we must endorse and adopt the motion before the House.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Higher Education Authority Bill, 1970: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In subsection (1), page 2, lines 21 and 22, to delete &ldquo;the Minister, after consultation with An tÚdarás, designates by regulations&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;on the recommendation of An tÚdarás the Minister designates by statutory order&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment in which I can support Deputy FitzGerald completely.  With the exception of the issue in regard to student representation, this is possibly one of the most important amendments tabled. We are dealing here with a Higher Education Authority appointed in the following manner : in the first instance the Minister appoints the chairman; in consultation with the chairman he appoints the Authority and, to put it in crude terms, he can hire or fire individual members of the Authority, pretty well as he will, it seems to me. In those circumstances I do not think the Minister has anything to fear in making statutory provision to the effect <Col N="262" /> that the recommendation of the Authority that a particular institution should be designated is a prerequisite for the Minister so designating the institution.</P>
      <P>Before reporting progress, Deputy Coughlan was making a point with reference to the proposed institution in Limerick, perhaps not a point of total obvious relevance within the terms of the Bill, but yet it was a point which raised an issue.  It is quite clear that the constituent colleges of the National University and Trinity College, Dublin will be designated as institutions falling within the meaning of this Bill.  The Minister has given an assurance that the Royal College of Surgeons will be similarly so designated, but this leaves us in the cloudy position that other institutions may or may not be designated as falling within the confines of the Higher Education Authority.  In this, I see two particular dangers, one an academic one and one a more directly political one.  The academic one is that the Minister might fail to designate a particular institution.  The more political one is that he may on his own initiative virtually designate some institution for some local political reason as being an institution of higher education when, in fact, in any meaningful academic terms it is not anything of the kind.  I make it quite clear I make no reflection upon the present Minister when I say this and make no reflection on the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on the Second Stage, higher education goes through cycles of fashion.  The current prevailing one is the technological fashion.  There is a serious danger here.  I have a slight suspicion that, in fact, Limerick might be falling into this danger.  I think there is a slight danger here that a community like Limerick in this instance might be reassured it was getting an institute of higher education because the Minister, in his wisdom, said that it was an institute of higher education.  This is too great a power to leave in the hands of any Minister, not specifically the present Minister.  I do not think that, by accepting this amendment, the Minister would seriously limit his powers.  There are other aspects of this Bill in which proposals have been made <Col N="263" /> to remove Ministerial initiative, which I would be the first to defend.  The Minister knows my attitude generally. I think the Minister would be making a very proper concession to a reasoned argument if he were to make it statutory that the recommendation was necessary first before he, by statutory order, designated an institution an institution of higher education within the meaning of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only repeat what I have already said in reply to Deputy FitzGerald.  That is, that An tÚdarás may not have any specific knowledge of institutions which did not fall within its ambit.  The Minister would have knowledge of these institutions because of the fact that he would be already dealing with them and they would be receiving financial assistance from the State and the Minister would, therefore, know whether or not an institution was one which was likely to be an institution which would be acceptable to An tÚdarás for designation.  For that reason I think the initiative must lie with the Minister.  The Minister would suggest to An tÚdarás what institution should be designated and, after consultation with them, would then make up his mind.  I do not think it could happen in a matter such as this that, for local political reasons, as suggested, a Minister would decide on some institution which obviously should not be designated, and I can imagine that, if he were to do that, there would be very strong opposition from An tÚdarás.  For that reason I believe that in any instance in which An tÚdarás, having examined the situation in relation to the institution suggested to them by the Minister, decided that this was not a suitable institution, I could not imagine the Minister going ahead and designating it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not contradicting himself here?  He says he could hardly go ahead if An tÚdarás dissented from his verdict.  If that is so, then why not make statutory provision to reassure people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>An tÚdarás would have special knowledge in relation to universities and in relation to institutions which were designated and were under their aegis, as it were, but in relation to other institutions, with which they would have no direct concern, they would not know whether or not these institutions should be designated or proposed for designation. On the other hand, the Minister, who would be dealing with these other institutions, who is at present dealing with them and giving them State financial aid, would have specific knowledge of these institutions and he would, therefore, be the one to say to An tÚdarás that a particular institution should be designated and, having discussed the matter with An tÚdarás, he could then make up his own mind.  If he were to attempt to do what the Deputy suggested might be done&mdash;designate an institution which quite obviously should not be designated&mdash;then the opposition of An tÚdarás would be such that he could not possibly go ahead with it.  For that reason, I could not imagine any Minister trying to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I hear the Minister correctly?  Is he suggesting there might be two categories of institutions, those with which the authority would already be traditionally dealing and those with which the Minister would be dealing and the authority would not yet be dealing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This will be the factual situation at the beginning. There are universities, for example, which are designated in the Bill itself and of which An tÚdarás would have specific knowledge.  Obviously, there would be other institutions about which the authority would not have any information at the moment, which might be institutions which should be designated by the Minister.  The Minister would have information about them because he would already be supplying them or making State assistance available to them.  He would have specific knowledge of them and he would, therefore, be in the best position to say to An tÚdarás that these were institutions which they <Col N="265" /> should consider for designation.  If, having consulted with them, they found these particular institutions to be acceptable, the Minister could designate them and if the Minister found there was considerable opposition for one reason or another he would have to reconsider the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the Minister's last remarks almost more alarming than the original statement in the Bill. One of the key aspects of the Higher Education Authority is that it is going to deal with the entire sphere of tertiary education.  Everything the Minister has said suggests that the initial function of the Higher Education Authority is going to be, broadly speaking, to identify the traditional areas of tertiary, in this instance one might honestly say academic, education and that additions to that will be put before the Higher Education Authority on the initiative of the Minister.  I cannot accept that either the Minister or the Department are necessarily better informed about the areas of higher teaching which should be added on to the already identifiable ones.  This is an area of political decision-making which worries me.  If I wanted to make a party political point I would now ask the Minister about the Ballymun technological complex. I see a whole dinner being made of this by politicians over the next ten years.</P>

It seems to me that the Minister's view is that the initiative in this matter would normally come from the Minister, because the Minister would so far as these existing institutions are concerned, have had continued contact with them through the giving of financial aid and the authority would not.  I can see a certain force in that argument although it does not meet the question of new institutions in respect of which the Minister would have no special knowledge and the genesis of which should properly come via the HEA and not the Minister.</P>
      <P>In so far as what the Minister has said is true, that is an argument against the wording of the amendment, but it is also an argument against the wording of the Bill.  What the Minister has been saying, and I noted his words very carefully, is that he might know more about it and, therefore, he is the person who would propose, but that the authority is the body whose view should determine the issue, and which would dispose, and that he would not ignore their view as expressed by them.  I agree that is a possible argument against the wording of the amendment which implies a movement in the opposite direction&mdash; An tÚdarás is the initiator and it passes to the Minister for a decision. It does not adequately explain the wording in the Bill, which far from giving the effective power of decision, as the Minister has implied, to An tÚdarás, gives it no more than the right of consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite prepared to admit that <Col N="267" /> to meet the Minister's point about the normal direction of the initiative my amendment would require redrafting. What I want to ask the Minister now is if I do withdraw my amendment, with a view to putting down an amendment on the Report Stage, which meets his point with some validity about the direction of the initiative, will he be prepared to accept an amendment or draft an amendment himself which would modify the Bill as at present drafted, to ensure that if the authority does not approve of the proposal of the Minister, it cannot go forward? What worries us are the words, &ldquo;after consultation with&rdquo;.  This seems to us to be inadequate because it does not protect us against certain bodies being set up by the Minister as being institutes of higher education, when they may not be so.  If the Minister is prepared to consider that, I am quite prepared to withdraw my amendment and come back on the Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Our concern here is not without some foundation.  Over the last couple of years there has been a development both in the policy of the Minister's Department as enunciated by his predecessor and through the HEA itself in relation to teacher training, which has indicated an attitude of mind on the part of both the authority, in this instance as it is presently constituted, and the Minister, which I regard as unrealistic.  At the moment we are trying to create a single teaching profession and there is a hard-fought struggle over this particular issue to avoid a breakdown.</P>
    <P>The teacher training method which the Minister's predecessor was proposing, and the one which is proposed by the HEA, would involve a three year course in one of the existing teacher training institutions, which is apparently to be transformed almost overnight into a degree-giving body, and will be so elevated in status that it will be capable of giving in three years a degree which would have parity with a four-year qualification for a secondary teacher in university.  This seems to me to argue a failure on the part of the Minister and the <i>ad hoc</i> HEA to understand the radical changes that would <Col N="268" /> be needed in some at least of the existing teacher training colleges in order that they could reach equivalent status. This attitude of mind of the Minister's predecessor and the <i>ad hoc</i> HEA worries me a little.  While I admit that to give a deciding voice to the HEA in such a matter may not be an adequate safeguard in view of the attitude they themselves have shown in the very self-contradictory report they published on the subject, where they quote from a Council of Europe or an OECD recommendation, and then disregard it.  Nevertheless, our sensitivity on this issue is well-founded in view of the attitudes of mind displayed in relation to this particular matter.</P>
    <P>As there are grounds for concern and as the Minister's point is not against the purpose of our amendment but against the wording of it&mdash;he argues the initiative should come from the Minister but he accepts the authority's decision on the matter should be the determining one&mdash;would he, therefore, be prepared to bring forward an amendment on the Report Stage to meet the point we are making, which would leave the initiative to the Minister, but mean he could not proceed to a decision without the approval of the authority?</P>

      <P>I am not going to argue the pros and cons of the teacher training report at this stage.  While I have mentioned on a number of occasions here that it would be for the Minister because of his specific knowledge in relation to institutions to suggest to the HEA that they should consider a particular institution for designation, it does not preclude the HEA from coming forward with suggestions of their own.</P>

      <P>If that is the case, the procedure the Minister envisages is that either at the suggestion of the Minister or without the suggestion of the Minister, the HEA will express a view. and the Minister feels that view is one which should be binding on him.  If that view is a positive one the Minister must act by making an order or a regulation.  In what way is the amendment I have proposed inconsistent with that approach?</P>

      <P>That is the old story.  I have tried to explain to the Minister that there is legitimate concern lest under various pressures&mdash;sectional, local, financial or pressures to reorganise the teaching profession&mdash; the Minister might be disposed to force through the elevation in name, but not in reality, of a particular institution to the status of an institute of higher education.  Against this danger some protection is required.  In his reply earlier the Minister was most concerned to give us the assurance that he would not, of course, go against the view of the Authority.  If that is the position let us give statutory effect to it, as proposed in this amendment.  If the Minister will not accept this, I cannot accept that he was completely frank in his earlier assurances.</P>

      <P>In regard to section 1 (c) which refers to an institution which the Minister, after consultation with An tÚdarás, designates by regulations as an institution of higher education for the purposes of the Act, I would ask the Minister to consider very carefully the designation of training colleges.  I have particularly in mind the training colleges concerned with the training of teachers in the Montessori methods, and I would ask the Minister to consider their designation so that they may be able to get greater financial assistance to enable them to carry out their useful work in the sphere of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to clarify a point I was making.  The Minister said he was not going to discuss the teacher training colleges here, and he is quite right.  I made it clear that my illustration was not to say that teacher training colleges should not come under this Bill, but to say that an attitude of mind had been disclosed in relation to those colleges giving in three years a degree having parity with a four-year university degree.  An attitude of mind had been displayed which suggested that there could be an attitude of mind in respect of other institutions that could lead to their being pushed to be institutes of higher education when they did not qualify.  It was an argument by analogy&mdash;I did not wish to press the Minister into arguing about teacher training colleges.  It appears to me that this could properly come within the framework of the Bill, but that is something for subsequent consideration and discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To revert to amendments Nos. 1 and 2, I would ask the Minister, in making appointments to An tÚdarás, to have regard to the considerations I put forward in proposing these amendments. I did not press the amendments; having heard the discussion it did not seem to me that the points were of <Col N="271" /> sufficient importance to press them to a division.  However, they are matters the Minister could consider.  It is important that the Minister would not choose people who would, during the course of their term of office, reach retirement and be out of touch&mdash;as retired people can&mdash;with the institutions of which they were members. The Minister should use his discretion in this matter with the utmost care. Having heard the arguments on this, I do not wish to exclude the possibility of any person, who is technically part-time, of ever being a member of the Authority.  I did not press the amendment because I could see that in many cases people who were technically part-time were much involved in the life of the college.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that the members be full-time academics in the fullest technical sense of the word and, where someone who is technically part-time is appointed, it should be ascertained that he is someone who is really involved in the life of the college.  A person who gives a few lectures and then disappears for the rest of the year should not be appointed in the guise of an academic member because this would cause a legitimate sense of grievance.</P>
    <P>In making the appointments the Minister should not exclude student representation.  He said it was not excluded in principle and that, if someone was suitably qualified, he would consider them.  In making the appointments the Minister should examine the qualifications and the contributions made, in particular by officers of the Union of Students in Ireland.  He might consider if somebody from that body could not reasonably be appointed on the merits of the contribution he might make&mdash;not as a representative reporting back, because that was not my suggestion.  In making such an appointment, the Minister could make it clear to the person being appointed that he was being appointed as a member of the body and not merely for the purpose of reporting back.  Although the Minister is not bound to appoint such people, the Minister might examine this proposal objectively.</P>
    <P>The Minister's earlier announcement <Col N="272" /> in connection with the Royal College of Surgeons may have been lost to some people because many were leaving the House after the division. The Minister announced that the Royal College of Surgeons will be designated by him after consultation by An tÚdarás.  I am sure that consultation will yield a positive reply, and even though the amendment was ruled out of order, I am glad that it elicited this assurance.  I shall be interested to hear from the Minister, in his reply, what thought he has given to other bodies and his attitude in relation to the designation of other bodies which might be brought within the ambit of the work of the Higher Education Authority.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy FitzGerald, I should like to state that the fact that I did not accept amendments does not mean that I will not concern myself with the points raised. Even when amendments are not accepted discussion on them is worthwhile. Although I did not consider that I should accept the amendments in question, nevertheless I will consider very carefully what was said by Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Thornley during the course of debate on the section. I might add that I put my case in relation to the students and I can only say that I did this after I had fully considered the matter objectively.  I have shown clearly that I am in favour of appointing students where I believe they have a contribution to make.  I do not believe in appointing students simply because they are students.  With regard to the Royal College of Surgeons, I took particular note of this and considered it carefully because it was named in an amendment.  Deputy Thornley took some exception to this and, I suppose, quite rightly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section that establishes the body.  I think it is legitimate just to make a reference here to what was said on the Second Stage.  The fact is that this Bill makes no provision to establish a council of Irish universities.  Now we did discuss that on the Second Stage and the Minister has decided against it.  I accept that there are some reasons against it, although I am not entirely persuaded by them.  I merely want to use the opportunity of this section to ask him whether he will be prepared to consider favourably the development of an <i>ad hoc</i> council of Irish universities. This body we are setting up here has emerged in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner by an action of the Minister, because the body is one whose functions are related to functions of Government.  The Minister's predecessor established this body and as a result of its operations for a couple of years <i>ad hoc</i> it became clear that the body was able to do a useful job and was able to formulate views on the methods which should be adopted to establish it statutorily.  It was an evolutionary process which has worked out very happily in the introduction of this Bill which, in spite of any faults I may see in it, is still a good Bill in principle.  I am wondering&mdash;and there is this feeling which exists in universities at present&mdash;that if universities went beyond the co-operation which has grown up between them, sometimes for negative motives, in the last couple of years, and formalised this co-operation into an <i>ad hoc</i> council of Irish universities, whether the Minister would welcome this kind of evolutionary development.  Of course as an <i>ad hoc</i> body it would have no statutory powers but it might facilitate some of the Minister's work if such a body existed and would help to establish what kind of powers and functions <Col N="275" /> should be given to a statutory council of Irish universities in due course if there was experience in the operation of such an <i>ad hoc</i> body established by the universities themselves.  I am not asking the Minister to set it up.  We are not talking of a body to advise the Minister but of a body which the universities might wish to establish themselves.</P>
      <P>I raise that matter because at a discussion last week-end amongst academics in a particular college when this Bill came up for discussion on that occasion, this suggestion was made and it was put to me that the opportunity of this debate should be taken to establish what the Minister's view and attitude would be to such a development. I took the liberty of opining that the Minister would not necessarily be hostile to such a development but it must be for the Minister himself to express his view on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose if they set up an <i>ad hoc</i> conference informally I could not stop them but the question of my lending my benediction to this action would be quite a different matter.  Without considering the future structure of universities it is doubtful if it would be feasible.  I would also have to concern myself with the problem of whether the setting up of that <i>ad hoc</i> conference could mean anticipating the future structure of higher education and I do not feel at this moment that I could place myself in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should have made my point clear.  It would not be my intention or anybody's intention that such an <i>ad hoc</i> body would attempt to prejudice future structure which is a matter obviously for consideration and debate eventually in this House.  I had not that in mind but I would have hoped, that having being clarified, for a slightly warmer welcome from the Minister for greater co-operation between universities, the lack of co-operation between whom has been the subject of legitimate comment from the Minister and his predecessors. There has been a development of co-operation and, as I have said, sometimes for negative reasons.  Occasionally <Col N="276" /> when you threaten people with change of some kind they begin to work together and that process has happened. In putting forward that suggestion I did think the Minister might have been induced, still might be induced, to welcome a development towards co-operation, of course so long as it did not prejudice the whole issue of the future structure of Irish university education.  That is a legitimate qualification. So I invite the Minister to amend his wording of a few minutes ago to a slightly more positive form if he feels he can do so.</P>

      <P>I have some sympathy with the Minister's difficulty here and this is one of the occasions where perhaps I am somewhat closer to the Minister than Deputy FitzGerald, because we have had a sort of hen and egg situation.  You start off by identifying the fractions in the structure and then you wonder whether you should reduce the structure and then determine the fractions.  I think Deputy FitzGerald is missing the point in that the Minister has the Authority first of all on the non-statutory basis and then established on a statutory basis.  With a non-representative body you can pick and choose, as it were.  Obviously a very different situation exists <i>vis-à-vis</i> the conference of Irish universities, for instance.  The first thing that is going to happen if you have a conference of Irish universities is that the Royal College of Surgeons will say: &ldquo;Why not us?&rdquo; and then you would have other organisations asking the same question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question I would like to address to the Minister directly covers a slightly different type of relationship. As I understand the original intention in respect of the Authority <i>vis-à-vis</i> the conference, the Authority is broadly responsible for the whole field of what we call tertiary education.  It has always seemed to me a somewhat unhappy <Col N="277" /> relationship that these two bodies which obviously have so much in common, particularly in fiscal terms, should be representative of different entities.  I wonder if the Minister would like to comment on that.  Does he think of the conference as not coming into existence at all?  Does he think of the conference as taking under its umbrella the same range of tertiary institutions as the Higher Education Authority?  If each covers different but in some cases coterminous areas, how do they work in any cohesion with each other?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that the Deputy has a point here.  At the moment nobody has decided what form the conference will take so I would feel that it is necessary that we should set up An tÚdarás and then, if we found that a conference was necessary or worthwhile, we would have to consider the position of the conference <i>vis-à-vis</i> An tÚdarás.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 35, after &ldquo;functions of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;assisting in&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment reflects a feeling in some university circles that the wording of the section, as drafted, gives to the Authority functions which are really those of the universities: &ldquo;Furthering the development of higher <Col N="278" /> education&rdquo; and &ldquo;promoting an appreciation of the value of higher education and research&rdquo; are at least arguably the functions of the universities.  The function of this body is, it can be argued and has been argued, to assist this process, to assist the universities to carry out these functions.  Logically, therefore, instead of being given these functions the Authority should be given the job of assisting.</P>
    <P>I admit that, if the Minister accepts this amendment inserting the words &ldquo;assisting in&rdquo;, the section will read: &ldquo;An tÚdarás shall, in addition to the specific functions given to it by this Act, have the general functions of assisting in furthering the development of higher education&rdquo; and some modification will be needed in paragraph (b) for the sake of tidiness.  We would want to delete the other &ldquo;assisting in &rdquo; and put in &ldquo;co-ordinating&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;in the co-ordination of&rdquo;.  That is a tidying-up matter we could deal with later on if the Minister were prepared to accept that this amendment would clarify the functions of An tÚdarás and avoid any confusion between it and the universities and their very separate functions.  I wonder could we have the Minister's reaction to this suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the words suggested here by Deputy FitzGerald, &ldquo;assisting in&rdquo;, already appear in paragraph (b), as the Deputy is aware, because An tÚdarás can only assist in the co-ordination of State investment in higher education.  It cannot be the sole co-ordinator or the only co-ordinator.</P>
      <P>The three functions set out here are general functions only.  The wording of the text does not mean that the furthering of the development of higher education, and the promoting of an appreciation of its value, become exclusive to An tÚdarás when the Bill is enacted. Perhaps that clarifies the position.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said that these two general functions were more the responsibility of the universities than the Higher Education Authority.  The point I am making is that they are the functions of the HEA but they are also the functions of the <Col N="279" /> universities.  They are not exclusive, in other words, to An tÚdarás.  I want to make that clear.</P>

      <P>If the Minister reflects on what he has said he will realise that he has succeeded in contradicting himself in the space of about five seconds because he justified the inclusion of the words &ldquo;assisting in the co-ordination of State investment&rdquo; on the grounds&mdash;and I quote because I wrote the words down as he said them&mdash;that An tÚdarás cannot be the only co-ordinator.  The Government has a role too.  Therefore, where An tÚdarás is not the only co-ordinator he feels that the words &ldquo;assisting in&rdquo; should be included.  He then argues that for that reason they should be omitted in respect of paragraphs (a) and (c).  The logic of this defeats me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but the point is that with regard to paragraph (b) it can only assist.  It cannot do anything else.  With regard to paragraphs (a) and (c) it can further the development of higher education, and it can promote an appreciation of it.</P>

      <P>I misunderstood the Minister then.  What does the Minister mean when he says it can only assist in the co-ordination of State investment?  It has two functions.  One is to submit to the State authorities what money is needed for higher education and the other is&mdash;and this we will be fighting out on section 12 on which the Minister has already given some ground&mdash; to co-ordinate that investment: how the lump sum is to be distributed.  In fact, in this matter of co-ordination of State investment this body, if we understand what the Bill is about at all, and unless the Minister has something very different up his sleeve or in his mind, is the co-ordinating body. The State will not have a co-ordinating function.  It will have the function of deciding when the co-ordinated proposals are put before it, whether it will pay the bill or some part of it, but if it does not pay the whole bill then An tÚdarás will decide how to co-ordinate the requirements in the <Col N="280" /> light of the sum available.  The whole purpose is to transfer the co-ordinating function of the State to this body. Therefore, it alarms me to hear the Minister say that it will not be co-ordinating but only assisting.  The one thing I thought it was doing was the job of co-ordinating.</P>

      <P>Frankly I think Deputy FitzGerald is splitting hairs in a most ridiculous manner.  This amendment is the function of a certain kind of academic hyper-neurosis which develops from the type of siege mentality which has come upon the universities in the past three years.  The logic of what Deputy FitzGerald is saying seems to me to add up to the fact that it would be legitimate to add in &ldquo;assisting in&rdquo; to paragraph (a), &ldquo;assisting in the development of higher education&rdquo;, and it would be logical to add in &ldquo;assisting in&rdquo; to paragraph (c), &ldquo;assisting in promoting an appreciation of the value of higher education and research&rdquo; but, in order to strengthen the hand of the Authority <i>vis-à-vis</i> investment, the same phrase should be taken out of paragraph (b).</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quarrelling with it in paragraph (b).  The Minister interpreted the words there as suggesting that it did not have a co-ordinating role and I was worried a little about that.  I do not think the Minister is pressing that.  In fact, the co-ordination of State investment will be undertaken by this body but, in so far as the State investment which it is co-ordinating will be allocated by the State, words &ldquo;assisting in&rdquo; are fairly harmless.  I am not pressing the point. I am merely pointing out a certain lack of logic in the Minister's approach.</P>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister agree that the whole of these functions should be governed by &ldquo;assisting in&rdquo; because they are all things in which the universities themselves have a role.  In the co-ordination of State investment there is a co-ordinating role for the universities.  The Minister must not think that each department will submit its requirements straight up to the Higher Education Authority.  Of course, the co-ordination of the amount required will be carried out at faculty level, at the Governing Body level and up to the HEA.  All these different bodies will be playing different roles in the function of co-ordinating State investment.  This is true of any activity.</P>
      <P>When one says that this Authority never had the function of promoting an appreciation of the value of higher educational research, there is a clear implication by omitting the words &ldquo;assisting in &rdquo; that it alone and not the universities will have this function. I agree with Deputy Thornley in that I am, perhaps, reflecting a hypersensitivity on the part of academics but the point I was making was intended to, perhaps, clarify the Minister's thinking.</P>

      <Col N="282" /> Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 35 and 36, to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( )  promoting the democratisation of the structure of higher education.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wish to press this amendment briefly but forcibly.  When speaking on the Second Reading, the Minister said that all these statements in relation to specific functions and general functions are, to a degree, all embracing and, perhaps, one can say they are pious hopes of one kind or another.  The suggestion that you promote the democratisation of the structure of higher education is at least as meaningful as the statement that it should further the development of higher education.  If one is meaningless the other is meaningless. We all know that we function with the higher education structure which, in the case of every single institution of higher education ranging from, for example the College of Art, which is a problem so close to the Minister's heart, down to my own college, functions in a relatively undemocratic manner.</P>
      <P>Inside this suggested amendment, there is a whole history of exploitation &mdash;which is a fair enough word&mdash;of both the student and the staff bodies of the different colleges.  I have strong feelings about this.  It is fashionable to talk today about student representation. Nevertheless, Deputy FitzGerald and I spoke and voted in favour of it earlier today.  We did so quite sincerely but if the taxpaying community who pay for these institutions which are to be co-ordinated by this body, realise how enrusted by tradition are the government structures, they would have serious doubt about the manner in which their money was being administered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, the amendment in its present form, suggests immediately the inclusion of student representation.  I am being quite honest, and would go further than that in saying that <Col N="283" /> there is at least a ten year backlog of promoting the inclusion of junior staff involvement in these institutions before we even reach the student level. It would be invidious of me to talk about the structure of any particular college but it should be accepted generally that there is great frustration among university teachers, particularly in the junior grades, about the manner in which they are represented.  All institutions tend, after a period of time, to fossilise at the top.  The bodies which speak, with an apparently representative capacity, on behalf of university teachers in several institutions are bodies which, on close inspection, would not stand the scrutiny of anyone who was even addicted remotely to the concept of democratic representation.</P>
    <P>To some extent, I am offering this amendment to the Minister&mdash;in no sense as a criticism of his Bill&mdash;but as a criticism of the institutions themselves. I am asking the Minister to give to the Education Authority the impetus, at least by having it written above the door, as it were, that they should do this.  I will have occasion to make this point again in connection with the next amendment.  What I fear most about this Authority which is admirable in so many ways, is that it would fall into the academic syndrome of tending to think that efficient administration of the <i>status quo</i> with, perhaps, an incremental progression of .01 per year was an adequate academic goal.  It took many years for my own college, TCD, to democraticise its internal structures to the relatively high point at which it stands at the moment&mdash;many years during which many people suffered a great deal of frustration.  Academics, by their nature, and especially when they reach professorial standard, are conservative. They tend to think that the institutions which they helped to take over ten or 15 years previously must be crystallised in the form in which they developed them.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I ask the Minister why he should not put this into the Bill as an inducement to the members of this authority to look in the mirror from <Col N="284" /> time to time and to realise that the institutions from which they come are very often growing deficient in internal democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Thornley's amendment almost in stronger terms than he himself supports it.  If this amendment is not included in the Bill, I suspect that the Higher Education Authority might, on the one hand, consider itself inhibited in taking steps to try to secure more democratic structures for the colleges while on the other hand, they might consider themselves entitled to resist any approaches from the HEA on this subject. I fear that if some impetus is not applied externally, the process of democratisation of the structure of our university colleges will be frustratingly and dangerously slow.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that it is almost two years now since a very unusual situation was created in our college by the action of a particular group of students who at that time had a grievance that most of the students and many of the staff considered to be legitimate.  They secured the support of a large number of students thereby creating the situation in which, for a few days, the normal operations of the college were suspended. Much of what happened at that time was constructive and, indeed, in those days when normal routine was suspended, staff and students came together in an atmosphere and under conditions which facilitated a kind of communication that had never existed previously.  That was healthy.  However, what is depressing at the end of all that unique experience which many of us valued greatly as a human experience, is that two years later we are no further on.  So slow are the internal processes of a university that even staff themselves have not yet enunciated their views on what changes and structures they wish for, arising out of those and other events.  The governing authority of the college has not found occasion to apply its mind to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the pace at which these matters are dealt with within the colleges when there is no external stimulus.  If this slow pace is to continue, <Col N="285" /> it would be easy to foresee the re-creation, at some point, of a similar situation which might not end as happily.  In that particular case it was partly luck and partly hard work by a lot of people that converted a potentially dangerous situation into one which turned out to be a potentially constructive one.</P>
    <P>If we do nothing to secure a genuine democratisation of our university colleges, they will remain extraordinarily vulnerable to unrest of this kind because, as is the case in Irish universities, there are governing authorities which have great powers.  Where the governing authority may be, in certain matters, the President or Provost, there are great powers but these powers are constituted so undemocratically that they do not carry conviction with and do not have authority in the proper sense of the word over staff or students, authority that is supported and accepted naturally and easily by staff and students.</P>
    <P>Then you have a potentially dangerous situation.  In the constituent colleges of the NUI at the moment you have Governing Bodies on which the junior staff&mdash;by junior I do not mean junior assistants in their early twenties; I mean the vast bulk of the staff, including people of some years of age, myself amongst them&mdash;have no right to elect anybody and can secure representation only by standing for election by the graduates, depriving the graduates, in a sense, of the kind of representatiton they should have.  It is only through them the junior staff can secure representation.  Those who have representation on the Governing Body are, in fact, the senior staff of the college and they have a very minor representation.  The professors elect six out of 34 members.  The junior staff elect no one.  The students elect no one.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Governing Body in its membership in our college and in the other colleges is reasonably representative in that there are junior staff and students on these bodies is because it has proved possible to manipulate the electoral system in many ways.  The Minister has contributed to that.  Another student was co-opted by <Col N="286" /> the Governing Body itself.  Junior staff are elected by graduates.</P>
    <P>A system in which there is no right of representation is one that deprives the body in question of the kind of authority it should have.  Moreover, the Academic Councils are the disciplinary bodies.  They consist only of the professors. Not alone are they confined to the professors, who are a minority of the staff, but they may not set up any committee comprising anyone who is not a professor.  Committees can only be committees of members of the Academic Council.  It is illegal for anybody else to be on them and so, when it was proposed, and when there was a very considerable body of opinion amongst the staff that disciplinary matters, which are the responsibility of the Academic Council, might in the first instance be handled by a joint committee of staff and students, as is the case in Trinity College, it proved legally impossible to do this.  There is no legal way in which the college can create such a joint body, a body which would carry much more weight in student discipline than a purely professional body.</P>
    <P>Our colleges are hidebound by an ancient charter in which three elements were involved&mdash;the British Liberal Party, the Irish Catholic Hierarchy and the Board of Education.  Two of these bodies are defunct and the third has moved on to some degree from where it was and does not necessarily reflect today quite the same attitude it had 60 years ago.  To have a body incapable of changing anything and vulnerable to any kind of unrest is a very dangerous situation.  I am afraid that the pace of change within the universities is simply too slow.  The mechanics of the system are too slow.  The interests built into the system resist change.  The Governing Body, constituted as our governing bodies are, with an Academic Council constituted as ours is, is unlikely to welcome and press forward for reforms that would, in fact, totally change its character and lead to the disappearance of more than half the members and a changed system of representation.</P>
    <P>The pace at which this House has been busy reforming itself over the <Col N="287" /> past 20 or 30 years confirms this.  To leave reform to a body itself is to court very slow results indeed.  In our case we have no alternative because nobody can reform us except ourselves. With other bodies there is some possibility of pressure from outside reforming them.  It is important that the Higher Education Authority should have a function in this matter and, if Deputy Thornley's amendment is not accepted, the authority may be slow to intervene in these matters, may feel it has not got any legal function and, while it is an <i>ad hoc</i> body, and probably feels free to do what it likes, once it has legal functions defined, it may become more inhibited and the colleges may very well say: &ldquo;That is all very well, but what has it got to do with you?  There is nothing in this Bill about structural reform.  Your job is to get more money for us.&rdquo;  In the absence of this amendment I fear the authority will be inhibited in this respect and I do not think that that is the intention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to set up an Authority to assist in the development of higher education generally.  I would, therefore, press the Minister very strongly, in the light of my experience, on the dangerous situation in the NUI colleges, and because of the rigidity of their structures, pending any reform, to accept this amendment so that the process of reform may be speeded up.  There is no power to enforce reform.  That would be undesirable. These are matters the colleges will ultimately have to agree amongst themselves, but it gives them a function in pushing them in the right direction, and the right to go to the colleges and ask for information as to their thinking on reform and recommend to the Government what changes in legislation may be necessary to secure reform. It is important that the HEA should play this role.  The <i>ad hoc</i> body has done this.  It has retained representation from the Irish Federation of University Teachers on the structure of reform.  I was associated with Deputy Thornley in some submissions in that respect. When it is a statutory body I am worried that it will feel precluded from pursuing this matter further and the <Col N="288" /> possibility of the Authority helping the process along by being a channel of communication and a pressure between the universities and the Minister, with a view to getting reforms, I am afraid that this channel might dry up and I would, therefore, strongly support Deputy Thornley's amendment.</P>

I would suggest using the words, &ldquo;to restructure the fabric of our universities to bring them into line with a more realistic system of education&rdquo; instead of using the word &ldquo;democratise&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Democratise&rdquo; may not necessarily mean the best educational service.  If the words, &ldquo;to promote the perfection of the structure of higher education&rdquo; were used it would be better because there would be no political tag attached to the word &ldquo;perfection&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Thornley mentioned earlier, I expressed an opinion on this matter when replying to the Second Stage of the Bill.  I pointed out I was not anxious to be involved in what appeared to be specifics.  I feel this discussion is very useful in that it will give guidelines to An tÚdarás when framing its recommendations as to the future structure of higher education in general and university education in particular.</P>
      <P>As I looked at this I felt what was really involved here was a restructuring of higher education and that this would be a process which would be effected through the medium of later legislation, which I shall introduce in due course, having considered the recommendations from An tÚdarás in this regard.

      <P>I am as anxious as anybody else to expedite matters and I am not therefore going to make a lengthy peroration about equality of opportunity in education.  This amendment gives me an opportunity to demonstrate the sincerity of what I have been trying to say to Deputy Moore in particular.  In the remarks Deputy Moore made on the last amendment he touched upon a very valid point, of which, had he been in the House at an earlier stage&mdash;that is no reflection on him, I am sure he was doing something else&mdash;he would have known that Deputy FitzGerald and I were both well aware, that when it comes to university education there is a tendency for academics to talk about it as if it were their own private preserve and nobody else was to do anything about it at all.  I can assure Deputy Moore that in this debate I have been leaning backwards to remember that I do not speak here as a Fellow of Trinity College, I speak here as a Deputy from an area in Dublin which Deputy Tunney also represents.</P>
      <P>I want to reiterate in essence a point I made during the Second Reading of this Bill that the debate seemed to be esoteric and remote from people.  On that occasion the Chamber was virtually empty, and even tonight there are only six Deputies present, five of whom are professional educationalists in different ways.  It is a terrible reflection that this is the kind of debate which empties the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk not merely about university education but about tertiary education of all forms, we are talking about a level of education which in broad terms is denied to the vast majority of our people.  I am not making a political point here.  It is rarely that one can discuss things without any element of political dissension. I am simply discussing a statistical fact : universities are closed shops to the great majority of our people.  They have become increasingly open in recent years and I will give the Minister, the Minister's predecessor and <Col N="291" /> his predecessor's late predecessor full credit for this at all times as I always have.  The fact remains that a great deal is left to be done so that if I remain a university teacher I may feel I am giving my services to ordinary children of ordinary working-class, middle-class and upper-class families in Dublin, who pay my salary.  This is a feeling I do not have at the moment.</P>
    <P>If I may intrude a personal note, when I was made a Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin seven years ago, I had to make an acceptance speech at the Fellow's dinner, and I said that my ultimate ambition in education was that the children who passed by Trinity College in the No. 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 buses would some day come to feel that that college was their own and they would turn in at the gate and not merely pass by.  That was years before I entered politics and I feel as strongly about that now as I did then.</P>
    <P>This amendment has some of the same defects as the last, in the sense that it imposes no obligatory statutory function upon those estimable 15 or 18 gentlemen but, again in the same terms, I urge that if it simply acts as a reminder to them that they have something more to do than a function in relation to an institution which caters on the whole for the better off minority of our people then it will have served its purpose.  I can see no reason why the Minister cannot accept this amendment and I am sure he will do so.</P>

      <P>I would like to support Deputy Thornley.  My own amendment is worded slightly differently in two respects.  With regard to the point about equality of opportunity my wording is that it shall have the general functions of &ldquo;increasing equality of opportunity in higher education&rdquo;.  I chose that particular formulation with care because in practice in this imperfect world the attainment of complete equality of opportunity, within our type of society, is not going to be feasible in our time.  The differences in income and the socio-economic differences in society are such that no matter what we do to help children from deprived backgrounds, the fact <Col N="292" /> that many children grow up in deprived backgrounds means that whatever financial aid is given, the proportion of children from homes which have not had the benefit of a high standard of education will be small. Those children are always going to be worse off than children coming from middle-class homes where there are books to read, where the atmosphere is more conducive to academic study, where there is a room to work in and not just one room with a television in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The differences between the social groups in their educational participation at the third level are enormous. As the Minister is aware, several studies of this have been carried out. The first in time to be done was in 1960 when Professor Lynch and I analysed four separate 100 samples of the matriculation entrance forms for the National University of Ireland, which gave us a sample of those who qualified for university education, never mind received it.  When we related the results of this study to the actual numbers in the different social groups at that time what emerged was that something between one-third and one-half of the children of professional people and business executives were qualifying for university education. That figure went very far down indeed and of the children of unskilled labourers between one-half and three-quarters per cent qualified for university. I doubt if many of that half or three-quarters per cent ever saw the inside of a university but they matriculated either by doing the matriculation examination or by getting their leaving certificate.  The proportion who actually got inside the university might only have been one-quarter per cent. Even at the level of qualifying the ratio between the different classes was somewhere between 60 and 80 to one. A child born into the home of a business or professional person had a chance of a university education 60 to 80 times as great as a child born into the home of an unskilled manual worker, not because there are differences in the level of intelligence, because levels of intelligence between the different classes are to all intents and purposes non-existent but simply because <Col N="293" /> of lack of opportunity.  This is a problem we have to tackle.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Thornley, I pay tribute to the work of the Government in this sphere in recent times.  All Governments neglected this matter for many decades and it is only in the last few years that something concrete has been done.  However, even if we doubled the grants and had free university education for all those who qualified, and if we gave adequate grants to all who live in rural areas, because of the class difference in society, in 30 years time we would still have proportions of 20 or 30 to one, and certainly of ten to one, between the proportions of the different socio-economic groups securing university education.</P>
    <P>The obstacles are much more than purely financial but that is no reason for not doing all we can to remove the financial obstacles.  However, we cannot expect merely by financial provision to resolve the problem in our time.  For that reason I worded my amendment slightly differently.  Rather than promoting the attainment of equality of opportunity in education&mdash; whose full attainment we cannot hope to secure in our time&mdash;I put increasing equality of opportunity in higher education as perhaps a more realistic goal. I added another provision because I think it is important: I added also &ldquo;maintaining standards in education&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is because there are pressures the other way.  Even the pressure towards equality of opportunity carries with it a risk.  If it is promoted in a particular way without regard to standards there is a risk that standards will be affected.  We must achieve both aims simultaneously.  Naturally, and properly, the main emphasis is on increasing equality of opportunity in higher education, as well as in all kinds of education, and we are all wholeheartedly behind this aim.  At the same time, it is right that we should try to ensure that in pursuing this goal as rapidly as possible we should do nothing that would lower standards in higher education; on the contrary we should try to raise them.  It was for that reason I worded my amendment in this fashion.</P>
    <P>In this I am reflecting accurately the <Col N="294" /> frame of mind of the Commission on Higher Education whose report has not received the attention it deserves &mdash;this may have been because of the events that followed its publication, such as the announcement of the still-abortive merger.  The report has many defects and I have criticised it fully in the past but it has the merit of emphasising the point about standards. Indeed, the chairman of the commission, a distinguished Chief Justice, stamped his own mark on the report because this was a matter about which he felt very strongly.  He came to talk to the staff of one of the universities here and he placed great emphasis on this point.  I think it is important that this authority should have the dual function of increasing equality of opportunity in higher education and also of maintaining standards. These should be the prime aims of the authority and its job should be to maintain a balance between them.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might reciprocate Deputy Thornley's remarks about Deputy O'Higgins.  I do not know if Deputy Thornley would agree with my formulation, with the addition to the other provision about maintaining standards in higher education?  The Deputy has nodded his agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reiterate what has been said by Deputy Thornley and Deputy FitzGerald.  We all share the hope that university education will be available to all, although it must be admitted that this is not likely in the immediate future. This amendment is important so far as it would possibly require the authority to insist that universities and other institutes of higher education would make available the one opportunity at the moment for people to avail of this equality, namely, in night classes.</P>
      <P>The economic and social difficulties about which Deputy Thornley and Deputy FitzGerald spoke can be remedied to some extent by the extension of night classes in our universities. For that reason, and because we all wish for equality of opportunity for all children, I should like to give my approval to this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to support this amendment.  The whole purpose of any legislation regarding education should be to promote equality of opportunity in all spheres of education. Perhaps Deputy FitzGerald is right when he said that even in 20 years time many of our people will be denied the opportunity of higher education. However, we can look forward to improvements in our living standards so that the young people who desire higher education and who have the ability will not be debarred because of lack of family means or because of family background.  Deputy FitzGerald referred to the latter point as something that might inhibit young people from fully partaking of education.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Tunney in his remarks about night classes.  This is very important for those people who cannot attend university courses during the day.  At this time we might consider Newman's thoughts on the subject of universities.  Although some of the <i>avant garde</i> educationalists would knock him today, his teachings and his writings might be worth considering when trying to promote equality of opportunity in higher education. I congratulate Deputy Thornley on this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputies will accept that I have always been anxious in regard to this question of equality of educational opportunity for all our children.  In fact, this matter was discussed today at Question Time. It is true to say that the Government have an exceptionally good record in this respect in so far as they have provided free post-primary education, free transport and grants for university education subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>However, I consider that it is not from An tÚdarás or from any of the institutions of higher education that the impetus towards providing educational opportunities will come.  I believe that all such measures in the future will depend largely on State initiative. Therefore, I believe that in so far as anything is required in the Bill in relation to this, it is to be found in section 3 (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the other matter <Col N="296" /> raised by Deputy FitzGerald, namely, the maintenance of standards in higher education, I think it is generally accepted that this is primarily an academic matter.  I do not think it would fit in with the general functions of An tÚdarás or, indeed, with its specific functions as set out in later sections. For these reasons I cannot accept these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I try to persuade the Minister here?  Let me take the last point first.  An tÚdarás has a vital role to play.  The Minister will appreciate that one of the problems the universities have at the moment is that of staff-student ratio.  Our building problems are gradually being met.  They remain severe but a great deal is being done in this sphere.  There are very serious problems because of the inadequacies of staff, and it is very difficult to maintain standards when the staff is inadequate.</P>
      <P>It is very important that this Authority, when allocating funds and when dealing with financial proposals from the colleges, should have regard to this and see that, on the one hand, the universities are organised and financed in such a way as to ensure, as far as possible, equality of opportunity in higher education and, on the other hand, that they are staffed and run in such a way as to ensure the maintenance of standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I readily concede that the Government have made achievements in regard to financing higher education and that there have been remarkable improvements. However, the area where progress has been least striking, in fact non-existent, has been that of the ratio between staff and students.  In our college the proportion of staff to students, for example, in the Arts Faculty, is between one-half and one-third what it is in Britain and Northern Ireland.  It is very difficult indeed to maintain standards where there is not just a marginal disparity but one of the order of two or three to one. In the Arts Faculty in UCD the ratio is 26 to one.  In British universities it is nine or perhaps ten to one; I think it has disimproved slightly in recent <Col N="297" /> years.  There has been no improvement in our case.  On the contrary, in the 1960's it deteriorated from just under 25 to over 26 to one.  It is getting worse, not better.</P>
    <P>This is the area of greatest pressure and where the Authority can do most by, perhaps, showing sympathy to claims from universities in this sphere and by presenting them more effectively to the Department than apparently the universities themselves have been able to do, because their failure to persuade the Department on this issue has been notable in recent years.</P>
    <P>It is entirely within the functions of the Authority to seek to maintain standards in higher education by working with the universities to ensure an adequate staff-student ratio; similarly with the question of increasing equality of opportunity in higher education.  Of course, it is fundamentally a matter of Government policy. If the Government do not provide adequate grants for students, equality of opportunity will suffer.  The question of how the moneys provided are to be distributed and spent to ensure equality of opportunity, whether they should be spent in one faculty or another where the demand is greatest.  These are matters for An tÚdarás.  While, as the Minister pointed out when we were discussing an earlier amendment, there is no question of An tÚdarás having the exclusive function of seeking to provide equality of opportunity, the main burden for which lies on the Government, it has a function to perform in this field and a very important one indeed with regard to the maintenance of standards.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to reconsider his view.  I do not think he was being absolutely dogmatic in what he said.  Including these items does not involve automatically increased expenditure. It does not make binding the taking of any particular action but it does alert An tÚdarás to the kind of objective towards which it should be working, and it is right and proper we should state these aims.  If the Minister agrees to include these items with the items he has included already, we would have a remarkably enlightened frame of reference for this new authority which could be a model for other countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to what the Minister said and to what Deputy Tunney, Deputy Moore and Deputy FitzGerald said.  Despite my nodding earlier to Deputy FitzGerald about the relative lack of difference between our amendments, I think there is a difference in emphasis between Deputy FitzGerald and myself here.  Therefore, I would appeal to Deputy FitzGerald to yield to my amendment, and I would appeal to the Minister to accept it.</P>
      <P>The reason why I do this&mdash;I do not want to appear to be personally critical of Deputy FitzGerald&mdash;is as follows. Maintaining standards in higher education is, of course, something we all want to do, but this is a loaded and a slightly emotive phrase.  First of all, it can be argued that the maintenance of standards in higher education is clearly subsumed in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of the section.  I do not understand how the development of higher education can be furthered without these standards being maintained. Nor do I understand how an appreciation of the value of higher education and research can be furthered without its standards being maintained.</P>
      <P>At the same time, these things could be done without equality of opportunity. Let me say, with due respect, that Deputy FitzGerald is falling into the trap he sometimes falls into, that is, of thinking specifically as an academic rather than as a servant of the community.  There is nothing wrong with thinking as an academic, but the maintenance of standards in higher education has been used to justify a chain of reasoning put forward by many academics, for example, cutting down the intake of universities, cutting out night classes in universities.  It has gone with a chain of reasoning in which, in the famous words of Kingsley Amis in England: &ldquo;More means worse.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sometimes think that university academics are excessively excited about standards.  Very often what standards mean is a low staff-student ratio.  It is, of course, what we all ideally want but in turn it means a low work load.  To take the specific point of night classes, I lectured for <Col N="299" /> some years in Trinity College in the Diploma in Public Administration classes and in the B.Comm. classes. The classes were huge; there were between 120 and 150 in the room at any time.  No one would suggest that the interchange of ideas between me as teacher and the classes as taught was ideal, but at least it happened.  They were not shut out of the sacred precincts of Trinity College altogether. Deputy FitzGerald is trying to ride two horses at once.  If I may mix my metaphors, he has one eye over one shoulder towards his constituents and another eye over his other shoulder towards his colleagues.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of standards in higher education is fully covered by the three preceding provisions (a), (b) and (c) of section 3.  I do not think equality of opportunity in higher education is so covered.  I agree totally with the Minister that ultimately it is the function of the State and of himself and his successors as Minister to perform this job of trying to achieve equality of opportunity.  All I ask is to let us have this simple goal inscribed in letters of gold on the walls of Fitz-william Square or wherever this Authority meets so that it will be constantly reminded of its greater duty. I would press the Minister to accept the simpler amendment, that is to say, mine.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Thornley, I do not think, if he reflected on our joint experiences over the last four years, he would suggest I always have too much of an eye to my colleagues in the things I say.  We have shared certain unpopularity in our respective institutions.</P>

      <P>We can all fall into the trap, in speaking in this House, of thinking not simply of the community as a whole but of particular interests with which we are associated and I will admit that I am more inclined to fall into it than Deputy Thornley is.  Having said that I think <Col N="300" /> there is a problem here that he is not facing.  We have to observe that in the 1950's and 1960's the absence of any body taking responsibility for university policy has led to a deterioration in the position which need not have occurred.  University colleges&mdash;some of them certainly&mdash;took the view that they should take in everybody who came in to build up a strong case for extra staff and extra buildings.  That was not the sole motivation but it was present in the minds of the authorities, I think, that if they took in everybody who came they could then press the Government to give them more facilities.</P>
      <P>The Government, on the other hand, took the view that, as they had not asked the universities to invite all those people in, and had never expressed any views on it, the fact that the universities were overcrowded was the universities' fault and not the Government's The Government did not provide the resources up to 1965 in buildings and up to 1971 in staff.  The weakness here lay in the fact that there was not one body responsible for policy.  It fell between two stools.  Indeed, the evidence submitted to the Higher Education Commission in 1961 and 1962 along these lines contributed, I believe, to the establishment of this body.  The point was made very forcibly, in one submission with which I was associated, in any event, that you needed to have one body which would be orientated both towards the universities and towards the Minister, and which would ensure that you would not have a situation in which universities were taking in students hoping to make a case for more facilities and the Government were saying: &ldquo;We are not responsible for the extra students and therefore, we have no obligation to provide the facilities.&rdquo;  If there was one body it would have to formulate a policy and decide, given the resources available, whether it was better to let standards drop by having the staff-student ratio unacceptably high, and letting everybody in, or to maintain the staff-student ratio and maintain standards by keeping some people out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance between these two is a matter of judgment.  No extreme answer <Col N="301" /> can be right: to let everybody in regardless of whether there is a place for them to sit, or a teacher to teach them, regardless of the size of the tutorials, never mind lectures, could in the long run be damaging particularly as many of those coming in created a congestion problem and not only did those who came in fail to get benefit, but they also reduced the benefit to those already there.  On the other hand to exclude anybody who is capable of benefiting from a university, because we just do not provide the facilities, would be wrong.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this body is to balance these two.  It was with that in view that recommendations were made to the commission ten years ago to establish such a body.  That having been done, it seems to me that these two aims should be incorporated.  I do not speak as one who seeks to maintain a high staff-student ratio but I am concerned because it has been allowed to deteriorate to far too low a level.  I believe that in this country because of the fact that we have larger classes, because we have far more general students&mdash;at least some of our universities have&mdash;than they have in Britain, we can offer the same standards to students with a staff-student ratio worse than it is in Britain.  I think the figure of 12 to one in this country could give us, in practice, standards similar to those in Britain in terms of the size of tutorials or the number of tutorials which is, perhaps, the crucial factor.  I am not saying that we must have the British ratio but I am saying that we have gone too far in one direction and we must balance these two requirements. I submit to Deputy Thornley, through the Chair, that my amendment would require the authority to take account of these two factors, to balance them and to make a policy decision with respect to the resources at its disposal and not to go overboard in one direction or the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept that the staff-student ratio and the maintenance of standards are linked but in my view the latter, <i>per se,</i> is not the direct concern of An tÚdarás.  Surely the assignment of the maintenance of <Col N="302" /> standards specifically to An tÚdarás raises questions in relation to university autonomy.  The Bill deals adequately with financial matters.  My view is that both of these amendments could be included in the &ldquo;furthering of the development of higher education&rdquo;. However, after some consideration I think I can accept amendment No. 9 &ldquo;promoting the attainment of equality of opportunity in higher education&rdquo;.  I do not feel that I can accept amendment No. 10.</P>

      <P>I have not got the Minister's speech in front of me, unfortunately. He spoke at some length on this and I was not entirely happy with some of the emphasis he placed on it.  Not having his speech in front of me I am at a disadvantage in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister should appreciate that there are considerable problems in this sphere of using the Irish language in the universities and that the failure to make more progress is by no means always due, if indeed it is ever due, to any hostility to it but to the very severe practical problems involved.  The Minister must know from representations that come to him from time to time from University College, Galway, of the very great difficulties experienced there which are not assisted by the fact that the financial provision for that college does not provide for the additional staff required to duplicate lectures in two languages, for example.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the difficulty that that college and University College, Cork, which has a requirement with regard to the appointment of staff in relation to the Irish language, have experienced in getting qualified staff to meet these requirements and the fact that frequently they have failed to fill posts because of this, must indicate that there is a real problem here.  I do not want to dwell on this for an unduly long time but I want to say I accepted section 4 without any particular demur until I read the Minister's speech, and then I was a little worried by its tone and by the fact that he did not seem to take account of the difficulties, some of them contributed to by the lack of provision to meet the particular problem of University College, Galway, and did not show an adequate appreciation of the extreme difficulty of finding staff who are able to do the job required. I want to take this opportunity of pressing the Minister to show financial generosity where there is a problem as there is in University College, Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in University College, Galway, recently and I was in Galway even more recently, and I was talking to people who are associated with the university.  I was struck by their feeling <Col N="304" /> of frustration on this subject, by the problems which they adduced and which they faced some of them, perhaps, insoluble because in many cases it is simply impossible to get anybody qualified in a subject who is capable of teaching it through Irish and, in other cases, soluble but because of the lack of financial provision not solved.  I would hope, therefore, that the Minister would look with sympathy on any financial requests from University College, Galway, which are connected with the duty imposed upon it of trying to teach in two languages and that he would also accept realistically that very often it is not possible to get anyone who is adequately and suitably qualified.  Certainly very often the best qualified person is not capable of teaching through Irish.  In this matter we must have regard to these considerations while still trying to pursue the legitimate aim incorporated in section 4.</P>

      <P>I would not like it to be assumed that, because Deputy FitzGerald talked about the difficulties which he envisaged, he accepts that in, say, UCD the attitude to date towards the subject of Irish itself has been what it should have been.  That would be my concern.  I would not be as concerned about the teaching of the subjects as much as I would be concerned about the attitude of the college to Irish and the national culture.  For my own part, I should like to see the word &ldquo;endeavour&rdquo; removed from the section altogether and the section reading &ldquo;....developing the national culture and shall promote the attainment of those aims&rdquo;.  With regard to UCD I would not like to be taken as being critical of an institution which, to quite an extent, has been very useful and good to me.  However, the attitude towards the teaching of Irish and the attitude towards anything that was Irish was not what I would have expected from an Irish university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to assure Deputy FitzGerald that I am not ignoring the fact that there are problems.  I have spoken at some length in relation to this matter and I do not propose to cover the same ground tonight.  However, <Col N="305" /> I would like to say a few words on a couple of other aspects which occurred to me in relation to this whole question.</P>
      <P>Before I was appointed Minister for Education I never questioned why particular subjects were taught in post-primary schools and, very often, in primary schools but since my appointment, it was necessary for me to go into this whole matter in some depth. I found that very often the subjects taught were, in a sense, dictated by requirements of the universities.  Although, in years past, the percentage of our people who attended university was very small&mdash;that percentage has improved very considerably in recent times&mdash;the curricula, particularly in smaller schools, was tailored to meet the requirements of the university.</P>
      <P>Some time ago we had discussions with the university authorities in relation to certain other subjects which we asked them to accept as university subjects.  One of these subjects was Art and I have noticed that the very fact of art becoming a university subject tended to make the subject blossom all the way down through the post-primary and primary systems.  Greater involve ment by our universities in our language revival could have the same happy result.</P>
      <P>When we talk about parents being uneasy in relation to having their children educated through the medium of Irish, I believe the cause of this unease to be the fact that parents know that generally speaking their children will not be able to continue their education through the medium of Irish in our universities.  I am not speaking here of courses only or on the teaching of the Irish language in the universities because I have already spoken on this subject at some length but, rather, in the sense that there should be a greater feeling in our universities as it were, for our national heritage, for our cultural heritage of which the language is the central point.</P>

    <P>Our cultural heritage should permeate our universities and our universities should be a mirror of this cultural heritage.  It appears to me&mdash; I have become more and more convinced of this in recent times&mdash;that <Col N="306" /> unless we find at the top in our university system, a greater recognition of the fact that we have a cultural identity, a particular national identity, and that unless our universities appreciate this and act accordingly, the task of reviving the Irish language is almost an impossible one.</P>
    <P>I recognise fully the very great difficulties that are involved here but if we are to be successful in preserving our national identity, and I think this is the wish of everyone, the effort must be made from the top.  Therefore, I am very pleased that IFUT will meet me to discuss this particular aspect of the revival of the language.  It appears to me that, apart from the Cumainn Ghaelacha in the universities, we have not a real identification with our past and, unfortunately, because these Cumainn Ghaelacha find themselves relatively isolated, they tend to find it necessary to move along certain ideological lines which sometimes mean that they cut themselves off from the broad stream of our people.  That is not their fault.  I am greatly concerned about the preservation of our cultural heritage and I believe it is essential for us to do everything possible to ensure that this culture which is ours and which identifies us as a people should be preserved.  During my time as Minister for Education I have become more and more convinced that the only real hope we have in this direction lies within our universities.</P>

      <P>I have no objection at all to this section.  I am impressed by the sincerity of what the Minister has said but, perhaps, I might draw one point to his attention.  His own remarks bring up a dilemma which faces any Minister for Education&mdash;a dilemma which I would like him to be conscious of&mdash;that is that a Minister for Education is subject to many pressures but that he is subject in particular to pressure, at the level of higher education, of the traditional academic disciplines on the one side and to the purely manpower approach to education on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest respectfully to the Minister that this more or less sustains the point I was making during the Second Reading debate when I remarked that fashions in teaching <Col N="307" /> change very often and that sometimes even academic conservatism has a virtue.  I suggest that it is not in the immediate productive spheres of education such as History, Classics, English, Irish and Celtic Studies that one very often finds the best guarantee of precisely the aspirations about which the Minister has been speaking.  Therefore, I hope the Minister will bear that point in mind when the exponents of computer technology and business studies bear on him and on his authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to pay tribute to the Minister's sincerity in this subject.  Not all Ministers at all times have been genuinely concerned about this.  It is because I know his concern is real that I put these points to him.  He must distinguish two different things.  One is the specific question of teaching through Irish in the universities.  This is a difficult problem and one which I do not think we have recognised sufficiently. Neither have we tackled this problem adequately.  The second question is a more general one and that is the feeling that, in some ways, the atmosphere in our universities is denationalised, that the sense of our cultural heritage is not strong enough within the universities. This criticism is one that has been heard often throughout the history of our State.  To some degree it is unfair because in any event, the universities tend, in a matter of this kind. to mirror society to a degree.  If, in fact, there is only one Irish language society and if the number of members is not very great that is not the fault of the universities; it is the fault of society which has opted out of a commitment to the Irish language while paying lip-service to it.  To that extent the university as a mirror of society is not to be blamed if it does not reflect a very handsome picture because it reflects only what is to be seen in the mirror. That does not mean that our universities have not in some respects failed and that more could not have been done but I think there is a danger of dialogue breaking down on this subject and people talking at each other without talking to each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> I am very pleased the Minister is meeting the Irish Federation of University Teachers to discuss this because it is only through direct confrontation that people are forced to discuss this at a real level and, discussing it with the Minister, they will become fully aware of the problem.</P>
    <P>This teaching through Irish is a very proper aspiration.  If people are going to bring their children up as Irish speaking citizens they must have universities in which those children can do a degree through Irish.  To expect people to bring up their children as Irish speaking citizens and then discover the children are not able to avail of a university education because they have opted for a language they cannot easily use is expecting too much.  Having said that, let us face the problems.  We at the moment have one college which has been given the job of doing this.  Two of our colleges have an Irish language requirement at entrance.  I think this is a mistake.  For a college which does not endeavour to any significant degree to teach through Irish and has not been given that responsibility, or taken it, to inhibit itself in recruiting staff by requiring a facility in teaching through Irish, when people are actually not asked to do that, is making life very difficult.  Cork has at times found itself unable to get qualified people to pass the test and have been left with unqualified people and they have to get around that in various ways.  This is a mistake.  On the other hand, University College, Galway, has not been given enough assistance in this matter of recruiting staff but, even if they were, the problem remains.</P>
    <P>When you are recruiting staff for universities it should be at a standard of excellence and very often it is very difficult to get any staff.  We are a small country and we do not ourselves produce enough people and at times there is simply no one adequately qualified.  When we try to recruit abroad we find we cannot get people. We have had great difficulty in filling chairs of modern languages in recent years.  Not only have we advertised outside the country, as well as within it, but our authorities have gone out <Col N="309" /> to look for people and have persuaded qualified people to apply for the job. As a result of these efforts we have been successful in filling several key posts in modern languages with remarkably well qualified people.  But it was not easy.  We had to go out and look for people and press them to apply for the job and persuade them to take it.  The applications received in the first instance were not sufficient for our purposes.</P>
    <P>Other colleges have had even greater difficulties.  Teaching through English, never mind through Irish, there are occasions when there is no applicant good enough for the job, no applicant who meets the standards required.  If on top of that, you limit yourself and say the applicant must be able to teach through Irish you rule out all from outside the country and a very large number, unfortunately, within the country.  Any college which has that imposed on it is handicapped and if you impose that handicap on two colleges you are certainly not helping things.  If, in the college where you require them to teach through Irish, you do not provide adequate incentives to teach in two languages and you simply expect people to do twice as much teaching, you are not offering these people any incentive and you are not providing a very good opportunity for university education for those children brought up to speak Irish.  Someone who wants a child to do a science degree in nuclear physics, for instance, will never find anyone to teach physics through Irish.  Even in the arts areas, where there are more students, larger staffs, a greater choice of personnel to teach through Irish, the problem is considerable.  We have a problem which is of its nature difficult and I would press on the Minister that he should have a sympathetic regard to this so far as finance can help&mdash;it can only help a little; a great many of the problems are insoluble&mdash;and that he should be particularly generous where additional financial aid would make it easier for a college to get people who can teach through Irish.  But that is a separate question from the general question to which Deputy Tunney adverted&mdash;the feeling that our universities do not play a sufficient role in <Col N="310" /> our national affairs.  With regard to that problem I would say that one ought not to expect too much here. A university is what its name implies &mdash;universal.  It may not be narrowly national and, without excusing the deficiencies which exist in this respect&mdash; I sympathise with Deputy Tunney&mdash; this must not be pressed so far as to diminish the universal character of the university, whose staff should include many from outside the country, and students likewise, if it is to be a university in the true sense.  It must concern itself with universal knowledge as well as special knowledge of our own history and traditions.  This is a difficult area in which a balance has to be maintained.  I merely wish to develop some of its aspects because I had a feeling the Minister was looking at it from a particular angle and these other aspects deserve mention also.  I would ask the Minister to look with sympathy at the problems in University College, Galway, trying to do its job.  Children who want to do third level education through Irish must have that opportunity, but that college must be assisted more generously than the other colleges.</P>

      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for his dedication to and sincerity in this language issue.  If our institutes of higher education have not promoted the language to our full satisfaction that is not the fault of any Government here and certainly no fault of the present Minister.  Deputy Tunney referred to his experience of University College, Dublin.  I knew a man who did a non-degree course and, in his simplicity, he asked for his diploma in the Irish language.  This was refused.  He had to take a certificate in the English language.</P>

      <P>Our universities and our institutes of higher education generally have not subscribed to Pearse's dream. We do not live the language.  Deputy FitzGerald referred to nuclear physics. Anyone trying to study nuclear physics here certainly does not face any enhanced prospects in the next few <Col N="311" /> years.  But, far from nuclear physics, there is our ordinary way of life.  The language should be ingrained in our very thinking.  The Minister said earlier that we must have a separate national identity.  As we are facing entry into the EEC it is all the more important that we preserve our national identity and one sure way of doing this is through our language.  Section 4 brings home to us the necessity for the Higher Education Authority to do everything in its power to restore the Irish language, preserve and develop national culture and endeavour to promote the attainment of those aims.</P>
      <P>The Irish language is saved but if the Authority succeeds in promoting it so that every university graduate in future will be fluent in his own language as well as in another language, the Bill will have been worthwhile.  We have to live the language if we want to have a Gaelic State, able to stand on an equal footing with the Danes, the French and the Germans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with various aspects of education and the Irish language which is something people feel very strongly about. I am greatly appreciative of the terms in which the Minister, Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Tunney have spoken.  They have spoken moderately on a subject which has sometimes given rise to heated arguments.  The fact that this subject can be discussed calmly is a symptom of the state of our country today.</P>
      <P>Our national culture should be encouraged in all forms of education by both financial and other means.  Love of our language and love of our national culture are very considerable. Deputy FitzGerald has pointed out that the very word &ldquo;university&rdquo; leads to universality and means the learning of as many things as possible which form part of our national heritage.  This should be the consideration of any body dealing with higher education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must face the fact that not every teacher is capable of teaching every subject through the medium of Irish and likewise not every student is capable of understanding and benefiting <Col N="312" /> from teaching in that way.  For instance, many medical terms are still in Latin.  We must decide whether we want our doctors to be handicapped through an imperfect understanding of the subject because it is being taught through the medium of Irish.  Deputy FitzGerald mentioned a difficulty which arises when a university tries to find a teacher in a particular subject who is required to teach that subject through the medium of Irish.  Does this mean a teacher, who is not as expert as a teacher would undoubtedly be, is appointed teaching through the medium of English?</P>
    <P>Everyone wants to see Irish culture encouraged but at the same time we do not want our universities to be handicapped.  I have a great love of history, although I do not have a deep knowledge of it, but I have often said that people are always taking the Bastille when there is nothing in it.  As Deputies will remember when the Bastille was taken everybody had left, bar a few criminals who probably richly deserved to be there.  People are often defending the Bastilles when the attack has ceased.  There are not the enemies of the Irish language now that there were in the past.  Some of them fought a difficult battle in the past but now that battle has been won in the sense that there is no individual nor any body in this country who does not encourage the use of the Irish language and Irish culture.  However, as a legislative body, we wish to see this further encouraged. We want to see our young people fully equipped for the future and a knowledge of the Irish language and our culture is one of the great weapons in the armoury of these young people. This is important whether they are studying physics, medicine, or any of the modern languages.</P>
    <P>Every facet of human knowledge is so extensive nowadays that it is seldom that a person can excel in more than one subject.  It might well be that we will handicap our young people in their future professions, and Irish culture and scholarship might be weakened, by an undue emphasis on that side of the policy.  I urge the Minister, as other speakers have done, not to tie the hands of the universities in this manner because they are as anxious as the <Col N="313" /> Department of Education, the Government, and indeed all parties in this House, in seeing that a justified and due emphasis is placed on higher education.  Let the Minister rest assured that the universities are worthy custodians of our Irish culture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the contribution made by Deputy Dockrell. However, the problem here is that both Deputy Dockrell and Deputy FitzGerald are creating problems which in my view are rather remote. We are supposing straight away that there will be a need tomorrow for the provision of teachers, lecturers and professors capable of giving instruction in the various faculties in the universities. As I see it, that is not the problem&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so in Galway.  Perhaps it is because of the concern about the language as it affected a small section of purists that the damage which we all regret has been done.  Rather than having the teaching of any subject in Irish in the universities, what I should prefer to see in the immediate future is encouragement by the university authorities to students to speak the Irish language throughout the day when they are going about their various activities.  This may be realised more easily in the immediate future rather than the objectives of Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Dockrell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point about universality, while I accept that <i>in toto,</i> on the other hand I do not accept that universality presupposes the exclusion of that which is essentially Irish.  That also has its place.  In the study of the Irish language and culture we should have here the philosophical basis on which we would approach the study of many other languages.  I would exclude for the immediate future the practical problems of providing teachers for the teaching of every subject in universities through the medium of Irish.  I would be more concerned about the approach of the universities and their attitude towards Irish culture and the Irish language.  I should like to see them giving encouragement <Col N="314" /> to students to speak the language while going about their work in the colleges and in their recreation time.  In this way I see the Irish language being restored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be few people in this House who would object to this section.  When talking about the use of Irish in universities, the argument is used frequently that it is impossible to teach technological subjects through the medium of Irish. My comment on that is that the terms used in technological subjects are, I think, based on the Latin and to this extent the Irish language is on an equal footing with English.</P>
      <P>I regret to say that it appears to be part of our heritage to pass pious resolutions and thereafter do nothing about them.  When I first spoke on education in this House, and possibly also when I last spoke on the subject, I referred to the situation whereby if one wished to study subjects at university through the medium of Irish one was told that there were no lecturers or professors or books available, that there was no terminology to deal with scientific subjects.  I proposed some time ago that the leaving certificate should be designed to cater for this. At that time there was a debate on the position of Irish in the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question came up in a year when there was a lot of trouble about the leaving certificate.  The present Leas-Cheann Comhairle had a particular interest in this problem at that time.  I expressed the view that through career guidance when a student reaches the leaving certificate stage he should be able to decide what course he will follow at the university.  Some students might wish to study Irish as an academic subject in the faculty of arts. I felt at that time that for the leaving certificate a pretty high standard of Irish was prescribed.  Students wishing to study law, medicine or the various sciences at university should, I felt, do an examination at leaving certificate level so designed as to involve the study of scientific terms necessary for university students.  This is the only way this particular section can be implemented as completely as <Col N="315" /> the Minister and the Department would wish.  It is the only way to break down the difficulty which arises at university when the students have not got the Irish terms needed in a particular faculty and must be diverted to English lectures.  One could say that difficulties would be created for the Department of Education in prescribing such a leaving certificate examination.  It may become easier in the future with a three-year course.  May I express the view that the Irish itself should be of a standard which would be acceptable to students who would be able to reach a high academic standard in literature as so many of us had to do in the past?</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney said that the speaking of the language is vital.  Many of us have got honours in the leaving certificate and have left secondary school hardly able to speak the language. Efforts are being made to remedy this situation.  I hope they will be successful.  To offer this particular section to the universities without making an effort in the secondary schools means that it will become a pious resolution which will not be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I would like to make in reply to some of the remarks from the other side of the House.  I agree with much of what Deputy Tunney has said and he will forgive me for concentrating on the particular problem of teaching through Irish.  He is right in saying that for the generality of students and most of the colleges the issue is a broader one.  They would be doing courses through English.  The Deputy would like to see encouragement for the students to continue to speak through Irish in so far as they have acquired this facility at school.  The Deputy must accept that in concentrating on that particular problem I am doing so because it is relevant to the particular issue of the Higher Education Authority's function and the Minister's responsibility in this regard.  The issue is a broader one for most people. There is a particular problem in teaching through Irish and we have a college which is required to teach through <Col N="316" /> Irish.  There are parents who want their children taught through Irish and students who wish to be taught through Irish at university level.  It is right that we should spend time on this subject. It is right to draw attention to the fact that this is part of the problem. Deputy Dr. Gibbons said that the problem is in not having the technical terms in Irish.  That is the least of our problems.  Many technical terms can be translated fairly easily or can be left as they are.  They are the same in every language.  It is only a question of putting a different shape on the same word.</P>
      <P>The problem is fundamentally one of staff.  When one looks for the best man for the job, and even the second best or the third best, one finds that he does not want to have to teach through Irish.  Many people who are specialists have to be mentally dedicated to their speciality when they leave school and they concentrate on a particular subject, be it a scientific subject or medicine or a language, but it is a whole-time job to qualify in that and to get to the stage where one is entitled to look for an academic post.  In the condition of our society where Irish is not the common language they lose the facility in speaking Irish.</P>
      <P>There are no Irish texts for many subjects and it would be impossible to think translations.  The variety of texts is enormous.  In subjects like history and English the reading list for a year runs to pages.  There is no question of translating scientific books because the range is enormous.  By the time they had been translated they would be out of date.  The people teaching at university have often lost their knowledge of the language and they may even regard it as irrelevant. This may be regarded as anti-national. These people are not anti-anything. They are simply dedicated specialists who are English-speaking at home. These problems are not ignored.  Perhaps they could be alleviated at Galway university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Holland much university teaching is done through English.  The Dutch realise that there is no hope of translating most of the texts into Dutch. <Col N="317" /> The texts are in English and the students and staff speak English so the lectures are given in English in many subjects.  They do not regard this as denationalisation.  I would be glad to be introduced to a denationalised Dutchman, if such exists.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore spoke and fell into the old trap which has done so much damage.  He identified the national culture and the Irish language as if they were the same thing.  The language is the greatest, single, historical heritage in our country.  This attempt to identify the two together and to identify as non-national anyone who is not of that tradition is a mistake which has been made for a long time by many people. we have grown out of that largely in recent years.  This view has not emerged recently from the opposite benches. The Deputy used the phrase &ldquo;Gaelic State&rdquo; as what we are looking forward to.  The aim of the Government was set out in the White Paper on the Irish language.  The aim as stated there was one of bilingualism.  It is important that we should accept that this is a country of many different traditions.  With all that has gone on <i>vis-à-vis</i> Northern Ireland, we should accept that lesson.  On the 14th May last I listened to a fine speech by the Minister for External Affairs in which he expounded the pluralistic tradition. There were different variations put forward by other Ministers.  I thought the Minister's speech did propound this in a manner which people of all traditions in Ireland could accept. When we talk about fostering national culture in the university we do not mean solely speaking Irish, but much else besides.  There are other traditions here.  We have inherited many traditions. One was referred to in another debate by Deputy Cosgrave this evening and he quoted Michael Collins in regard to the Geraldines who were aliens here and who like to think they have become more or less native at this stage.  I had occasion here a month ago to quote from an Irish statute. I stumbled over it using the English translation because my ability to pronounce Norman French which was then the legislative and official language of this country was insufficient to cope here in Parliament today.  Quite apart <Col N="318" /> from the English and Anglo-Scots tradition there are other elements such as the Norman tradition which are still relevant and come actively into our debates.  For anybody to try to tie down the national culture to the single Gaelic tradition&mdash;which deserves more respect than the rest because it is the single greatest native culture which we have&mdash;is doing a disservice to the whole question of the Irish language and of the national culture. I am sorry Deputy Moore is not present to hear what I have said.  The other contributions are ones which have added constructively to the debate.</P>

      <P>I intend to speak very briefly on this subject.  I want to say that it has been an exceptional pleasure for me to have listened to the debate tonight.  The interest shown by everybody is something which is very important. I would like to emphasise that while I am very strongly in favour of the revival of the Irish language, I do not for one moment suggest that the Irish language belongs to my party; nor does it belong to Fine Gael or the Labour Party.  It belongs to all of us. From a personal point of view I could say that it is very rarely the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and myself speak English to each other.  It is very signicant that we have had a debate of this kind here tonight on this subject.  We all recognise that there are difficulties and we should not overstress them.  If we are determined to face up to them I think we can overcome them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 3, line 14, to add &ldquo; having regard to the need to maintain a reasonable balance in the distribution of the total number of students between the institutions of higher education&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section we are dealing with here is one that requires An tÚdarás to make a continuous review of the demand and need for higher education <Col N="319" /> and in this context it particularly requires the Authority to recommend to the Minister the overall provision of student places to be made within the higher education system.  Not all universities are entirely happy with this, but I take the view that the opposition that has emerged to this is mistaken. I think it is the function of An tÚdarás to recommend on this.  This does not impinge on the autonomy of a particular university or college.  The question of what should be the total number of student places and towards what targets we should be working as a nation in this respect is a legitimate matter of public concern.  When that has been decided, and when we come to consider how they are to be allocated, of course, the question of how many student places there will be in each university must be something for discussion and for agreement by the Higher Education Authority with the university college concerned.  However, that there should be an overall target, and that An tÚdarás should have the function of deciding on it, seems to me to be correct.  I have not, therefore, sought to make any amendment to that, as some university people have proposed, but I have put down an amendment on one point which I think is a legitimate one.</P>
    <P>What is involved here is not merely the total number of places there will be.  It should be a matter for An tÚdarás to try to maintain this kind of balance. There is a danger of an unbalanced system.  There is the danger of one college&mdash;because of historically being larger, because of having the advantage of being in the capital city, because of having the advantage of not having a religious ban applied to it&mdash; having had a greater rate of expansion, having moved ahead and become a very large college, and acquired a very large site, continuing to expand at a rate that would unbalance the whole system.</P>
    <P>There is also a great need that our colleges in the cities of Cork and Galway should be particularly encouraged and assisted to expand.  If we are to have a balanced system we must have colleges in these provincial <Col N="320" /> centres which are large enough, which reach a minimum size&mdash;and there is a minimum size for a university; as far as we can assess it seems to be, under conditions in this country and with the kind of faculty ranges we have, something of the order of 4,000.  I think there is general agreement on this figure.</P>
    <P>Obviously An tÚdarás in planning ahead should be concerned not only with the total number of student places but with getting a rapid development to this level in Cork and Galway, with not permitting University College, Dublin, to overbalance the whole system, with not permitting Trinity College to opt out by keeping its student numbers down, and having a nice cosy little situation of its own and making use, for this purpose, of its small site as an argument against expansion.</P>
    <P>These are all things to be considered. It is for this reason that I put down the amendment which would require the Authority to have regard for the need to make a reasonable balance in the distribution of the total number of students between the institutions of higher education.  That includes naturally, by inference, the distribution between the existing and new institutions, because this would involve new institutions coming into being.  It is no harm that the Authority should be encouraged to bear this in mind, not to confine itself to the total number but to concern itself very much with distribution.</P>
    <P>Of course the taking of decisions must be done in consultation and agreement with the institutions concerned but, as I say, it ought to concern itself with the balance, negotiate with the colleges on this and not merely concern itself with the total number of students which is implied in but not, I think, intended in the section as drafted.</P>

      <P>It would be necessary to take section 6 (2) with section 10 (2) of the Bill and it will be seen that the idea Deputy FitzGerald has in mind is covered by this subsection of section 10.  Here it occurs more appropriately in relation to the assessment <Col N="321" /> of An tÚdarás of the amount of State financial provision, both current and capital, which it recommends for higher education and research.  The overall provision of student places is absolutely dependent on the amount of money, both capital and current, which the State is prepared to make available for higher education.  As I say, what the Deputy has in mind is adequately covered in section 10.</P>

      <P>This is one amendment of Deputy FitzGerald's which I would like to support.  I do not quite agree that section 10 covers the point which Deputy FitzGerald seeks to make, because you could have a situation where the capital provision for a particular university institution would not necessarily be in direct balance with the number of student places.  For example, taking up the point which Deputy FitzGerald was making in relation to University College, Galway, a while ago, it could be argued that the <i>per capita</i> provision for UCG should be higher than the <i>per capita</i> provision for another college.  I am not stating that as an absolute fact.  I am just saying you could argue that a particular institution should be richer <i>per capita</i> in student numbers than another one.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I think Deputy FitzGerald is correct in arguing that this amendment of his, while it would not give overall powers to the Higher Education Authority to impose student limitation upon particular institutions&mdash; obviously it would have to do this in consultation with them&mdash;nevertheless it would cause it to keep this problem constantly in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald, again putting on his local mortar board, has spoken about the attractive functions of smallness of Trinity College.  He has a point here but what we are both getting at here is that no institution should have the attractive function of either size or of smallness or exclusiveness in the context of the relative small number of students we are speaking of in Ireland, that is, about 25,000. I do not think Ireland, as an educational community, is capable of sustaining an American-style monolith university in student numbers and I <Col N="322" /> agree with Deputy FitzGerald there is a minimal size.  When we were working together in the Irish Federation of University Teachers we tended to think of something like 4,000 as a minimal size and 8,000 to 10,000 as a maximum size.</P>
    <P>It is important that this should be kept in mind and if this meant that there was a conscious policy to restrict growth in certain areas, Dublin, for example, I would personally accept that, speaking as a Dublin Deputy, as a valid argument.</P>
    <P>Since we are moving into an area where the concept of regionalisation and growth centres is being developed increasingly, we should be very chary of allowing a situation to develop in the universities where great concentrations of teaching units polarised around one, two or three specific areas.  I agree with Deputy FitzGerald's amendment. I do not agree with the Minister that it is adequately covered in section 10.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be improving the Bill if he accepted this amendment in the reasonable way he has accepted some previous amendments.</P>

      <P>Section 10 (2) provides:</P>
      <P>In making assessments under this section in respect of institutions of higher education, An tÚdarás shall have regard to the accommodation capacity for students of each institution...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words the accommodation capacity is given.  It is what the capacity is.  Given that that is the capacity, the money must be provided in relation to it.  We are concerned with something quite different.  We are concerned with the targets for growth in these institutions under the section we are on at the moment.  It is not sufficient to say that the target for growth shall be 20,000 or 25,000 university places by 1980 for the country as a whole.  Having set the target, all An tÚdarás does is look at each college each year and see how many places they have and then allocate the money.  On that basis the target might never be reached.  The target must be broken down and in breaking down the target it is important&mdash;and An tÚdarás will have to do this even though it is not mentioned <Col N="323" /> here&mdash;to have regard to the need to maintain a reasonable balance.  The target is the figure which will be relevant for planning purposes and for capital purposes.  Section 10 (1) refers to current and capital provisions and relates to the amount of money to be made available in any given period for the building projects of that year and the years immediately ahead.  Those capital provisions should be within the context of the target set under section 6 (2).  If there is not a breakdown of the overall target in section 6 (2), the authority could not, in fact, be making provisions under section 10 (2) because there is no guidance as to how it is to break down the sums each year.  This is the point we need to make.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that under section 6 (2) An tÚdarás will not only be making provision for student places in the country as a whole.  It will also be saying to the Minister: &ldquo;We think you should be building up Galway to 4,000, holding UCD at 10,000, building Trinity to 6,000.  That is the target and we recommend that that should be the plan.&rdquo;  That plan having been set under section 6 (2)&mdash;and it will be set whether the Minister accepts this amendment or not&mdash;when the actual applications are made for the year ahead, or the three years ahead, for capital and current expenditure, they will be assessed in the context of a long term plan and, of course, in providing the money at any given time, it will be provided in relation to the number of students then in the college, or who are to be in the college when the particular sum of money is spent. There is a need to build it into section 6 (2) as well.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say what is the exact meaning of &ldquo;a reasonable balance&rdquo;?  Deputy FitzGerald seems to approach this question from the point of view of the balance in the college.  I wonder would it be correct to read more into it?  Would it be said that we had too many doctors and wanted more dentists?  Could this section be used in that respect?  Another aspect is the time.  Would this <Col N="324" /> bring up the question of time made available for night students?  Is this something that would be considered? Would this cater for extra-mural studies?  I believe that some of the university courses could be just as well conducted extra-murally as intramurally, on the lines of the university of the air.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept that there is a need for this amendment.  I still feel that the number of places in any institution will be governed by the amount of money made available both capital and current through An tÚdarás.  An tÚdarás will be concerning itself not only with one year periods but also with the provision for, say, up to five years&mdash; a quinquennial provision.  While it may concern itself with the numbers at a given time in the university, nevertheless it will also have to concern itself with the provision of money for future developments.  It will have to decide what that development is to be.  It is pretty obvious that this development must be controlled by the amount of finance made available and, for that reason, I feel that there is no need for this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that the Minister should be so hesitant about accepting such a reasonable amendment to put teeth into the functions of An tÚdarás.  I would very strongly recommend this amendment to the Minister.  Greater power in its proper sense should be given to An tÚdarás.  It is all very well for the Minister to suggest that they can project for five years ahead, or for a decade ahead, but the only thing written into the Bill is the rather naked phrase that An tÚdarás shall maintain a continuous review of the demand and need for higher education.  This can mean anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A somewhat more definitive term is used by Deputy FitzGerald in his amendment &ldquo;having regard to the need to maintain a reasonable balance in the distribution of the total number of students between the institutions of higher education&rdquo;.  By and large, the executive authority of An tÚdarás <Col N="325" /> would welcome that power Whether we like it or not, there will be an element of suspicion, and an element of veiled hostility to some extent, in the reaction of several of the governing bodies towards the function of An tÚdarás.  This is quite a useful proposition to put to the Minister this evening.</P>
    <P>There is no desire on the part of anyone in this House to see An tÚdarás getting involved in an annual squabble between the various institutions about the precise allocation of current and capital expenditure.  This is likely to happen even under section 10.  Frankly, I do not think section 10 meets the suggestion made by Deputy FitzGerald and supported by Deputy Thornley. We must face up to the fact that in Ireland, by the mid-1970s or the mid-1980s, due to social and political pressures and educational developments generally, we will be entering into a period when it will be necessary to make available more and more generous <Col N="326" /> maintenance grants, travel payments, subsistence facilities, and so on.</P>
    <P>I would hope that An tÚdarás would decide very deliberately for expansion or contraction, if necessary, in particular fields which would meet the concern of Deputy Gibbons.  Certainly, we could have a situation in which many students in the Leinster area might well continue their education in a given faculty without any great expense in terms of loss.  If they were to go from Dublin to Galway or from Dublin to Cork, they would certainly find that this kind of approach would be fair and reasonable.  It is already a distinguishing feature of the British university system and I can see that developing here in the years ahead.</P>
